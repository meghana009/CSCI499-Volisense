increasing transparency and protecting social spending pakistan is facing a challenging economic environment with lackluster growth elevated inflation high indebtedness and a weak external position this reflects the legacy of uneven and procyclical economic policies in recent years aiming to boost growth but at the expense of rising vulnerabilities and lingering structural and institutional weaknesses the authorities recognize the need to address these challenges as well as to tackle the large informality in the economy the low spending in human capital and poverty in this regard the government has already initiated a difficult but necessary adjustment to stabilize the economy including thorough support from the state bank of pakistan these efforts need to be strengthened decisive

grateful to the pakistani authorities for open and constructive discussions and their hospitality finance minister abdul hafeez shaikh said he hoped it would be pakistan s last prime minister imran khan s government came to power last year determined to avoid another bailout and initially sought billions of dollars in funding from friendly countries including china saudi arabia and the united arab emirates but with inflation climbing to over 8 percent the rupee losing a third of its value over the past year and foreign exchange reserves barely enough to cover two months of exports it was forced to turn to the imf
pakistan sealed a 6 billion bailout deal with the international monetary fund imf last week to shore up its fragile public finances and underpin its slowing economy but the programme is unlikely to achieve stabilisation amid sacrificed growth according to economists the experts also fear that the three year structural adjustment programme which is expected to be formally approved by the fund s executive board in july will further add to rising inflation and utility tariffs this will be the imf s 13th structural adjustment programme for pakistan since 1988 the basic focus of this programme is stabilisation now and growth later but history tells us that at the end of these programmes pakistan s average growth rate remained the lowest in south asia since 1988 shahid hasan siddiqui a karachi based economist told anadolu agency this is because of the artificial stabilisations that eventually disturbed the growth rate siddiqui said he said another key condition of the latest imf programme was to reduce the budget deficit by meeting tax collection targets which seemed to be difficult to achieve for various political reasons to bridge this gap he observed the cash strapped government would go for indirect taxes and raising utility tariffs which would directly impact the general public under the agreement the government will no longer control the value of the dollar against the rupee instead it will be dealt with by the open market also the government will start withdrawing exemptions offered on various taxes amounting to around rs350 billion in the 2019 20 budget rupee devaluation will certainly increase the country s exports and reduce the rising imports but a hike in power and gas tariffs will increase the cost of production and ultimately neutralise the devaluation benefit the currency devaluation will also increase the cost of raw materials which pakistan imports for its export output siddiqui added analysts view the rising imports as a major threat to the country s 300 billion economy pakistan s annual imports currently total around 60 billion compared to a mere 24 billion worth of exports temporary relief kaiser bengali a former government economic adviser views the imf package as a temporary relief to the country s tottering economy the imf package means nothing more than some time to fill the balance of payments gap it s just breathing space bengali told anadolu agency he observed that despite the latest imf loan which is insufficient to meet the country s actual requirements pakistan had to go to the commercial market to borrow short term and expensive loans which he said would further deepen the dollar deficit this will further push pakistan to look to the imf he said bengali linked the proposed imf package to talks between islamabad and the financial action task force fatf a global terror financing watchdog the fatf has already placed pakistan on its grey list for not taking enough measures to curb terror financing and money laundering now the fatf meeting is continuing in china with turkey the united states united kingdom china india and others participating i believe the imf has brought pakistan to this stage deliberately now both the imf and fatf will force pakistan to carry out multiple drastic structural economic reforms mainly related to terrorism financing he contended farrukh saleem an islamabad based economist shared a similar view this package is yet to be approved it will only be approved if pakistan meets some key imf conditions mainly related to cooperation with the fatf and the forthcoming budget saleem told anadolu agency grappling with a colossal 18 billion current account deficit islamabad s current external debt stands at nearly 100 billion the bulk of it borrowed from the world bank imf asian development bank islamic development bank the us china france and other countries recently saudi arabia and the united arab emirates also announced bailout packages of 6 billion each for pakistan endorsement since 1993 siddiqui said successive governments have been accusing their predecessors of ruining the economy despite repeated successful imf programmes every government would declare itself near bankrupt and approach the imf not long after the successful completion of the imf programme by the previous government he said and i fear it will happen this time also but he viewed the bailout package as beneficial as well in a few areas the foremost benefit is that the simmering foreign reserves crisis will be contained for a longer period due to instalments from the imf he said annual remittances to the tune of 20 billion from overseas pakistanis are a major source of the country s foreign reserves which currently stand at 16 billion saleem said the only benefit he could see was the endorsement pakistan would get from the imf that would enable it to cash in through other forums such as the world bank and asian development bank it s not only because we need a loan from the imf but we need its endorsement of our economic policies to get loans from the world bank asian development bank and other donor agencies he said otherwise he contended the imf model was not aimed at rescuing countries out of crises the imf s agenda is not to strengthen global economies because if it does that then the fund itself will be out of business he said
menafn dailyfx trade wars talking points a run of reports and rumors seemed to turn the tide on trade war speculation wednesday but market response was uneven while tension between the us and china is still high reports of the next round of talks warmed sentiment if not usdcnh or audusd both the us and china reported troubled growth data the sterling extended its brexit slide and euro is being pulled forward what do the dailyfx analysts expect from the dollar euro equities oil and more through the 2q 2019 find our forecasts for the quarter in the dailyfx trading guides page are trade war clouds lifting it seems there is a concerted effort by us officials afoot to leverage some speculative enthusiasm to counteract the shaky ground the markets have found themselves on lately while there were a number of critical fundamental threads being pulled this past session through headlines the baseline trade wars continued to blot out any distractions of course the primary interest remains with economic collision course on which the united states and china remain there were reports suggesting the united states was preparing a delegation to return to china next week to pick back up the fractured talks that broke off last week before the us upgraded the tariff rate it placed on 200 billion in chinese goods from 10 to 25 percent followed by china s retaliation of a 25 percent tax on 60 billion in us imports asked to confirm these rumors however treasury secretary mnuchin would not commit this remains the most costly burden on the course of the global economy but the three to four weeks president trump gave before they plan to expand the tariffs to the remaining suite of chinese goods making their way to the country said to be 325 billion worth offer some time before the impact if truly felt in the meantime there was an unmistakable improvement in the sentiment surrounding an existing trade conflict and a potential tidal change in an impending threat for the former negotiators agreed seemed to agree to a rough outline for a usmca us mexico canada agreement that would replace the nafta accord a few months ago but the us legislature seemed to consistently rebuff the president s replacement the hold up seemed to be the refusal by the trump administration to remove quotas on steel and aluminum tariffs that were instituted over a year ago to start the global trade wars wednesday it was reported that us trade representative lighthizer was presenting a proposal to mexican and canadian officials that would lower the commodity tax and smooth trade relations interestingly neither usdcad nor usdmxn seemed to respond significantly to the news is it skepticism or is this outcome already priced in chart of usdcad daily looking to avert a further escalation of trade wars the most promising leak on the day was signal that president trump would decide at saturday s deadline on the 90 day review period on the commerce department s section 232 review of auto imports to delay for six months at its core this is only a deferment of a future risk but the market s are already under trade war pressure so that is still viewed as an improvement as the rumor spread through the new york morning trade the german dax surged as did the afterhours trade for japan s nikkei 225 europe and japan stood to absorb the biggest hit from such a shift in trade wars that said there was a notable lack of response from eurusd usdjpy and the us indices there is good reason to hard skepticism but is that what the us market s lack of response reflects or perhaps we are witnessing recognition that sentiment simply has run out of relief rally chart of germany s dax index daily risk trends prove reticent as growth and political troubles remind us other troubles taking a look to risk leaning assets outside the specific germany subset there was a sense of balance that didn t really hit the tenor of genuine enthusiasm perhaps that is due in forthcoming sessions from the s p 500 we were met with yet another gap lower on wednesday s open that is the 7th time in 8 trading days that the benchmark index has opened to a significant drop the most troubled mix for opening moves since the tumult of february 2018 ultimately the day s performance would cover the gap and more with notable gains that fell just short of a tipping confidence that a short term recover was in place having slipped little more than 5 percent from record highs the picture is very different for the s p 500 looking at similar patterns for other major risk benchmarks that so happen to be trading far from their early 2018 record multi year highs it is difficult to generate the same degree of enthusiasm my greater concern is the disparity between speculative dependent assets that capitalize on momentum versus those assets with a sentiment bent that also abide by growth or traditional economic backing a good example is the contrast that the most liquid sovereign debt yields hold to the us stock indices chart of s p 500 and opening gaps daily more likely than not the divergence in speculative assets is the result of deteriorating conviction behind an unquestioned risk appetite there are certain technical advantages such as the minor benefit found from being the instigator of trade wars that can amplify tepid performance into a genuine jump however such prompts rally prove reliable skepticism puts the emphasis back on the laundry list of fundamental shortcomings for which this global market continues to contend on global growth considerations the united states reported a contraction in retail spending and industrial production while china printed troubling april figures for fixed assets industrial production and retail sales of its own on the political risk front the us iran threats continue to build with the us withdrawing embassy staff and rumors that 120 000 troops may be deployed to the region presents fundamental instability that cannot be ignored chart of us crude oil and 10 day historical range daily dollar and euro spin their tires pound and aussie extend slide watch loonie and peso as the big picture themes work through the market s digestive system do not be surprised if key assets show more indecision than commitment the eurusd for example is very likely to remain of the most indecisive lightning rods for speculative appetite the greenback has neither the extreme risk aversion to prompt its intense safe haven status while its yield advantage bears little fruit with rate forecasts through year end dropping to their lowest levels since january 2018 for the euro s part there is simply too much to anticipate there is traditional event risk ahead that includes eurozone and italian trade figures my focus will be on the eurozone finance ministers meeting though as they will weigh in on more systemic issues like brexit and italy italian 10 year govenment bond yields continue to climb amid concerns that the government is gearing for a fight against european limits on debt in a bid to pump up a painful growth forecast that has already raised the ire of eu officials and stirred to life concerns over the stability of the shared currency looking ahead the eu parliamentary election carries serious weight on this front and will act to throttle deep euro moves chart of eurusd and italy germany 10 year yield spread inverted daily there will be similar restrictions to account for when it comes to the pound and australian dollar ahead yet at least these hurdles are not so convoluted for the sterling the threats are building in the government to force prime minister may to break an impasse by presenting her withdrawal agreement but it is still very likely the effort fails that makes the calls for may to set a date to receive brexit deal approval or step down all the more intense in turn the early june time frame for the vote is a strategic maneuver that may hold her position for longer while also posing an issue for the sterling to gain clear traction from eurgbp we have seen an incredible 8 day rally that breached range resistance defied retail anticipation and marked the longest climb since 2011 manage expectations as for the aussie dollar the economic connections to china are impossible to miss but the open market nature of the currency means audusd is probably a better reflection of trade wars than usdcnh the employment and inflation expectations figures this morning may prompt more meaningful response from this currency but consider that versus risk trends chart of eurgbp and consecutive day count daily two other currencies worth keeping tabs on the canadian dollar is facing some discrete event risk in the previous month s capital flows and the bank of canada s financial stability report that could prompt volatility but i retain my expectations to trade war or crude oil response usdcad has held stubbornly to its range a reflection of the loonie s temperament and i think a break is probable and even likely trade wars is just as much a caveat to mexican peso movement as its canadian counterpart but the bank of mexico rate decision on tap thursday could render a more targeted fundamental charge to override the restraint keep usdmxn in your review for the coming session we discuss all of this and more in today s trading video if you

submitted written testimony bearing these lessons in mind i will offer suggestions on how we might respond to russia s continued aggression in the current context as background allow me to share perspective from the 2014 experience as a treasury official i worked extensively on the design of russia sanctions in 2014 i draw three main conclusions from the experience 1 well designed sanctions are highly effective at generating financial pressure on a market based economy 2 signals from our top leadership are often more potent than sanctions themselves and 3 sanctions are rarely enough by themselves to achieve the foreign policy objective especially when we re confronting an entrenched autocrat putting these principles into action required an understanding of russia s economic pressure points we focused on asymmetries where did u s economic leverage intersect with russia s economic vulnerability financial capital was and is an obvious choice u s and european firms are the dominant global suppliers of financing that russia needed in large quantity and could not easily replace from other sources similarly in energy russia s production is dependent upon u s and european technology to boost long term capacity here again u s and eu companies are major suppliers of something that russia needed and cannot easily replace we began pursuing this objective by first writing down a set of guiding principles that remain instructive today sanctions against a large complex and integrated market economy such as russia should be 1 powerful enough to demonstrate u s resolve and our capacity to impose overwhelming economic costs 2 responsible to limit contagion through the u s and global financial system 3 targeted to avoid the appearance of punishing the civilian population and in doing so strengthening the autocrat s domestic narrative 4 calibrated to increase the chance of partnering with allies and 5 staged to preserve scope for escalation or de escalation depending on the target s response and learnings from previous steps before 2014 the united states had never imposed sanctions on a country the size of russia it was the tenth largest economy in world with a gdp roughly the size of italy more important than its size was the complexity of russia s economy and its connections to the rest of the world russia was and is of systemic importance in global energy markets ranking second and third in the production of natural gas and oil respectively its largest banks were comparable in size and complexity to lehman brothers before 2008 given the high stakes involved our objective was to design a menu of sanctions options that could deliver economic costs while limiting spillovers to the u s and global economy punishing impact to the russian economy followed soon afterwards import prices surged in tandem with russia s weakened currency and pushed the inflation rate up to the mid teens forcing several rounds of emergency interest rate hikes by the russian central bank banks required government injections of capital and regulatory forbearance just to avoid bankruptcy adjusted for inflation wages and spending collapsed bank lending and investment dried up in a futile attempt to defend its currency the ruble the russian central bank depleted about a quarter of its foreign currency reserves before essentially giving up and allowing the ruble to depreciate up to fifty percent from its pre sanctions value importantly the speed of the deterioration in russia s financial markets was determined by market forces and putin s own defiance rather than prescribed in advance by u s policy the mechanism was the reversal of market based financing for sanctioned entities we prohibited the supply of western capital through debt and equity issuance closing access to external financing spiked the borrowing cost for our targets to distressed levels the sudden impairment of balance sheets in the largest sectors of russia s economy spilled over to the corporate sector more broadly and sparked record levels of capital flight from the country as a whole restricting foreign capital proved even more potent than we anticipated by removing the u s and european supply of debt and equity financing to the largest russian state owned enterprises in the most critical sectors of the economy the 2014 sanctions triggered a negative feedback loop in russia that ultimately led to a deep recession and double digit inflation spillover risks were managed carefully by late 2014 our sanctions program had the potential to deliver a knockout blow particularly with lower oil prices causing an even larger shock instead we showed restraint both to increase the staying power of sanctions and to avoid the appearance of targeting russian civilians our sanctions program only targeted a handful of state owned companies in key sectors we did not target private companies nor did we sanction all sectors of the russian economy we prohibited new flows of financing to sanctions targets but existing stocks of risk were not frozen u s investors remained free to reduce exposure to russia at a pace and magnitude of their choosing derivatives and money markets both of which tend to be the dry tinder of financial crisis were largely untouched to avoid accidents in the global economy impact and spillovers were largely as expected due in large part to this restraint the economic impact to and spillovers from russia were in line with our expectations the russian economy contracted 2 8 percent in 2015 the largest decline among large economies and the recession continued into 2016 over the medium term these sanctions dealt a weak strategic hand to putin s economy russia s already depleted stock of capital was starved of much needed financing and investment removal of u s and european energy technology and the de integration of russia from the global financial system deprived russia of productive capacity and made its economy even more brittle the chilling effect across the economy prompted defections from talented portions of russia s already declining labor force as of last july the imf estimated potential growth in russia over the medium term at no more than 1 5 percent per year well below the average for emerging economies meanwhile unwanted spillovers were minimal sanctions forced the russian government to spend a sizeable portion of its resources to contain economic stress but we avoided causing widespread panic among the general public this was consistent with our purpose to create diplomatic leverage and deal space for our political leadership not to deliver financial hardship blowback to the u s economy was limited in the aggregate although certain businesses and sectors were negatively affected by construction sanctions are an economic distortion spillovers are unavoidable even for europe where direct linkages to russia are far more significant than in the u s the spillovers were summarized by the european commission as contained arguably without sanctions the paralyzing uncertainty brought about by unchecked russian aggression in the heart of europe would have generated far more economic damage to the region signals were at least as important as actions throughout this process both the impact and spillovers from sanctions were managed through signaling the signals were expressed by the most senior leaders of the u s government and their force of impact was multiplied by international partnership in march 2014 after announcing the first round of sanctions against russia president obama signaled the possibility of further escalation with a new executive order that authorized broader sanctions against key sectors of the russian economy in the same statement he pushed forcefully in favor of an imf bailout program for ukraine s economy a recognition that the best defense against russian aggression was a strong economic offensive vice president biden was dispatched to the baltic states to reinforce our article 5 commitment to nato countries and to step up cooperation with europe on developing buffers against energy shortfalls in the region after announcing sanctions in july 2014 against russia s largest banks energy companies and defense firms president obama warned again that the costs on russia would ratchet higher if putin s aggression in ukraine continued he also signaled that european allies were poised to mimic our sanctions program after close consultations which they did multiplying the direct effect of sanctions and reducing the competitive disadvantage to u s firms intensifying threats of escalation were expressed by president obama in september after another round of sanctions this time targeted at russia s largest bank even amid diplomatic efforts in minsk to broker a ceasefire looking back i have no doubt that direct signaling from the u s president was among the most potent sanctions tools we deployed against russia this is not just a matter of opinion many of the most punishing episodes in russian markets during 2014 were not those in which new sanctions actions were formally announced but rather when signals about future actions were revealed by the president this makes intuitive sense markets prices are shaped by expectations about the future escalatory signals from the president provided new information that markets had yet to incorporate into prices and these signals were invariably enough to impose costs on russian markets by themselves of course this signaling would have lost its potency if investors doubted the credibility of the threat but this has only become a relevant concern more recently yes sanctions can change behavior did these economic costs ultimately matter to putin answering this question goes beyond my expertise but i would observe that any leader however rogue cares about popularity and recessions do not win hearts and minds among cronies nor with the general public it s certainly true that putin s tolerance for economic pain is higher than that of most western leaders but there was threshold of pain above which his decision making calculus began to change close observers have argued convincingly that were it not for the mounting costs to the russian economy in late 2014 putin s forces might have annexed more territory or marched all the way to kyiv we ll never know the counterfactual but by the russian leadership s own admission the impact of sanctions was painful during this period my takeaway is that sanctions need to be sustained and intensified to challenge putin s endurance both through actions and by shaping expectations through clear and unified signals from our top leadership ultimately putin is more tactical opportunist than grand strategist costs matter if only we are willing to deliver them with a steady hand a key caveat to this optimistic view is the importance of winning the narrative within russia if there was a major failing in our 2014 sanctions regime it was that the average russian citizen did not see our purpose as honorable or even lawful instead of believing our objective was to defend the free will of a sovereign ukraine the average russian likely bought putin s propaganda that u s sanctions were just the latest in a series of historical injustices perpetrated by the west upon russia our inability to counter putin s scapegoating muted the effects of sanctions and gave the regime far more tolerance for economic pain and staying power than it would have enjoyed otherwise current context turning to the current context we know that russia s aggression abroad and repression at home have only worsened since 2015 at the same time economic developments in russia have improved markedly the economy is out of recession in fact russia s gdp grew in 2018 by the fastest amount in six years inflation touched an all time low last year oil production also set a new post soviet record in 2018 foreign reserves are back to pre sanctions levels nearing 500 billion in total both the government s budget surplus and trade surplus have reached record levels financial conditions have taken a similarly positive turn in february moody s upgraded russia s sovereign debt to investment grade in march the russian government placed the largest amount of dollar issuance since 2013 foreign investors have been major buyers of russian debt sales absorbing almost half of all issuance according to official sources the russian ruble is the top performing currency in the world this year and russian stock market performance is among the top ten in 2019 rising oil prices are undoubtedly driving part of the rebound but so is the perception that the u s lacks the political will to stand up to putin this should come as no surprise markets are reading the signals president trump has repeatedly questioned the findings of our top intelligence officials about russia s attack on our democratic process in 2016 president trump says it would be a good thing to get along with russia despite putin s desire to undermine our national interests in ukraine syria and venezuela he congratulated putin on his re election even amid outrage over russia s brazen chemical attacks on british soil investors see the sanctions tool being applied to the limit against rogue regimes in iran and venezuela but when it comes to russia they read stories of sanctions fatigue even within the u s congress if i were to summarize the general market attitude towards the u s government s russia sanctions program it would be described as political theater an unserious show of concern without any real desire for policy action behind the scenes in a practical sense that s the good news expectations for u s sanctions are low and greed has overtaken fear in the pricing of russian assets perhaps more now than at any point since 2014 new russia sanctions would be a surprise shock to markets and make a real difference i suggest two immediate actions first u s investors should be prohibited from purchasing new russian sovereign debt in 2014 i was cautious about taking this action due to the unpredictable spillover effects of disrupting the risk free benchmark asset of a sovereign nation circumstances have changed russia is far better able to absorb a hit to its sovereign debt market considering the background conditions described earlier and investors have had almost five years to reduce exposures in russia more to the point i can think of no credible argument why u s public pension funds and household 401ks should fund the russian government after its sweeping and systemic attempts to undermine american democracy second while i am not in favor of prohibitions on secondary market trading of russian assets as a general matter there is merit in constructive ambiguity requirements on u s persons to disclose any existing holdings of promsyvazbank russia s designated bank to service the defense sector and possibly veb would generate a broader chilling effect especially if it includes a grace period by itself this measure would not prohibit any trading activities but markets are conditioned to read the signals that broader restrictions could follow note these financial institutions are essentially appendages of the russian government oriented around domestic lending and with relatively limited international linkages beyond sanctions we must focus our efforts on winning the domestic narrative within russia both by exposing the corruption and criminality of putin s regime and through a renewed effort to bolster ukraine as a successful free market democracy in the near abroad transparency treasury and other authorities should conduct a study that attempts to identify the location holdings and financial intermediaries that manage and benefit from putin s wealth and the fortunes of his fellow kremlin kleptocrats even in the unlikely scenario that this effort has no effect on putin s geopolitical calculus it will signal to the russian people that our quarrel is not with them and it would provide a measure of transparency on putin s fortunes held abroad passage of beneficial ownership legislation by congress would also help to shine a light on stashes of stolen wealth held in high end u s real estate relatedly i would encourage a robust campaign to improve transparency within russia distributing verifiable evidence of corruption and the dependence of the current regime on kleptocracy would help to counter the government s disinformation campaign and its control of the media putin is ripping off the russian people and they should know it second a comprehensive package to counter russian aggression requires an offensive economic strategy in its near abroad especially in ukraine it remains the poorest country in europe on the per capita income basis largely because the reform effort has languished capital continues to flow out of the country and lending conditions are choked by interest rates in the mid teens and nonperforming loans near fifty percent corruption remains rampant in the financial system and the judiciary system the most impactful step that could be taken is conditions based bilateral u s support to reinforce long standing imf priorities in the region to improve the rule of law battle corruption and implement market oriented reforms including property rights the overarching purpose is to create a successful alternative to russian style autocracy also known as putin s worst nightmare mr chairman and ranking member stivers thank you once again for the invitation to testify and i look forward to your questions
there is no doubt that the us dollar is currently the most important global reserve currency with approximately 60 of central bank reserves denominated in us dollars the fact that the dollar figures in the balance sheets of central banks as reserves means that the demand for dollars remains high and that helps to support dollar strength see the chart below the us dollar is also the most important currency in forex markets with about 85 of all transactions involving dollars the table below refers to march 2018 the most important currencies in international transactions after the us dollar are the euro the japanese yen and the british pound the renminbi has a long way to go before it can be considered a major reserve currency currency market share usd 87 6 eur 31 3 jpy 21 6 3 gbp 12 8 click to enlarge the bloomberg us dollar index chart below shows that the dollar has been holding steady at around 95 most of the time since 2015 this may be due mainly to weakness in the euro as the euro is the principal currency basis for the dollar index the us dollar has been doing very well against the renminbi see below as investors know rather well past performance is no guarantee of future performance that is also applicable to the us dollar we do not know what is going to happen in the forex markets there have been several articles about the plans of china and russia to avoid using the us dollar for payments it is also the case that countries being targeted by the us namely cuba iran north korea syria turkey and venezuela are seeking ways to escape from having to resort to dollars for international payments saudi arabia has even threatened to modify its petrodollar policy which requires customers acquiring its oil to pay in us dollars there is now an oil futures market in shanghai where the chinese are trying to promote the renminbi for oil transactions furthermore it has now become obvious that president trump uses the predominant position of the dollar as a weapon in global diplomacy as the us has done in the past it is thus highly uncertain what is going to happen with the us dollar as a global reserve currency and as the principal currency in forex transactions the current trade negotiations between china and the us have so far not reached any immediate far reaching conclusions besides the imposition of tariffs on large quantities of goods it is not clear for how long these tariffs are going to remain in force the msm and alternative media are full of articles commenting on the negotiations it seems that president trump has not been able to make a deal with the chinese negotiators so he has upped the ante by imposing higher tariffs on the goods already subject to tariffs raising the tariff rate from 10 to 25 it is obvious that president trump has underestimated the determination of the chinese not to lose face dealing with chinese is different from dealing with americans president trump is going to learn a lesson about making a deal with asians and it is going to be a costly one the five year bloomberg chart below shows the us dollar exchange rate with the chinese yuan it is useful to track the exchange rate because until well into 2015 a us dollar could buy only â 6 20 the chinese government was keeping the currency within a narrow range this began to change in the latter half of 2015 as the dollar strengthened against the yuan that means that the yuan was weakening against the dollar as by 2017 a dollar could buy â 6 80 china was exposed to the complaint that the currency was being devalued in order to promote chinese trade in the latter half of 2017 president trump began proposing tariffs on chinese goods and this was positive for the yuan which went to around 6 30 by the beginning of 2018 as it seemed that a deal could be reached as the negotiations became longer and longer the yuan weakened as tariffs were imposed and the dollar went up to more than â 6 80 in this way the imposition of tariffs had as a result a weakening of the yuan which to a certain extent nullified the effect of the tariffs on chinese imports to the us positive news about the possibility of reaching a deal helped to strengthen the renminbi but recent developments that have been marked by more tariffs being imposed and the unlikelihood of a deal being reached anytime soon have resulted again in weakness on the part of the chinese currency the bottom line for investors is that stock markets may suffer from trade disruptions due to the dispute volatility will likely return to the markets the ppt plunge protection team may be sent in to avoid a bear market in the us given that the current economic cycle is in its late stages investments in renminbi are consequently now riskier than before since a breakdown in negotiations may result in a downturn in chinese markets even if the government intervenes to help buoy up the markets recent volatility in shanghai may presage even more negative downturns that the government will try to counter complacent investors may be unpleasantly surprised at future developments us investors face various risks if they decide to invest in china at this time
pakistan sealed a 6 billion bailout deal with the international monetary fund imf last week to shore up its fragile public finances and underpin its slowing economy but the program is unlikely to achieve stabilization amid sacrificed growth according to local economists they also fear that the three year structural adjustment program which is expected to be formally approved by the fund s executive board in july will further add to rising inflation and utility tariffs this will be the imf s 13th structural adjustment program for pakistan since 1988 the basic focus of this program is stabilization now and growth later but history tells us that at the end of these programs pakistan s average growth rate remained the lowest in south asia since 1988 shahid hasan siddiqui a karachi based economist told anadolu agency this is because of the artificial stabilizations that eventually disturbed the growth rate siddiqui said he said another key condition of the latest imf program was to reduce the budget deficit by meeting tax collection targets which seemed to be difficult to achieve for various political reasons to bridge this gap he observed the cash strapped government would go for indirect taxes and raising utility tariffs which would directly impact the general public under the agreement the government will no longer control the dollar value against the local rupee instead it will be dealt with by the open market also the government will start withdrawing exemptions offered on various taxes amounting to around 350 billion rupees in the 2019 20 budget rupee devaluation will certainly increase the country s exports and reduce the rising imports but a hike in power and gas tariffs will increase the cost of production and ultimately neutralize the devaluation benefit the currency devaluation will also increase the cost of raw materials which pakistan imports for its export output siddiqui added analysts view the rising imports as a major threat to the country s 300 billion economy pakistan s annual imports currently total around 60 billion compared to a mere 24 billion worth of exports temporary relief kaiser bengali a former government economic adviser views the imf package as temporary relief to the country s tottering economy the imf package means nothing more than some time to fill the balance of payments gap it s just breathing space bengali told anadolu agency he observed that despite the latest imf loan which is insufficient to meet the country s actual requirements pakistan had to go to the commercial market to borrow short term and expensive loans which would further deepen the dollar deficit he maintained this will further push pakistan to look to the imf he said bengali linked the proposed imf package to talks between islamabad and the financial action task force fatf a global terror financing watchdog the fatf has already placed pakistan on its gray list for not taking enough measures to curb terror financing and money laundering now the fatf meeting is continuing in china with turkey the u s the u k china india and others participating i believe the imf has brought pakistan to this stage deliberately now both the imf and fatf will force pakistan to carry out multiple drastic structural economic reforms mainly related to terrorism financing he contended farrukh saleem an islamabad based economist shares a similar view this package is yet to be approved it will only be approved if pakistan meets some key imf conditions mainly related to cooperation with the fatf and the forthcoming budget saleem told anadolu agency grappling with a colossal 18 billion current account deficit islamabad s current external debt stands at nearly 100 billion the bulk of it borrowed from the world bank imf asian development bank islamic development bank the united states china france and other countries recently saudi arabia and the united arab emirates also announced bailout packages of 6 billion each for pakistan the south asian nuclear state has conceded a loss of 100 billion since 2002 after joining the u s led war against terrorism endorsement since 1993 siddiqui said successive governments have been accusing their predecessors of ruining the economy despite repeated successful imf programs every government would declare itself near bankrupt and approach the imf not long after the successful completion of the imf program by the previous government he said and i fear it will happen this time also but he viewed the bailout package as beneficial as well in a few terms the foremost benefit is that the simmering foreign reserves crisis will be contained for a longer period due to installments from the imf he said annual remittances to the tune of 20 billion from overseas pakistanis are a major source of the country s foreign reserves which currently stand at 16 billion saleem said the only benefit he could see was the endorsement pakistan would get from the imf which would enable it to cash in through other forums such as the world bank and asian development bank it s not only because we need a loan from the imf but we need its endorsement of our economic policies to get loans from the world bank asian development bank and other donor agencies he said otherwise he contended the imf model was not aimed at rescuing countries out of crises
treasury cs henry rotich right and principal secretary department of planning julius muiya during the launch of 2019 2022 economic survey at kicc the eurobond has become a cliché after kenya issued a dollar denominated sovereign debt for the third time in five years a combination of factors has led to kenya s heavy reliance on debt from american and european investors but significant of all was the graduation of the country s economy into a low middle income country lmic after the country s gross domestic product was recalibrated to include other sectors in one of its documents treasury said the graduation of kenya to a lower middle income country in 2015 resulted in a shift from concessional cheap funding to blend financing from both the world bank and african development bank graduation to lmic means a move into the blend window with financial terms that are hard compared to the soft terms in the concessional window said the treasury besides high interest rates non concessional external financing such as the eurobond carries an inherent foreign exchange risk according to treasury in other words should us dollar under which the eurobond is denominated strengthen against the shilling the debt becomes expensive the henry rotich headed treasury also noted that some countries provide credit on commercial terms a situation that has seen kenya s stock of expensive debt surge the result has been an increase in the amount of debt repayment with the country paying sh89 9 billion in interest for the first and second eurobond issuance delicate situation the international monetary fund imf which has in the past warned against kenya s ballooning public debt saying the country s external debt has left it in a delicate situation where any slight external disturbance such as drought or increase in global oil prices could plunge it into a financial crisis the higher level of debt together with rising reliance on non concessional borrowing have raised fiscal vulnerabilities and increased interest payments on public debt to nearly one fifth of revenue said imf in a review of kenya s economy already kenya has paid sh73 5 billion in interest for its sh275 billion debut sovereign bond issued in 2014 part of the sh210 billion it raised this week will be used to refinance the five year tranche that is maturing in june with the issuance of the third eurobond kenya has effectively become part of the market and it needs to grow its revenues to comfortably repay the loans
two mass protest movements have in quick succession forced regime changes in sudan and ethiopia two of the horn of africa s quintessential hard states a deep seated disillusion with the security and developmental states drives the new revolutionary mood what is less clear is where all the ferment and the popular demand for a new dispensation will lead in sudan the ouster of omar al bashir has been followed by a partial retreat of the security state in ethiopia the election of a reformist prime minister and a year of sweeping reforms have extensively eroded the power of the security deep state yet neither prime minister abiy ahmed ali s extensive cull nor the sudanese military council s modest targeted purge constitute a fundamental dismantling of the structures of the security state more importantly the transitions underway in the two countries were in the initial phases at least top down attempts by the security state to engineer a soft landing with minimal disruptions prime minister abiy s singular act of genius lay in the way he deftly subverted a strategy of piecemeal reform assigned to him by the ruling party and began almost single handedly to unravel old ethiopia at breakneck speed the retreat of the authoritarian order in both ethiopia and sudan opens up huge possibilities a generational opportunity for meaningful and positive change but also great risks in ethiopia a year of deep reforms under the youthful reformist prime minister has put the transition on a rocky but relatively steady positive trajectory overall prospects for good governance civil liberties and human rights continue to improve in sudan the situation is less hopeful and remains so far uncertain the hopes and expectations raised by the resignation of omar al bashir after 30 years in power now grates against the reality of a potentially messy and protracted transition following a controversial intervention by the army the transition military council tmc made up of al bashir s allies is struggling against mounting popular discontent to manage an interregnum the horn is at strategic crossroads there is immense hope but also great fear how ethiopia and sudan manage their fraught transitions and the prospects for success and reversal remain unknown what is not in doubt is that a botched transition in both nations will crush the dreams of millions and their quest for liberty and a better quality of life it will also embolden autocratic regimes and vindicate their ideology of stability the unprecedented upheaval and ferment in the two horn of africa states provide an extraordinary window into the complex diverse and obscure changes and currents shaking up society and traditional politics these contextual dynamics must not be overlooked in the analyses of ethiopia and sudan sudan s turbulent interregnum sudan and ethiopia offer two fraught transition models atypical unstable and potentially reversible while dissimilar in some key aspects both are attempts at a top down fix reliant on continued goodwill and support of the military security services and dominant parties more importantly the two transitions are not outcomes of political and constitutional settlements and are likely to remain contested and unsettled for some time sudan s transition is in its infancy and is dogged by a host of challenges of the two countries it is the one with the greatest potential for a short term crisis but if successful one that opens enormous possibilities for improved governance and stability formal direct talks between sudan s protest movement and the military began on 27 april but quickly hit a snag barely two days later the key sticking points the length of the transition the military wants two years while the protest movement favours four years on the basis that more time is needed to undo the damage of 30 years of misrule composition of the proposed sovereign transition council stc and who should lead it on 30 april the tmc issued a series of controversial and unilateral decisions that escalated the stalemate into a crisis the council said the stc would be headed by the military and that 7 out 10 posts would be allocated to the military contrary to the sudanese professional association s demand for a 15 member council the bulk of whose members should be civilian it further called on the spa to dismantle barricades at the army command in khartoum and to get protesters off the streets the generals had been angling for a longer pre transition period from the start this was largely based on the assumption that they stood to gain more from the tactical point of view the spa had more to lose but there are other pressing calculations first more time allows the tmc to sort out internal divisions second it gives it the leg room to craft and fine tune its negotiation strategy third it provides the tmc with the opportunity to drag out the process and wear down the pro democracy movement the so called attrition option that has served the military well in the past at the heart of sudan s chaotic and bitter transition contest indeed the crisis of legitimacy credibility is the self appointed tmc it is made up of senior generals all beneficiaries of the army purges in the last one decade by al bashir that elevated loyalists to key posts the decision by the african union to extend the tmc s life by three months is therefore a major victory for the military it now has up to the end of july 2019 to set up an authority to oversee the transition and to agree to a roadmap with the opposition a viable transition roadmap in sudan depends on consensus between the five distinct actors constituencies street protesters the leadership of the protest movement traditional parties the tmc and regional actors this will not be easy it is almost certain that divergent aims interests and calculations could prove a major impediment the military council a reluctant reformer at the heart of sudan s chaotic and bitter transition contest indeed the crisis of legitimacy credibility is the self appointed tmc it is made up of senior generals all beneficiaries of the army purges in the last one decade by al bashir that elevated loyalists to key posts they eased al bashir out and made a number of significant concessions however they controversially stonewalled when it came to the speedy transfer of power to a civilian administration significantly they have so far resisted popular calls for the dismantling of the so called dawlah al amiqah or deep state widely perceived as a covert power centre whose members include senior generals securocrats and politicians who exercise extra constitutional influence on the state what the tmc s true aims are and what its interests and links with the deep state and foreign powers are are all a matter for debate and conjecture far less speculative and hazardous perhaps is what it isn t the council is essentially a product of a deep crisis within the state a hastily created crisis response tool to reassert military influence and manage a fluid political situation it pulled back from imposing a state of emergency and allowed the protests to continue it quickly shed unpopular senior ex regime figures such as the intelligence chief salah gosh it released some but not all political prisoners and reached out to protest leaders these were all positive and encouraging steps that demonstrate that the tmc has significant agency is pragmatic and is amenable to a political settlement yet the clumsy nature of the coup the confusion in the first 48 hours as well as the incoherent pronouncements and policy flip flops since then point to deep internal frictions tactically this could be an advantage for the coalition leading the protests potentially giving them greater room to nudge the tmc towards reform and to influence the agenda it could also pose serious challenges in the coming weeks and months especially if as some fear the council becomes opportunistic and capricious and its cohesions become more frayed but there must be no mistake about the tmc s politics its primary goal is to maintain national stability it views retention of military power influence and privilege as necessary to achieve that noble goal there is no evidence that it shares the democratic aspirations of the majority of the sudanese people it is instinctively suspicious of civilians and resistant to the idea of civilian oversight and even much less civilian rule sudan s military for three decades waged not just war but also engaged in multiple peace processes and political negotiations at the local and national levels involving armed and non armed civilian opponents under al bashir talks were conducted in the same manner as war was waged invariably three distinct tactics with roots in war strategy were deployed to outflank and eviscerate the civilian opposition accommodation co option and containment the official discourse and rhetoric surrounding the series of national dialogues in train for nearly two decades offers a fascinating glimpse into the appropriation of martial metaphors a progressive militarisation of politics domestic politics was officially referred to as jabhat al daakhiliyah internal front political parties were reminded of the value of national cohesion and called upon to help unify the ranks tawhid al saf dissidents were cat s paw mikhlab qit of foreign enemies sudan s protest movement will be negotiating with a military that has set ways of dealing with civilian adversaries expectations that the military is willing to make a strategic and irreversible retreat from politics seems over optimistic the tmc s 30th april pronouncements and the subsequent hardening of language certainly sowed doubts about the prospect of that happening any time soon the unilateral and escalatory nature of the council s statement goes against the letter and spirit of the negotiations it may be a hint of an intense internal power struggle it could also signal an attempt by hardline factions to assert greater control a hypothesis lent some credence by the fact it was the tmc s second in command general muhammad hamdan dagalo aka hemedti who was personally involved hemedti the commander of the rapid support forces rsf quwaat al da m al sari has in recent weeks emerged as the real power within the tmc playing court to visiting dignitaries and diplomats his swift maneuvers to consolidate power within the military and security services are anything but coincidental he was for example elevated to a member of the national intelligence and security service niss an official suna news agency dispatch said that he was now uzw a member of niss a vague term that is both odd and inexplicable the rsf itself is affiliated to the niss since it was established in 2013 from the rump of the janjaweed militia the original force of roughly 7 000 was drawn mainly from hemedti s own rizaygat tribe in darfur an important factor in itself that partly explains its strong internal cohesion and loyalty to hemedti it has a complicated dual command chain answerable to both the niss director general and the regular army general command al bashir increasingly relied on the rsf and the popular police forces in recent years to quell social unrest and low level armed insurrections the bulk of the rsf is now fighting in yemen alongside emirati troops a decision based on rsf s perceived counterinsurgency competence and adaptability to the yemeni battlefield conditions hemedti is young ambitious and has powerful gulf friends who are keen to see him play an influential role in the transition he has a fearsome reputation and is deemed both an able battle field commander and a skillful political operator his rise to prominence since al bashir s ouster and high visibility within the tmc suggest a resurgence of hardline elements keen not to cede too much ground to the protest movement old parties and the protest movement sudan s bewildering array of political parties which are weak and deeply fragmented were caught off guard by the protests however they seem keen to be included in the transition talks the tmc initially seemed to prefer a broad based dialogue in part because that could have neutralised the weight of the protest movement it has since walked back and proposed a format that significantly shortened the list of participants not least because of the risks of an unwieldy and fractious dialogue process that is impossible to conclude within the short timeframe it now has three months two distinct but complementary historical trends converged in the horn protests a massive demographic shift that progressively moved the youth to the centre of politics and a technological revolution that provided them with the tools to effectively resist and organise the sheer demographic weight and the volatility and restless energy unleashed by these changes cannot be ignored sudan s protest movement and its leadership hold the initiative in the contest to shape the transition the call for freedom justice and peace emblazoned on every placard gelled a fragmented nation and triggered the horn s most powerful and unprecedented mass protest movements the expectations are high and the road to achieving them daunting the risk of fragmentation within the protest movement is also high it is now made up of two distinct groups quwaa i laan al huriyyat wal tagyiir declaration of freedom and change forces dfcf and the sudanese professionals association spa tajamm u al mihniyiin al sudaniyin they are now broadly aligned in their demands however tmc s co option strategies and the attrition of protracted negotiation are highly likely to sow division ethiopia s transition is the outcome of two severe crises that shook the regime to the core over four years of relentless mass protests in oromiya and amhara regional states and a sharp economic downturn the ethiopian people s revolutionary democratic front eprdf played a central role in the transition that engineered abiy ahmed s rise the spa and the dfcf have so far done a remarkable job in leading a cohesive disciplined and non violent mass protest movement they must not sell themselves short in the delicate negotiations now underway they must safeguard their cohesion eschew personal ambition remain vigilant against the familiar co option traps stay resilient and focused in the face of setbacks and be hard nosed at every phase of the negotiations ethiopia s unstable transition ethiopia s transition is the outcome of two severe crises that shook the regime to the core over four years of relentless mass protests in oromiya and amhara regional states and a sharp economic downturn the ethiopian people s revolutionary democratic front eprdf the coalition of four ethno regional parties that has dominated politics since the early 1990s played a central role in the transition that engineered abiy ahmed s rise it started off well in the early years combining a reformist zeal with an accommodative approach to politics its fortunes for over two decades was tied to that of the charismatic and talented meles zenawi it owes its structural and organisational resilience and more importantly its internal consensus style ethos to him the aftermath of the controversial elections in 2005 and the massive crackdowns on protests ushered in a long period of repression deflected the party from its democratic goals and progressively strengthened the hegemony of the tigray people s liberation front tplf but even in its weakened state the eprdf proved its dependability as an instrument of crisis management at critical junctures it engineered a smooth transition of power after the death of meles in 2012 and leaned on hailemariam desalegn to resign as prime minister in february 2018 abiy capitalised on the party s internal institutional strength and exploited the antipathy to the tplf to build the tactical alliances necessary to seal his victory at the eprdf congress in february 2018 ironically abiy s radical reforms in particular the planned swift transition to a conventional multiparty system makes the future of the governing coalition perilous and uncertain while the pm has orchestrated changes within the eprdf and consolidated his grip over his own oromo democratic party odp many suspect the era of the dominant vanguard party may be coming to a close significantly the ethiopian prime minister has relied on a close knit circle of politicians and inexperienced advisers to drive his fast paced reforms with minimal or no input from the eprdf and other key institutions the benefits of a personalised elite driven reform seem obvious abiy arguably needed the latitude and flexibility it provides to push through a raft of deep reforms and swiftly dismantle key pillars of tplf s power in the military security services and economy the potential drawbacks of a highly personalised leadership style and an elite driven reform process lacking sufficient institutional buy in and support must be obvious it is inherently risky and alienates the very agencies indispensable to implementation and long term sustainability understood thus the risks to reform in ethiopia seem not so much bureaucratic inertia as bureaucratic recalcitrance rumblings of unease within the state and in the parastatals over key aspects of the reforms from privatisation to the future of the ethnic federalism system reinforce these fears the prime minister rhetorically at least is increasingly aware of this potential problem he has stepped up meetings with key departments and pledged to deepen institutional engagement however his critics claim that the impromptu townhall style meetings are cosmetic and do not constitute structured policy dialogue ethnic unrest identity politics may act as a catalyst for change but its huge capacity to complicate transitions that foment new unrest must not be ignored ethiopia is an egregious example aggressive and adversarial strains of ethno nationalisms resurgent in recent years pose grave conflict risks many ethnic conflicts are traditionally driven by contested borders and resource competition ethno regionalism nationalism aggravate these conflicts and make them intractable prime minister abiy s stabilisation and consolidation efforts have had minimal impact in de escalating the problem balancing multiple and contending ethnic interests proved far trickier than anticipated his policy of accommodation to remedy historical injustices and allocate more government posts to marginalised communities and disadvantaged segments of the population won wider praise but either failed to mollify more militant and younger ethno nationalist activists clamouring for deeper affirmative action or reinforced resentment among other ethnicities this is particularly the case in oromiya where factions loyal to the oromo liberation front that view the prime minister as a traitor to the oromo cause continue to stoke violence and undermine social cohesion several attempts to mediate an end to the ructions in oromiya and reconcile the rival factions so far have produced shaky truces that failed to hold in ethiopia the economic crisis was largely induced by the frenetic pace of growth skewed development expensive infrastructure mega projects and dependence on foreign chinese loans abiy in early 2018 inherited a state that was virtually bankrupt its foreign exchange reserve depleted and saddled with mounting and unsustainable debt servicing obligations meanwhile the abiy s anti corruption drive and political consolidation strategy perceived targeted at curbing the influence exerted by the minority tigrayan ethnic community on the country s political and economic life fomented serious backlash the widely held perception that the premier s new friendship with the eritrean president isayas afewerki is partly motivated by a common desire to isolate the tplf served to further inflame sentiments in tigray the region is now effectively a mini state its relations with addis ababa deeply fraught and antagonistic on off dialogue between addis and mekele and a series of high level meetings in 2018 failed to smooth relations or diminish the potentially dangerous siege mentality developing in tigray the region is where the country s elite military units are garrisoned and where sophisticated heavy military hardware including air combat assets are kept a legacy of the border conflict with eritrea an armed conflict highly improbable but impossible to rule out would be catastrophic economic hardship economic hardships remain core drivers of social unrest in sudan and ethiopia conditions for the vast majority of their populations progressively worsened in the last five years sudan s loss of oil revenues and subsequent deadlock over oil trans shipment fees with south sudan triggered the country s severest economic crisis in decades high inflation currency turbulence and a series of austerity measures that saw subsidies lifted on bread and other commodities hit the lower classes hard and fomented the mass protests that quickly engulfed the whole country in ethiopia the economic crisis was largely induced by the frenetic pace of growth skewed development expensive infrastructure mega projects and dependence on foreign chinese loans abiy in early 2018 inherited a state that was virtually bankrupt its foreign exchange reserve depleted and saddled with mounting and unsustainable debt servicing obligations an emergency deposit of 1 billion dollars into the treasury by the uae helped to stabilise the volatile fiscal situation the short to medium term prospects look bleak even though china s decision to write off some of the debt in late april and signals of support from multilateral financial institutions and donors promise some relief in sudan the uae similarly stepped in to shore up the currency by depositing money in the treasury donors have equally signaled readiness to help the gravity of the economic crisis in the two states and the improbability of a quick and dramatic improvement portend huge risks for the transition yet the kind of tangible and irreversible progress in their delicate transitions necessary to unlock donor support and foreign investment hardly exists now and is bound to take years by which time conditions would have deteriorated further in ethiopia the continued proliferation of ethnic unrest and violence in economically productive regions has triggered massive displacement estimated at 3 million the government s inability to get on top of the situation is hugely destabilizsing in itself but also certain to prove a major impediment to new foreign investment an emergency financial aid package for sudan and long term economic relief and stimulus package for ethiopia seem the best options for the international community to shore up the transitions a youth revolt the uprisings in ethiopia and sudan constitute the horn s first uniquely large scale youth revolt the first political coming of age of two youth generations embittered by economic hardship and the inequities of the hard state ethiopia with over 70 of the population out of a total of 110 million under the age 30 and sudan with 60 of the population 42 5 million under the age of 25 are examples of states where the demographic shift has been at its starkest reflecting both the promise and destabilising potential of the so called youth bulge two distinct but complementary historical trends converged in the horn protests a massive demographic shift that progressively moved the youth to the centre of politics and a technological revolution that provided them with the tools to effectively resist and organise the sheer demographic weight and the volatility and restless energy unleashed by these changes cannot be ignored the long term viability and sustainability of the transitions hinge on how the disruptive impact of the youth bulge is managed the recurrent themes of the protests are familiar they revolve around a set of socio economic grievances that cut across the age divide jobs and better wages economic growth opportunities and autonomy better services sudan s unemployment rate is estimated to be around 21 4 or over 2 million of the productive labour force of 21 million in ethiopia youth unemployment stands at 19 5 social media and the diaspora the protest movements in ethiopia and sudan are beneficiaries of the digital revolution effectively harnessing the power of the smartphone and social media facebook twitter whatsapp to challenge the regimes in power these tools allowed them to organise to break the state s monopoly over information and to generate their own multimedia content in the contest for narrative space the state was severely disadvantaged its power of monopoly over communication and access to sophisticated cyber spying software was offset by the technical savvy and ingenuity of the protesters frequent communication shutdowns that targeted sms and internet access proved ineffective protesters used vpns and encrypted messaging apps and relied on diaspora supporters to bypass state censorship diaspora support in both instances was crucial and went beyond amplifying social media messages activists in north america and europe mobilised funds organised pickets and petitions highlighted rights abuses and raised the profile of these protests at the international stage the oromo diaspora in the us a close knit community with its own influential media outlets played a particularly pivotal role a role recognised by prime minister abiy himself when he made a thanksgiving tour of the us in 2018 a number of high profile exiled figures have since been given high level posts in the ethiopian government diaspora influence and power have not been without controversy especially in ethiopia there have been claims that hardline activists disseminated fake news and inflammatory messages to stoke ethnic hostility and division in sudan there is speculation probably fueled by the military that the diaspora is inciting intransigence and radicalising the protest movement the transition in ethiopia has brought to the fore the simmering tensions between political classes inside the country and those abroad growing intra oromo divisions partly reflect both the type of rivalries political divergence and clash of ambitions that could complicate the transition a fracturing of the protest movement s core support base remains a potential risk in a delicate transition such as ethiopia s but also the one in sudan the sudanese reform movement has so far stayed remarkably cohesive that unity is almost certain to come under great strain especially in the highly likely scenario of protracted and intensely contested transition the transition military council favours a fragmented and weak opposition all the signs indicate that this is an outcome it is actively working to achieve identity politics sudan and ethiopia are similar in a variety of ways they are the horn s most diverse states with a combined total of 99 major ethnic groups and over 200 languages and dialects they still remain geographically vast and unwieldy even after secessionist wars and peace settlements led to a partition that diminished their original size both share a long history of multiple armed conflicts and vast ill governed and severely underdeveloped peripheries conditions that incubated volatile forms of identity politics insurrections and social unrest both countries also experimented with decentralisation models designed to foster self rule and greater autonomy however neither ethiopia s radical ethnic federal system nor sudan s conventional one achieved the desired aims instead they replicated the ills of the central state bred their own inequities inflamed ethno regional nationalisms and reinforced core periphery tensions ethnic identity politics was a potent factor in the ethiopian mass protests it provided the glue and energy what is fascinating is not just the complex ways in which group grievances intersect feed off bleed into wider discontent but the subtle somewhat counter intuitive ways in which even hitherto antagonistic ethnicities regions and religious groups managed to cooperate and transcend their differences ethiopia s mass protests never evolved into a single nationwide movement like sudan s they were almost exclusively confined to oromiya and amhara regional states which are dominated by two ethnic groups divided by a long history of mutual antipathy yet activists in the two regions drew energy and succour from each other s protests they cross fertilized and learnt effective protest tactics from one another for example amhara region s ghost town tactics that paralysed cities were replicated in oromiya gradually a new sense of mutual empathy and solidarity developed between oromo and amhara protesters the seminal moment was when protesters in the two regions chanted down down woyane proof that the two distinct ethnic discontents had coalesced into a single national demand in sudan the protest leadership quickly tapped into and harnessed the vast array of diverse grievances to weave a set of key national objectives with a comparably freer civic space well organised trade union movement and professional associations with a proud tradition of political activism sudan s mass revolt took on a national character much more quickly than ethiopia s what tipped the scales was not critical mass though that was important but the emergence of a proto narrative that encapsulated shared national goals in sudan the protest leadership quickly tapped into and harnessed the vast array of diverse grievances to weave a set of key national objectives with a comparably freer civic space well organised trade union movement and professional associations with a proud tradition of political activism sudan s mass revolt took on a national character much more quickly than ethiopia s the rallies in khartoum reflected the diversity of the nation s social fabric and remained characterised throughout by a convivial ecumenical spirit as remarkable as it is rare identity protest and culture sudan achieved in protest what eluded it for decades a genuine moment of unity in diversity the protest rallies in khartoum were a microcosm of the nation bringing together diverse ethnic and civil society groups drawn from all regions social strata and professions darfuris kordofanis and nubians women and other distinct social groups aggrieved workers and traders all disenfranchised and rendered powerless and invisible by state policies were catapulted onto the national stage they all made common cause and rallied around a single political message but the mass uprisings in sudan and ethiopia were not just animated by political and economic grievances activists in sudan actually took slight at media characterisation of their protests as bread riots they were also impelled by cultural discontent a sense of humiliation and anger at the state s perceived cultural homogenisation discrimination and misogyny in ethiopia the oromo unrest was fueled in part by long simmering grievances over the status of the oromo language and state interferences in religious affairs while in sudan state driven islamisation and arabisation remained major sources of social frictions the act of protest was in itself psychologically and culturally transformative providing an opportunity to assert cultural pride and reclaim self confidence and autonomy the oromo pride movement in ethiopia and the rise of women in sudan exemplify the cultural forces shaping the politics of protests and transitions prime minister abiy s open embrace and appropriation of oromo culture and his gender parity campaign are just two examples of the symbolic and practical policy impacts hopes are high that sudan s new breed of assertive female activists will capitalise on the national mood for change and harness their collective picketing power to influence the transition s agenda no less important the rallies served asa vehicle for collective catharsis and radical empathy a space to affirm values of mutual interdependence solidarity and peaceful co existence the slogan kuluna darfur we are all darfur at the rallies in khartoum hopefully was not just a feel good empathetic response but marks a fundamental positive shift in the way communities relate to one another religion and culture religion as a powerful galvaniser and conduit for protest and a repository of moral and ethical values necessary for a just society has a long history in the horn the protests in sudan and ethiopia provide contrasting lessons in the resilience of religion and its potency to inspire and channel protest but far more interesting is how the debate over the relevance of religion in governance continues to evolve the oromo mass insurrection in ethiopia gestated for many years it fed off diverse small and localised communal grievances before it snowballed into a national crisis the big triggers high youth unemployment state driven land grabs punitive taxation repression and violent crackdowns are well known less noted and examined are the obscure and overlapping cultural and religious roots of the discontent brewing for close to a decade the political rebellion owed much of its resilience and success to the cultural revivalist movement gaining in momentum and influence in recent years it drew energy inspiration and self confidence from the potent message of ethnic pride preached by oromo elders like abba gadda oromo traditional waqqeffana religion practised by a small fraction of the community roughly less than 5 played an important complementary role as a central pillar of cultural expression regarded as the indigenous faith of the oromo nation its rituals and spiritual teachings progressively galvanised millions the irrecha annual festival of harvests with roots in the waqqeffana religion drew tens of thousands and became a visible symbol of political and cultural consciousness and a focal point for the protests a series of muslim unrests in oromiya in 2012 quickly spread to other regions and continued to simmer for over 18 months much of the unrest was initially triggered by alleged state interference in muslim affairs but quickly aggravated by mass arrests of clerics and community leaders and the suspension of muslim publications such as ye muslimoch guday the muslim protests viewed across oromiya as evidence of the state s wider malign intent against the oromo thus triggered the first spark that lit the fire of large scale rebellion in 2014 the oromo nation s ability to harness its cultural heritage and multiple faith traditions and to foster internal mutual respect and tolerance is unique so too is the tradition of syncretism that indigenised islam and christianity and reduced the heat and social frictions generally associated with puritanism and proselytism this cultural adaptability and inherent resistance to exclusivist manifestations of faith may partly explain why salafism found oromiya a less ambient and sympathetic territory to put down roots in the bid to project this benign and positive face of oromo culture on the national stage was thwarted by fragmentation and factionalism as well as by the political clout exerted by militant factions widely perceived wedded to an exclusivist ethnic agenda prime minister abiy a practising pentecostal with muslim heritage represents this hybrid pluralistic and healthy attitude to religion while his fervent faith and the occasional unnerving messianic tenor to his speeches raised some concerns the prime minister so far has acted with great sensitivity on matters to do with faith he released detained muslim leaders and appointed a record number to key state posts and reached out to the orthodox church abiy s medemer philosophy based on values of love compassion and solidarity in the new testament does not signal intent to christianise or change the strong secular character of the ethiopian state the primary motive is to create a unifying principle around which the nation can rally a striking feature of sudan s protest movement is the near total absence of islamist slogans and the emergence of more assertive youthful female activists keen to raise their visibility to subvert the strict dress code and to claw back their huquq al mar a al maqsub usurped fundamental rights of women however the rise of evangelical churches and their aggressive proselytisation remain a source of anxiety within the influential orthodox church but the greatest threat to religious harmony stems from ethnic conflict inter communal violence in troubled pockets of the country in the last one year exacerbated religious tensions and triggered attacks on mosques and churches islam in transition in sudan the controversial intervention in sudan s transition in recent weeks by gulf actors principally uae and the kingdom of saudi arabia ostensibly aimed at preventing the muslim brotherhood from staging a comeback is both ill advised and dangerous first there isn t the kind of cohesive highly organised islamist opposition able to single handedly gain dominance second the tmc cannot be a guarantor of long term stability nor can it serve as an effective bulwark against islamism third and assuming they cared to look deeper at the uprising and the social political trends they would have realised the depth of disillusionment with islamist politics and generally with all traditional politics and parties finally the saudi emirati axis s meddling alienates huge segments of society and is counter productive to their twin strategic goals maintaining sudanese troops in yemen and isolating the muslim brotherhood a striking feature of sudan s protest movement is the near total absence of islamist slogans and the emergence of more assertive youthful female activists keen to raise their visibility to subvert the strict dress code and to claw back their huquq al mar a al maqsub usurped fundamental rights of women the language and tone of discourse is deliberately non confessional these two complementary dynamics lend a mildly secular character to the uprising for the first time in three decades islam is no longer a contentious subject for sudan s youth but we ought to be careful in not drawing hasty conclusions more importantly we must avoid using the binary secular religious mindset as a prism to analyse events in sudan that the battle over sudan s future is being waged over traditional secular issues liberty justice and bread and butter issues is emblematic not so much of a society that is becoming secular but one deeply disillusioned with the brand of islam advocated by hassan al turabi and enforced by al bashir for three decades sudan s youth are rejecting the politicised islam that underpinned al bashir s quasi islamic state and the stifling social conservatism fostered by its intrusive policies put differently what we are seeing in sudan is the early sign of a society that is self correcting seeking both to restore health to islam and return it to its traditional orbit sphere it is not yet clear who the secularists are in sudan s transition no group has so far articulated what one might call a clear secular agenda it is conceivable that some in the protest movement such as traditional left leaning parties that played a big role in the protests and even elements in the tmc opposed to islamism may make common cause and lock out islamists from the transition whether all these diverse anti islamist stakeholders can agree on a common strategy to address the issue of islam and the state is hard to tell an aggressive enclavement strategy that criminalises islamism and locks out islamists is certain to prove hugely destabilising it risks driving islamists underground and is bound to incubate the same toxic type of militancy and violence familiar in many parts of the muslim world sudan s best hope to achieve a viable and sustainable transition lies in a policy of accommodation that is genuinely inclusive islamist parties are predominantly moderate and including them in the tent has the potential to lock them into the broader reform process to temper their politics and to progressively isolate the more militant groups
by brandon smith times of great political and social crisis can almost always be linked back to a common root cause false paradigms there are many people out there who have no clue what this phrase means just as they have no clue what the phrase controlled opposition means some of these people are new activists to the liberty movement who recently joined because of the fervor of the trump presidential campaign they think the world of sovereignty and nationalism revolves around trump because frankly they have been duped by a false paradigm themselves false paradigms are a base tactic of what is known as 4th generation warfare the purpose of 4th gen warfare is described in the document from psyop to mindwar a document circulated within the dod by the 7th psychological operations group and written by now former general paul vallely spelled valley in the document and now former lt colonel michael aquino a self professed satanist believe it or not i recommend it as a means to understand how globalists tend to think how they use division to conquer populations and to come to terms with the fact that these people are not held in check by empathy morality or reason as far as 4th gen warfare is concerned mindwar describes a method of psychological manipulation and propaganda used by governments and militaries as a means to turn a target population against itself the goal is to win a war against a group of people by causing them to destroy each other so that the government does not have to combat them directly false paradigms are a premier tool for pursuing this outcome they are achieved by dividing a population through false leadership fake and sometimes real outside threats as well as manufactured crisis events globalist institutions and the political puppets they control use false paradigms as a means to distract the public away from their criminal endeavors while we are focused on the political left or the political right or the russians or the iranians or the chinese they are exploiting our fear and doubt to gain more centralization and more power for globalists the great prize is of course open global economic management rather than covert management a one world currency and cashless society as well global government they want a veritable worldwide feudal plantation state and they want the masses to embrace it willingly or perhaps even beg for it to obtain this prize they will need a considerable economic disaster the us economy and the dollar would have to be undermined for americans would not consent to global governance as long as our society remains relatively affluent and comfortable but how is this being accomplished by the elites and what does the trade war have to do with their plans global banking elites and the controlled demolition of the us i have been writing extensively on the controlled demolition of the us economy for some time now in january of 2018 i predicted in my article party while you can central bank ready to pop the everything bubble that jerome powell and the federal reserve would pursue policy tightening and would continue until the bubble in fundamentals corporate debt consumer debt housing retail stock markets etc collapsed so far i have been proven correct the fundamentals are plunging and only stock markets remain in the 2nd quarter of 2019 the fed is still cutting assets exponentially from its balance sheet and still refuses to pull interest rates back from their neutral rate of inflation despite the predictions of many in the mainstream and alternative media the fed has used the tactic of addictive stimulus measures and artificially low interest rates to create massive financial bubbles in the past and they almost always use tightening policies in times of economic weakness to deliberately pop those bubbles for example this is exactly what happened at the onset of the great depression as former fed chairman ben bernanke openly admitted in 2002 in an address in honor of milton friedman in short according to friedman and schwartz because of institutional changes and misguided doctrines the banking panics of the great contraction were much more severe and widespread than would have normally occurred during a downturn let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the federal reserve i would like to say to milton and anna regarding the great depression you re right we did it we re very sorry but thanks to you we won t do it again and yet it is happening again today as the economy nosedives banking institutions buy up more hard assets and consolidate more power and each time global economic management is suggested as a possible solution to the very crisis they created my question has never been will there be a crash a crash of the us is mathematically inevitable it is happening now in accelerated fashion and has been progressing in various ways since 2008 instead my question has always been how do the globalists plan to get away with it in my article trump trade wars a perfect smokescreen for a market crash published in march 2018 i outlined exactly how they plan to get away with it in that article i examined the strange number of similarities in policy and politics between donald trump and herbert hoover including the use of large scale tariffs right before the collapse of the us financial system while it was the federal reserve s interest rate increases into weakness that exacerbated and prolonged the great depression for many years it was herbert hoover s policies and sometimes the gold standard that were blamed for the crash in other words donald trump is following almost the exact same path as herbert hoover and trump s trade war with china is being used by the banking elites as cover for their sabotage of the us economy in the end it will be trump and all of his populist followers that will get the blame for the destabilization of our financial structure the central bankers have a perfect scapegoat trump and the false left right paradigm but how could the banking elites and globalists possibly predict trump s behavior in order to take advantage of it well if you look at trump s background as well as the number of elites he has placed within his own cabinet the reality if the situation becomes clear trump is a puppet and always has been in my article trump is a pied piper for the new world order i outlined trump s history with the banking elites including his relationship with rothschild banking agent wilber ross who bailed trump out of his debts and saved him from the effects of bankruptcy in the 1990 s trump s biggest campaign promise in 2016 was to drain the swamp in washington d c of the financial elitists and globalists that hillary clinton was so closely tied to but when he entered the white house he made wilber ross his secretary of commerce hired on goldman sachs goons like steven mnuchin and gary cohn and he has brought warmongering psychopathic think tank members like john bolton and mike pompeo into his cabinet the globalists don t have to predict trump s behavior they dictate trump s behavior thus the false left right paradigm reigns supreme once again the same paradigm many trump followers thought they were escaping by rallying against a clinton presidency current trump cheerleaders completely ignore this fact however i have not seen a single one of them confront the issue of trump s cabinet or his associations with the rothschilds they either ignore it outright or they claim trump is keeping his enemies close or using their expertise to free america this is insanity but it showcases the power that false paradigms have conservatives were so afraid of clinton that they jumped on the bandwagon of trump s controlled opposition administration and they refuse to admit they have been conned we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us how have globalists benefited from trump being in the white house though trump has gone on to attach his presidency so closely to the performance of the economy and primarily stock markets that any crash now will undoubtedly be blamed on him this is strange behavior if you consider his statements during his campaign including his assertion that the fed was deliberately keeping interest rates low to protect obama and that the stock market was a giant fraudulent bubble today trump is demanding that the fed funds rate be lowered and that stimulus be renewed and he has been tweeting incessantly about how the economy under his watch is the greatest ever to those who actually track the health of the us economy trump s statements might seem delusional if you understand that trump is controlled opposition and that he is playing the scripted role of a bumbling villain his statements make perfect sense the us economy is not the greatest it has ever been in fact it is the worst it has been since the crash of 2008 as i evidenced in detail in my article the crash in us economic fundamentals is accelerating trump is wrapping himself around the implosion of the everything bubble as a mascot of fiscal destruction and he s trying to drag all conservatives with him china and the false east west paradigm the other side of the control mechanism for a crash of this magnitude is on the other side of the world china it is not only trump that has to act a certain way in order to cover for the crash of the everything bubble china must also play its role the false east west paradigm is perhaps the most pervasive of all false paradigms for even many in the liberty movement think that governments in china or russia are opposed to the elites in the us and europe this is simply not true china in particular has a long time relationship with western globalists in fact modern china was essentially built by them the rockefeller family and the rockefeller foundation have been influencing chinese social and political developments since the late 1800 s this started as seemingly innocuous with the foundation initiating social and health related programs in rural areas but as noted by historians with access to the rockefeller archives the rockefellers were not seeking to display their capacity for philanthropic charity but pursuing wide reaching influence in chinese society and politics for more information i highly recommend reading frank ninkovich s study of the rockefeller s dominance in china for the past century in the journal of american history china s central bank is currently linked to the bank for international settlements which is often referred to as the central bank of central banks and as admitted in an article for harpers in 1983 the bis essentially writes policy for all member banks this means the chinese central bank and the federal reserve are both controlled by the globalists at the bis this is even more evident in recent years as all major central banks have operated with an odd level of coordination to prop up the stock markets of other nations including stock markets of nations that are supposedly in conflict china also now works closely with the imf the yuan has been inducted into the sdr basket system and china has called on multiple occasions for the sdr basket to replace the us dollar as the world reserve structure the imf is openly discussing the introduction of a cashless digital currency system based on blockchain technology which i believe will be the likely replacement for all currencies when the time comes this means the trade war is a farce when it comes to the elites of china and the us there is no division and no conflict they all want the same thing global centralization the trade war smokescreen for many years i have warned that the next world war would be an economic world war between the east and west and that this war would be engineered by globalists as a mass distraction while they introduced their one world economic system the crux of that economic war would be the eventual dumping of us treasuries by foreign central banks as well as the dollar as the world reserve currency what many pro trade war people don t seem to realize is that the dollar s world reserve status was part of the original deal with china china gained a trade surplus and access to us markets the us gained a cheap labor pool access to cheap goods and our currency was accepted by the chinese as the foundation of international trade but this dynamic no longer serves globalist interests in the new system they hope to create as described in an article published in the rothschild run magazine the economist in 1988 the us economy has to be brought down to pave the way for the new global currency system globalist mohamed el erian confirmed this plan in a 2017 op ed for the guardian and as globalist george soros stated in 2009 china is intended to take a larger role in the imf and become the economic engine for the new world order while the us is set to take a back seat in global affairs as the rest of the world moves away from the dollar this might be why us 10 year treasury auctions are seeing dismal results and why the chinese are now willing to threaten the dumping of us t bonds through their state run media china has not folded to us tariffs as so many people have been predicting for the past year in fact china has dug in even further china is the number one exporter importer in the world they now set the standard for international trade not the us if china follows through on threats to dump us treasuries or if they dump the dollar as the world reserve then most if not all of their trading partners will do the same the consequences would be devastating for the us economy which has a minimal manufacturing base and is utterly reliant on the international acceptance of the dollar to keep prices low and to prop up what s left of our financial structure while proponents of the trade war keep insisting that manufacturing will come back to the us this still has not materialized why would corporations spend all the money to rebuild factories in the us when they can simply stay in asia and use the existing factories and cheap labor there is no incentive for them to come back if tariffs go higher they can easily raise prices on consumers to support their bottom line the us is being set up for a spectacular fall those that claim china would never make such a move don t understand the chinese economy the us market is only 18 of chinese exports and us consumption has been declining the vast majority of china s gdp comes from domestic consumption and the claim that china is dependent on us markets to survive is one of the most widely perpetuated lies of the past decade the chinese will take a hit to their economy certainly but nowhere near the hit the us economy will take if they cut off the dollar as the primary trade mechanism the trade war only makes sense if you look at it from the globalist perspective china will get hurt to an extent the us will suffer an economic disaster it will never recover from and only the globalists truly benefit with tensions increasing probably through the end of 2019 i suspect the federal reserve will increase cuts to their balance sheet under cover of the trade war i also suspect that china s central bank will finally cut off stimulus measures which have been keeping global stocks afloat for the past four months this will eventually trigger the crash of markets on top of already plunging fundamentals the us will lose the trade war trump and conservatives will be blamed for the collapse china will already be pre positioned as the next economic engine for the world and the imf and bis will introduce their one world currency system as the solution to the problem they created whether or not they succeed in this plan will greatly depend on whether or not enough people set aside their biases and accept that the whole thing was a farce from the very beginning

government and how does it compare to the previous one these numbers have lost so much credibility i have no way of checking them and am not going to get into a debate about reading the tea leaves this is the tragedy of constantly revising data there are changes in definition and revisions but it somehow always seems that the growth in a particular year went up this process needs to stop no number is perfect but constantly tweaking the process where there is a potential for political interference does damage it creates suspicion about the quality of data you were one of the 108 signatories to a letter that red flagged data suppression and interference in data estimation by the current government have you witnessed government interference of this nature before and what must be done to resolve the matter there must be a committee of experts that has credibility to propose a stable methodology that can then be back cast say for a decade to reconstruct consistent gdp series for those years even in china there are are similar claims about data manipulation especially at the provincial level and there are many people there who are suspicious of the data i believe that some chinese government officials have even suggested that they look at non government numbers they seem be more open to this than we are in india there have long been discussions on why the gdp data is collected in a particular way or why the government does not invest more in the national sample survey it may be more true now that people are questioning political motives than before but the idea that the data collection agencies have failed is not new earlier the release of data was not so frequent and if there was clear opposition to the government s numbers the government had a set of experts who were established as being objective so it was a bit more process driven currently the niti aayog comes up with one number after the other whenever it wants when i speak to people in the financial world they say that they don t pay any attention to government data anymore we must invest money and effort to bring in experts from india and abroad and establish a process which is without interference and stick to it without any fiddling for say the next decade recently with reference to unemployment you wrote something will need to be done and it will probably eventually take the shape of a minimum income guarantee the congress has proposed nyay and the bharatiya janata party government has started implementing pm kisan announced in budget 2019 to offer income support to small and marginal farmers there have been questions about the financial viability of both particularly nyay your comments financial viability is an issue there is a long term problem we face i think we are not taxing the economy enough if nyay is implemented it will add urgency but even without it we need a series of fiscal intervention i have been saying this long before nyay was discussed i think we are under taxed we need to bring down our interest rates and give some semblance of balance to our budgets this will involve figuring out the subsidies that need to be cut and taxes to be increased or risk going back to high inflation we cannot afford the interest rates we have our share of government debt in gdp has been going up since 2014 and creditworthiness will eventually be hurt we do not want to get into such problems so whether or not we have nyay we will have to solve the problem praveen chakravarty chairperson of the congress party s data analytics department mentioned in an interview that around 939 schemes excluding 11 core schemes will have to be reviewed for financial rationalisation if nyay were implemented manmohan singh former prime minister and economist said that no new taxes on the middle class would be required to fund nyay and that 1 2 to 1 5 of gross domestic product at the scheme s peak would be needed do you agree i do not think there is going to be enough money from just cutting the minor schemes but i do agree that schemes should be reviewed and many should be shut down there is money there which can be utilised both taxes and expenditure rationalisation are important i am all for more taxes on the rich maybe we can look at some version of a wealth tax there needs to be some thought on how much the wealthy population can be taxed have you made an assessment of the schemes that can be shut down to facilitate nyay the right way to think about nyay is that it is the opening step in creating an infrastructure for making money transfers possible rather than an entitlement for a particular good it is better to give people cash than a fertiliser subsidy or free power however the first step has to be to convince people that the subsidy delivery mechanism works this is what nyay can do so the major subsidy schemes cannot be removed before nyay is well established and in the short run there will definitely be some fiscal pressure you were consulted by the congress for nyay what sort of inputs did you provide how will a government go about targeting the poorest given that poverty data has not been collected since 2011 12 i think the hardest group to target would be those who are a bit further up beyond the bottom 20 the poorest 20 are relatively easy to identify and if they are willing to be inclusive even if it includes up to 22 25 the targeting should be not too bad in our research we find that there is relative agreement on who the poorest are even within villages so it should be possible to combine an updated version of the socio economic and caste census and some local community review mechanisms to come up with a targeting procedure it may not be perfect but the scheme has to be run in a way to ensure that the associated infrastructure works and people do not get excluded for random reasons i was consulted on matters relating to estimating beneficiaries for the scheme considering that exact numbers or data are not available economic inequality is high in india the nine richest indians now own wealth equivalent to the bottom 50 nearly 50 of the population is dependent on agriculture that contributes 14 of the gdp rural distress is a major issue what are the solutions is moving people out of agriculture the only viable alternative we do not have the urban infrastructure to move everybody out of agriculture it may be true that around 50 are dependent on agriculture but the share of their incomes from agriculture is actually less than 50 many people in agriculture have other jobs to supplement their incomes which often involve temporary migration to cities one of the things governments can do is to create low cost spaces for migrants to live in so that it is more viable to work in urban areas but this is unlikely to be a very big part of the story in the short run my prediction is that we will move towards cash transfer as many of these lives are only marginally viable especially among the younger more educated generation that does not want to do the same jobs or have the same lifestyles as their parents did we have this political problem that needs to be solved in a march 2019 paper you along with thomas piketty and amory gethin noted that voters seem to be less driven by straightforward economic interests than by sectarian interests and cultural priorities worldwide we have seen a rise in populist leaders is this trend a major worry for india given that the rise of religious divisions and the persistence of strong caste based cleavages is determining voters choices while education income and occupation play little role controlling for caste there should be more politics based on economic interests because those are aspects that we can deliver on without creating social divisions if voters come to believe that the state cannot offer anything useful in terms of economic benefits then they will be responsive to sectarian claims if people start caring about only sectarian issues then parties have an incentive to promote it and then we will end up in a totally fractured polity the advantage of economic interests is that they can often be addressed whereas sectarian interests cannot be addressed other than saying that we will hurt those others which is frightening the criteria for 10 reservation for economically weaker sections announced by the bjp government allows a majority of households to qualify how do you assess this reservation policy and what are the political and economic implications that you foresee this policy won t do anything people from upper castes with an annual income less than rs 8 lakh are a huge part of the population and they are already getting more than 10 of the jobs other than as a political gesture it will have no consequences almost four fifth rs 5 5 lakh crore or 79 51 billion of the total amount of corporate bad loans written off in the last 10 years was during the five years after april 2014 noted an april 2019 report in the indian express nearly rs 1 5 lakh crore was during the nine months ending december 2018 farm loan waivers have received much criticism as a populist measure while such corporate write offs do not seem to how do you explain the problem of non performing assets and write offs and its implications on the economy the public sees it asymmetrically because one happens quietly while the other does not the media must put the spotlight on such write offs for corporates of course there may not be much of an option now given that the banking system has frozen up under the burden of debt and is unable to deliver the issue is more that the wrongdoers get away with it corporate interests are protected by layers of law which are in their favour the poor farmer mortgages land and loses it when unable to repay loans farmers are vulnerable whereas it is hard to hold corporations accountable a corporation can go bankrupt without the controlling individuals

trump s tariff war with china what happens to american labour donald trump voiced the real concerns of many americans when he spoke of the need to bring jobs to communities and to end unfair trade deals by blocking the trans pacific partnership pushing a re negotiation of nafta and increasing tariffs on a range of imports trump has appeared to finally take seriously the needs of unemployed and underemployed workers some unions have been calling for tariffs for years most notably the united steelworkers while obama ran in 2008 on a promise to renegotiate nafta he never did so and in fact became a relentless proponent of expanding free trade so is trump the worker s hero will increased tariffs return jobs to the u s the left has been weak on this issue on the one hand we need to take economic development and job creation seriously workers are suffering even though official unemployment rates are low more and more of the jobs people hold are low wage insecure non union and dead end the left lacks a real program to address the real concerns of those impacted by trade deals we need to better understand the history of tariffs and trade and we need an international vision for economic development most rich countries have used import tariffs as a way to develop their own industries alexander hamilton argued in the late 1700s for using tariffs to develop infant industries until they grew large enough to compete in a global market in general the idea was to allow raw materials in at a lower tax the import tariff on intermediate or finished goods was much higher this allowed manufacturers to import cheap inputs from other countries and then manufacture the items domestically most of the profit in a good comes in the production stage the goal for countries is to be able to move up the economic ladder where they can go from raw material exporters at low profit rates to finished goods exporters at much higher profit rates marx explained this process through the concept of socially necessary labour time or the average amount of labour time needed for a worker to produce a good for exchange there is relatively little labour time needed to harvest a peanut and more labour time needed to manufacture peanut butter marx explained this process through the concept of socially necessary labour time or the average amount of labour time needed for a worker to produce a good for exchange the united states relied heavily on high import tariffs on a range of goods for many decades according to the economist ha joon chang the u s had some of the highest tariffs in the world from 1816 to 1945 this can of course create strong tensions between different sections of the ruling class for example southern plantation owners wanted low tariffs so that they could easily export raw cotton and import manufactured goods northern manufacturers wanted high tariffs on manufactured imports but tariffs were not the only tool governments used chang points out that every rich country became rich by using a range of government interventions tariffs are just one tool other tools include direct subsidies to firms public investment in infrastructure that allows industries to develop and transport goods public investment in research and development public schools to train workers financial regulations banking systems to generate savings available for investment nationalization of industries and more governments have also used more insidious tools to develop their economies including war colonization industrial espionage and the trade in human beings forced into slave labour many economists from a range of perspectives have argued that the world as a whole benefits from free trade the idea that countries should be able to exchange goods and services without tariffs or other disincentives or barriers the free trade school of thought has dominated economics since wwii the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt was established just after wwii as a diplomatic forum where states could meet and agree to reduce tariffs in 1995 the world trade organization wto was formed with a mandate to govern the rules of trade between states with the goal of ensuring that trade flows as smoothly predictably and freely as possible alongside the wto countries signed free trade agreements and bilateral or multilateral investment treaties designed to reduce tariffs further and particularly to reduce other barriers to trade the u s signed its first free trade agreement in 1985 with israel and has since signed bilateral or multilateral agreements with 19 other countries the u s now has a highly complex tariff schedule there are three different rates of duty the general rate a special for free trade or generalized system of preference partners and a third rate that applies to cuba and north korea some products are free there is no import tariff fresh plantains for example can come in with no tariff even from cuba or north korea dried plantains however require some processing they have a 1 4 percent tariff for the general rate free for the special rate and 35 percent for our enemy countries chainsaw blades have a 7 2 percent general tariff free for the special rate and 60 percent otherwise meanwhile circular saw blades are free for the general and special rate and 25 percent otherwise all of this highlights the reality that tariffs are greatly influenced by political processes as much as economic ones employer associations powerful corporations members of congress unions and consumers have all lobbied to set tariff rates for each of the tens of thousands of products there is no other way to explain why tariff rates differ for forks versus spoons or for almonds versus pistachios versus pecans versus chestnuts another political consideration is how other countries respond to our tariffs if we raise tariffs on chinese steel china might raise tariffs on our wheat since the end of world war ii most western countries have agreed to keep tariffs low and avoid this sort of scenario in fact tariffs have been so low that free trade agreements haven t lowered them much the difference between say 1 4 percent and zero is trivial this raises the question why has there been so much uproar about free trade agreements since at least the battle of seattle in 1999 the answer is that modern free trade agreements aren t really about tariffs rather they re about loosening restrictions on flows of international investment which makes it easier for western companies to offshore jobs and hide their profits from the tax authorities trade agreements have also been about lowering non tariff barriers to trade these include things large sections of the population support such as environmental protections labor laws or licensing restrictions such as against genetically modified seeds many of these protections have been weakened or voided in the name of free trade but trump s stance on tariffs and trades appeals to workers who have lost their jobs and are looking for hope anywhere they can it also plays with some of his supporters who are motivated more by nationalism and racism than economic concerns so the fact that tariffs won t bring back many jobs doesn t matter to them and while tariffs are a real problem for some of the capitalist class not all are directly impacted and for all of trump s talk of nafta re negotiation his plans will leave the bigger problems with free trade unregulated cross border money flows and erosion of environmental and labour protections untouched tariffs are not the only economic development tool people may blame outsourcing or unfair trade but in fact there are many policy options available to us to try right now to create good jobs for example one argument for steel tariffs was based on national security but if security is really our concern it is a mistake to leave vital production of things like steel oil medicine and food in the hands of unaccountable private corporations create public entities that can do this there is a wide range of policy options that we could pursue to create jobs and to make bad jobs into better ones our demands must focus on ways to create jobs that also undercut the power of multi national corporations to pit workers against one another the principle must be job creation built on solidarity with other workers with workers in other industries and with workers overseas not competition people s world

1q 2019 financial results phosagro ceo andrey guryev said in 1q 2019 phosagro demonstrated a solid set of results with ebitda margin and fcf generation both growing despite challenging macro conditions recent weather conditions in the united states depressed fertilizer demand in the first quarter of 2019 leading to higher inventory levels which resulted in a 6 quarter on quarter decrease in dap prices thanks to phosagro s operational excellence and global sales reach our cash cost of production remained low and we were able to sell our impurity free products at the best netback prices i believe that this is a strong endorsement of the success of phosagro s strategy our sales strategy proved effective even amid market headwinds and it will remain a cornerstone of our organic growth in the future in 1q 2019 our domestic fertilizer sales remained flat year on year while sales in our priority export markets advanced by 8 year on year the strongest growth was in north america where phosphate sales increased by 25 year on year driven by the expectation of solid demand from agricultural producers additionally i would underscore our excellent free cash flow generation in the first quarter which was the highest in 8 years and helped bring phosagro s leverage to a two year low will enable the company to continue its generous dividend pay outs while continuing to implement our investment and social projects the board of directors has recommended distribution in the form of dividends almost 70 of adjusted net income in the amount of rub 9 3 billion or rub 24 per gdr looking at global markets we see key markets struggling to consume the high levels of inventories in the united states which is dragging prices down in response several fertilizer exporters announced production cuts for 1h 2019 the second quarter is a transitional period where the high season should start in the main agricultural markets helping to absorb inventories that remain due to slow demand in the first quarter from the united states 1q 2019 market conditions prices for dap fob tampa gradually softened in the course of 1q 2019 and averaged usd 400 per tonne almost flat year on year usually active in the first quarter european markets saw low demand for fertilizers due to the weak euro and low farmer purchasing power due to bad weather conditions in 2h 2018 the us market was the main driver of a fertilizer price correction throughout the winter the industry stockpiled fertilizers in expectation of seasonal demand but record flooding in the midwest at the end of 1q 2019 caused farmers to delay purchases in response mosaic announced a 300 kt cut in its phosphate production in the united states in order to balance the market the price correction was slightly offset by the indian market where distributors accelerated dap imports on the back of a relatively strong rupee against the us dollar soft dap prices and high maximum retail price prices for urea fob baltic were on a downward trajectory and averaged around usd 244 per tonne but remained 8 higher year on year primarily driven by slow demand recovery in the united states and europe ammonia fob baltic prices declined by 7 year on year to average usd 276 per tonne on slow demand for nitrogen based fertilizers in europe impacted by last summer s heatwave and an unusually warm winter on top of that a price correction for natural gas in europe since october 2018 continued to exert pressure on ammonia prices prices for sulphur cfr china contracted by 11 year on year to usd 126 per tonne primarily driven by soft prices for phosphate based fertilizers changes in china s approach to purchasing sulphur also affected prices environmental reform in the country triggered a consolidation of sulphur consumers which prefer to import sulphur on quarterly contracts rather than buying from the spot market financial performance in 1q 2019 phosagro s revenue was up 32 year on year to rub 72 3 billion usd 1 1 billion driven by 5 year on year growth in fertilizer volumes and an 8 year on year increase in average realised prices in usd terms which were supported by 16 year on year rouble depreciation against the us dollar overall sales growth was due to the release of inventory accumulated in the last months of 2018 and relatively strong demand in the first months of 2019 revenue growth for 1q 2019 was partially offset by a 32 year on year decrease in an sales due to the early start of the high season in russia in 4q 2018 which is phosagro s main market for this product revenue by key products rub

materials and services rose by 21 year on year to rub 8 3 billion usd 126 million this was driven primarily by growth in expenses for materials by 20 year on year and higher transportation costs which rose by 22 year on year on higher volumes of phosphate rock shipments depreciation rose by 20 year on year to rub 5 7 billion usd 86 million as a result of growth in capitalised repairs and

for sulphur remained flat year on year costs for potash rose by 20 year on year to rub 2 7 billion usd 41 million due to a 35 year on year increase in purchase prices which was partially offset by 12

maintenance electricity costs increased by 18 year on year to rub 1 7 billion usd 26 million mainly due to growth in the purchase price by 22 year on year expenses on fuel rose by 49 year on year to rub 1 5 billion usd 23 million in response to the higher purchase prices up 23 year on year and higher consumption levels up 21 year on year costs for ammonia increased by 24 year on year to rub 1 4 billion usd 21 million due to the growth in sales volumes of map and nps produced at phosagro s balakovo site and an increase in the average purchasing price for ammonia up 6 year on year administrative expenses for 1q 2019 rose by 17 year on year to rub 4 0 billion usd 60 million primarily due to growth in salaries and social contributions by 25 year on year as the result of higher bonuses and management remuneration in 1q 2019 selling expenses increased by 21 year on year to rub 10 3 billion usd 155 million the main factors behind this growth were freight port and stevedoring expenses rose by 28 year on year to rub 5 3 billion usd 80 million due to a 12 year on year increase in export sales and growth in shipping rates this was also influenced by rouble devaluation as the majority of freight and stevedoring tariffs are still denominated in us dollars growth in costs for russian railways tariffs and operators fees by 9 year on year to rub 3 1 billion usd 47 million was driven by a change in shipment structures and indexation of railway tariffs spending on customs duties grew by 49 year on year to rub 700 million usd 11 million triggered by increased deliveries under ddp terms and rouble depreciation against the us dollar market outlook phosagro s outlook for phosphate based fertilizers in 2019 is neutral due to the following market conditions may begin to improve with the start of the high season in latin america which will likely enable the re export of fertilizers stockpiled in the united states an additional supportive factor will be the temporary shutdown of mosaic mines in brazil due to new environmental regulation india s imports of phosphate based fertilizers in the second quarter may be below last year s levels as local distributors accelerated dap stockpiling in the previous quarter the forecast for dap imports for 2019 will be subject to maximum retail price reduction the strong rupee and flat nutrient based subsidies high season for phosphate based fertilizers in phosagro s domestic russian market is expected in 2q and 3q the rate at which inventories in the usa and india decline chinese export volumes as well as progress on new capacities

n ot long ago there was a broad consensus that rich world governments had become too indebted how times change left wing politicians today say that governments need to spend freely to counter climate change and should not worry about borrowing more if necessary america s republicans who not long ago warned of imminent budgetary catastrophe have in office cut taxes enough to push the deficit above 4 of gdp despite a healthy economy economists meanwhile are locked in debate over whether much higher debt to gdp ratios might be sustainable see article listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element is lunch free after all changing attitudes to budget deficits are in part a backlash against the zealous fiscal rectitude that prevailed in much of the rich world after the financial crisis america began deep and indiscriminate spending cuts in 2013 after a commission failed to agree on alternative measures to contain its deficit britain has spent most of a decade chasing balanced budget targets that were postponed and then partly abandoned in the euro zone where currency union leaves countries much more vulnerable to debt crises austerity pushed greece into depression and germany s reluctance to loosen its purse strings has slowed europe s economic rebalancing with hindsight the horror of deficits looks overblown america will probably enter the next decade with a debt to gdp ratio seven percentage points higher than in 2013 but with long term interest rates roughly unchanged japan has gross debts of almost 240 of gdp without any sign of worry in bond or currency markets amazingly even greek three and five year bonds now yield only around 2 in the short term accurate judgments about fiscal firepower matter because deficits will be an important weapon in the fight against the next downturn central banks have little or no room to cut interest rates the potency of alternative monetary policy tools such as bond buying is still up for debate with few other options available a reluctance to use fiscal stimulus to fight a recession could be self defeating because a lack of growth imperils fiscal sustainability at least as much as deficits do in the long term low interest rates change the dynamics of debt if growth and inflation together exceed the interest rate existing debts shrink relative to gdp over time happily this condition holds in many places today in america it has been the historical norm the dollar s dominance of the global financial system results in a seemingly insatiable appetite for safe dollar denominated assets were the treasury to issue much more debt investors would scramble to buy it for the left especially those who want a green new deal to fight climate change this is a reason to cast aside worries about debt and focus on boosting spending for the right it is a reason to cut taxes today and shrink the government later both attitudes are dangerous throwing fiscal caution to the wind runs two risks the first is that it kills off debate over how to allocate scarce resources encouraging waste although debt funded investments may be desirable fiscal free for alls are not the rich world already faces huge upward pressure on health care and pension spending as societies age adding tax cuts and new spending programmes with their own constituencies to defend and expand them only makes the eventual necessary compromises harder to reach the second problem with disregarding deficits is that conditions change anyone who claims to know with certainty that interest rates will be low for decades to come has not learnt from history that economic paradigms eventually come to an end when rates rise heavily indebted countries will find that their budgets are under much greater pressure countries can mitigate interest rate risk by issuing debt at very long maturities today but indebted nations will always have less room to borrow afresh to fight future emergencies this applies even in america because the dollar s dominance is not guaranteed to last indefinitely over the course of this century it could be threatened by the yuan or even by the euro when the pound sterling lost its pre eminence in the early 1930s britain with a debt to gdp ratio in excess of 150 faced a currency crisis sometimes the risks of debt are worth running book balancing during downturns rarely pays off looked at from a global rather than national perspective climate change is more worrying than fiscal profligacy although a carbon tax could curb emissions while shrinking deficits but public debt is not costfree fiscal firepower is nice to have but more often than not it is wisest to keep the powder dry

lindrik thinkstock the u s federal reserve s tightening last year had a significant impact on emerging economies last year as people worried about the fed tightening liquidity a number of currencies and economies started to slow dramatically said michael reynal chief investment officer and portfolio manager at sophus capital in des moines iowa in an april 12 interview the argentine peso fell by 50 in 2018 reynal said and it wasn t alone the turkish lira fell by 28 the russian ruble by 17 the brazilian real by 14 and the south african rand by 13 5 these are all indicators of countries struggling with debt and whose currencies had to suffer to help rebalance their capital and current accounts said reynal whose firm sub advises the renaissance emerging markets fund so what does the fed s current pause mean for emerging markets once those currencies devalue however competitiveness kicks in in other words the argentine cost is 50 below what it was before the devaluation in the current calmer environment he said countries that have suffered devaluation have limited downside and a more positive outlook for 2019 we re looking more favourably at south africa and brazil for example said reynal the south african rand has fluctuated from us 0 081 a year ago to us 0 070 this month further annual inflation in south africa has been on the rise this year increasing to 4 5 in march though it remains below its november 2018 peak of 5 2 in brazil one real has fluctuated between us 0 28 a year ago and us 0 25 this month meanwhile inflation increased to 4 94 inapril up from 3 89 in february cpi was also up to 4 7 which is 0 8 higher than february reynal is also positive on russia the country remains one of the largest global oil exporters he explained and after dipping at the end of 2018 the price of oil has rallied this year west texas intermediate went from us 45 41 per barrel on dec 31 2018 to us 66 30 on april 23 before dropping slightly in recent weeks also reynal said the russian government is stable and the ruble is cheap and competitive a year ago the ruble cost us 0 016 and while it s seen minor fluctuations it was at us 0 015 this month reynal is still worried about turkey from a political perspective we re less worried than we were previously from an economic and capital perspective the turkish lira is trading at a discount today us 0 16 compared to the us 0 24 rate a year ago meanwhile turkey s annual inflation rate was 19 5 in april declining since it surpassed 25 in september finally reynal remains concerned about the political situation in argentina with an election in october we re staying clear for now but we know the argentine market is extremely cheap and we re looking for signals for stabilization at the political level the argentine peso has continued to decline it s trading at us0 022 compared to us 0 044 a year ago further the inflation rate continues to climb in april 2018 inflation was 25 6 as of march 2019 it hit 54 7 overall reynal said the fed s potential loosening or more stable outlook in 2019 and 2020 means he s looking at some of these riskier markets with more interest this article is part of the advisortogo program powered by cibc it was written without input from the sponsor
16 05 2019 at what cost to humanity capitalism s terminal crisis cannot be resolved positively without a powerful left says rex dunn today we find ourselves in a conjuncture which is unique in human history this is a reflection of capitalism in terminal crisis thanks to its internal contradictions which are unresolvable in addition this has led to an existential crisis for humanity itself ie the real possibility of an ecological catastrophe meanwhile bourgeois democracy is becoming more authoritarian not only is it dependent on the decisions of a managerial bureaucracy the world trade organisation international monetary fund etc which direct the political elites at the national level such as the federal reserve bank the congressional lobby industry and the politicians themselves but now these institutions are being challenged by the us president and his cabinet as the virtually unaccountable executive of the world s hegemon trump and his team are beginning to act in their own interests even when they contradict those of america s traditional allies the world is becoming more unstable and there is rising inequality everywhere especially in africa parts of the middle east and asia this is being exacerbated by wars and ecological devastation the burning of fossil fuels shows no sign of slowing down alongside new green energy we have the development of the fracking industry especially in the united states which today is self sufficient in fossil fuels add to this the destruction of the rainforests desertification acidification of the oceans three fifths of the earth s surface loss of habitats and the possibility of another mass extinction including many species upon which civilisation depends this does not mean that all life is about to become extinct rather as marx pointed out a long time ago the productive forces under the system of private property a one sided development only for the majority they become destructive forces 1 in geological terms we have entered the capitalocene epoch which within a short time is moving towards capitalist ecocide we are already living in a world where there is a scarcity of natural resources upon which the many depend for their very existence alongside this we see an abundance of technology which is controlled by the few as a means to enrich themselves further populism yet the consciousness of the masses is at an all time low instead of developing what marx called the consciousness of the need for a fundamental revolution we have the rise of rightwing populism in the united states this led to trump s victory in the 2016 presidential election he won by repeating the mantra make america great again and continues to do so he uses crude sensationalism such as this as a means to stir up old style national chauvinism in a new form nostalgia for the way we were he is supported in this by millions of self employed people blue collar workers women as well as men even a few black voters despite the fact that he is a racist and a misogynistic bully not just a demagogue but a megalomaniac as well the most powerful man in the world also conducts the affairs of state via twitter no one would have believed this before trump came along so far his only major achievement has been a massive tax cut for the rich whilst ordering an equivalent increase in america s defence budget therefore the us debt which already amounts to trillions of dollars will jump even higher yet given its huge surplus china acts as creditor to the us even though the latter is gearing up for a possible war against its rival otherwise the dollar upon which world trade depends might collapse meanwhile the masses continue to swallow the hype that trump has created millions of new jobs but many of these are in the self employed sector which will go bust come the next downturn the rest are low paid jobs based on zero hour contracts trump s core support also includes millions of evangelical christians they believe that the president is an instrument of god s will who will bring about armageddon in the holy land as a precursor to christ s second coming followed by the rapture his vice president is an evangelical christian so is his secretary of state it is hard to believe that such an insane ideology is being used to drive american foreign policy on the other hand it dovetails neatly with the hegemon s geopolitical interests recently trump gave zionist israel a colonialist settler state and outrider for american imperialism in the middle east the green light to complete the dispossession of the palestinian people trump has already flagged this up as the deal of the century at the same time he is stirring up a possible war with iran wherein israel will play a proxy role 2 after all the us has to demonstrate its hegemonic status to the world it is a demonstration of who s boss especially to china it also acts as a riposte to the latter s development of a new high tech system to boost internet technology not forgetting its new trade policy ie beijing s belt and road initiative but the bottom line is the fact that the us economy is still driven by military keynesianism which it prefers to any keynesian green new deal this has been the default position of the us ever since dwight d eisenhower embraced the military industrial complex during the cold war so the democrats are unlikely to buck the trend therefore despite the breakdown of neoliberal economics in short austerity on the one hand and rising inequality on the other trump was able to win the support of the so called left behinds because their living standards have fallen in real terms his core support is holding up well and come the next presidential election in 2020 there is every possibility he will make inroads into the democrat s core base as well apart from make america great again he has also been able to tap into a rising tide of anti immigrant sentiment which is worldwide whether it is a question of political refugees or economic migrants thus rightwing populism is poised to become mainstream if that happens neoliberalism and the democrats will be fatally destabilised even though trump has appropriated the basic elements of their economic agenda on the other hand he is implacably opposed to neoliberalism s social agenda identity politics therefore bipartisan politics itself is under threat meanwhile bourgeois as well as marxist economists predict there will be another financial crash in the next period which will be worse than 2008 yet the managerial bureaucracy is reluctant to abandon neoliberal economics in favour of a neo keynesian green new deal gnd even though this would provide new technologies to create new jobs as well as tackle the climate crisis instead aided and abetted by trump neoliberalism continues to destroy people s lives by means of the free market globalisation outsourcing of investments low wages welfare cuts and permanent austerity rather than face up to the challenge the democratic party pinned its hopes on the mueller enquiry into trump s alleged misconduct but when this came up with nothing the leadership appeared to be nonplussed this is because the democrats are tied to corporate america most likely they will choose jo biden to challenge trump in a year s time but like hillary clinton before him biden s first priority is to prop up finance capital along with the super rich or the 1 therefore the democrats have nothing to offer the working class other than a vague promise to raise the minimum wage and defend medicare but don t hold your breath on the other hand if the democrats are to have any chance of winning in 2020 they would have to opt for a green new deal alternative but unlike franklin d roosevelt in the 1930s they are incapable of doing that if they do lose it will be because they are unable to offer a real alternative to the american working class it is a case of paralysis versus regression which is indicative of the decline of capitalism itself under these circumstances as long as nature is ruled by some blind power ie the market the world is becoming increasingly irrational otherwise how do we explain the trump phenomenon as one critic said if we were living in a sane world then trump would lose by a landslide even if he was running against a potted plant on the other hand whilst it does have a sane agenda such as a commitment to a gnd the tiny american left is unable to break out of its isolation it has nothing to offer the working class either because it is tied to the apron strings of the democratic party despite the fact that the latter remains wedded to neoliberalism that is why traditional ideologies such as sexism xenophobia racism anti semitism and nationalism continue to grow but now thanks to neoliberalism and its social agenda these reactionary ideas find expression in a new ideological form identitarian politics which focuses on group identity rather than class issues hence we have fragmentation and social disintegration paradoxically whilst alienation has been compartmentalised in this way it is still able to spread itself across the political spectrum from left liberalism to the fascist right from bourgeois feminism the me too movement and lgbt wherein gays and the supporters of gender ideology are fighting each other to white supremacy angry white men who want to save the white race from the muslim invasion along with its mirror opposite islamist jihadists save islam from the crusader christians hence we are seeing an increase in terrorist outrages carried out by the far right white supremacists on the one side and islamist extremists on the other in a deadly tit for tat struggle the christchurch massacre and the bombings in sri lanka are just the latest examples automation and artificial intelligence will continue to be used to create unnecessary wants or for destructive ends eg driverless cars surveillance capitalism and war not to shorten the hours of work therefore given the absence of a real alternative the direction of movement for the mass of humanity is further to the right but what about the extinction rebellion against the threat of an ecological catastrophe at last we have a climate change movement which cannot be ignored but it had to be kick started by schoolchildren who feel betrayed by their parents generation at least they are aware that there is no planet b but this movement like the occupy movement before it is likely to fade away unless the working class decides to support it but the latter is fragmented by identitarian politics dictatorship apart from another financial crash political economists are also predicting that the trade war between trump and china will deepen because china is fighting back a combination of trump s tax cuts and tariffs which is already raising prices could trigger a new slump if that happens another dose of austerity will not be sufficient there will have to be a shift towards a more authoritarian form of democracy in the united states things are already deeply corrupted by the corporate lobby perhaps the next step will be a one party state to match that of china trump has already tweeted that he is entitled to an extra two years in office because the mueller enquiry hampered his promise to make america great again come the 2020 election all he has to do is win control of both houses of congress he already has control of the supreme court cue a trump dynasty and an elected dictatorship but the problem for trumpism is the free market model itself which is beginning to falter therefore a move towards something like china s top down state regulated model of future capitalism is possible if not probable trump is not just one of the most maverick presidents in the history of the united states we could be witnessing the start of capitalism s necessary transition to a new form but without the consciousness of a need to renew the social revolution the foundations for this have already been laid there is already a tendency to impose a scarcity of resources on the many in order to ensure that there will be an abundance of riches for the few but in order to be completely successful this will require a policy of exterminism for anyone who is surplus to requirements in this regard the war in the yemen which is backed by trump offers a template for the future thus the chances of achieving socialism are becoming even more remote yet this is a necessary precondition for the true realm of freedom which according to marx is the final form or condition towards which man as a species being is supposed to be developing capitalism is coming to an end but how will it end what will be the cost to humanity and the rest of the planet notes
beijing bloomberg united states president donald trump s call for the federal reserve to mirror its chinese counterpart misses the mark because beijing s main defence against trade war fallout will come from the finance ministry not the central bank if tariffs begin to really hurt china s growth this year there s plenty of direct fiscal firepower left to stoke the economy before the people s bank of china pboc would have to cut interest rates data released on wednesday may 15 showed an across the board slowdown in april central and local authorities in china have at least 25 1 trillion yuan s 5 trillion unspent in their budgets this year according to data compiled by bloomberg using official budget plans that s two trillion yuan more than the ammunition china had in the same period last year and about equivalent to the entire annual output of germany chinese leaders will be able to better utilise different kinds of policy tools than their us counterparts if the trade war persists and that s where china s confidence comes from said ms serena zhou an economist at mizuho securities asia in hong kong from monetary policy and fiscal policy to the dominant role of the state owned enterprises china s control on the economy is obviously stronger than the us she said indeed pboc governor yi gang has spent the past year saying he wants to avoid a flood of stimulus pushing back against expectations of benchmark interest rate cuts as he seeks to curb market bubbles and keep a lid on debt growth that said economists from morgan stanley and china international capital corporation cicc to macquarie securities expect further cuts to the proportion of deposits banks are forced to lock away as the authorities look to keep the credit taps flowing the authorities have ramped up fiscal expenditure earlier this year than they usually do with the most obvious front loading coming in infrastructure related areas such as transportation and environmental protection
this article is more than 4 years old chip somodevilla getty images what if the u s treasury department held a bond auction and nobody came this highly feared scenario one that would savage world markets leapt to mind last week as washington suffered its worst debt sale in a decade and if donald trump is looking to assign blame the u s president needn t stretch his imagination very far china the fingerprints of trump s favorite scapegoat for weak u s wages climate change you name it are all over the events of may 8 punters only submitted bids for 2 17 times the 27 billion of 10 year bonds the treasury sold that day it was quite the reality check for those who think demand for treasurys is limitless at its root is increasing awareness that beijing is buying fewer and fewer dollars japan too but china is america s top banker a status that shines a bright spotlight beijing s way yet some of the spotlight needs to be on trump s shaky stewardship of washington s remaining aaa credit ratings in other words china has very valid reasons to worry about the 1 12 trillion of state wealth it entrusted to the u s government here the 2009 and 2019 bookends deepen the plot the last time the u s held so ugly a bond auction was in march 2009 that was amid a post lehman crisis borrowing binge that spooked america s bankers in asia that year then chinese premier wen jiabao even resorted to public pleas we have made a huge amount of loans to the united states wen said of course we are concerned about the safety of our assets to be honest i am a little bit worried he urged the u s to honor its words stay a credible nation and ensure the safety of chinese assets wen looked prescient two years later when standard poor s yanked away america s aaa rating neither wen s successor li keqiang nor president xi jinping are taking chances quietly but clearly they are reducing their exposure to trump s america they re doing so stealthily because world markets would panic if washington s main financier abruptly pulled the plug lintao zhang getty images assets everywhere would plunge as the linchpin of the global financial system lost its main benefactor to be sure china s holdings are just a fraction of the roughly 22 trillion of outstanding american ious but china s purchases like those of japan taiwan singapore and south korea are thought to be automatic beijing after all has a chronic need for dollars as its own foreign debt load explodes this also traps officials in beijing and tokyo to some extent if peers got wind of the bloodbath to come they too would rush for the exits and intensify the selloff neither xi nor japan s shinzo abe relish the idea of explaining massive paper losses to their citizenry yet trump s erraticness is making the dollar a risky bet it s not just that he favors a weaker exchange rate it s that he s running fiscal policy with the same abandon with which he once bankrupted casinos trump s giant 2017 tax cut pumped 1 5 trillion of unneeded stimulus at an economy near full employment paying for it has washington now borrowing more than 1 trillion annually it also has him leaning on the federal reserve to go the way of argentina and ease with abandon in 2009 china s officials in beijing were losing sleep over a u s debt load below 10 trillion today it s well beyond double that level as trump eyes any number of spending increases ahead of the 2020 election on the military infrastructure additional tax cuts you name it china has even greater reason now to worry about trumpian losses as the u s taps the debt market ten years into a recovery in such conditions such issuance is unprecedented says louis gave of gavekal research worse still gave says the u s population is aging as growth in social security medicare and medicaid spending is set to structurally rise from 8 to 10 of gross domestic product to over 17 in the coming decades this is not the best time it follows to be curtailing immigration another top trump priority trump s answer to the risk of surging bond yields is a compliant fed two decades of pressuring the central bank to ease more and more hasn t served japan terribly well browbeating fed governor jerome powell to cut short term rates when unemployment is 3 6 may backfire traders might demand higher yields to compensate them for bad washington policies trump might consider going easier on his main banker instead he s ratcheting up his china trade war on may 10 he raised to 25 from 10 tariffs on some 200 billion of chinese goods trump may soon slap taxes on all mainland goods entering the u s more than 500 billion annually just ten days ago markets were buzzing about a bilateral u s china trade deal now the chatter concerns how beijing might retaliate to trump s actions that includes talk of what traders call the nuclear option of dumping treasurys it would be a pyrrhic victory at best any jump in u s rates might reduce american consumers demand for chinese goods beijing s need for economic resilience says michael hirson of eurasia group means that some forms of retaliation such as uncontrolled currency depreciation or selling u s treasurys which threaten blowback to china s economy are likely off the table for now but the option gives xi a powerful bargaining chip a highly dangerous one too as the events of june 1997 demonstrate then japanese prime minister ryutaro hashimoto was giving a rather dry speech in new york on tokyo washington relations until he admitted that several times in the past we have been tempted to sell large lots of u s treasurys to make a political point one such moment was during heated auto negotiations a few years earlier markets tanked everywhere since then u s government debt has only grown in scale and supremacy any risk off shift sends punters scurrying into treasurys even if it s trump s white house that is unnerving markets europe s multiyear debt travails undermine its utility as a safe haven while the yen often gets a bid in times of global trouble japanese government bonds are becoming less liquid as the central bank hoards them that leaves treasurys for better or worse at the center of an increasingly uncertain world order and it leaves china simultaneously with immense leverage over trump s america and immense exposure to its policy chaos if xi s government wanted to get trump s attention making a loud point about not financing his excesses fits the bill nicely

penafiel commented our operating netback declined in q1 19 due to a combination of lower market prices for oil and higher than normal operating costs caused primarily by work overs carried out during the quarter at our conventional noroeste basin assets we continue to expect the results of those workovers to drive improved results in q2 19 and beyond and we are very excited to report as previously announced that operations have begun on a multi well drilling program on the coiron amargo sur este block targeting the prolific vaca muerta shale with drilling and completion methods that are hoped to further optimize economics relative to previously drilled wells on the block we are also pleased to announce the approval of a 2 year extension on the curamhuele block that is in the condensate

curamhuele concession based on its proposal to drill one vertical well in a new location to vertically test vaca muerta and lower agrio formations on may 13 2019 the extension was approved by the minister of energy and natural resources for the province of neuquen which granted an additional twenty four months expiring march 9th 2021 for the exploratory period of the concession the company

source imgflip like many income investors the goal of my retirement portfolio where i keep 100 of my life savings is to maximize safe and growing income with no interest in yield traps companies that are likely to have to cut their payouts this is why over my five years as an investment analysts writer i ve honed my analytical risk models to focus on quality first and valuation including yield second today all my retirement portfolio investments and article recommendations are based on my three factor sensei quality score which looks at dividend safety business model and management quality the 11 point scale classifies companies with 8 or higher scores as blue chips and 9 or higher as swan stocks sleep well at night a very high quality blue chip i am only interested in buying level 8 or above quality dividend stocks though at times i ll point out level 7 dirty values buys like qualcomm was recently for more risk tolerant investors because i consider the margin of safety high enough in this article i wanted to highlight two deeply unpopular level 8 quality blue chip mlps energy transfer lp nyse et and mplx lp nyse mplx that the market is currently badly mispricing that s based on their fundamentals quality and long term growth outlook which should allow them to deliver very generous safe and growing income over time in all economic industry and market environments better yet with et and mplx lp about 29 and 31 undervalued respectively both 8 yielding blue chips are likely to deliver long term double digit total returns potentially up to 20 cagr over the next five to 10 years that means these mlp giants are potentially excellent buys today for anyone comfortable with their risk profiles and who doesn t mind that they use a k 1 tax form energy transfer lp nothing like the energy transfer of the past few years first i need to address the concerns that many investors have about energy transfer s payout safety that s courtesy of two stealth distribution cuts experienced by unitholders of its predecessor energy transfer partners both tied to mergers with other energy transfer run mlps as morningstar s travis miller explains the old energy transfer partners faced numerous liquidity concerns that made maintaining and growing its payout very challenging energy transfer partners faced a high debt burden and a risk of cutting its distribution to fund energy transfer equity s incentive distribution rights the combination eliminates those concerns and allows the company to pursue growth investments morningstar emphasis added the completion of the merger of the two mlps in october 2018 simplified energy transfer s corporate structure and eliminated its idrs lowered its cost of capital and created one of the strongest distribution coverage ratios in the mlp industry source energy transfer investor presentation source simply safe dividends energy transfer formerly energy transfer equity has never cut its distribution since its 2005 ipo kelcy warren the founder and ceo of the mlp directly owns over 40 million units paying him almost 50 million per year in tax deferred distributions according to morningstar s travis miller including indirect ownership via his stake in et s general partner which isn t publicly traded warren owns 31 of et giving him an immense incentive to keep the payout rock solid during all industry market economic conditions the first thing i look at with any dividend stock is the safety of the payout some investors who use simply safe dividends safety scores they are super conservative and have predicted 98 of dividend cuts since 2015 are a bit concerned about et s borderline safety rating company yield distribution coverage simply safe dividends safety score out of 100 sensei dividend safety score out of 5

sources simply safe dividends earnings release but there are two important things to note about that safety score the first is that as simply safe itself explains its issue with et s distribution safety isn t due to a lack of stable cash flow coverage but rather one debt metric in particular et s current net debt to capital ratio is 60 which is a reasonably safe level but is nearing the high side for mlps and could leave et with less flexibility to take on significantly more debt should the need arise simply safe dividends emphasis added according to csi marketing the average debt capital ratio for mlps is currently 57 simply safe s potential concern with et s debt is likely based on concerns over how the company s financial flexibility will fair during a future recession when credit conditions are likely to tighten see risk section however ssd where i m an analyst doesn t consider the payout unsafe overall et s dividend looks to be about as safe as the average company s while et is likely a source of reliable dividend income conservative investors often prefer to have most of their portfolios invested in companies whose dividends appear safer than average simply safe dividend emphasis added most likely energy transfer s biggest risks in terms of access low cost debt would come from its bbb credit rating which the mlp is working hard to improve via long term deleveraging that included a 4 21 billion debt exchange and 800 million in new preferred unit issuances in q1 that were used to pay down debt reduce interest costs and extend its average debt duration reducing long term interest rate risk company debt adjusted ebitda interest coverage ratio debt capital s p credit rating average interest cost energy transfer 4 4 4 7 60 bbb 5 0 safe level for mlps 5 0 or below 2 5 or above 60 or below bbb or higher below roic industry median 4 4 4 5 57 na click to enlarge sources simply safe dividends f a s t graphs gurufocus management guidance csi marketing the mlp s actual balance sheet is strong by industry norms and its borrowing costs are 5 1 which is reasonable given its returns on capital in the future management says it will maintain a long term leverage ratio of 4 0 to 4 5 far below the 5 0 credit rating agencies and bondholders consider safe that would likely be enough to deliver it an upgraded bbb credit rating and lower future costs of capital what s more energy transfer s distributable cash flow or dcf the mlp equivalent of free cash flow and what funds the payout grew 39 in q1 2019 dcf unit rose 34 that was both due to the et ete merger completed last year as well as numerous growth projects coming online sources earnings release motley fool for the full year management is guiding for 10 7 billion in adjusted ebitda representing about 12 5 yoy growth in cash flow roughly four times the growth rate analysts expect for the s p 500 this year in q1 2019 et courtesy of its booming cash flow and a lack of distribution growth due to management prioritizing deleveraging and self funding growth the distribution coverage ratio dcf distributions hit a record high of 2 07 that means the mlp is paying out just 48 of dcf one of the lowest payout ratios in the industry in q1 et retained 856 million in cash flow to fund its 5 billion growth spending plan for the year source et investor presentation four projects are currently slated for 2020 completion rounding out the committed backlog and ensuring at least 15 cash flow growth from today s levels by the end of next year et had previously been guiding for 2 5 billion to 3 billion in annual retained cash flow and a coverage ratio of just 1 8 and is now at a 3 4 billion retained cash flow run rate enough to fully fund its future growth plans with virtually no debt if it wanted to do that given the number of new projects coming online by the end of 2019 and early 2020 energy transfer will have the financial flexibility to start raising its payout soon morningstar expects 6 annual distribution growth or buying back its highly undervalued units which have 16 dcf yields at a unit price of 15 source et investor presentation energy transfer s massive network of midstream assets 86 000 miles of oil gas gathering storage export transportation and ngl production facilities is one of just three that serves all of america s largest oil gas shale formations and runs through 38 states source et investor presentation that vertically integrated network which moves about 30 of all us oil natural gas gives it a highly diversified customer base which when combined with long term and mostly volume committed contracts creates an extremely stable and relatively commodity insensitive about 88 of cash flow is fixed fee based cash flow to support the generous distribution et s cash flow remained stable even after oil prices were more than cut in half during the second worst oil crash in the past 50 years 2014 to 2016 source et investor presentation the legacy intrastate texas pipeline system is the highest margin and widest moat business it has with a virtual monopoly for most of texas s largest shale formations like the eagle ford and permian basin 95 of that cash flow is under long term volume committed contracts the mlp has steadily diversified into other opportunities to serve america s shale oil gas renaissance these newer projects tend to have shorter contracts and have more long term commodity sensitivity in that when contracts are up for renewal their rates can be more variable and based on supply demand which can fluctuate more than the regulated rates it enjoys in texas however in recent years the new assets have come to represent over 50 of cash flow and yet the mlp s adjusted ebitda continues to remain stable even in the face of two 40 oil crashes indicating income investors likely have little to fear from the new contract structures it s pursuing energy transfer s growth in 2019 and 2020 is likely to be very strong courtesy of that 5 billion growth backlog but what about beyond 2020 well here s what cfo thomas long told analysts at the q1 conference call about the company s long term growth potential we ll give guidance at least for 2020 later this year but when you look at i think you re probably at a run rate of the 3 maybe 3 billion to 4 billion 4 billion just because of the share scale and size of the company is probably a good run rate but we ll update those and it could be a little bit lumpy as you know we ve been talking about lng and stuff so keep all that in mind as we look out but i think that 3 to 4 range is probably a good number thomas long emphasis added for context roughly 3 5 billion in annual growth spending all of it self funded with zero equity issuances would equate to a standard mlp five year backlog of 17 5 billion that would give et the third largest growth backlog in the industry behind only tc energy trp and enbridge enb to fund that growth et has 4 15 billion in liquidity under its revolving credit agreements as well as over 3 billion in annual retained cash flow it s generating each year energy transfer recently opened its first foreign office in beijing part of its plan to expand its energy export business the mlp already owns two facilities on the gulf coast with daily export capacity of almost 2 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids in march 2018 et formed a joint venture with china s satellite petrochemical corp to built an ethane export terminal on the gulf coast with the project expected to completed by the end of 2020 more recently energy transfer announced a joint venture with shell rds b to convert its lake charles liquefied natural gas or lng import facility into an export terminal with an annual export capacity of 16 5 million tons of lng that project is expected to be complete in late 2024 or early 2025 this 3 billion project hasn t yet been approved final decision expected next year and thus isn t part of the official growth backlog source shell investor presentation the lake charles lng facility is et s way of profiting from the long term growth in lng demand mostly from emerging markets such as india and china the growth backlog also includes expansions of the permian express pipeline a joint venture with exxon xom source ryastad energy rtlr s 1 the permian basin is estimated by some analysts to be the largest oil formation ever discovered potentially with almost 250 billion barrels worth of remaining recoverable oil and oil equivalents with about half of that at sub 40 per barrel break even costs source epd investor presentation that loan formation is expected to double production over the next five years creating immense demand for new pipeline takeaway capacity including to export facilities on the us gulf coast according to the us energy information administration america s oil exports are expected to grow through at least 2030 but possibly not peak until beyond 2040 with improved fracking tech and strong energy prices possibly allowing for up to 10 million bpd per day of exports source eia america s long term energy boom is expected to require about 800 billion in new midstream infrastructure through 2035 alone about 50 of that for oil and 50 for gas lng ngl source kmi investor presentation should the eia s more bullish long term estimates prove true then through 2050 us midstream infrastructure needs will likely top 1 trillion creating a decades long growth runway for the midstream industry energy transfer as one of the largest blue chips in the industry will be well situated to profit from that resulting in potentially decades of generous safe and eventually growing income that should result in strong double digit total returns mplx objectively strong fundamentals the market is totally ignoring mplx is one of my favorite high yield mlps due to its great combination of safe sky high yield nearly 9 right now and steady long term payout growth 6 in

the acquisition will slightly lower this ratio as will the mlp s self funding business model over the long term that s because on may 8th mplx announced it was buying andx in a 9 billion all stock

price for its andx units in order to make the deal slightly accretive to mplx s dcf unit by about 0 01 andeavor logistics was part of the 23 billion acquisition mpc made in may 2018 when it bought refiner andeavor and it s long been expected that mplx would eventually swallow up andx in a simplification transaction source mplx merger presentation mpc has long had a history of being very generous to mplx investors when it comes to structuring major acquisitions so as to benefit the mlp s investors one of the reasons why i trust management source mplx merger presentation when the deal closes in the second half of 2019 mplx will be 63 owned by mpc whose interests are closely aligned with retail investors a safe and steadily rising distribution even in a recession thanks to this deal

about three times lower than the returns on capital the mlp is pursuing via its organic growth investments source mplx merger presentation all while pursuing a low risk self funding business model that has zero reliance on fickle equity markets to support its growth plans the stock price could be cut in half and mplx s ability to grow wouldn t be affected in the slightest basically i have little concern about mplx or et s balance sheet which when combined with their investment grade credit ratings and self funding business models supported by strong coverage ratios is why i consider them 4 5 safe dividend stocks more importantly post andx merger mplx will be well situated to continue diversifying its operations as it has since its 2012 ipo that includes in the permian super basin where it has no less than four growth avenues to pursue including three oil pipelines and two gas ones serving that formation s thriving output in both source mplx merger presentation mplx is also planning on cashing in on us oil gas exports it currently has two export facilities with plans to build two more and expand the ones that are currently operating mplx s fast growth continued in q1 with 22 growth in both adjusted ebitda and dcf unit source mplx merger presentation the mlps growth plan is part of a long term strategy to diversify away from purely serving mpc s logistics needs the pipelines that supply the largest independent refiner in america which currently represents 60 of mplx s cash flow while high single customer concentration isn t good keep in mind that all of those mpc contracts are long term 5 to 10 year with 100 volume commitments representing very steady cash flow with a financially sound counterparty this is largely what has allowed mplx to raise its payout for 25 consecutive quarters every quarter since its ipo source mpc investor presentation better yet the logistics and storage business which serves mpc is thriving with 11 growth in pipeline throughput fueling 12 growth in adjusted ebitda even excluding last year s huge drop downs source mplx merger presentation and the gathering and processing segment formerly markwest is similarly seeing booming cash flow up 15 yoy courtesy of nearly 20 growth in gas and ngl fractionation volumes as the largest midstream provider in the marcellus utica shale the second largest gas formations in north america mplx has a long and visible growth runway created by the decades long expected growth in us gas production source eia the majority of that growth in gas production which will be partially fueled by lng demand growth is expected to come from the marcellus utica shale that mplx dominates its fractionators produce 55 of all ngls out of those two formations source mplx merger presentation mplx has a large number of organic growth projects planned for both its business segments totaling 4 2 billion in 2019 and 2020 plus now andx s organic growth projects better yet andx also brings plenty of great assets including ones serving the permian where mplx has just started to expand into and the bakken formation of north dakota andeavor logistics assets source andeavor logistics investor presentation andeavor had 3 billion in organic growth and andeavor dropdowns planned but its high leverage low unit price 12 cost of equity and a coverage ratio of about 1 0 meant it was in a liquidity trap mplx upon acquiring andx will be able to execute on those growth opportunities with a cost of capital of just 4 6 mplx has 2 8 billion in liquidity under its two revolving credit facilities including a 1 billion one from mpc once more showing the kind of support its sponsor gives it there s also the 860 million in annual retained cash flow plus low cost borrowing the mlp can tap to grow as quickly as management can secure contracts for profitable future projects the biggest short term risk to mplx prior to this acquisition announcement was what terms it would get for an andx buyout mpc taking a 2 haircut in terms of the price it s getting for its stake in the smaller mlp shows just how shareholder friendly marathon management is to mplx investors with the final big acquisition now done and mplx s dcf unit being virtually unaffected that rock solid 1 4 coverage ratio and excellent 4 0 leverage ratio means mplx s payout safety is intact and the payout is likely to grow for the foreseeable future source simply safe dividends it won t be as fast as in recent years when steady mpc drow downs 12 billion in 2017 and 8 billion last year helped fuel incredible dcf growth at mplx however while 2020 distribution growth guidance isn t yet available i fully expect 1 penny per quarter 6 growth rates to continue for several years morningstar expects payout growth to accelerate to 9 over the long term in 2020 and beyond ceo mike hennigan told analysts at the q1 conference call that the mlp s previous payout ratio growth guidance for 2019 is unchanged by the andx merger source mpc investor presentation that s likely because mpc s last guidance for mplx andx showed about 15 dcf unit growth for 2020 which should easily support continued 6 payout growth all while allowing the coverage ratio to climb steadily higher and the leverage ratio to fall under 4 0 possibly earning it an upgrade to a bbb credit rating and to a level 9 swan stock status under my quality rating system and given that factset research reports the analyst consensus for five year dcf unit growth as 5 which i consider reasonable given the growth prospects and strong access to low cost capital that likely makes mplx a great long term high yield income growth investment one that should easily deliver strong double digit total returns over the coming years from today s rock bottom valuation valuation total return potential incredible bargains plus safe high yields means great probability of double digit total returns what determines my retirement portfolio

dividend yield theory moneychimp analyst estimates today mplx and energy transfer are offering truly astonishing yields but as i ve clearly demonstrated ones that are safe and likely to be sustained even during a recession in terms of long term growth potential analyst estimates for energy transfer are about 5 the same as mplx those estimates might prove overly conservative given the huge demand for new infrastructure but i prefer to err on the side of conservatism even modest 5 long term dcf unit growth would still likely deliver about 14 long term total returns even assuming today s extremely low valuations persisted forever that kind of mid double digit total return potential is far above the market s historical 9 1 cagr and far better than the roughly 4 cagr total returns most asset managers expect from the s p 500 over the coming five to 10 years however when we factor in valuation then energy transfer and mplx become even more attractive high yield opportunities with the

market in industry history today that means both mlps are trading at valuations that bake in virtually no long term growth which the last few quarters and current growth plans prove 100 false this implies that both mlps and the entire industry is set for significant future multiple expansion to estimate how much and complete my valuation adjusted total return model i turn to my favorite blue chip valuation method dividend yield theory or dyt this has been the only approach used by asset manager newsletter publisher investment quality trends since 1966 dyt which compares a stock s yield to its historical norm has been the only approach iqt has used for 53 years and only on blue chips to deliver market beating returns with 10 lower volatility to boot source investment quality trends according to hulbert financial digest iqt s 30 year risk adjusted total returns are the best of any us investing newsletter basically dyt is the most effective long term valuation approach i ve yet found which is why it s at the heart of my retirement portfolio s strategy and drives many of my article recommendations dyt merely compares a company s yield to its historical norm because assuming the business model remains relatively stable over time yields like most valuation metrics tend to revert to historical levels that approximate fair value now many investors will correctly point out that the mlp business model has changed a lot over the past five years gone forever are the days of hyper payout growth replaced with self funding business models and much lower leverage ratios while that s true i d also point out that a five year average yield which occurred entirely during a bear market seems like a conservative estimate of where each stocks yield can be expected to return company yield 5 year average yield estimated discount to fair value upside to fair value 5 10 year valuation boost cagr energy transfer 8 3 6 7 19 24 2 1 to 4 4 mplx 8 6 6 2 28 38 3 3 to 6 7 click to enlarge sources simply safe dividends dividend yield theory gordon dividend growth model f a s t graphs management guidance moneychimp dyt estimates et and mplx are 19 and 28 undervalued respectively even if it takes the market another five to 10 years to return to those reasonable fair value yields that would still mean shares would likely appreciate about 4 to 5 faster than cash flow per unit over time but in case you think that the classic mlp business model breaking means dyt is invalid for this sector let s consider one final valuation method morningstar s conservative three stage discounted cash flow models morningstar analysts build these 100 fundamentals driven models using some of the most conservative growth assumptions on wall street often lower than even management guidance if morningstar says a stock is at fair value it s generally undervalued and a good buy if they say it s highly undervalued that usually means it s a screaming buy company current price estimated fair value moat management quality discount to fair value long term valuation boost potential energy transfer 14 78 22 medium uncertainty none stable trend standard average to good 33 5 star valuation very strong buy 4 1 to 8 3 mplx 30 60 39 5 low uncertainty narrow stable trend standard average to good 23 4 star valuation strong buy 2 6 to 5 2 click to enlarge source morningstar morningstar thinks that mplx is overpaying for andx by about 19 which is why it reduced its fair value estimate from 44 to 39 5 but even factoring in that and et s long term dcf unit growth of just 3 as i said very low growth assumptions morningstar thinks that mplx and et are 23 and 33 undervalued respectively when deciding on my official recommendations i average dyt and morningstar s conservative estimates to minimize the chance of readers overpaying for any blue chips thus i estimate that these stocks are energy transfer 29 undervalued mplx 31 undervalued dividend sensei blue chip valuation scale 0 to 9 undervalued buy 10 to 19 undervalued strong buy 20 to 29 undervalued very strong buy 30 or more undervalued ultra strong buy under my blue chip valuation score that makes energy transfer a very strong buy while mplx is an ultra strong buy of course that s only as part of a well diversified and constructed portfolio and for income investors comfortable with each mlp s risk profile risks to consider i can t stress enough how important good risk management is sizing positions based on your risk tolerance and proper asset allocation to long term investing success long term income growth investing depends both on selecting quality companies and being able to hold them during times of severe market volatility because as peter lynch the second greatest investor in history behind buffett 29 cagr total returns at fidelity s magellan fund between 1977 and 1990 famously said some readers have the mistaken impression that my quality score classifications especially the swan rating imply a stock is impervious to sharp short term declines such as during the late 2018 correction source ycharts let me be very clear that all dividend stocks no matter the quality can and eventually will suffer sharp and sometimes ferociously rapid declines during the last correction peak decline of 19 8 for the s p 500 the worst correction in a decade mlps in general and et and mplx in particular all fell hard and fast where they undervalued at the time based on their objectively strong fundamentals and solid long term growth outlook you bet but when the market is gripped by terror in this case fears over a possible 2019 recession none of that matters as i like to say in the short term the market s stupidity is infinite which means that even deep value blue chips can get a lot cheaper when panic grips wall street investor sentiment hit a 10 year low in december while i have confidence in my analysis of these two mlps and the safety of their respective distributions that doesn t mean that both might not become a lot more undervalued during a future correction or bear market which is why only those comfortable with mlp risk profiles including execution risk and high volatility often linked to volatile energy prices and who don t mind using k 1 tax forms increased tax complexity in exchange for deferred tax liability should consider these stocks and even then only as part of a diversified and well constructed portfolio that uses asset allocation that s appropriate for your individual needs and risk tolerance here are my risk management rules of thumb based on numerous market studies as well as consultations with a trusted colleague who has decades of experience as a mutual fund manager most importantly of all i need to point out that my expertise is in blue chip dividend stocks which is why that s what i write about it s my circle of competence however all my recommendations are purely meant for the equity portion of your portfolio and never as a bond alternative bonds are a separate asset class which in the modern era since 2000 of slower growth lower inflation have been generally countercyclical to stocks this means that a well designed portfolio needs to balance the historical total return superiority of stocks with the lower volatility of bonds cash equivalents such as t bills are what you need for meeting expenses during the market s inevitable downturns such as retirees on the 4 rule bonds are what you use if you run out of cash and help reduce overall portfolio volatility this allows you to sleep at night during corrections and avoid panic selling stocks no matter how well stocks do over time if you get scared out of them your returns will suffer since 1926 bonds have been far less volatile experiencing their worst single year decline in 1969 a mere 8 fall in contrast stocks can be over five times as volatile with their worst year being 1931 s 43 market plunge granted that was part of the 90 peak market crash during the great depression the worst in us market history future stock market declines are not likely to be nearly as severe but the point is that the superior market returns of stocks are meaningless if you can t hold them through an inevitable downturn bonds and cash equivalents are meant to offer you a stable appreciating asset that can be sold to fund living expenses either planned or unplanned during corrections bear markets and thus avoid becoming a forced seller of stocks at the worst possible times such as at fire sale prices during market panics such panic selling when combined with fomo fear of missing out buying of overvalued stocks is the primary reason that retail investor returns over the past 20 years have been so horrible underperforming every asset class and even historically low inflation in contrast a 60 40 stock bond portfolio the default recommendation for most conservative investors almost matched the s p 500 s 5 6 cagr total return and even a highly conservative 40 60 stock bond portfolio did nearly as well the point is that anyone buying mplx or et needs to do so as part of an overall portfolio strategy that fits their individual needs and risk tolerances what about individual company risks the biggest potential worry i have for energy transfer not large enough to break its thesis is the low investment grade credit rating which the mlp is working diligently to improve while et has no trouble access low cost debt today during times of financial market fear such as corrections and recessions that can change in a hurry source ycharts as you can see even bbb rated corporate bonds which mplx has but et doesn t can be highly volatile with their risk premia yields minus 10 year yields spiking when credit markets become spooked bbb risk premia have averaged about 1 over the past decade but during recessions they tend to rise to about 3 and during the financial crisis bbb rated bond yields hit double digits this is a key reason why i only recommend or own mlps with strong balance sheets and good access to low cost fixed rate bonds while the next recession is likely to be mild the usual 12 to 18 month 1 decline in gdp and not a repeat of the great recession almost a 5 decline in gdp you want to make sure that any dividend stock you own isn t likely to face a liquidity trap due to credit markets tightening up just how much of a risk is a recession right now source new york federal reserve the bad news is that it s now the highest in 10 years according to models by the cleveland and new york federal reserves while 28 to 34 recession risk isn t necessarily a cause for alarm it s important to point out two things first prior to the last three recessions 12 month recession risk peaked at between 35 and 50 we re very close to those danger zones right now and the current escalating trade war which moody s analytics estimates might reduce annual us gdp growth by about 1 8 could be sufficient to put the us into a mild recession in 2020 or 2021 and as lipper financial s research makes clear if the us experiences a recession a bear market while not 100 certain is extremely likely since wwii no economic downturn has ever not caused a bear market which tends to be about 13 more severe than the rare non recessionary ones during a recession energy prices can be expected to decline significantly while both mplx and energy transfer have diversified and long term contracted cash flow streams and the us shale industry is now far less leveraged than it was during the 2014 2016 oil crash with breakeven costs about half as high each mlp does have modest cash flow risk that s created by either spread differential businesses which account for about 13 of et s cash flow or due to a lack of pure take or pay volume committed contracts mplx has within most of its markwest segment the good news is that the high coverage ratios each mlp now enjoys are likely to make a distribution cut during a recession a low probability event however it s highly likely that a hyper pessimistic market is going to worry a lot about mlp payout safety given the high amount of distribution cuts the industry saw during the 2014 2016 oil crash that could create yields as high as 10 to 12 in both stocks which is great for value focused income investors but could be painful and scary for anyone who foolishly bought either of them as bond alternatives or becomes a forced seller due to financial necessity due to the credit market fears during the next recession i am waiting for energy transfer to earn an upgrade to bbb before i raise its quality rating to 9 earning it a swan designation what about mplx risks the biggest short term one to consider is the possibility that marathon petroleum will possibly buy it out should the current valuation persist too long remember that mplx s cash flow continues to grow steadily despite what the flat to falling unit price might indicate this creates an incentive for mpc to eventually buy it out in an all stock deal which would likely come with a 10 to 20 premium while that would mean a short term pop for anyone buying right before such a deal were announced it wouldn t be necessarily great news for any investors attracted to mplx s safe sky high and steadily growing yield or whose cost basis was below the buyout price marathon petroleum 4 2 yield and 10 long term dividend growth expected mplx 8 6 yield and about 5 long term payout growth expected should mpc buy mplx in a stock based deal the difference in yield is highly unlikely to be offset by the exchange ratio we get a stealth payout cut what s more mpc s long term dividend growth potential while much higher than mplx s is still likely to create a slightly lower long term total return potential source mpc investor presentation personally should mpc buyout my mplx units with 63 ownership retail investors can t stop a roll up i d keep my shares of mpc which i consider an excellent high yield dividend growth blue chip but we can t forget that any mpc buyout of mplx would be a taxable event resulting in potentially painful short term tax implications any deferred tax liabilities would be triggered and is one reason that so many income investors have shied away from the mlp industry in recent years that s because depending on what your cost basis is a buyout might lock in a loss and lead to a one time tax bill that could be significant bottom line today is a potentially great time to add these safe 8 yielding mlp blue chips to your portfolio don t get me wrong there is no such thing as must own dividend stocks that all income investors should buy mplx and energy transfer lp while great deep value high yield blue chip options are not right for everyone some people hate k 1s with a passion my best friend s accountant won t let him touch them others don t like that their unit prices which have been in a bear market for five years are so correlated with cyclical energy prices despite their low cash flow sensitivity making this unjustified and some investors just don t like anything connected to oil gas either out of moral objections or due to the need to own something that can be bought and held for several decades the oil gas age is likely to eventually end though not for many years but assuming you re not one of those people then today is a potentially excellent time to add energy transfer and mplx to your diversified income portfolio both mlps have strong cash rich and commodity insensitive business models that when combined with strong coverage ratios good balance sheets and low risk self funding business models should ensure generous safe and steadily rising distributions over time and as hard as it might be to believe after a five year industry bear market at some point wall street won t be able to ignore steadily rising cash flows and the long growth runway each mlp enjoys with both stocks about 30 undervalued their combination of 8 safe yields plus about 5 long term dcf unit and payout growth and significant valuation boosts should result in strong double digit returns potentially as high as 15 to 20 over the next five to 10 years this makes them some of my favorite high yield blue chip recommendations today and is also why i own both in my retirement portfolio with plans to eventually increase my positions when my sector concentration falls below 20
emefiele policy saboteurs will no longer be spared saboteurs of economic policies will find their match in the central bank of nigeria cbn should governor godwin emefiele get the senate s all clear for a fresh tenure he said yesterday that circumventing the policies designed by the federal government to stabilise the economy had been the bane of nigeria s development emefiele spoke when he appeared before the senate committee on banking insurance and other financial institutions for screening as cbn governor following his reappointment for another five year term he said part of the problem that we have seen in nigeria is lack of respect for the policies of this country nigeria is very good at putting in place policies that are sound and workable but implementation has always been almost zero and it is arising because we see sabotage activities we see people when policies are made where they pick up the pieces of paper about the policy what they think about is how do we circumvent this policy the central bank of nigeria if given this mandate will push very hard to ensure that those who seek to undermine the policies of nigeria without respecting the laws of this country will be brought to book under any circumstances and that is why i said please pray for us because the road ahead is still rough emefiele did not mention the specific policies that may have attracted saboteurs but the prohibition of 21 items from accessing foreign exchange has been controversial the cbn insists that the list will be expanded to strenghten the naira and some local industries there are also those who think the easy access to forex at banks has killed their profiteering at the parallel market the cbn boss said the era of relying on crude oil as the mainstay of the nation s economy was gone for good as some other commodities have overtaken petroleum in value at the international market he told his audience for some of you who are very good in doing calculations go and check today the price of a barrel of palm oil is more than the price of a barrel of crude oil so what happened to our country there are countries when they have the opportunities in agriculture and also have opportunities in the crude sector they didn t let their guards down but unfortunately we did and that is what we are paying for today so that when there are some external shocks in the crude oil market we sneeze but we only smile when the market is good we will grow that market back again and after that we will go into cocoa in the south west area to be sure that what we are doing permeates all the nooks and crannies of this country because we think we owe nigerians this emefiele who thanked the lawmakers for praying for the cbn to succeed said i thank you for praying for me because we need it i say this because the road ahead is still rough and very tough but i want to appeal to all nigerians that a time comes in the history of a country where you have to learn to respect the policies and laws of a country he decried the high level of disregard and disrespect for policies and laws of the country the cbn boss noted that there was no doubt that observing policies and laws put in place by the government is a sure way of growing the economy emefiele explained what the apex bank did to lift the country out of recession he vowed that those who work to circumvent and flout laws would no longer be spared the cbn governor was worried over the country s rapid population growth rate warning that steps must be taken to put in place policies that would take care the projected 425 million people in 2050 emefiele said we just came back from the imf world bank programme in april and in the world bank s imf s world economic outlook nigeria is positioned as a country whose population will grow and rise to over 425 million people by the year 2050 that will present nigeria as a country with the third largest population in the world after china and india and indeed surpassing the united states of america in population i worry and i do think that we all should worry that a lot of work needs to be done to make sure that we are able to put in place policies that will make life good for this 425 million people when we are the third largest population in the world so we from the central bank of nigeria from the monetary policy side have come to the realisation that using the instrumentality of the anchor borrowers programme where access to credit is being provided to our masses all over the country that it will be a way to generate employment and boost economic activity amongst our rural population the results are there to see that as a result of our anchor borrowers programme where we have disbursed over n190 billion to over 1 1 million small holder farmers cultivating over 1 3 million hectares of land that we need to do more of this as we do this we make finance available at low interest rate we make access to credit easy for our people and in doing this we will be able to create jobs for them and improve the livelihood of our people that is a sole thing that we make and i am very optimistic that this can be achieved he continued i went to one asian country i entered the country happy but i came out of the country sad sad because i could see the level of development that this country has achieved over the last 50 years related posts experience the ultimate celebration xiaomi fan festival promotion and i cast my mind back and looked at my country nigeria that what have we achieved this is what gives me the push that at my age of 57 i saw this country when it was good i am looking at the country today and i am saying i don t want to say it is bad but i want to say that we have a lot of work to do because the country has no doubt receded somewhat so from our side in the monetary policy we will do everything possible to ensure that with the mandate that is bestowed on us we will pull this country forward aside from the anchor borrowers programme we are also looking at special programmes targeted at wholesale growth of agricultural sector in nigeria aside from rice and other small good crop markets we have started looking at palm oil because we believe that this country has a lot of potentials in palm oil if you think about what this country was in the 50 s and 60 s nigeria being a country at that time that controlled 40 percent market share in palm oil industry exporting its palm oil to different parts of the world but because we found crude oil we receded and abandoned it on multiple exchange rate emefiele said a couple of people have raised issues that we have multiple exchange rates and we have said we do not have multiple exchange rates when you talk of multiple exchange rates you talk about divergence in exchange rate substantially today our rates have converged around n360 to 1 because the investors and exporters will know which is the dominant market for procurement of foreign exchange today it hovers around that rate but what you will find is multiple windows and we don t have any apologies for it when you talk about multiple windows the central bank has a responsibility to provide foreign exchange to everybody what we saw that resulted in us creating multiple windows we want to ensure that those who seek to travel who will normally go to our banks to ask for foreign exchange and the banks will turn them away and these people will seek to go to black market to buy foreign exchange we said no we will allocate specific sums of money to you to allocate to people who want to travel we will allocate specific sums of money to you to allocate to those who are into the small and medium enterprise business and we will allocate funds to you for you to give to those who are in your corporate sectors so you will find multiple windows because the rates at which foreign exchange is traded through all these windows are substantially the same so there is no multiple exchange rates but i will admit there is multiple windows and it is for a good reason emefiele was optimistic that very soon you will begin to see smiles on the faces of our youth especially those with entrepreneurial skills on how the cbn bailed out the country during recession he said when i resumed work in june 2014 i unveiled a five year vision for the bank and for the country achieving microeconomic stability was my main focus in trying to talk about what we achieved in the last five years we should take our mind back to the state of the economy in august 2008 about 62 billion was in our foreign reserve within the period we saw an increase in the price of crude oil despite this our reserve plummeted to about 40 billion by the time i assumed office the reserve was 32 billion as a result of the pressure on the reserve import was high export was reducing as a result exchange rate had to move coupled with the increase of fuel price inflation became high between january 2016 and january 2017 the period was bad the restriction of exchange rate was to reduce pressure on imports we have maintained the exchange rate at n360 to a dollar in the last three years in the last three years about n300 billion has been invested in small businesses the senior special assistant to the president on national assembly affairs senator ita enang who presented the nominee for screening praised the senate s speedy response to the president s request for emefiele s confirmation enang said this confirmation will be seen as one of the fastest requests to be considered by the senate the executive is grateful i hereby present to you for confirmation godwin emefiele governor of the cbn a member of the committee senator fatima raji rasaki urged emefiele to ensure that any time there is funds like the bailout funds the government is properly advised on how to disburse the funds for the benefit of nigerians senator hope uzodinma reminded his colleagues that the screening was for reappointment and not a fresh appointment he noted that in the wisdom of mr president the cbn governor passed his examination hence his reappointment for a second term senator shehu sani kaduna central advised the cbn boss to consolidate on the growth of cotton and textile especially in kaduna and katsina states the touted petitions against the confirmation of emefiele were not mentioned during the session the chairman of the committee senator rafiu ibrahim merely talked about a trending audio video he noted that the good work emefiele was doing might have attracted a distraction when you see a good thing some people want to distract it he said no fewer than 17 senators attended the screening

many market participants believe the commodities super cycle is all but over yet others opine it is merely taking a break to return with the next cycle led by natural resources of a different sort needed in the drive towards electrification of human mobility and a low carbon economy whichever side of the argument you happen to be on there is likely to be agreement that china drove the commodities market either side of the global financial crisis following the assetization of commodities that occurred towards the end of the last millennium or to be precise in the final four decades of the last millennium this millennium any commodity value experiencing double digit inflation adjusted price growth on an annualized basis can be deemed to be in a super cycle 2018 bloomberg finance lp courtesy of china s own double digit growth until a recent cooling of its economy a plethora of commodities both soft and hard experienced such growth between january 1 1998 and june 30 2008 it led people to opine that a commodities super cycle was occurring forget double digits the price of oil rose 1 062 and that of copper rose 487 over the said period according to bloomberg data then a u s sub prime mortgage crisis became a full blown global financial crisis halting that super cycle but in a bid to minimize the effects of the global slowdown on its economy china announced a 4 trillion yuan 586 billion economic stimulus package on november 9 2008 centered on infrastructure and social development commodity price growth initially limped and in subsequent years jumped upwards but fast forward to 2019 and it s a changed macroeconomic landscape china s economy is making a transition from being manufacturing led to a services driven model unable to match double digit growth the commodities market has grown accustomed to in recent decades since commodity prices are informed by marginal costs subject to intermittent deflationary or inflationary disruptive forces this expected maturing of the chinese economy is troubling in 2017 18 when china s perceived economic adjustment was clear for all to see commodities ended up as the worst performing asset class crude oil the sphere s poster natural resource ended 2018 down 18 though not entirely down to chinese demand while natural gas ended 3 lower on an annualized basis however neither was the worst performing commodity that dishonor fell to lithium 30 despite it being central to a rising need for rechargeable high performance batteries from mobile phones to electric vehicles a manufacturing segment where china leads in volume terms that s because alongside being a top consumer of lithium china also happens to be a top producer of the silver white alkali metal it is only behind australia and chile in terms of output and the world leader in terms of proven reserves that neutered the scope for it factoring in china s still decent appetite for metals unlike copper which has seen an upturn fortunes since 2016 lows 70 2019 bloomberg finance lp but china s overall commodity consumption is nothing like it was in the last decade beijing is also currently embroiled in a trade spat with u s president donald trump involving tariff salvos that have implications well beyond bilateral trade between u s china a recent poll of economists surveyed by bloomberg suggests china s 2019 gdp growth will be lowered by 0 3 percentage point by the rise in u s tariffs on 200 billion of imports from china following the latest escalation by trump if more tariffs are slapped by the u s president to cover all chinese goods then a 0 6 percentage point drop in the 12 months thereafter appears to be the median figure given by those polled however even before the latest escalation of the ongoing trade spat began data had been pointing to lower economic activity according to china s national bureau of statistics the country s april industrial output came in at 5 4 on an annualized basis down from 8 5 in march april retail sales growth came in at 7 2 versus 8 7 in march and fixed asset investment at 6 1 versus 6 3 in march kit juckes head of fx at société générale said china s activity data has surprised on the downside looking through the monthly volatility china is still on track of stabilization but the recovery is probably not going to be as strong as some are hoping for while an economic stimulus from beijing is imminent its nature would be very different from 2008 back then an infrastructure focused stimulus supported not just copper and iron ore prices but also those of zinc lead nickel and fossil fuels the stimulus measures expected in 2019 will still offer significant support to the chinese economy but will feel different according marie diron head of asia pacific middle east africa sovereigns at moody s speaking at the rating agency s emerging markets summit in london on thursday may 16 diron said market expectations are that beijing s move will be more skewed towards tax cuts whether it would be as effective as previous initiatives remains to be seen moody s predicts china s gdp growth in 2019 of just above 6 accompanied by a significant tightening in credit 2017 bloomberg finance lp and the ongoing trade spat while negative for the u s carries bigger problems for china given trade imbalances as it exports more goods to the u s rather than the other way around that s why beijing s reaction to each escalation by trump via retaliatory tariffs of its own is lower in dollar terms chinese companies will be negatively impacted whether you take direct u s action into account or domino effects on the supply chain all at a time when corporate leverage remains a risk said gary lau head of north asia ex japan corporates at moody s and with trump in the white house the issue is not going away anytime soon juckes of socgen added china will remain a bone of contention whether the current trade dispute is resolved or not and the president might turn his attention to what many in washington view as overvalued dollar that might open another can of worms for the commodities trade given such variables selective commodities might fare better than others for instance the commodity that outshone others in 2018 was uranium 20 3 but the uptick albeit from a low base had little to do with china the price rise came because the supply and demand equation for uranium has resulted in a tightening of the market following japan s fukushima nuclear tragedy in 2011 countries began to shy away from nuclear power generation in tandem with a short term surplus of japanese uranium stockpiles the perceived nuclear switch off meant the number of mining companies declaring interest in uranium fell by 90 then dwindling japanese stockpiles uptick in favor for nuclear power generation and lack of resource mining plays sent the uranium price soaring last year quite like uranium there will be other winning commodity plays but a holistic china driven commodities super cycle is unlikely to materialize disclaimer the above commentary is meant to stimulate discussion based on the author s opinion and analysis it is not solicitation recommendation or investment advice to trade commodities futures options or products commodities markets can be highly volatile and opinions in the sector may change instantaneously and without notice
tsca fifra tri epa issues final snur for asbestos will close loophole and protect consumers on april 25 2019 epa issued a final significant new use rule snur for asbestos using the definition in title ii section 202 of tsca which defines asbestos as the asbestiform varieties of six fiber types chrysotile serpentine crocidolite riebeckite amosite cummingtonite grunerite anthophyllite tremolite or actinolite 84 fed reg 17345 the restricted significant new use of asbestos including as part of an article is manufacturing including importing or processing for uses that are neither ongoing nor already prohibited under tsca persons subject to the snur may not undertake any of these activities they are required to notify epa at least 90 days before commencing any manufacturing including importing or processing of asbestos including as part of an article for a significant new use the required notification initiates epa s evaluation of the conditions of use associated with the intended use manufacturing including importing and processing including as part of an article for the significant new use may not commence until epa has conducted a review of the notice made an appropriate determination on the notice and taken such actions as are required in association with that determination the final snur is effective june 24 2019 more information is available online ninth circuit issues order requiring epa to rule on objections to denial of tolerance revocation for chlorpyrifos within 90 days on april 19 2019 the u s circuit court of appeals for the ninth circuit ninth circuit issued an order following an en banc rehearing in league of united latin am citizens lulac v wheeler no 17 71636 the february 6 2019 ninth circuit decision to grant epa s request for rehearing effectively vacated an august 9 2018 decision in lulac that had ordered epa to revoke all tolerances and cancel all registrations for chlorpyrifos after the rehearing the en banc panel issued a writ of mandamus directing epa to issue no later than 90 days after the filing of this order a full and fair decision on lulac s objections to an initial epa order denying a 2007 petition to revoke all tolerances for chlorpyrifos the en banc order states that the court has discretion to construe the petitioners opening brief as a request for mandamus relief even though the petitioners sought judicial review of epa s initial denial decision without waiting for epa to rule on their objections and even though they did not file a petition for mandamus under the applicable procedural rule the court then states that onsidering the history and chronology of this matter and the nature of the claims we conclude mandamus is appropriate and we hereby grant the petition for a writ of mandamus the court states that epa represented that it could issue a final decision with respect to petitioners objections within 90 days of an order issued by this court during oral argument on march 26 2019 the en banc ruling however does not discuss the jurisdictional issues presented when the petitioners sought judicial review of epa s initial denial decision without waiting for epa to rule on their objections moreover the ruling does not discuss the substantive dispute concerning epa s authority to decline to revoke the tolerances and cancel the registrations for chlorpyrifos based on the current administrative record more information on the protracted litigation concerning chlorpyrifos is available on our blog under key words chlorpyrifos and ninth circuit epa announces proposed procedures for review of cbi claims for the identity of chemicals on the tsca inventory on april 23 2019 epa issued a proposed rule regarding its plan to review certain confidential business information cbi claims to protect the specific chemical identities of substances on the confidential portion of the tsca inventory 84 fed reg 16826 the cbi claims that would be reviewed under this plan are those that were asserted on notice of activity noa form a s filed in accordance with the requirements in the active inactive rule tsca section 8 b 4 c requires epa to promulgate a rule establishing a plan to review all cbi claims to protect the specific chemical identities of chemical substances on the confidential portion of the tsca inventory that were asserted in an noa form a this rule must be promulgated not later than one year after the publication of the first tsca inventory containing all active substance designations tsca also requires epa to implement the cbi review plan so as to complete all cbi claim reviews not later than five years after such tsca inventory publication with the possibility of a two year extension epa states that since it released the updated tsca inventory on february 19 2019 the deadline for issuing a final rule is february 19 2020 and the deadline for completing all the cbi claim reviews is february 19 2024 if epa invokes the two year extension under tsca the deadline for completing all the cbi claim reviews would then become february 19 2026 as reported in our february 21 2019 memorandum epa releases updated tsca inventory of the 40 655 chemicals in commerce more than 80 percent 32 898 have identities that are not cbi and fewer than 20 percent 7 757 have identities that were claimed as cbi epa notes that other types of cbi

revisions and update to small manufacturer definition for tsca section 8 a on april 25 2019 epa issued a proposed rule that would amend tsca section 8 a chemical data reporting cdr requirements and the tsca section 8 a size standards for small manufacturers 84 fed reg 17692 the current cdr rule requires manufacturers including importers of certain chemical substances listed on the tsca inventory to report data on chemical manufacturing processing and use every four years epa is proposing several changes to the cdr rule to make regulatory updates to align with new statutory requirements of tsca improve the cdr data collected as necessary to support the implementation of tsca and potentially reduce the burden for certain cdr reporters proposed updates to the definition for small manufacturers including a new definition for small governments are being made in accordance with tsca section 8 a 3 c and impact certain reporting and recordkeeping requirements for tsca section 8 a rules including cdr epa states that the definitions may reduce the burden on chemical manufacturers by increasing the number of manufacturers considered small overall according to epa the regulatory modifications may better address epa and public information needs by providing additional information that is currently not collected improve the usability and reliability of the reported data and ensure that data are available in a timely manner comments are due by june 24 2019 d c circuit partially denies petition for review of tsca inventory on april 26 2019 the u s court of appeals for the

proposed interim registration review decision for glyphosate on may 6 2019 epa announced it was releasing its proposed interim registration review decision pid for glyphosate acid and its various salt forms 84 fed reg 19782 in the pid epa states that it did not identify any human health risks from exposure to any use of glyphosate but did identify potential risk to mammals and birds within the application area or areas near the application area and potential risk to terrestrial and aquatic plants from off site spray drift consistent with glyphosate s use as a herbicide even with these potential risks the pid states that epa concludes that the benefits outweigh the potential ecological risks when glyphosate is used according to label directions and proposes certain risk mitigation strategies including to reduce off site spray drift to non target organisms the epa is proposing certain spray drift management measures with specific spray drift mitigation language to be included on all glyphosate product labels for products applied by liquid spray application to preserve glyphosate as a viable tool for growers and combat weed resistance the epa is proposing that herbicide resistance management language be added to all glyphosate labels and to require measures for the pesticide registrants to provide growers and users with detailed information and recommendations to slow the development and spread of herbicide resistant weeds inclusion on labels of a non target organism advisory statement to alert users of potential impact to non target organisms and epa is also proposing certain labeling clean up consistency efforts to bring all glyphosate labels up to modern standards epa states that these measures were discussed with glyphosate registrants who do not oppose the proposed risk mitigation measures outlined in the pid the public can submit comments on epa s proposed decision at www regulations gov in docket number epa hq opp 2009 0361 public comments

the petition the court ruled that epa acted legally and appropriately in rejecting the petition it stated that achieving compliance by relying on the caa s good neighbor provision which requires epa to impose a federal plan on states that contribute significantly to other states ability to meet air quality standards was the appropriate approach the court stated that epa thus concluded that compared to the blunt impact of expanding the region these other tools provided more effective and efficient approaches to the ozone transport problem in light of limited agency resources epa releases interpretive statement on whether cwa npdes permit program applies to releases of a pollutant from a point source to groundwater on april 23 2019 epa announced it was making available its interpretive statement addressing whether the clean water act s cwa national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit program applies to releases of a pollutant from a point source to groundwater interpretive statement for comment 84 fed reg 16810 epa is issuing the interpretative statement to provide clarity on interpretation of the given the mixed record of prior statements and a split in the federal circuit courts regarding this issue epa s interpretive statement states that it sets forth interpretation of the permit program s applicability to releases of pollutants from a point source to groundwater that subsequently migrate or are conveyed by groundwater to jurisdictional surface waters and epa concludes that the is best read as excluding all releases of pollutants from a point source to groundwater from npdes program coverage and liability under section 301 of the cwa regardless of a hydrologic connection between the groundwater and a jurisdictional surface water epa also released a fact sheet on its interpretive statement available online the april 23 federal register notice states that the interpretative statement reflects epa s consideration of the public comments received in response to its february 20 2018 federal register notice 83 fed reg 7126 which requested comment on epa s previous statements regarding whether pollutant discharges from point sources that reach jurisdictional surface waters via groundwater or other subsurface flow that has a direct hydrologic connection to the jurisdictional surface water may be subject to cwa regulation epa received over 50 000 comments from a wide range of stakeholders many of which affirmed that additional clarity from epa was necessary epa reached its conclusion based on the comments received and on a holistic analysis of the its text structure and legislative history epa also references numerous policy considerations that support excluding groundwater discharges from npdes permitting

compensation and liability act cercla or superfund and corrective action under rcra the interim guidance is available online the guidance provides interim recommendations for screening levels and preliminary remediation goals prg to inform final cleanup levels for pfoa and or pfos contamination of groundwater that is a current or potential source of drinking water epa states that its recommendations are consistent with existing epa guidance and standard practices in addition to applicable statutes and regulations for groundwater contaminated with pfoa or pfos epa instructs its regional offices to consult on a case by case basis with the office of land and emergency management olem prior to using the fund and the office of enforcement and compliance assurance oeca prior to taking enforcement action the interim recommendations are as follows sites should be screened using a level set to a hazard quotient of 0 1 for pfoa or pfos individually which is currently 40 parts per trillion ppt and for sites where groundwater is contaminated and is a current or potential source of drinking water the prg should be 70 ppt unless a state or tribal maximum contaminant level for pfoa or pfos is in place in situations where groundwater is being used for drinking water epa expects that responsible parties will address levels of pfoa and or pfos over 70 ppt epa is taking comment

d or introduced the chemical poisons reduction act of 2019 h r 2471 the bill would ban the use of two compounds that are used to control predator populations specifically the bill would ban the use of sodium fluoroacetate commonly known as compound 1080 and sodium cyanide to kill predatory animals although epa banned compound 1080 in 1972 after lobbying from the livestock industry epa re approved the compound for use in the livestock protection collar collars containing the compound that are placed around the necks of sheep and burst when punctured by a predator in 1985 sodium cyanide is contained within m 44 devices which are spring activated ejectors that deliver a dose when pulled the top of the ejector is wrapped with an absorbent material that has been coated with a substance that attracts canines when the device is activated a spring ejects the poison the u s fish and wildlife service and state agencies regularly use both of these poisons in their predator control programs house subcommittee holds hearing on bill to ban asbestos on may 8 2019 the house energy and commerce subcommittee on environment and climate change convened a hearing entitled ban asbestos now taking action to save lives and livelihoods energy and commerce chair frank pallone jr d nj opened the hearing and his opening statement was withering in its criticism of epa on its inaction on asbestos pallone stated it has been 30 years since epa finalized that ban and it has been 28 years since that ban was struck down in court twenty eight years of frustration of sickness and loss we have known the dangers of asbestos for decades enough is enough the hearing focused on h r 1603 the alan reinstein ban asbestos now act the bill would ban the manufacture import processing and distribution of asbestos it would also require epa to assess and report on the risks posed by legacy asbestos found in buildings mr pallone stated that the frank r lautenberg chemical safety act for the 21st century empowered epa to ban asbestos in fact this committee s report on the lautenberg act written under republican leadership states and i m quoting now to many members of the committee an important measure of tsca reform proposals has been whether the proposal would enable epa to take broader regulatory action to protect against unreasonable risks from asbestos the committee expects this legislation to enable that regulatory action he added however that unfortunately it is now clear that despite the best efforts of our committee the trump epa is not using the tools we gave it to regulate dangerous chemicals asbestos is the poster child for the problems we are seeing in the implementation of the lautenberg act epa s actions under the lautenberg act have been so legally suspect that i believe we need to pass this bill regardless of whether epa were to announce that it is moving forward with a full ban of asbestos we don t have time for more legal maneuvering and a drawn out court battle while tens of thousands of people are dying it is deeply disappointing that 40 years after epa began work to ban asbestos under tsca and three years after we passed the lautenberg act to reform that statute we need to pass another law to ban this deadly substance but it is clear that congress must act and so we will testifying at the hearing were alexandra dunn assistant administrator

sdwa the bill would authorize sweeping investments for water infrastructure creating a grant program to upgrade the country s drinking water systems with treatment technology that can remove pfas it is intended to allow affected communities to remove pfas and other substances from their drinking water the bill would amend the sdwa to require epa to establish within 180 days of enactment a program to award grants to pfas affected water systems to pay the capital costs associated with eligible treatment technologies the legislation further directs epa to create a list of eligible treatment technologies defined as those which can remove all detectable amounts of pfas from drinking water other bills on pfas introduced on may 8 2019 are h r 2570 which is intended to ensure that polluters pay ongoing water treatment costs associated with contamination from pfas h r 2577 a bill that would amend the emergency planning and community right to know act epcra to include pfas on the toxics

pose to coral reefs and to study the impact of these chemicals on human health and the environment the oxybenzone and octinoxate impact study act of 2019 s 1371 would require epa to study the impacts of those two chemicals on human health and the environment the reef safe act of 2019 s 1375 would require fda to develop standards for a reef safe label for sunscreens companion legislation h r 2588

international trade commission usitc released its report assessing the likely economic impact of the united states mexico canada agreement usmca the report is required under the bipartisan congressional trade priorities and accountability act of 2015 the report united states mexico canada agreement likely impact on the u s economy and specific industry sectors assesses the likely impact of the agreement on the u s economy as a whole and on specific industry sectors and the interests of u s consumers the usitc investigated the impact the agreement would have on the u s gross domestic product gdp exports and imports employment and the production employment and competitive position of industries likely to be affected by the agreement the report concludes that if fully implemented and enforced usmca would have a modest positive impact on u s real gdp and employment specifically the report estimates that usmca would raise u s real gdp by 68 2 billion 0 35 percent and u s employment by 176 000 jobs 0 12 percent u s exports to canada and mexico would increase by 19 1 billion 5 9 percent and 14 2 billion 6 7 percent respectively u s imports from canada and mexico would increase by 19 1 billion 4 8 percent and 12 4 billion 3 8 percent respectively the elements of the agreement that would have the most significant effects on the u s economy are provisions that reduce policy uncertainty about digital trade and certain new rules of origin applicable to the automotive sector the report highlights usmca s new international data transfer provisions including provisions that largely prohibit forced localization of computing facilities and restrictions on cross border data flows because the north american free trade agreement nafta already eliminated duties on most goods and significantly reduced nontariff measures usmca s emphasis is on reducing remaining nontariff measures on trade and the u s economy this includes addressing other issues that affect trade such as workers rights harmonizing regulations and deterring certain potential future trade and investment barriers usmca s requirements are estimated to increase u s production of automotive parts and employment in the sector but also to lead to a small increase in the prices and small decrease in the consumption of vehicles in the united states usmca would reduce the scope of the investor state dispute settlement isds mechanism a change that based on modeling results would reduce u s investment in mexico and would lead to a small increase in u s domestic investment and output in the manufacturing and mining sectors the report is available online atsdr requests comment on proposed substances to be evaluated for toxicological profiles on april 19 2019 atsdr issued a federal

significant current potential threat to human health the atsdr toxicological profile succinctly characterizes the toxicologic and adverse health effects information for these toxic substances each peer reviewed profile identifies and reviews the key literature that describes a substance s toxicologic properties other pertinent literature is also presented but is described in less detail than the key studies the focus of the profiles is on health and toxicological information therefore each toxicological profile begins with a relevance to public health discussion that would allow a public health professional to make a real time determination of whether the presence of a particular substance in the environment poses a potential threat to human health the adequacy of information to determine a substance s health effects is described in a health effects summary data needs that are of significance to the protection of public health are identified by atsdr and epa the list of

the reserve bank would have studied the recent snapshot of australia s workplaces with decidedly mixed feelings this week construction work done third quarter data thursday construction work done third quarter data thursday rba minutes and rba governor speech tuesday rba minutes and rba governor speech tuesday thanksgiving day closes wall street thursday unemployment ticking down another notch was very much going to plan wages growth stuck near its historic low was not the trend is not new nor localised to the rba s patch it is also not supposed to happen according to the phillips curve one of the core beliefs of the big inflation targeting central banks worldwide being at the heart of global monetary policy the phillips curve has driven interest rate movements and by extension the cost of paying off our home loans and credit cards but if the curve is not broken already it bent badly out shape according to ubs economist george tharenou this central bank article of faith was drawn up by a kiwi economist a w phillips in 1958 in its simplest form it postulates as unemployment falls wages and inflation rise it is an attempt to put some intellectual rigour and numbers to the rather hazy nairu non accelerating inflation rate of unemployment or the rate below which unemployment should not fall without causing a wages breakout and rampant inflation to be fair to the rba australia hasn t hit that theoretical point yet but it is close australia s nairu is currently assumed to be around 5 per cent the abs trotted out an official unemployment rate of 5 4 per cent last week a look at the us where unemployment is now at 4 1 per cent or the uk where it fell to a more than four decade low of 4 3 per cent wage growth barely keeps up with inflation it shows something seems to be out of whack with central bank thinking this shouldn t happening according to conventional central bank wisdom supplied ubs six reasons for the rba to be happy one why it is not mr tharenou has tallied up a list of why the rba expects wages growth to rebound jobs booming to a post gfc high of 3 per cent annually jobs booming to a post gfc high of 3 per cent annually unemployment dropping to a more than four year low of 5 4 per cent only modestly above nairu unemployment dropping to a more than four year low of 5 4 per cent only modestly above nairu the minimum wage by rose by 3 3 per cent the most in six years directly adding around 0 25 percentage points to overall wages the minimum wage by rose by 3 3 per cent the most in six years directly adding around 0 25 percentage points to overall wages record business conditions record business conditions a rebound of commodity prices which lifted profits exports and nominal gdp by 3 5 to 4 points over the past year and put upward pressure on inflation a rebound of commodity prices which lifted profits exports and nominal gdp by 3 5 to 4 points over the past year and put upward pressure on inflation a synchronised pick up of global gdp which is likely to continue ahead all terrific but as mr tharenou notes despite so many positive shocks wage growth remains near a record low and will continue to disappoint stagnating around 2 per cent growth last month rba deputy governor guy debelle expressed some unease about the expectation that under the laws of economics wages would now start to rise he pointed out in the us germany and japan wage and price inflation remained weak as unemployment tumbled below previous estimates of nairu this can presumably only go on for so long as eventually the laws of supply and demand mean that as new workers become increasingly hard to find companies will actually have to pay higher wages to fill jobs dr debelle said mr tharenou has his doubts there is also still broad weakness of wpi across most industries coupled with an even greater relative extent of weakness in average earnings which are flat mr tharenou said this along with enterprise bargaining agreements ebas collapsing to a record low means it is unlikely inflation will get back to the rba s 2 to 3 per cent target band any time soon the expectation of low inflation is also keeping wage pressure in check as is strong population growth of around 3 per cent annually driven in large part by a rebound in net migration as mr tharenou points out migration is increasing aggregate demand especially for residential rental accommodation but it is also a significant positive labour supply shock which is likely to cap wages growth for some time yet in the past three years the unemployment rate has clearly trended down but wages still weakened further to new record lows he said the phillips curve in australia appears not just bent but is arguably becoming broken the collapse of ebas low inflation expectations population growth and technology are all keeping wage pressures at record lows supplied ubs weak wage growth now on rba agenda market economics managing director stephen koukoulas said the world is still probably five years away from finding out the full impact of stubbornly low wage growth the resurgence of globalisation and the impact of technology something like uber versus taxis low inflation but low wages is phenomenal for productivity but bad for workers mr koukoulas said mr koukoulas who helped develop the closest thing australia has to an monthly measure of inflation in his days at investment bank td securities said the rba by forecasting underlying inflation won t get above 2 per cent before 2019 the bottom of its target band does not have any margin for error low wage growth is one of the key drivers behind the optimistic business pessimistic consumer paradox it may have boosted profits but it has eroded buying power and has forced households to raid savings to pay for day to day essentials you can only fund consumption out of household savings for so long mr koukoulas observed when household spending dries up so will the biggest driver in the economy and business conditions and confidence may well topple from their current lofty heights too the rba now seems to be shuffling low wage growth up its list worries having for long fretted about asset bubbles hoping that falling unemployment would do its job as economic orthodoxy and the phillips curve suggested it would judging by dr debelle s recent speech on uncertainty the rba still hopes the phillips curve will deliver but perhaps with less conviction than before our forecast is that spare capacity will be gradually reduced in the period ahead he told a gathering of economists late last month but as it is reduced we will be alert to the possibility that these developments we see in other labour markets in terms of subdued inflation in the face of minimal spare capacity occur here too could be time

by the technical inclusion of darwin s central processing facility however as nab s david de garis noted there was no net gdp impact given it was imported that gas story may well be repeated this

central bank of nigeria cbn governor mr godwin emefiele on wednesday urged federal government to attach premium to palm oil production saying its price is higher than that of crude oil thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe emefiele stated this in abuja when he appeared before senate committee on banking insurance and other financial institutions for screening for his second term nomination by president muhammadu buhari he did not however give the current prices of the commodities in the international market but said that palm oil was a goldmine which nigeria had capacity to export to many countries the cbn governor expressed concern that though nigeria was one of the major palm oil producers in the 1960s it failed to consolidate on it because of the discovery of crude oil he however said that the cbn through its legal functions would come up with a special programme to boost palm oil production to help in diversifying the economy according to him nigeria had the potential to export palm oil and boost its revenue generation emefiele recalled that in the 60s nigeria controlled 40 per cent share in the global palm oil chain we were exporting our palm oil to different parts of the world but because we found crude oil we receded and abandoned it the price of a tonne of palm oil is more than the price of a barrel of crude oil so what happened for other countries when they had the opportunity in agriculture and in the crude sector they did not let their guards down unfortunately we did and that is what we are paying for today such move is so so that when there are some external shock it will not be felt we will grow that market again and after that we will go into cocoa he said he commended president muhammadu buhari for his commitment to repositioning the agriculture sector according to emefiele the president had on different occasions insisted that the country should be producing what it would consume and consume what it would produce he noted that the charge resonated with cbn management which took it further by starting the anchor borrowers programme that had impacted so much on the lives of nigerians he also disclosed that the apex bank was coming up with a fund for the creative industry to engage nigerian youths so as to increase employment rate as well as tackle restiveness the cbn governor informed the committee that the bank had worked assiduously to stabilise the economy in many areas we went into the regime of restricting foreign exchange this was intended to control import and encourage export to reduce pressure on the reserve fortunately we saw import dropping to as much as six billion dollars on a quarterly basis to today that it is significantly lower having adjusted the demands and trying to see how to balance the foreign exchange rate a number of intervening actions were introduced to help boost the supply of foreign exchange into the market he pointed out that the bank had explored other intervening initiatives that would help boost the supply of foreign exchange into the market including encouraging investors emefiele added that cbn had been able to reduce the exchange rate from about n500 to a dollar to the current rate of n360 to a dollar he promised to make further effort to ensure stability of the exchange rate for a clear monetary policy direction exchange rate now converges substantially at n360 to a dollar inflation trending downwards for about 25 consecutive months now from about 18 72 per cent in 2017 to as low as 11 72 per cent now in the area of interest rate we tried as much as possible but unfortunately we have not quite achieved what we thought we will achieve on interest rate moderation though we have moved from about 18 5 per cent to 14 per cent we will still work hard to bring it further down on recent international monetary fund imf and world bank s population projection of over 400 million for nigeria in 2050 emefiele said much work needed to be done for policies that would make life easy for the people we just came back from the imf world programme in april and in the world bank imf world economic outlook nigeria is positioned as a country whose population will rise to over 425 million people by the year 2050 that will present nigeria as the country with the third largest population in the world after china and india and surpassing the united states of america we from the central bank on the monetary policy side have come to realise the instrumentality of the anchor borrowers programme a programme where access to credit is being provided to our masses all over the country will be a way to generate employment and boost economic activities among our rural population the results are there to see that as a result of our anchor borrowers programme where we have disbursed over n190 billion to over 1 1 million farmers cultivating over 1 3 million hectares of land we need to do more as we do this we make finance available at low interest rate make access to credit easy for our people and in doing this we will be able to create jobs for them and improve their livelihood i am very optimistic that this can be achieved he said emiefele called for prayers and concerted efforts to consolidate on his achievements if his nomination was confirmed he said you have all testified to what we have done in the last three to four years i am not saying it is that simple it is difficult but we will do our best he pledged he would not rest in ensuring that the next five years would be unbearable for those bent on sabotaging government policies adding that the bank would do anything to bring such persons to book we need your prayers because the road ahead is still very tough so i appeal to all nigerians to respect the policies and laws of the country part of the problems we have is lack of respect for our policies nigeria is very good at putting in place policies that are sound and workable but implementation is almost zero and that must change the governor said on belief that the bank was operating multiple exchange rate he said it was not true according to him the bank only have multiple windows to make it easy for nigerians who make use of foreign exchange and in spite of the multiple windows there is convergence of rate with about n360 to a dollar in his remarks chairman of the senate committee sen rafiu adebayo said that the committee would put its report together and submit to the senate in plenary for further action he commended emefiele s effort in stabilising the economy through various initiatives and urged him to put in more effort in ensuring that some economic challenges currently bedevilling the country were tackled the senate had on may 9 read a letter from buhari requesting the confirmation of the cbn governor for a second term it thereafter directed its committee on banking insurance and other financial institutions on monday to screen the appointee and report back
it is a pleasure to be here at the national tax association annual spring symposium just as it may take the tax experts and practitioners here today some time to disentangle the longer term implications of recent major changes to tax policy so too we are in the process of analyzing the lessons for monetary policy of apparent post crisis changes in the relationships among employment inflation and interest rates 1 the congress has assigned the federal reserve the job of using monetary policy to achieve maximum employment and price stability price stability means moderate and stable inflation which the federal reserve has defined to be 2 percent inflation maximum employment is understood as the highest level of employment consistent with price stability in the aftermath of the great recession which had deep and persistent effects it is important to understand whether there have been long lasting changes in the relationships among employment inflation and interest rates in order to ensure our policy framework remains effective employment and inflation this expansion will soon become the longest on record in the united states growth has persisted throughout the past decade overcoming downdrafts from abroad and pullbacks in fiscal support earlier in the expansion and benefiting last year from a large fiscal boost recent data confirm that consumers remain confident workers are productive and businesses are hiring although trade conflict is creating uncertainty the job market is strong at 3 6 percent the unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the crisis at 80 percent the employment rate for workers in their prime working age years a more comprehensive measure of slack that includes shifts in labor force participation as well as unemployment has recently risen close to its pre crisis level in contrast the picture on inflation is puzzling this far into an expansion despite the strengthening of the labor market the measure of core inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices did not move up to 2 percent on a sustained basis until last year and in the most recent reading the 12 month change has moved down to 1 6 percent other inflation measures paint a somewhat more reassuring picture the dallas fed s trimmed mean measure of inflation which provides a different way to filter out idiosyncratic movements in various components of inflation has increased 2 percent in the past 12 months slightly higher than its level of 1 9 percent for the two previous years 2 the new normal since the great recession there have been several changes in macroeconomic relationships which i refer to as the new normal 3 now is a good time to assess the characteristics of the new normal and what they mean for monetary policy the emerging contours of today s new normal are defined by low sensitivity of inflation to changes in labor market slack a low long term neutral rate of interest and low underlying trend inflation let me take each in turn in today s new normal price inflation has not moved up consistently as the labor market has strengthened considerably over the course of the long expansion this is what economists mean when they say the phillips curve is very flat the historical relationship between resource slack and price inflation appears to have broken down 4 although wage growth has been moving progressively higher as labor market slack has diminished broader price inflation has remained muted another important feature of today s new normal is that the long run neutral interest rate seems to be lower than it was historically the neutral rate of interest refers to the level of the federal funds rate that would maintain the economy at full employment and 2 percent inflation if no tailwinds or headwinds were buffeting the economy the decline in the neutral rate likely reflects a variety of forces globally such as the aging of the population in many large economies some slowing in the rate of productivity growth and increases in the demand for safe assets when one looks at the federal reserve s summary of economic projections sep it is striking that over the past five years since the sep interest rate projections first became available the median estimate of the long run federal funds rate has declined 1 1 2 percentage points from 4 1 4 percent to 2 3 4 percent going back further to the two decades before the crisis shows a similar decline in today s long run neutral rate relative to earlier blue chip consensus forecasts of the long run federal funds rate 5 third underlying trend inflation the trend in inflation after filtering out idiosyncratic and transitory factors appears to be somewhat below the federal reserve s goal of 2 percent this raises the risk that households and businesses could come to expect inflation to run persistently below the federal reserve s target and could change their behavior in a way that reinforces that expectation expectations are an important determinant of actual inflation because wage and price behavior by businesses and households is partly based on expectations of future inflation while low inflation and low interest rates have many benefits the new normal presents a challenge for the conventional approach to monetary policy in which the federal reserve could rely on changes in the level of the federal funds rate to achieve its inflation and employment goals in past recessions the federal reserve has typically cut interest rates by 4 to 5 percentage points in order to support household and business spending and hiring with the long run neutral rate low and with underlying trend inflation somewhat below target nominal interest rates are likely to remain below those levels which therefore leaves less room to cut rates as much as needed with less room to ease financial conditions and support economic activity using our conventional policy tool the economy may endure prolonged periods during and after recessions with short term interest rates pinned at their effective lower bound that of course was what happened following the financial crisis when the federal reserve kept interest rates close to zero from december 2008 through november 2015 that constraint limits the federal reserve s ability to provide stimulus through its conventional tool and thus could tend to leave inflation lower than it would otherwise be and unemployment higher the experience of several years with the federal funds rate pinned at its effective lower bound and actual inflation below our target could weigh on expectations for future inflation and thereby influence the behavior of households and businesses that helps determine wages and prices the experience of a sustained period of low inflation could depress underlying trend inflation by feeding into lower inflation expectations further reducing nominal interest rates and the space to cut interest rates in what could become a downward spiral 6 so we need to be especially careful to preserve as much of our conventional policy space as we can while exploring mechanisms to augment the effectiveness of our framework 7 maximum employment in the new normal the new normal has some important benefits with subdued inflation the sustained expansion has drawn workers back into the labor market after a damaging recession the unemployment rate is approaching a 50 year low and the overall labor force participation rate has remained constant despite the long term aging of the population that would otherwise be pushing participation lower like the overall unemployment rate broader measures of labor market slack are also lower than their pre crisis levels the bureau of labor statistics u 6 measure shows that two groups have recently shrunk to pre crisis levels after rising considerably during the recession those working part time who would prefer full time employment and people marginally attached to the labor force who have looked for work in the previous year but stopped looking more recently the strong labor market is leading to employment gains among workers with disabilities research suggests it may be helping to narrow some of the long standing disparities for some racial minorities although this development is tentative and modest 8 we hear from business contacts that they are now hiring workers they may not previously have considered during the recession the evidence suggests that many employers raised their requirements for many job categories as labor markets have tightened employers in certain sectors occupations and areas of the country report they are loosening requirements and investing more in training that means today s economy is providing opportunities for workers who might previously have been left on the sidelines including those with records of past incarceration or who lack a particular certification or degree given that the large majority of working age households those at the middle and lower ends of the income distribution rely primarily on wage income advancing our employment mandate has served the country well in today s new normal with the low responsiveness of inflation to labor market tightness there appears to be little evidence so far of a tradeoff with our price stability objective the sustained strengthening of the labor market also adds to the productive capacity of the economy by attracting people on the sidelines to join or rejoin the labor force and move into employment what about the risks of course there are also risks the past three downturns were precipitated not by rising inflation pressure but rather by the buildup of financial imbalances extended periods of above potential growth and low interest rates tend to be accompanied by rapid credit growth and elevated asset valuations which tend to boost downside risks to the economy 9 it is not hard to see why a high pressure economy might be associated with elevated financial imbalances especially late in the cycle as an expansion continues the memory of the previous recession fades profits tend to rise experienced loss rates on loans are low and people tend to project recent trends into the future which leads financial market participants and borrowers to become overly optimistic risk appetite rises asset valuations become stretched and credit is available on easier terms and to riskier borrowers than earlier in the cycle when memories of losses were still fresh historically when the phillips curve was steeper inflation tended to rise as the economy heated up which naturally prompted the federal reserve to raise interest rates in turn the interest rate increases would have the collateral effect of damping increases in asset prices and risk appetites with a flat phillips curve inflation does not rise as much as resource utilization tightens and accordingly provides less necessity for the federal reserve to raise rates to restrictive levels at the same time low interest rates along with sustained strong economic conditions are conducive to increasing risk appetites prompting reach for yield behavior and boosting financial excesses late in an expansion with the forces holding down interest rates likely to persist valuation pressures and risky corporate debt such as leveraged lending could well remain at elevated levels elevated valuations and corporate debt could leave the economy more vulnerable to negative shocks the market volatility in december is a reminder of how sensitive markets can be to downside surprises a key implication of the weakening in the relationship between inflation and employment then is that we should not assume monetary policy will act to restrain the financial cycle as much as previously as a consequence policymakers may need to think differently about the interplay of the financial and business cycles due to the combination of a low neutral rate a flat phillips curve and low underlying inflation with financial stability risks likely to be more tightly linked to the business cycle than in the past it may make sense to take actions other than tightening monetary policy to temper the financial cycle in order to enable monetary policy to focus on supporting the return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent target on a sustained basis along with maximum employment we should be looking to countercyclical tools to temper the financial cycle one tool other central banks have been using to help temper the financial cycle is the countercyclical capital buffer ccyb the ccyb provides regulators with the authority to require large banks to build up an extra capital buffer as financial risks mount 10 although the ccyb was authorized as part of the post crisis package of reforms so far the federal reserve has chosen not to use it turning on the ccyb would build an extra layer of resilience and signal restraint helping to damp the rising vulnerability of the overall system moreover because the ccyb is explicitly countercyclical it is intended to be cut if the outlook deteriorates boosting the ability of banks to make loans when extending credit is most needed and providing a valuable signal about policymakers intentions this feature proved to be valuable in the united kingdom in the wake of the brexit referendum if countercyclical tools and other regulatory safeguards are not adequate over the cycle monetary policy will need to carry a greater burden in leaning against financial excesses that would be unfortunate because adding financial stability concerns to the burden of conventional monetary policy might undermine sustained achievement of our employment and inflation goals because the financial cycle is today likely to be tempered less than in the past by material increases in interest rates as the economy expands the appropriate level of bank capital for today s conditions is unlikely to be the same as in past business cycles because interest rates likely will do less than in past cycles regulatory buffers will need to do more as a consequence now is a bad time to be weakening the core resilience of our largest banking institutions or to be weakening oversight over the nonbank financial system instead we should be safeguarding the capital and liquidity buffers of banks at the center of the system carefully monitoring risks in the nonbank sector and making good use of the countercyclical tool that we have achieving our inflation objective on a sustained basis finally let us turn to the apparent softness in underlying trend inflation one hypothesis for the flat phillips curve is that central banks have been so effective in anchoring inflation expectations that tightening resource utilization is no longer transmitted to price inflation 11 another possibility is that structural factors such as administrative changes to health care costs globalization or technological enabled disruption have been dominant in recent years masking the operation of cyclical forces 12 regardless because inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon the federal reserve has the capacity and the responsibility to ensure inflation expectations are firmly anchored at and not below our target as i have argued in the past the fact that inflation has been running somewhat below our longer run goal of 2 percent may not be entirely due to labor market slack or to transitory shocks it also likely reflects some softening in inflation s underlying trend 13 first estimates of underlying inflation based on statistical filters are lower than they were before the financial crisis and are currently below 2 percent second estimates of longer run inflation expectations based on the university of michigan surveys of consumers and on inflation compensation from financial market pricing are also running lower than before the financial crisis 14 our goal now is to get underlying trend inflation around our target on a sustained basis what would this take we can get some sense from statistical models although there is no one widely agreed upon method of measuring underlying inflation one statistical approach that has received attention in recent years captures the idea that underlying inflation responds to the experience with actual inflation and that this responsiveness varies over time 15 we can use such an approach to get an idea of how much and how quickly underlying inflation might respond to any particular path for actual inflation it provides some reassurance that our goal may be achievable if inflation moves only slightly above 2 percent for a couple of years the sep inflation projections of committee members suggest that many have over the past year or so envisaged a few years of a mild overshoot 16 of course it is not entirely clear how to move underlying trend inflation smoothly to our target on a sustained basis in the presence of a very flat phillips curve one possibility we might refer to as opportunistic reflation would be to take advantage of a modest increase in actual inflation to demonstrate to the public our commitment to our inflation goal on a symmetric basis 17 for example suppose that an unexpected increase in core import price inflation drove overall inflation modestly above 2 percent for a couple of years the federal reserve could use that opportunity to communicate that a mild overshooting of inflation is consistent with our goals and to align policy with that statement such an approach could help demonstrate to the public that the committee is serious about achieving its 2 percent inflation objective on a sustained basis conclusion in today s new normal it is important to achieve inflation and inflation expectations around our 2 percent target on a sustained basis while guarding against financial imbalances through active use of countercyclical tools we want to be mindful of the risk of financial imbalances that could amplify any shock and help tip the economy into recession which the federal reserve has less conventional space to address in today s low interest rate environment in my view it is therefore wise to proceed cautiously helping to sustain the expansion and further gains in employment and with appropriate regulatory safeguards that reduce the risk of dangerous financial imbalances 1 i am grateful to john roberts of the federal reserve board for his assistance in preparing this text these remarks represent my own views which do not necessarily represent those of the

associated press unless you re into hearing your president take swipes at progressive causes like transgender advocacy and anything beholden to the ideas of karl marx then brazil s jair bolsonaro has been a disappointment his popularity is in decline though more people approve of him than disapprove he s not quite the equivalent of president trump whose approval level struggles to break 50 his attitude is similar though you either love him or you hate him and four months into his presidency shows no signs of that abating bolsonaro s blockbuster pension reform is a no show investors thought brazil s new government would be getting somewhere by now they re not house speaker rodrigo maia said this week that a vote can be expected at some point in september economic growth forecasts are in decline and now under 1 5 based on a survey of 81 economists published in the brazil central bank s weekly focus report released on wednesday a month ago gdp was forecast to end the year at 1 95 next year s growth rate is still forecast to come in at 2 5 though that is a moving target 2016 bloomberg finance lp the brazilian real is back over four to the dollar it keeps getting weaker unemployment is also deteriorating são paulo brazil s biggest city saw its unemployment rate go from 12 4 in the fourth quarter to 13 5 in the first never mind that the christmas holiday may have helped with employment in november and december either number is abysmal a year ago unemployment in the city was 14 so it s taken 12 months to trim half a percent off that rate in brazil s most populous workaholic city the national unemployment rate is 12 7 down from 13 1 a year ago maybe there is some light to be seen here if so it s a dim bulb for sure to be fair bolsonaro inherited an economic and a political mess a political war zone is more like it with casualties everywhere impeachments jail the constant threat of arrest warrants or the federal police showing up at your door this is the life of a brazilian politician today too much of their time is spent proving their innocence to one another or ridiculing those that were not fortunate enough to have gotten away with brazil s version of highway robbery associated press bolsonaro s new government led by a ragtag group of freshman congressmen has struggled to form a unified front on key issues like pension reform the reforms approved by the previous president michel temer moved along at a faster pace anyone who hoped bolsonaro could continue that has been let down so far many in his circle are new to this level of political power and responsibility it s early this is only a four and a half month old government it s been a rocky start yesterday saw a multitude of students public university professors education advocates and general anti bolsonaro activists taking to the streets to protest a federal university budget freeze announed by the education ministry bloomberg reported that the freeze amounted to 420 million placed on hold rather than actual cuts this year however cuts are on the table for public schools associated press one of the best things brazil s economy has going for it right now is 6 5 interest rates and 4 9 inflation credit hasn t been this cheap in brazil since the days when henrique meirelles was happily running the central bank oil production is also on the rise which is good for state controlled petrobras and good for government coffers other than that brazil s place as the emerging market darling of 2019 was short lived the msci brazil is down 0 36 year to date and down 5 27 over the last 12 months according to economist gustavo arruda of bnp paribas in são paulo brazil s gdp contracted by about 0 3 in the last quarter the industrial and services sectors were weaker than expected corporate investments are not picking up the slack if our gdp forecast for this year is confirmed it would be the first contraction since the fourth quarter of 2016 arruda says that s when brazil was mired in an impeachment trial with temer s president dilma rousseff it s possible that the weak first quarter could lead to a revision of the fourth quarter resulting in another negative quarterly growth rate that characterizes a technical recession he says bolsonaro wants the government to spend less just like the government before him wanted to get there the biggest obstacle is existing public pension law that law has to be changed in order to fulfil the constitutional amendment to cap spending if it fails then the government will have to look to make cuts elsewhere this conundrum is great for the opposition terrible for bolsonaro no one likes austerity if the bolsonaro administration is looking to reduce expenditures for education and healthcare in order to make up for what will likely be a relatively weak pension reform he could end up guaranteeing political victories for new young left wing politicians in the next election cycle warning this crop of angry organic vegan left wingers are nothing at all like luiz inacio lula da silva the jailed ex president and founder of the workers party brazil s largest left of center political party they have more in common economically with cristina kirchner in argentina and more in common politically with alexandria ocasio cortez the progressive congresswoman from new york than they do lula lula is the old guard a joe biden to the umpteen number of democrats seeking the nomination to represent the party in the 2020 presidential campaign while some of them may be affiliated with the workers party they are definitely not lula peace and love types they have different fights and different issues from lula who focused almost entirely on labor rights and support for the poor the new government s lack of experience in dealing with congress and the decision to submit a new social security reform proposal instead of taking advantage of the temer proposal that was ready to be voted by the lower house increased uncertainties for brazil businesses and it s pulled the rug out from under brazil investors we expected the lower house to approve pension reform in the first semester says arruda we now expect this to happen only in august after the midyear break arruda may have to wait a bit longer than that

it is a pleasure to be here at the national tax association annual spring symposium just as it may take the tax experts and practitioners here today some time to disentangle the longer term implications of recent major changes to tax policy so too we are in the process of analyzing the lessons for monetary policy of apparent post crisis changes in the relationships among employment inflation and interest rates 1 the congress has assigned the federal reserve the job of using monetary policy to achieve maximum employment and price stability price stability means moderate and stable inflation which the federal reserve has defined to be 2 percent inflation maximum employment is understood as the highest level of employment consistent with price stability in the aftermath of the great recession which had deep and persistent effects it is important to understand whether there have been long lasting changes in the relationships among employment inflation and interest rates in order to ensure our policy framework remains effective employment and inflation this expansion will soon become the longest on record in the united states growth has persisted throughout the past decade overcoming downdrafts from abroad and pullbacks in fiscal support earlier in the expansion and benefiting last year from a large fiscal boost recent data confirm that consumers remain confident workers are productive and businesses are hiring although trade conflict is creating uncertainty the job market is strong at 3 6 percent the unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the crisis at 80 percent the employment rate for workers in their prime working age yearsâ a more comprehensive measure of slack that includes shifts in labor force participation as well as unemploymentâ has recently risen close to its pre crisis level in contrast the picture on inflation is puzzling this far into an expansion despite the strengthening of the labor market the measure of core inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices did not move up to 2 percent on a sustained basis until last year and in the most recent reading the 12 month change has moved down to 1 6 percent other inflation measures paint a somewhat more reassuring picture the dallas fed s trimmed mean measure of inflation which provides a different way to filter out idiosyncratic movements in various components of inflation has increased 2 percent in the past 12 months slightly higher than its level of 1 9 percent for the two previous years 2 the new normal since the great recession there have been several changes in macroeconomic relationships which i refer to as the new normal 3 now is a good time to assess the characteristics of the new normal and what they mean for monetary policy the emerging contours of today s new normal are defined by low sensitivity of inflation to changes in labor market slack a low long term neutral rate of interest and low underlying trend inflation let me take each in turn in today s new normal price inflation has not moved up consistently as the labor market has strengthened considerably over the course of the long expansion this is what economists mean when they say the phillips curve is very flat the historical relationship between resource slack and price inflation appears to have broken down 4 although wage growth has been moving progressively higher as labor market slack has diminished broader price inflation has remained muted another important feature of today s new normal is that the long run neutral interest rate seems to be lower than it was historically the neutral rate of interest refers to the level of the federal funds rate that would maintain the economy at full employment and 2 percent inflation if no tailwinds or headwinds were buffeting the economy the decline in the neutral rate likely reflects a variety of forces globally such as the aging of the population in many large economies some slowing in the rate of productivity growth and increases in the demand for safe assets when one looks at the federal reserve s summary of economic projections sep it is striking that over the past five years since the sep interest rate projections first became available the median estimate of the long run federal funds rate has declined 1 1 2 percentage points from 4â 1 4 percent to 2 3 4 percent going back further to the two decades before the crisis shows a similar decline in today s long run neutral rate relative to earlier blue chip consensus forecasts of the long run federal funds rate 5 third underlying trend inflationâ the trend in inflation after filtering out idiosyncratic and transitory factorsâ appears to be somewhat below the federal reserve s goal of 2 percent this raises the risk that households and businesses could come to expect inflation to run persistently below the federal reserve s target and could change their behavior in a way that reinforces that expectation expectations are an important determinant of actual inflation because wage and price behavior by businesses and households is partly based on expectations of future inflation while low inflation and low interest rates have many benefits the new normal presents a challenge for the conventional approach to monetary policy in which the federal reserve could rely on changes in the level of the federal funds rate to achieve its inflation and employment goals in past recessions the federal reserve has typically cut interest rates by 4 to 5 percentage points in order to support household and business spending and hiring with the long run neutral rate low and with underlying trend inflation somewhat below target nominal interest rates are likely to remain below those levels which therefore leaves less room to cut rates as much as needed with less room to ease financial conditions and support economic activity using our conventional policy tool the economy may endure prolonged periods during and after recessions with short term interest rates pinned at their effective lower bound that of course was what happened following the financial crisis when the federal reserve kept interest rates close to zero from december 2008 through november 2015 that constraint limits the federal reserve s ability to provide stimulus through its conventional tool and thus could tend to leave inflation lower than it would otherwise be and unemployment higher the experience of several years with the federal funds rate pinned at its effective lower bound and actual inflation below our target could weigh on expectations for future inflation and thereby influence the behavior of households and businesses that helps determine wages and prices the experience of a sustained period of low inflation could depress underlying trend inflation by feeding into lower inflation expectations further reducing nominal interest rates and the space to cut interest rates in what could become a downward spiral 6 so we need to be especially careful to preserve as much of our conventional policy space as we can while exploring mechanisms to augment the effectiveness of our framework 7 maximum employment in the new normal the new normal has some important benefits with subdued inflation the sustained expansion has drawn workers back into the labor market after a damaging recession the unemployment rate is approaching a 50 year low and the overall labor force participation rate has remained constant despite the long term aging of the population that would otherwise be pushing participation lower like the overall unemployment rate broader measures of labor market slack are also lower than their pre crisis levels the bureau of labor statistics u 6 measure shows that two groups have recently shrunk to pre crisis levels after rising considerably during the recession those working part time who would prefer full time employment and people marginally attached to the labor force who have looked for work in the previous year but stopped looking more recently the strong labor market is leading to employment gains among workers with disabilities research suggests it may be helping to narrow some of the long standing disparities for some racial minorities although this development is tentative and modest 8 we hear from business contacts that they are now hiring workers they may not previously have considered during the recession the evidence suggests that many employers raised their requirements for many job categories as labor markets have tightened employers in certain sectors occupations and areas of the country report they are loosening requirements and investing more in training that means today s economy is providing opportunities for workers who might previously have been left on the sidelinesâ including those with records of past incarceration or who lack a particular certification or degree given that the large majority of working age households those at the middle and lower ends of the income distribution rely primarily on wage income advancing our employment mandate has served the country well in today s new normal with the low responsiveness of inflation to labor market tightness there appears to be little evidence so far of a tradeoff with our price stability objective the sustained strengthening of the labor market also adds to the productive capacity of the economy by attracting people on the sidelines to join or rejoin the labor force and move into employment what about the risks of course there are also risks the past three downturns were precipitated not by rising inflation pressure but rather by the buildup of financial imbalances extended periods of above potential growth and low interest rates tend to be accompanied by rapid credit growth and elevated asset valuations which tend to boost downside risks to the economy 9 it is not hard to see why a high pressure economy might be associated with elevated financial imbalances especially late in the cycle as an expansion continues the memory of the previous recession fades profits tend to rise experienced loss rates on loans are low and people tend to project recent trends into the future which leads financial market participants and borrowers to become overly optimistic risk appetite rises asset valuations become stretched and credit is available on easier terms and to riskier borrowers than earlier in the cycle when memories of losses were still fresh historically when the phillips curve was steeper inflation tended to rise as the economy heated up which naturally prompted the federal reserve to raise interest rates in turn the interest rate increases would have the collateral effect of damping increases in asset prices and risk appetites with a flat phillips curve inflation does not rise as much as resource utilization tightens and accordingly provides less necessity for the federal reserve to raise rates to restrictive levels at the same time low interest rates along with sustained strong economic conditions are conducive to increasing risk appetites prompting reach for yield behavior and boosting financial excesses late in an expansion with the forces holding down interest rates likely to persist valuation pressures and risky corporate debt such as leveraged lending could well remain at elevated levels elevated valuations and corporate debt could leave the economy more vulnerable to negative shocks the market volatility in december is a reminder of how sensitive markets can be to downside surprises a key implication of the weakening in the relationship between inflation and employment then is that we should not assume monetary policy will act to restrain the financial cycle as much as previously as a consequence policymakers may need to think differently about the interplay of the financial and business cycles due to the combination of a low neutral rate a flat phillips curve and low underlying inflation with financial stability risks likely to be more tightly linked to the business cycle than in the past it may make sense to take actions other than tightening monetary policy to temper the financial cycle in order to enable monetary policy to focus on supporting the return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent target on a sustained basis along with maximum employment we should be looking to countercyclical tools to temper the financial cycle one tool other central banks have been using to help temper the financial cycle is the countercyclical capital buffer ccyb the ccyb provides regulators with the authority to require large banks to build up an extra capital buffer as financial risks mount 10 although the ccyb was authorized as part of the post crisis package of reforms so far the federal reserve has chosen not to use it turning on the ccyb would build an extra layer of resilience and signal restraint helping to damp the rising vulnerability of the overall system moreover because the ccyb is explicitly countercyclical it is intended to be cut if the outlook deteriorates boosting the ability of banks to make loans when extending credit is most needed and providing a valuable signal about policymakers intentions this feature proved to be valuable in the united kingdom in the wake of the brexit referendum if countercyclical tools and other regulatory safeguards are not adequate over the cycle monetary policy will need to carry a greater burden in leaning against financial excesses that would be unfortunate because adding financial stability concerns to the burden of conventional monetary policy might undermine sustained achievement of our employment and inflation goals because the financial cycle is today likely to be tempered less than in the past by material increases in interest rates as the economy expands the appropriate level of bank capital for today s conditions is unlikely to be the same as in past business cycles because interest rates likely will do less than in past cycles regulatory buffers will need to do more as a consequence now is a bad time to be weakening the core resilience of our largest banking institutions or to be weakening oversight over the nonbank financial system instead we should be safeguarding the capital and liquidity buffers of banks at the center of the system carefully monitoring risks in the nonbank sector and making good use of the countercyclical tool that we have achieving our inflation objective on a sustained basis finally let us turn to the apparent softness in underlying trend inflation one hypothesis for the flat phillips curve is that central banks have been so effective in anchoring inflation expectations that tightening resource utilization is no longer transmitted to price inflation 11 another possibility is that structural factors such as administrative changes to health care costs globalization or technological enabled disruption have been dominant in recent years masking the operation of cyclical forces 12 regardless because inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon the federal reserve has the capacity and the responsibility to ensure inflation expectations are firmly anchored atâ and not belowâ our target as i have argued in the past the fact that inflation has been running somewhat below our longer run goal of 2 percent may not be entirely due to labor market slack or to transitory shocks it also likely reflects some softening in inflation s underlying trend 13 first estimates of underlying inflation based on statistical filters are lower than they were before the financial crisis and are currently below 2 percent second estimates of longer run inflation expectations based on the university of michigan surveys of consumers and on inflation compensation from financial market pricing are also running lower than before the financial crisis 14 our goal now is to get underlying trend inflation around our target on a sustained basis what would this take we can get some sense from statistical models although there is no one widely agreed upon method of measuring underlying inflation one statistical approach that has received attention in recent years captures the idea that underlying inflation responds to the experience with actual inflation and that this responsiveness varies over time 15 we can use such an approach to get an idea of how much and how quickly underlying inflation might respond to any particular path for actual inflation it provides some reassurance that our goal may be achievable if inflation moves only slightly above 2 percent for a couple of years the sep inflation projections of committee members suggest that many have over the past year or so envisaged a few years of a mild overshoot 16 of course it is not entirely clear how to move underlying trend inflation smoothly to our target on a sustained basis in the presence of a very flat phillips curve one possibility we might refer to as opportunistic reflation would be to take advantage of a modest increase in actual inflation to demonstrate to the public our commitment to our inflation goal on a symmetric basis 17 for example suppose that an unexpected increase in core import price inflation drove overall inflation modestly above 2 percent for a couple of years the federal reserve could use that opportunity to communicate that a mild overshooting of inflation is consistent with our goals and to align policy with that statement such an approach could help demonstrate to the public that the committee is serious about achieving its 2 percent inflation objective on a sustained basis conclusion in today s new normal it is important to achieve inflation and inflation expectations around our 2 percent target on a sustained basis while guarding against financial imbalances through active use of countercyclical tools we want to be mindful of the risk of financial imbalances that could amplify any shock and help tip the economy into recession which the federal reserve has less conventional space to address in today s low interest rate environment in my view it is therefore wise to proceed cautiously helping to sustain the expansion and further gains in employment and with appropriate regulatory safeguards that reduce the risk of dangerous financial

the new york times is touting a few city managers in hard hit upstate new york who are hoping to rejuvenate their local economies by attracting a share of the many illegal and legal immigrants who enter the united states each year but the soft focus pro migration article also provides an unpaid boost for the economic innovation group which is an investor funded group pressing congress to allow state legislators to import their own extra supply of cheap immigrant workers consumers and renters city managers are testing out a new strategy luring refugees who have settled in other parts of the united states to move to new york according to the new york times they are advertising job placement english language and housing services hoping to draw enough people to offset the shortfall of american residents the article said the region is doomed unless it can import more migrants the new york times suggested the real fear for upstate cities is that if we don t keep our population growing we will fall into an endless cycle of decline said a highlighted quote from assemblyman sean ryan a democrat from the upstate city of buffalo but there are at least several alternatives to the eig s push to grow the economy by importing even more immigrants for example cities can compete to attract the roughly 12 million americans who are still looking for decent jobs including many sidelined people in west virginia and other states who were hit hard by free trade city officials can also compete to attract millions of young americans are looking for wage raises and decent housing to grow their own families president donald trump is rolling back some of the free trade rules that encouraged u s investors to welcome low skill somali immigrants to utica after they had exported the region s high skill manufacturing jobs to cheap workers in china yet the nyt prefers to tout the recruitment of the somali refugee who moved to utica ny and is now working in a retail store abdiwahab awayle 36 first moved to erie pa in 2017 from a refugee camp in kenya but after three months he stopped receiving government help to learn english and to find a job struggling to make ends meet while working at a plastic production company he decided to move with his wife and five children to utica where he heard from somali friends that rents were lower and that better paying manufacturing jobs were available the center for refugees they said offered free english classes the government imports roughly one million legal workers consumers and renters each year the nation s divided government also accepts more than one million illegal and semi legal migrants in 2019 along with at least one million temporary workers this huge supply of imported workers consumers and renters prefer to cluster in coastal cities and so it also drains job creating investment wages and real estate values that would otherwise go to the four million americans graduates each year and to the children young workers and homeowners in america s heartland towns and cities for example the nyt article touts a few hundred migrants who have moved to the upstate cities even though at least 3 75 million other legal immigrants and about 750 000 illegal migrants have chosen to live in new york city those 4 5 million migrants comprise at least one quarter of the city s workforce and their imported willingness to accept low wages is a huge federal subsidy to the city s elite because it lowers the price of services such as restaurants for many of the city s upper income professionals in the financial sector the inflated population of migrants also spikes rental income for housing investors despite the obvious and huge economic skew enabled by legal and illegal migration the nyt tries to blame the upstate cities problems on trump s campaign promise to reduce the annual inflow of refugees from somalia and other strife torn regions that rejuvenating bounce for cities such as utica buffalo and syracuse ended after the trump administration drastically cut the number of refugees allowed into the country new york received 1 281 refugees in the last fiscal year compared with 5 026 just two years before according to the state department officials in those cities worried they had lost a small but important bulwark against population decline the nyt article also downplays a second cause of the decline in upstate new york the government s decision to export the region s manufacturing base to cheap labor workforces in china via the free trade treaties the article hints at the disaster a manufacturing decline left homes vacant and storefronts dark while it tacitly endorses a two class economy built on cheap labor in contrast trump s hire american policies are reversing the cheap labor policy by curbing both free trade and immigration trump s lower immigration higher wages policy are shifting money from investors to workers according to a growing number of news articles a may 14 report from wisconsin by the associated press reported nik rettinger the 28 year old first vice chairman of waukesha county gop said he knows several people who were trump skeptics but have come around to him in no small part because of the economy we want people moving out of their parents basements he said a lot of people said i don t know if he can do it now they think he s done it on may 12 the wall street journal reported growing wages and spiking productivity in trump s hire american economy as the job market tightens some small firms are experimenting with new ways of recruiting judy briggs owner of a cleaning business in boston with seven employees has hired three people since she began providing bonuses for referrals in november workers can earn 100 if a new recruit stays 30 days plus 250 after 90 days and 500 after one year a small firm in fort smith ark that conducts employment background checks has spent about 350 000 over three years to automate repetitive tasks the 16 current employees are performing twice as much work as when we had 28 employees said its president dean wilson indiana restaurant workers are gaining wage increases training better conditions from employers in pres donald trump s hire american low immigration tight labor economy meanwhile biz lobbyists progressives urge more migration neil munro neilmunrodc april 25 2019 the nyt s cheerleading for cheap immigrant labor is also tacit support for the eig s advocacy for a law that would import many more immigrants for state governments the nyt article included a brief reference to the political campaign noting in trying to draw upon the existing pool of refugees in the united states new york is competing against places that have experienced similar declines as the country s population growth has fallen to 80 year lows between 2007 and 2017 80 percent of american counties with a combined population of 149 million americans lost prime working age adults according to a recent report from the economic innovation group a washington think tank the eig is not a mere think tank it is an advocacy group founded by a team of investors including sean parker a founder of facebook the president is jon lettieri whose bio says prior to eig john was the vice president of public policy and government affairs for a leading business association the organization for international investment ofii where he led the organization s state and federal policy work on such issues as tax reform trade investment promotion and manufacturing eig s april 2019 proposal for more imported workers and consumers admits that the current immigration policy favors large cities saying it currently serves to increase the regional disparities highlighted above the fastest growing decile of counties has proportionally more skilled immigrants than the slowest growing one by a factor of eight what is more the 20 most populous u s counties currently contain 37 of the country s skilled immigrants compared to only 19 of the country s total population more broadly the 5 of counties with the highest home prices have over half of the country s skilled immigrants and 90 of skilled immigrants live in the top one third of counties with the highest housing prices the group also admitted that more immigration raises housing prices which is bad for home buyers such as young married americans seeking to start a family cheaper housing is good for first time home buyers and renters says the eig proposal which is titled could a heartland visa help struggling regions but instead of reducing immigration to spur income gains and family formation by many americans and also to help spread job creating investment beyond the major coastal cities the eig just urges more immigration current skilled immigration policy largely benefits populous booming metro areas but fails most heartland communities a new program of place based visas let s call them heartland visas could become a powerful economic development tool for communities facing the consequences of demographic stagnation but not content to simply manage decline the visas would constitute a new additive and voluntary pathway for skilled immigrants to come to the united states eligible communities would opt in to hosting visa holders who would provide a much needed injection of human capital and entrepreneurial vitality into parts of the country that retain considerable economic potential the extra immigrants would help boost housing prices the eig proposal notes the relationship between population growth and housing demand is clear more people means more demand for housing and fewer people means less demand as a result a shrinking population will lead to falling prices and a deteriorating vacancy plagued housing stock that may take generations to clear the potential for skilled immigrants to boost local housing markets is clear notably economist albert saiz 2007 found a 1 increase in population from immigration causes housing rents and house prices in u s cities to rise commensurately by 1 the eig report praises a huge outsourcing proposal which was announced by wisconsin gop sen ron johnson in 2017 and which was immediately buried once it was exposed by breitbart news according to eig most notably in the united states in 2017 senator ron johnson r wi introduced the state sponsored visa pilot program act s 1040 which would have instituted a state based visa system the bill proposed allocating up to 500 000 visas annually to the 50 states and washington dc with 5 000 per state as a baseline and the rest allocated in proportion to population this proposal would be a temporary working visa with the goal of taking a more federalist approach to immigration the policy would allow states to sponsor foreign workers investors and entrepreneurs and determine themselves the criteria used in its 2017 report breitbart news reported the bill would allow states to each get 5 000 visas for additional foreign workers per year plus a population based share of another 245 000 visas plus a share of any visas not used by other states the inflow of foreign workers would start at 495 000 in the first year not counting the additional family members of each imported worker the bill would also create an amnesty because the visas could be given to 11 million plus illegals living in the united states including those who returned to the united states after being deported the senator said he has 50 co sponsors but acknowledged the likely unpopularity of his american replacement bill which is formally titled the state sponsored visa pilot program of 2017 the acknowledgment came at the end of his statement when he thanked the cato group and his house counterpart colorado gop rep ken buck for backing the replacement bill let s face it to have the courage we re probably a lightning rod on this bill johnsson said in his videotaped speech johnson also said the imported workers are needed to replace the many americans lost in unemployment and drug addiction johnson spoke at length about the new plague in our country and quoted from an article describing the huge extent of worker drop out amid the post 2008 combination punch of recession and mass immigration the subsequent social pathologies i would argue are being driven by government policy johnson told the hearing room and he cited medicaid s distribution of free opioids throughout much of the country but it is not going to be a government program that is going to solve that worker drop out problem johnson continued so the new visa bill he said is targeted to making sure that american businesses have the labor they need johnson s bill was tentatively backed colorado s gop rep ken buck i m not ready to sponsor it in the house yet it is important to take the bill out of the oven when it is baked he said in 2017 in 2019 buck is backing a bill h r 1044 and s 368 that would provide a path to citizenship for hundreds of thousands of indian college graduates if they accept low wages to work college grade jobs in the united states that are also sought by u s graduates weird but true gop and dems in congress are offering fast track green cards to encourage 300 000 vr low wage indian workers to take jobs from middle class american voters graduates fwiw i don t think the pols staffers recognize what they are doing neil munro neilmunrodc march 1 2019 the eig did not respond to questions from breitbart news so far democrats have displayed more enthusiasm for cheap labor immigration plans partly because it provides more taxes to local government and eventually more voters for the democratic party big gov t can fund itself with more immigrants says democratic 2020 candidate pete buttigieg so immigration cuts americans wages and shifts investment wealth from the heartland to the coasts but that s ok b c buttigieg s city might get more taxes neil munro neilmunrodc april 22 2019 for example democratic presidential hopeful mayor pete buttigieg endorsed more immigration during an april 17 campaign in des moines iowa we need people here we need to grow my community if we ve got responsible able bodied people on a path to citizenship send them to south bend because we trying to grow our community and job growth in population growth go hand in hand we know despite what they say about us here in the heartland we know how much our communities benefit from the growth that happens through immigration each year roughly four million young americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or university but the federal government then imports about 1 1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of roughly 1 5 million white collar visa workers including roughly one million h 1b workers and approximately 500 000 blue collar visa workers the government also prints out more than one million work permits for foreigners tolerates about eight million illegal workers and does not punish companies for employing the hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants who sneak across the border or overstay their legal visas each year this policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth for investors because it ensures that employers do not have to compete for american workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions this policy of flooding the market with cheap foreign white collar graduates and blue collar labor shifts also enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors even as it also widens wealth gaps reduces high tech investment increases state and local tax burdens and hurts children s schools and college educations it also pushes americans away from high tech careers and sidelines millions of marginalized americans including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions the labor policy also moves business investment from the heartland to the coasts explodes rents shrivels real estate values in the midwest and rewards investors for creating low tech labor intensive workplaces
foreign instigated demonstrations afoot the united states of america usa s latest zimbabwe travel advisory to americans intending to visit zimbabwe and those in zimbabwe is couched as a routine cautionary statement yet it is laden with a potent message it would be naïve to read the message as targeting americans the message is two fold it is targeting the zimbabwe is open for business policy by portraying zimbabwe as an unsafe destination for investors and tourists alike as there is alleged increased crime and civil unrest wow secondly it gives zimbabwean authorities a sneak peek into the evil machinations intended to destabilise zimbabwe through demonstrations via the usual trojan horses the opposition and the motley host of anti zimbabwe civil society organisations the zimbabwe republic police zrp has already dispelled and dismissed the mischievous placement of zimbabwe on level 2 by the us the police have been conducting routine patrols stop and searches in central business districts industrial and residential areas with a view to get rid of the malady of criminality it is instructive that according to nationmaster com a reputable international statistics website the us is far ahead of zimbabwe in terms of crime rate the graphic here shows a comparative of selected statistics between zimbabwe and the united states on the crime rate dear reader the foregoing statistics expose the folly behind the travel advisory by the us their country is a haven of criminality statistics do not lie if anything americans are safer in zimbabwe than they are in their own country the us is number one in terms of crime in the world the travel advisory by the us has nothing to do with crime and safety it has everything to do with politics and us foreign policy against zimbabwe this piece will not belabour enumerating and explaining the illegal sanctions regime imposed on harare by washington as this is a matter of public record however it is trite to note that the americans are unhappy with the failure of their illegal sanctions regime which has been devastating on zimbabwe but not devastating enough to cause illegal regime change through mass protests remember the illegal sanctions were imposed to make zimbabwe s economy scream as a means to ignite civil protests make no mistake there have been sporadic acts of civil unrest by the opposition and its adjuncts in civil society it is not a secret that powerful super powers such as america through usaid sponsor most of these csos under the guise of promoting civil rights and democracy however harare has been alive to the evil machinations of organisations such as crisis in zimbabwe coalition czc and the zimbabwe congress of trade unions zctu as well as mdc alliance whose leadership openly brag about their close relationship with washington where they wine and dine while inviting more sanctions against zimbabwe the new dispensation under president mnangagwa has been trying to extricate zimbabwe from the economic cesspit that the country was plunged into because of a combination of sanctions and misrule by former president robert mugabe the country has gone on a re engagement offensive under the auspices of the zimbabwe is open for business mantra which most well meaning nations have embraced and shown credible intent to trade and invest with zimbabwe the us appears to be miffed by this progress hence has decided to up the ante against harare through public diplomacy it is now using the travel advisory as a means of scaring away potential investors and tourists yes zimbabwe is under sanctions yes zimbabwe is grappling with exchange rate distortions yes harare is dogged by price hikes as a result of misplaced benchmarking of prices in local currency against the us dollar yes zimbabwe has a high domestic and international debt but if truth be told zimbabwe remains a peaceful country under a legitimately elected president in fact the new dispensation has unveiled a cocktail of socio political economic reforms under the banner of the transitional stabilisation programme tsp tsp is anchored on austerity itself a necessary evil to cut on government expenditure the travel warning by the us should be read as a threat to harare that acts of civil disobedience and violent demonstrations are afoot zimbabweans continue to go about their daily business in a peaceful harmonious and hard working manner they remain dedicated to peace it is thus shocking that america has intelligence that there would be violent protests in the very near future to the extent of warning its citizens to stay away from zimbabwe or if they are in zimbabwe to remain vigilant it is my fervent hope that zimbabwe s security services are alive to this intelligence that there is going to be violent demonstrations the mdc alliance a friend of the west has indicated that soon after its elective congress if ever it happens will roll out a wave of mass protests mdc alliance deputy chairman tendai biti who is aspiring to be that party s vice president openly declared that by december 2019 president mnangagwa would have been jettisoned from number 1 chancellor road in borrowdale the official presidential residence the mdc alliance is obviously planning a sudan in harare the us is privy to this either because they are part of the devious plot or simply because they are reading the public grandstanding by the opposition but am certain harare is aware of the foreign hand behind the mdc alliance and its cooperating partners in civil society it is a public secret that their foreign backers finance all their activities including organising and implementing such devious illegal regime change plots the magnitude of the civil unrest plot can be gleaned from four pointers in the travel advisory namely l stay away from political rallies demonstrations and crowds l monitor local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust your plans l enrol in the smart traveler enrolment programme step to receive alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency and l follow the department of state on facebook and twitter the security services should see that local political actors will be used to execute the demonstrations while the private media and social media would be used to snowball the violent protests aimed at dislodging the government this is the same modus operandi which was used in the january 2019 violent demonstrations however this time it promises to be bigger and more organised to set the mdc alliance s illegal regime change project in motion to be forewarned is to be forewarned the gloves are off
the koch brothers the billionaire plutocrats and gop mega donors network of organizations are railing against president trump s tariffs on china to protect american workers and u s industry this month trump hiked tariffs to 25 percent on about 200 billion worth of chinese manufactured goods trump has also ordered trade officials to begin reviewing the process of increasing tariffs to 25 percent on an additional 300 billion worth of chinese goods in the wake of the latest round of tariffs the koch brothers organizations like the americans for prosperity afp and the libre initiative demand that the trump administration carry out an agenda focused on free trade as the bush and obama administrations did afp president tim phillips said that instead of protecting american industries by slapping tariffs on foreign manufacturers and imports the trump administration should eliminate all tariffs more protectionist measures will continue to undermine the historic pro growth policy achievements fueling our economy countless families factory workers and farmers are feeling the financial strain caused by continued trade escalation rather than continuing to push a strategy where both sides clearly lose the u s should seek the elimination of all tariffs quotas and trade barriers that adversely affect americans adopting a more positive approach will foster growth at home and welcome cooperation from allies and trading partners abroad afp senior policy fellow alison acosta winters published an op ed in the washington examiner in which she declared tariffs are bad and claimed tariffs penalize american workers and consumers scrapping the tariffs would be easy and the right thing to do winters wrote it would help american businesses and consumers libre initiative president daniel garza in a statement said trump s tariffs were specifically harming hispanic american families and claimed the tariffs have increased the tax burden on working families without providing any data tariffs and other trade barriers are another word for tax increases on the products that consumers buy consumers around the world benefit when governments eliminate those barriers they are able to choose from a greater array of products at competitive prices and that competition encourages all producers to keep their prices down exporters benefit when trade barriers are eliminated as it improves their ability to compete and earn a profit hispanic families are directly affected by these trade barriers since so many in our community spend a large portion of our incomes on necessities with that in mind the white house must focus on a realistic plan to eliminate barriers to trade as quickly as possible these barriers are hurting american consumers and undermining the ability of u s companies to compete effectively in the international market they are increasing the tax burden on working families and undoing the positive benefits of tax reductions adopted just a few years ago we need a course change and soon as breitbart news economics editor john carney has chronicled tariffs have not spurred mass unemployment as a study commissioned by the koch brothers claimed last year the 2018 study said trump s imposi9ng of tariffs on foreign goods would throw 2 75 million americans out of work federal labor data reveals that this claim has not panned out likewise american consumers have not been hit with additional product costs due to trump s tariffs on china and imported steel and aluminum department of labor data this month found that its year to year consumer price index had increased just two percent indicating the prices for u s consumers are not rising the way free trade advocates had claimed but unlike a sales tax or a gas tax consumers do not directly pay any tariffs carney wrote in his piece titled the tariff scare narrative has collapsed latest price data show no inflation tariffs are paid by importers often large u s companies that are importing from their own foreign subsidiaries or foreign contractors carney wrote there have been at least 11 100 u s jobs created due to trump s protective tariffs as of august 2018 according to the latest available research this indicates that there were 20 times as many american jobs created in the first half of 2018 thanks to trump s tariffs on imported foreign goods than jobs that were lost patrick courrielche host of the podcast red pilled america recently told breitbart news that it is paramount that the u s focus on maximizing u s jobs and american production rather than prioritizing cheap foreign products people aren t understanding the issue because everyone you speak to on this is like free trade free trade free trade yes of course we have to send this stuff overseas we want cheaper products courrielche said cheaper products are great but at the same time if you don t have a job you can t even afford cheap a harvard harris poll in march found that nine in ten conservatives support reciprocal tariffs that is tariffs which would allow the president to impose the same tariff on foreign imports that are imposed on american manufactured products similarly 80 percent of all u s voters said they support reciprocal tariffs the pro tariff views of the american electorate are in stark contrast to the billionaire donor class which favors a global open markets policy of free trade that outsources american jobs to foreign countries as a result specifically the u s chamber of commerce has attempted to tank the passage of the reciprocal trade act and has united with the rest of the business lobby and republican lawmakers to strip trump of his tariff powers meanwhile there is little to no support for the donor class s preferred economic libertarian agenda since the north american free trade agreement nafta was enacted and china entered the world trade organization wto nearly five million american manufacturing jobs have been eliminated from the american economy the vast elimination of working and middle class jobs and depressed u s wages due to nafta has coincided with a nearly 600 percent increase in trade deficits the u s chamber of commerce and the koch brothers network continue to support nafta one former steel town in west virginia lost 94 percent of its steel jobs because of nafta with nearly 10 000 workers in the town being displaced from the

may 2019 rail news canadian national railway cn photo cn by jeff stagl managing editor on june 6 1919 an act of parliament incorporated cn by combining several railroads that were bankrupt or owned and absorbed by the canadian government cn with the 100th anniversary nearing cn s leaders are reflecting on what s transpired since that group of insolvent and disparate railroads were forged into a new crown corporation the company s evolution into one of north america s best performing railroads both operationally and financially is a compelling story they believe seminal events over the past century include the addition of grand trunk pacific in 1923 and absorption of central vermont railway in 1927 pioneering of two way train phone service in 1930 introduction of continuous welded rail to canada in 1954 use of the nation s first hot box detector in 1961 and acquisitions of illinois central corp in 1999 wisconsin central ltd in 2001 bc rail ltd in 2004 and key portions of the elgin joliet eastern railway in 2009 cn has grown into a transportation services provider with about 27 000 employees and a 20 000 route mile network in canada and mid america on an annual basis revenue exceeds ca 14 billion carloads reach 6 million units and the operating ratio typically is near or below 60 the company has several operating railway subsidiaries owns assets worth about ca 38 billion and provides rail intermodal trucking freight forwarding warehousing and distribution services association of american railroads president and chief executive officer ian jefferies congratulated cn on what he characterizes as 100 incredible years the railroad has served a wide range of customers with integrity and continues to play a role in making the industry smarter safer and more efficient jeffries said in an email the industry continues to evolve and cn is a leader in bringing the freight rail industry into the new era of modern transportation he said to commemorate the centenary anniversary and mark the railroad s rich past specifically the key historical moments contributors and technological changes the class i plans to conduct a special tour over the next 16 months in several major canadian and u s cities each of the 14 stops on the cn100 a moving celebration tour will feature music food and themed rail containers exhibits and workshops will be offered to inform employees retirees residents and others about the railroad s history since connectivity to many communities has long been vital to cn the tour will stress how the railroad has aided and will continue to benefit dozens of cities and towns but cn s progression since 1919 isn t at the forefront of senior executives minds they re much more fixated on the class i s present and future while acknowledging the past they re trying to assert their attention on the railroad s short and long term strategies which target top line growth cost control higher productivity better service performance and more innovations to learn more about those objectives as well as how past events helped mold cn progressive railroading emailed a series of questions to cn president and ceo jean jacques ruest executive vice president of corporate services and chief legal officer sean finn and senior vp and chief information and technology officer michael foster they provided responses about the railroad s greatest achievements biggest challenges potential hurdles technology s current and future role and some possible highlights to come the defining moment the 1995 privatization that turned cn into a publicly held corporation with traded stock was perhaps the biggest turning point in the railroad s history said ruest who joined the class i in 1996 after working for a major international chemical company for 16 years it set the railroad on its current course privatization required us to redefine ourselves into a private company that needed to compete with other privately run railroads ruest said acquisitions have been defining factors as well during the past 20 years the network has grown through a series of them the elgin joliet eastern railway acquisition provided a highly competitive route to bypass the rail congestion in and around chicago while the addition of bc rail afforded a deep reach into the resource rich northern regions of british columbia ruest said meanwhile the wisconsin central acquisition helped cn develop and connect new markets and provided a better connection between western canada and the united states but perhaps the most important and transformative acquisition was the illinois central railroad which aligned the class i with trade moving north and south because of the north american free trade agreement nafta ruest said it transformed cn from a canadian railroad into a truly north american railway and the only one serving all three coasts he said with markets changing and trade diversifying the class i needs to keep growing and expanding while making its value felt and understood finn believes a truly north american railroad that ties both the u s and canada together with international markets he said another thing that s important to cn maintaining a communal presence systemwide we don t just operate in towns across north america our 25 000 employees and 40 000 retirees eat sleep and live there too which is why we are so focused on being a partner and a good neighbor all across our network finn said as a company cn aims to be a supply chain partner and enabler and not just a mover of trains he said we help our customers win in their markets and we help communities achieve their goals finn said cn the main challenge as it is for any company is how to elicit and embrace change whether it is increased crop sizes or a shift toward multimodal transport new commodities that need to be delivered or new technologies we need to constantly ask ourselves how we can improve finn said this is why we are investing approximately 25 percent of our revenues back into our network as capital investments year after year both organic and inorganic organic growth or growing with the economy and customers is crucial ruest believes since 2012 cn has registered an industry leading 3 5 percent compound annual growth rate our customers tell us we are different from other railroads we are embedded in their supply chains we understand their markets we help them win in their markets and we are ready to deploy our capital to work for our customers ruest said to that end cn is investing an all time high ca 3 9 billion in capital expenditures this year maintaining capex at record levels will ensure customer demand is met where needed ruest said the class i is buying 140 locomotives which will be delivered by year s end ordering additional rail cars and hiring more crews the railroad is focused on inorganic growth as well and there are strategic opportunities to add more supply chain offerings ruest said the late 2018 acquisition of the transx group of cos is a perfect example he said transx provides various transportation and logistics services including intermodal through a subsidiary cn also recently reached an agreement to acquire h r transport ltd s intermodal division moreover cn in early may announced two new export supply chains targeted at asia thermal coal moving from a hinton alberta mine to ridley terminals and propane moving from alberta to a new ridley island export terminal i ve often described this strategy as feeding the beast ruest said the focus is on maximizing existing assets through inorganic growth and increasing capacity through targeted investments cn aims to be more aligned with the consumer driven economy we will keep the focus on innovation and sweating our assets which has served us so well ruest said innovator extraordinaire cn long has been an innovator ruest added the class i is the original large scale implementer of scheduled railroading which has been in place for more than 15 years most class is are employing or adopting the operating strategy that now is more commonly called precision scheduled railroading credited as an innovation devised by former cn leader e hunter harrison who also implemented it at canadian pacific and csx before he died in december 2017 scheduled railroading calls for shifting the focus from moving trains to moving cars and minimizing car handling events we invented it and we derived enormous value from it for our loyal customers and our loyal shareholders ruest said we have evolved past scheduled railroading to a supply chain transportation leader cn cn also developed or refined many of the technologies in use by the north american rail industry he said the class i invented the beltpack remote control locomotive device which prompted yard management flexibility perfected ultrasonic test cars for rail flaw detection and installed the industry s most trackside wheel impact detectors and hot journal detectors the class i also is driving safety in part by employing other trackside and handheld technologies train crews are using about 9 000 mobile devices and carmen are using 500 shared handheld devices to report activities wirelessly cn is interested in both rail and non rail specific technologies to improve reliability and safety said foster the chief technology officer the railroad employs a dedicated research and development team that evaluates the applicability of technologies such as blockchain artificial intelligence ai data science operationalization multi cloud orchestration intelligent agents and augmented reality collaboration is key cn also is increasingly working with external partners to stay abreast of the latest technological trends and patterns and is constantly working with startups universities and other industry thought leader platforms to further innovation efforts foster said cn the big driver is to leverage all possible technology solutions and enable customers with applied technologies we are looking at the supply chain from a holistic view and creating platforms that will allow us to be agile scalable and faster to deploy with reusable cloud based technology foster said to date cn has adopted various automated inspection technologies including mobile test cars and inspection portals that provide employees with additional information to safeguard operations the innovations use various back end and edge platforms based on innovative algorithms lidar and machine vision capabilities that are scalable and reusable said foster by 2019 s end the class i expects to employ seven train inspection portals in canada and the united states as well as five inspection cars provided by duos technologies inc the portals combine several intelligent technologies and subsystems designed to provide real time images and a host of data for a variety of rail car inspection criteria in addition the class i has adopted deep learning modeling for joint bar crack detection in the back office robotic processing automation has been a growth area allowing field employees to focus on value added instead of repetitive tasks foster said many of these technologies are now connected to our enterprise big data platforms which are enabling cn to transform from reactive to proactive and predictive decision making he said this year and next cn plans to continue deploying machine deep and reinforcement learning tools and other automation to boost ai capabilities what is most exciting is how the company is organizing itself to increase the scalability reusability and deployment speed of our technology foster said to further accelerate technology deployment we are increasingly migrating to a platform based architecture that allows us to deploy technology solutions faster and at a lower cost the data dynamic it managers also are paying close attention to the scale of the internet of things and the data it generates a conundrum is becoming a better connected railroad that generates the data needed to drive insights into operating more effectively without getting lost in the data foster said cn a challenge for the years ahead will be how to manage the dynamic between the flow of data and our ability to find the truth inside thousands and thousands of data points he said we are doing this through our platform architecture approach and by leveraging non rail technology with leading providers in their fields but what perhaps is the future in innovation it could be next generation automation technology that will continue to reduce the impact of human error and limitations on railroad operations foster believes the use of it in managing infrastructure planning and locomotive maintenance asset management track and wheel maintenance bridges and infrastructure maintenance and environmental impacts is only going to become more important in the next 10 years he said i think we will solve challenging problems in ways we can t even yet imagine that s where curiosity and pioneering towards the future come in which is why we place so much emphasis on innovation at cn foster said cn s first quarter operational and financial results show ongoing efforts to be an innovative and self challenging company are bearing fruit despite a prolonged period of historically cold temperatures in the quarter which at one point reached 16 straight days of 40 below zero revenue climbed 11 percent to a q1 record ca 3 5 billion operating income increased 5 percent to ca 1 08 billion and volume ratcheted up 1 percent to a record 1 4 million units on a year over year basis the adjusted operating ratio improved 0 6 points to 67 2 operationally car velocity rose 8 percent to 173 car miles per day average through dwell time on the entire railroad improved 12 percent to 8 7 hours and workload increased 2 percent to 115 9 billion gross ton miles better balance in the batter s box the challenge going forward balancing demand costs and customer expectations ruest believes we have the best executive team in the industry and we know that we need to plan all of our actions before implementing them he said i like to use baseball analogies and for me it is about taking the opportunity to swing at the balls that come into the strike zone senior execs are counting on each of the company s railroaders to continue pitching in and help raise the class i s batting average they say doing so will further instill a culture of excellence nimbleness and forward thinking ruest believes every single one of our 27 000 railroaders plays a key part in our company and i want to thank them all for their dedication he said email questions or comments to jeff stagl tradepress com

the new york times is touting a few city managers in hard hit upstate new york who are hoping to rejuvenate their local economies by attracting a share of the many illegal and legal immigrants who enter the united states each year but the soft focus pro migration article also provides an unpaid boost for the economic innovation group which is an investor funded group pressing congress to allow state legislators to import their own extra supply of cheap immigrant workers consumers and renters city managers are testing out a new strategy luring refugees who have settled in other parts of the united states to move to new york according to the new york times they are advertising job placement english language and housing services hoping to draw enough people to offset the shortfall of american residents the article said the region is doomed unless it can import more migrants the new york times suggested the real fear for upstate cities is that if we don t keep our population growing we will fall into an endless cycle of decline said a highlighted quote from assemblyman sean ryan a democrat from the upstate city of buffalo but there are at least several alternatives to the eig s push to grow the economy by importing even more immigrants for example cities can compete to attract the roughly 12 million americans who are still looking for decent jobs including many sidelined people in west virginia and other states who were hit hard by free trade city officials can also compete to attract millions of young americans are looking for wage raises and decent housing to grow their own families president donald trump is rolling back some of the free trade rules that encouraged u s investors to welcome low skill somali immigrants to utica after they had exported the region s high skill manufacturing jobs to cheap workers in china yet the nyt prefers to tout the recruitment of the somali refugee who moved to utica ny and is now working in a retail store abdiwahab awayle 36 first moved to erie pa in 2017 from a refugee camp in kenya but after three months he stopped receiving government help to learn english and to find a job struggling to make ends meet while working at a plastic production company he decided to move with his wife and five children to utica where he heard from somali friends that rents were lower and that better paying manufacturing jobs were available the center for refugees they said offered free english classes the government imports roughly one million legal workers consumers and renters each year the nation s divided government also accepts more than one million illegal and semi legal migrants in 2019 along with at least one million temporary workers this huge supply of imported workers consumers and renters prefer to cluster in coastal cities and so it also drains job creating investment wages and real estate values that would otherwise go to the four million americans graduates each year and to the children young workers and homeowners in america s heartland towns and cities for example the nyt article touts a few hundred migrants who have moved to the upstate cities even though at least 3 75 million other legal immigrants and about 750 000 illegal migrants have chosen to live in new york city those 4 5 million migrants comprise at least one quarter of the city s workforce and their imported willingness to accept low wages is a huge federal subsidy to the city s elite because it lowers the price of services such as restaurants for many of the city s upper income professionals in the financial sector the inflated population of migrants also spikes rental income for housing investors despite the obvious and huge economic skew enabled by legal and illegal migration the nyt tries to blame the upstate cities problems on trump s campaign promise to reduce the annual inflow of refugees from somalia and other strife torn regions that rejuvenating bounce for cities such as utica buffalo and syracuse ended after the trump administration drastically cut the number of refugees allowed into the country new york received 1 281 refugees in the last fiscal year compared with 5 026 just two years before according to the state department officials in those cities worried they had lost a small but important bulwark against population decline the nyt article also downplays a second cause of the decline in upstate new york the government s decision to export the region s manufacturing base to cheap labor workforces in china via the free trade treaties the article hints at the disaster a manufacturing decline left homes vacant and storefronts dark while it tacitly endorses a two class economy built on cheap labor in contrast trump s hire american policies are reversing the cheap labor policy by curbing both free trade and immigration trump s lower immigration higher wages policy are shifting money from investors to workers according to a growing number of news articles a may 14 report from wisconsin by the associated press reported nik rettinger the 28 year old first vice chairman of waukesha county gop said he knows several people who were trump skeptics but have come around to him in no small part because of the economy we want people moving out of their parents basements he said a lot of people said i don t know if he can do it now they think he s done it on may 12 the wall street journal reported growing wages and spiking productivity in trump s hire american economy as the job market tightens some small firms are experimenting with new ways of recruiting judy briggs owner of a cleaning business in boston with seven employees has hired three people since she began providing bonuses for referrals in november workers can earn 100 if a new recruit stays 30 days plus 250 after 90 days and 500 after one year a small firm in fort smith ark that conducts employment background checks has spent about 350 000 over three years to automate repetitive tasks the 16 current employees are performing twice as much work as when we had 28 employees said its president dean wilson indiana restaurant workers are gaining wage increases training better conditions from employers in pres donald trump s hire american low immigration tight labor economy meanwhile biz lobbyists progressives urge more migration neil munro neilmunrodc april 25 2019 the nyt s cheerleading for cheap immigrant labor is also tacit support for the eig s advocacy for a law that would import many more immigrants for state governments the nyt article included a brief reference to the political campaign noting in trying to draw upon the existing pool of refugees in the united states new york is competing against places that have experienced similar declines as the country s population growth has fallen to 80 year lows between 2007 and 2017 80 percent of american counties with a combined population of 149 million americans lost prime working age adults according to a recent report from the economic innovation group a washington think tank the eig is not a mere think tank it is an advocacy group founded by a team of investors including sean parker a founder of facebook the president is jon lettieri whose bio says prior to eig john was the vice president of public policy and government affairs for a leading business association the organization for international investment ofii where he led the organization s state and federal policy work on such issues as tax reform trade investment promotion and manufacturing eig s april 2019 proposal for more imported workers and consumers admits that the current immigration policy favors large cities saying it currently serves to increase the regional disparities highlighted above the fastest growing decile of counties has proportionally more skilled immigrants than the slowest growing one by a factor of eight what is more the 20 most populous u s counties currently contain 37 of the country s skilled immigrants compared to only 19 of the country s total population more broadly the 5 of counties with the highest home prices have over half of the country s skilled immigrants and 90 of skilled immigrants live in the top one third of counties with the highest housing prices the group also admitted that more immigration raises housing prices which is bad for home buyers such as young married americans seeking to start a family cheaper housing is good for first time home buyers and renters says the eig proposal which is titled could a heartland visa help struggling regions but instead of reducing immigration to spur income gains and family formation by many americans and also to help spread job creating investment beyond the major coastal cities the eig just urges more immigration current skilled immigration policy largely benefits populous booming metro areas but fails most heartland communities a new program of place based visas let s call them heartland visas could become a powerful economic development tool for communities facing the consequences of demographic stagnation but not content to simply manage decline the visas would constitute a new additive and voluntary pathway for skilled immigrants to come to the united states eligible communities would opt in to hosting visa holders who would provide a much needed injection of human capital and entrepreneurial vitality into parts of the country that retain considerable economic potential the extra immigrants would help boost housing prices the eig proposal notes the relationship between population growth and housing demand is clear more people means more demand for housing and fewer people means less demand as a result a shrinking population will lead to falling prices and a deteriorating vacancy plagued housing stock that may take generations to clear the potential for skilled immigrants to boost local housing markets is clear notably economist albert saiz 2007 found a 1 increase in population from immigration causes housing rents and house prices in u s cities to rise commensurately by 1 the eig report praises a huge outsourcing proposal which was announced by wisconsin gop sen ron johnson in 2017 and which was immediately buried once it was exposed by breitbart news according to eig most notably in the united states in 2017 senator ron johnson r wi introduced the state sponsored visa pilot program act s 1040 which would have instituted a state based visa system the bill proposed allocating up to 500 000 visas annually to the 50 states and washington dc with 5 000 per state as a baseline and the rest allocated in proportion to population this proposal would be a temporary working visa with the goal of taking a more federalist approach to immigration the policy would allow states to sponsor foreign workers investors and entrepreneurs and determine themselves the criteria used in its 2017 report breitbart news reported the bill would allow states to each get 5 000 visas for additional foreign workers per year plus a population based share of another 245 000 visas plus a share of any visas not used by other states the inflow of foreign workers would start at 495 000 in the first year not counting the additional family members of each imported worker the bill would also create an amnesty because the visas could be given to 11 million plus illegals living in the united states including those who returned to the united states after being deported the senator said he has 50 co sponsors but acknowledged the likely unpopularity of his american replacement bill which is formally titled the state sponsored visa pilot program of 2017 the acknowledgment came at the end of his statement when he thanked the cato group and his house counterpart colorado gop rep ken buck for backing the replacement bill let s face it to have the courage we re probably a lightning rod on this bill johnsson said in his videotaped speech johnson also said the imported workers are needed to replace the many americans lost in unemployment and drug addiction johnson spoke at length about the new plague in our country and quoted from an article describing the huge extent of worker drop out amid the post 2008 combination punch of recession and mass immigration the subsequent social pathologies i would argue are being driven by government policy johnson told the hearing room and he cited medicaid s distribution of free opioids throughout much of the country but it is not going to be a government program that is going to solve that worker drop out problem johnson continued so the new visa bill he said is targeted to making sure that american businesses have the labor they need johnson s bill was tentatively backed colorado s gop rep ken buck i m not ready to sponsor it in the house yet it is important to take the bill out of the oven when it is baked he said in 2017 in 2019 buck is backing a bill h r 1044 and s 368 that would provide a path to citizenship for hundreds of thousands of indian college graduates if they accept low wages to work college grade jobs in the united states that are also sought by u s graduates weird but true gop and dems in congress are offering fast track green cards to encourage 300 000 vr low wage indian workers to take jobs from middle class american voters graduates fwiw i don t think the pols staffers recognize what they are doing neil munro neilmunrodc march 1 2019 the eig did not respond to questions from breitbart news so far democrats have displayed more enthusiasm for cheap labor immigration plans partly because it provides more taxes to local government and eventually more voters for the democratic party big gov t can fund itself with more immigrants says democratic 2020 candidate pete buttigieg so immigration cuts americans wages and shifts investment wealth from the heartland to the coasts but that s ok b c buttigieg s city might get more taxes neil munro neilmunrodc april 22 2019 for example democratic presidential hopeful mayor pete buttigieg endorsed more immigration during an april 17 campaign in des moines iowa we need people here we need to grow my community if we ve got responsible able bodied people on a path to citizenship send them to south bend because we trying to grow our community and job growth in population growth go hand in hand we know despite what they say about us here in the heartland we know how much our communities benefit from the growth that happens through immigration each year roughly four million young americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or university but the federal government then imports about 1 1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of roughly 1 5 million white collar visa workers including roughly one million h 1b workers and approximately 500 000 blue collar visa workers the government also prints out more than one million work permits for foreigners tolerates about eight million illegal workers and does not punish companies for employing the hundreds of thousands of illegal migrants who sneak across the border or overstay their legal visas each year this policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth for investors because it ensures that employers do not have to compete for american workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions this policy of flooding the market with cheap foreign white collar graduates and blue collar labor shifts also enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors even as it also widens wealth gaps reduces high tech investment increases state and local tax burdens and hurts children s schools and college educations it also pushes americans away from high tech careers and sidelines millions of marginalized americans including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions the labor policy also moves business investment from the heartland to the coasts explodes rents shrivels real estate values in the midwest and rewards investors for creating low tech labor intensive workplaces
the canadian dollar rose 0 18 percent against the greenback on wednesday canadian inflation data met the forecast at a 2 percent rise on a year over year basis gasoline prices increased 10 2 percent in the last 12 months as crude has appreciated with the opec deal limiting output and several geopolitical disruptions to supply offsetting the rise of us and canadian production the biggest factor for the loonie did not come from an economic indicator the news that the us is close to reaching a resolution on steel and aluminium tariffs boosted the currency us treasury secretary mnuchin said high level talks met to discuss trade given the uncertainty surrounding trade with the us the news carries a positive connotation and eases concerns for the usmca deal that could come under fire if the us decided to pursue a global trade war the us is also signalling a willingness to reassume talks with china as mnuchin is looking forward to connecting again with beijing oil prices rose despite higher us weekly inventories as tension in the middle east forced the us to pull out its diplomats out of iraq the opec deal brought about stability to crude prices but as geopolitics have caused supply disruptions prices have risen as sanctions sabotage and military action threaten the steady flow of crude in the region the us dollar is higher against most majors on wednesday after a flurry of trade comments injected optimism into the market a delay of us auto tariffs boosted global stock markets and offset some of the softer us data released on wednesday retail sales and industrial production remain weak in an economic calendar that wrapped up early this week the next major release in the us will be next week on wednesday when the u s federal reserve published its notes from its april may fomc meeting global trade has been the biggest story in 2019 as much as the fed was in 2018 the central bank hiked rates 4 times in 2019 but as the us economy loses momentum even the president has asked for a rate cut the market is now pricing in that scenario as a real possibility this year and it could become a reality if fundamentals don t improve the us decided it was better to delay the auto tariffs to avoid opening more fronts in order to concentrate on the china deal us treasury secretary mnuchin said that a deal with canada and mexico is close on steel and aluminium which would give more bandwidth on trade to focus on dealing with the second largest economy oil crude higher as middle east tension offset higher us inventories the energy information administration eia reported a gain of 5 4 million barrels but rising tensions in the middle east forced us diplomats to withdraw from iraq putting more emphasis on a showdown between america and iran the attacks on saudi tankers and iran ending its nuclear commitments have escalated turmoil in the region with the us ready to apply pressure in tehran and evacuating its embassy in iraq due to security concerns supply disruptions have kept crude higher even as the us has ramped up production the opec agreement to limit output is the biggest factor but geopolitical disruptions like the us sanctions against iran and venezuela and the armed conflict in libya are added to the situation in saudi arabia iran has said that its goal it s not military confrontation but just a response to us escalating its efforts supply disruptions have been the major factor boosting oil prices geopolitical saudi arabia is seen as the main producer that could cover the gap in supply left by iranian crude us president donald trump has tweeted about the opec s role in keeping prices lower if they increase their output the deal between opec and other major producers will reach its end in june but it could be extended if participants deem the market has not reach price stability which was their main goal russia remains a big question mark as it has sacrificed its revenue to be part of the deal and could be ready to take advantage of higher prices ahead of even higher levels of us production causing another drop us production has increased dramatically to the point that the one time net importer is now an exporter of energy products shale technology has tipped the scales of global production and threatens to reduce the influence that the opec has on the market the decision from opec members to fight fire with fire and flood the market to drive shale operations into bankruptcy backfired and forced the group to reach out to non opec members in order to have a significant impact on the market by collectively reducing their output gold gold stable as trade concerns ease but middle east tensions rise gold was flat on wednesday as positive us comments on trade brought back risk appetite the trump administration delayed auto tariffs by six months and is said to be close to resolving its steel and aluminum tariffs with canada and mexico stock markets rose on the news despite softer economic indicators out of the us the yellow metal s fall was broken by the higher tensions in the middle east making gold a good alternative for investors looking for a safe haven trade concerns are easing as the white house is looking forward to more talks with china and tariff delays for global auto lifted pressure on european stocks volatility will remain high as uncertainty is plentiful with so many geopolitical risks up in the air making gold a viable asset for diversification stocks equities rebound after positive trade news global equities were higher after us president donald trump announced a delay to the planned auto tariffs the six month term was a positive for auto stocks that gained after the news the us entered a combative stance on trade when trump entered the white house but as a trade deal with china broke off in the last mile american rhetoric had become more aggressive and markets feared a full on trade war us data came in below expectations with retail sales and industrial production disappointing and building the case for a fed rate cut this year economic indicators continue to be mixed and the market is pricing in lower growth but trade war concerns are driving prices until a us china trade deal is signed which could come before or at the g20 meeting in japan fundamentals will still be in the backseat to geopolitics
henry rotich the national treasury boss arrives back in the country this weekend after procuring a sh210 billion international loan that is slightly more expensive that the previous issues but even with the excitement generated by the latest eurobond the secured funds will likely to be a bitter yet critical pill in plugging the country s revenue shortfalls cs rotich took up just a fifth of what lenders offered in proceeds that would go a long way in reducing the government borrowing needs at home besides being used to repay some maturing debt the money will be pumped into crucial development projects that otherwise would have stalled for lack funding kenya s third eurobond issue is slightly more expensive than the previous two partly because of prevailing market conditions internationally where interest rates have relatively soared as well as the country having higher debt levels than it did the first time around convince lenders further it had been reported that mr rotich pictured hoped to convince lenders to allow kenya to repay the loan in two tranches in may 2029 and 2049 however the deal tabled was slightly different of the two tranches accepted kenya will pay an interest rate of seven per cent for the portion of the loan whose repayment will start in 2023 and eight per cent for the other half that matures starting 2028 these relatively shorter repayment terms mean more pressure for kenyans to service its debt obligations this comes on the heels of a recent warning issued by the international monetary fund which cautioned that at the pace of kenya s borrowing newer loans could only get costlier rotich s proposals would have bought the economy more time to organise its finances as soon as the money arrives at the central bank of kenya some sh75 billion 750 million plus a final interest of sh2 2 billion will be paid out to the lenders of the 2014 debut eurobond another portion of the money raised from borrowing from american and british lenders will be spent on development infrastructure projects which the treasury did not specify further apart from retiring the first portion of the 2014 eurobond the funds could potentially be used to repay other debt obligations the current eurobond which attracted offers nearly five times what rotich was seeking could be viewed as a major vote of confidence in the kenyan economy the announcement of kenya s issuance triggered an overwhelming response from investors that amounted to an order book of 9 5 billion sh950 billion an over subscription of 4 5 times the cs said following the conclusion of the issue interest on bonds is paid out every six months after borrowing meaning the lenders for this eurobond will start earning from november this year the lenders further want principal repayments of sh30 billion in 2023 2024 and 2025 and a further sh40 billion in 2028 2029 and 2030 rotich approached international lenders against the backdrop of a decision by the imf to withdraw a standby loan that was structured to cushion the local currency from shocks over failure to implement some measures including the removal of a cap on bank rates the imf facility was seen as an endorsement that would offer additional confidence to lenders that their money was safe but despite the sentiment internationally economists at home are concerned with the rate of accumulation of debt where a general consensus is that it is approaching unsustainable levels the country s total debt including what the state has borrowed at home reached sh5 4 trillion after the latest issue or nearly 62 per cent of the 2018 gross domestic product gdp while the amount in nominal terms could be argued to be below that of other countries some already under debt distress it is the ability of the economy to generate the required revenues in foreign currencies that is of concern billow kerrow an accountant and former mandera senator is among leaders who feel legislators and kenyans should at least be told what was contained in the prospectus mr kerrow noted that eurobond issues were international loans that required prior approval by parliament as per the constitution i can t remember any prospectus or proposal shared with parliament he told the standard kenya s current dollar reserves after the receipt of the bond will exceed sh1 trillion but the june eurobond repayment will take away sh77 billion in principal and interest already sh73 5 billion has been paid as interest on the first eurobond alone while another sh15 8 billion has been paid out on eurobond ii issued in february last year further in the next financial year kenya is scheduled to repay more than sh1 trillion in principal and interest which is more than 75 per cent of projected tax collection a huge chunk of the principal is however expected to be rolled over rotich has however not indicated what assurance he gave to lenders that their loans would be repaid details that are usually be contained in a document called a prospectus which is yet to made it is hoped that the cs would share the prospectus so as to offer kenyans a glimpse of the government s assurances to secure to loan secrecy relating to specific terms of borrowing for this eurobond pretty much like most of the sh2 9 trillion foreign loans to reduce to sh2 8 trillion next month has been a concern for many kenyans previous prospectuses were only made available long after the funds had been borrowed and after long persuasion
general george custer met his doom charging into a battle he thought he could win against an opponent he did not understand based on his views about the fast emerging trade war with china it looks to me that donald trump another blonde with a very high opinion of himself is charging into an economic version of the little bighorn by mistaking the real nature of international trade the costs of tariffs the effects of currency movements and the supposed ease with which the united states could quickly re establish itself as a low cost manufacturer trump risks shredding the safety nets that have undergirded the u s economy for decades and plunging us into a war we are ill equipped to fight the prevailing view is that a trade war hurts both sides but in a war of attrition we can both outpunch and outlast the competition many argue that based on its smaller economy the spotty performance of its stock market and its vital need for american customers china is in a weaker position with our larger economy surging stock market strong currency and prodigious borrowing capacity they believe that the u s can pressure china to capitulate albeit with some short term pain but president trump goes much further and asserts that a trade war itself not just the results that may flow from it will be a boon to america he believes that tariffs are currently boosting growth and are restoring our manufacturing prowess based on his rhetoric it s hard to imagine why we would ever want a trade war to end cnbc s jim cramer went one step further arguing that tariffs may place a small burden on u s consumers but chinese manufacturers will cut prices in order to preserve u s market share in other words china will throw itself on a grenade meant for us by bearing the cost of the tariffs and their expenditures will flow directly into u s coffers many are also arguing that china s potentially heaviest weapon its ability to dump more than 1 trillion in u s treasury bonds onto the open market is unlikely ever to be used they argue that such selling could cost china too dearly as it would reduce the value of china s own treasury holdings and strengthen china s currency against the dollar thereby further disadvantaging chinese exporters looking for u s market share before i delve into the emptiness of these arguments about tariffs and treasuries a quick word about trump s negotiating skill and his potential motivation for weeks he has been saying that the chinese have been dragging their feet because they were being beaten so badly in the negotiations basic tactics would suggest that a way to get your adversaries to agree to a deal that is not in their interest is to convince them that it is in their interest by saying loudly that the deal favors the u s trump is not exactly pushing them over the finish line in my mind trump may not want the agreement he may just want the war instead more importantly the economic uncertainty could force the federal reserve to cut interest rates which may be his most desired outcome while it is true that the chinese have illegally appropriated huge quantities of american intellectual property i believe that we have received greater benefits in return without the cheap goods produced in china prices may very well have been much higher for vast quantities of key products for u s consumers and without chinese purchases of u s debt interest rates could have been much higher making borrowing more expensive for both businesses and consumers it s hard to quantify just how important these benefits have been for an economy such as ours which has been driven for decades by borrowing and spending trump believes that tariffs are weapons and that since there are many more chinese products than american products to target that we have an inherent advantage but tariffs are weapons that hurt your own people slapping federal taxes on imported products simply means that u s consumers will pay more for the things they want contrary to jim cramer s wild optimism the chinese will not discount for americans when other customers can pay in full trump downplays these fears by saying it would be very easy for americans to avoid higher prices by bringing manufacturing back home where tariffs won t apply he seems to believe american firms that have relied on foreign production for decades can just start producing domestically this is a fantasy take for instance an american company like nike the oregon based footwear behemoth employs 70 000 american workers in product design sales marketing finance operations strategic development and r d but the company hasn t mass manufactured footwear in the u s in decades that task has fallen largely to the chinese and other south east asian nations what would it take for nike to begin manufacturing millions of pairs of athletic footwear in the u s currently no such facilities exist domestically so they would have to be built that would take years and be a real cost where would nike get the money it might have to cancel its share buybacks or issue new share offerings to raise money to fund the capital expenditures if this were to happen at a time of falling profits its share price might drop if all u s companies now relying on imports did likewise what impact might that have on the stock market but more importantly factories don t exist in a vacuum they need to be linked to a supply chain large quantities of rubber leather vinyl and cotton would need to be delivered to the factory and if those materials don t exist in adequate supply other factories that could produce them would need to be built as well substantially raising the cost to the u s economy but more than just the cost it s the time it would take this is not something that happens quickly and when nike gets up and running assuming it had survived years of low production it would be very hard pressed to produce its shoes at its current costs if all u s companies did this at once consumer prices could surge and retail sales fall but the long hoped for manufacturing jobs could be slow to materialize in contrast to how difficult and painful it could be for the u s to ramp up domestic production it may prove relatively easy for china to ramp up domestic consumption suppose nike stopped producing sneakers in china and abandoned the facilities it once used the workers the factory and the supply chain would still exist new owners could move in take over and begin producing sneakers if the u s market were closed to that production the new owners would have to find customers elsewhere i assume that chinese consumers have feet maybe a bit smaller and would appreciate cool looking sneakers mainstream analysts argue that china simply doesn t have the purchasing power to replace america s consumptive capacity but purchasing power is largely a function of currency valuation and if the chinese currency were to rise in value chinese consumers would then be able to buy more which brings us to the next issue chinese dollar reserves by selling their reserves china can strengthen its currency and help to build the domestic economy that it has long desired contrary to the current consensus i think there may be a sharp and sudden selling of u s treasuries by china which would hurt the u s and benefit china selling treasuries could push up long term interest rates in the u s and weaken the dollar possibly generating inflation and slowing the economy americans would face much higher prices for goods and would have to pay more to borrow to buy homes and cars or to build businesses this might force the fed to deliver greater monetary stimulus as the economy slowed further weakening the dollar and putting the u s into a possibly dangerous inflationary spiral the countless benefits that accrue to americans as a result of a strong dollar would be lost conversely dumping its cache of more than 1 trillion in treasuries could strengthen the rmb but a strong currency is precisely what china needs to drive domestic consumption and lessen its dependence on exports this has been its stated economic goal anyway a cheap currency may help exports but a strong currency empowers domestic consumption such a move could help china mature into a healthier and more balanced economy however there is an added benefit to china from selling treasuries or merely allowing them to mature without rolling over the principal all of those savings currently being loaned to the u s government would then be available to finance its domestic projects the extra capital at home could allow china to increase production even further to meet the increased consumption demands of a rapidly growing middle class enriched by the increased purchasing power of their savings and wages but it s not just china that could dump treasuries and enjoy the possible twin benefits of increased purchasing power and domestic investment but the rest of the world as well particularly south east asia that entire region might witness the benefits if local trade investment and consumption all rose countries might no longer compete to debase their currencies to preserve market share in the u s but allow their currencies to rise engendering the possibility for increased domestic investment and consumption so not only does trump risk blowing america s great deal with china but with the entire world the dollar s role as the reserve currency could be lost as would the artificially high living standards it has produced americans would finally be forced to live within their highly diminished means borrowing would have to be financed from the shallow pool of domestic savings and consumption would be limited by domestic production as imports would have to be paid for with exports of real products rather than mere paper dollars while custer believed blindly in his own invincibility in the end he was only a general with about 300 unlucky cavalrymen under his command but his defeat was just a temporary setback as the weight of the american economy ultimately overwhelmed the native americans ability to defend their traditional way of life while trump s blunder will be equally as foolish as custer s this time it s the modern american way of life that may be lost

lahore just a couple of days after premier imran khan led government had succeeded in reaching an accord with the international monetary fund to seek a 6 billion bailout in a bid to implement its structural reform agenda over a period of around 40 months a generous tax amnesty scheme called the asset declaration scheme has now been approved by the federal cabinet though public office holders would not be allowed to benefit from this privilege which is basically a premium for dishonesty under this scheme assets within the country and abroad except for real estate can be whitened after paying a charge of 4 per cent only contrary to a 45 per cent levy in india for people wanting to keep their whitened money abroad a rate of six per cent would be charged for the declaration of real estate its value would be considered 1 5 times more than the federal board of revenue assigned value to bring it at par with the market rate the amnesty scheme also has the facility for citizens to whiten their benami accounts and properties it is a pity that instead of enacting concrete laws to bring back looted money from swiss banks and other tax havens the ruling pakistan tehreek e insaaf government has thus toed the line of all its predecessors who had come up with such initiatives but to no avail as all such moves have historically failed in this part of the world a brief peek into the past money whitening schemes in pakistan pakistan had offered its first tax amnesty scheme in 1958 during the regime of ayub khan meaning thereby that not only have black economy and tax evasion been haunting the pakistani economy for well over six decades loot and plunder have also continued unabated since then this 1958 initiative had brought approximately 71 000 declarations and as many as 266 183 taxpayers had entered the fold contributing a total of rs1 12 billion to the kitty despite this tax collection remained at less than 10 percent of the total gdp in 1958 59 over rs142 million was collected through the 1997 tax amnesty scheme the year 2000 amnesty scheme was launched under the general musharraf led regime during this scheme some incumbent ministers had declared their assets approximately 79 200 declarations were filed bringing in rs 10 billion to the exchequer in 2001 a tax amnesty scheme called investment tax on income inserted vide section 120a of the income tax ordinance had given a similar facility to whiten untaxed money and assets by paying just 2 per cent the effort proved futile as only rs 2 5 billion was received during 2008 the then pakistan people s party regime had solemnly pledged before the parliament that after tax investment scheme of 2008 it would not introduce any more amnesty schemes which was a lollypop for critics however the ppp government had gone on to offer the same to stock exchange investors in april 2012 and all kinds of concessions were dished out to tax evaders during may and june 2012 to achieve the time s budget target of rs1 952 billion the target was missed by over rs70 billion though in 2013 the pakistan muslim league nawaz government had announced a money whitening scheme dealing only with assets held within the country this scheme was primarily intended for owners of imported cars who had brought them into the country without paying due taxes the 2016 scheme saw just 10 000 declarations coming forth contributing a mere rs0 85 billion research further shows that in november 2016 a national assembly panel had approved a blanket tax amnesty scheme to whiten an estimated rs7 trillion of black money invested in the real estate sector despite stiff opposition by the federal board of revenue although this scheme was seen as a defeat of the finance ministry which had vowed to force people to pay their taxes on property transactions at fair market values just five months back the national assembly had approved this mega tax amnesty scheme on december 1 2016 for the real estate sector the lower house of parliament had approved whitening of black money invested in this sector by paying only three per cent tax instead of recovering taxes in april 2018 the then pakistani prime minister shahid khaqan abbasi had given the tax dodgers a chance to come clean through what can be dubbed an extremely generous amnesty scheme for undeclared local and foreign assets by june 30 2018 nearly 5 000 people in pakistan had filed returns declaring their foreign assets and deposited approximately rs80 billion in taxes the scheme was launched by the pml n government and passed through parliament in a bid to boost the national foreign exchange reserves which were then hovering around the usd 10 billion mark sufficient to finance barely two months of imports as far as the 2018 tax amnesty scheme was concerned research conducted by the jang group and geo television network shows that hints about this initiative were actually dropped by disqualified prime minister nawaz sharif in january 2017 during an export trophy function held under the aegis of the federation of pakistan chambers of commerce industry fpcci nawaz sharif had assured a galaxy of industrial magnates in karachi that he would talk to ishaq dar his minister for finance revenue and privatization for promulgating a one time tax amnesty scheme however as luck would have it nawaz sharif was disqualified on july 28 2017 by supreme court of pakistan heading a country with just 1 2 million filers including only 0 7 million people who are actually paying taxes premier shahid khaqan abbasi had basically extended the proverbial olive branch to pakistani citizens who had failed to report their undeclared assets to the tax authorities research reveals that a lot of countries have launched such money whitening schemes in the past and have reaped lucrative financial dividends here follow some international precedents in this context in october 2016 the indian tax amnesty had drawn 9 8billion in asset declarations an october 2 2016 report of the financial times india had stated a four month amnesty for tax evaders in india has resulted in the declaration of hidden assets worth nearly 10bn the government has said as it seeks to fulfill an election pledge to crack down on illicit black money the income declaration scheme which ran from june through september allowed citizens to report assets previously undeclared to the tax authorities without risk of prosecution a charge of 45 per cent was to be levied on the assets declared under the scheme one of the most conspicuous initiatives in prime minister narendra modi s drive to tackle widespread corruption that is seen as a significant drag on the economy the widely subscribed indian media outlet had added arun jaitley finance minister told reporters at the weekend that assets worth rs652 5billion 9 8billion had been declared under the scheme implying a boost to government revenue of rs294billion the amnesty attracted 64 275 declarations with the average amount declared standing at rs10 2million the initiative followed a similar one launched in 1997 that yielded revenue of rs97 6billion but mr jaitley said that the latest drive was firmer in its treatment of evaders arguing that the previous effort had allowed them to make payments based on unduly low valuations of their assets it is imperative to note that in 1997 after the indian voluntary disclosure scheme was announced the civil society had strongly objected to the same and represented to the government to drop the proposal however the scheme was implemented in india more than 15 disclosure schemes have been introduced till date the financial times had maintained liases foras a property research company estimated in 2014 that 30 to 40 per cent of indian real estate transactions involved an illicit cash payment firm progress in reducing tax evasion would boost the credibility of mr modi s government which made this a key part of its 2014 election manifesto the us based group global financial integrity has estimated that indians sent 343 billion of assets abroad illicitly between 2002 and 2011 innumerable american states have had tax amnesties for example the los angeles administration had collected 18 6 million in its 2009 tax amnesty programme claiming that the amount was 8 6 million more than was expected and that businesses saved 6 7 million in penalties the state of louisiana had brought in 450 million from its 2009 tax amnesty programme three times more than what was expected on june 26 2012 the united states internal revenue service irs which the nation s tax collection agency had said its offshore voluntary disclosure programmes had collected more than 5 billion in back taxes interest and penalties from 33 000 voluntary disclosures made under the first two programmes in canada a tax amnesty scheme called the voluntary disclosure programme already exists for income tax and excise related offences the canada revenue agency has given this relief for a 10 year period prior to the date of filing and covers unfiled tax returns and unfiled information returns such as offshore asset form eligible taxpayers receive full penalty relief and avoid any possible tax evasion prosecution in belgium during 2004 the country s legislative house had adopted a law allowing individuals subject to belgian income tax to regularize the undeclared or untaxed assets they held before june 1 2003 in 2004 germany had also granted a tax amnesty in connection with tax evasion the largest islamic country indonesia had netted about 9 61 billion in march 2017 the country had previously given such incentives in 1964 1984 and 2008 also in 2003 south africa had enacted the exchange control amnesty and amendment of taxation laws act a tax amnesty in 2012 the spanish government had announced a tax evasion amnesty for undeclared assets or those hidden in tax havens repatriation was allowed by paying a 10 percent tax with no criminal penalty italy had first introduced a tax amnesty in 2001 in 2009 the italian tax amnesty subjected repatriated assets to a flat tax of 5 per cent and succeeded in whitening a huge amount about 80 billion euros in assets were declared which resulted in tax revenues of 4 billion euros the bank of italy had estimated that italian citizens held around 500billion euros in undeclared funds outside the country in 2007 a russian tax amnesty programme had collected 130 million in the first six months the russian programme however was not open to anyone previously convicted of tax crimes such as tax evasion on september 30 2010 the government of greece had granted tax amnesty to millions of greek citizens by paying just 55 percent of the outstanding debts in 2014 the australian tax office ato tax amnesty had netted billions but probes against rich with secret swiss accounts were not shelved on december 9 2014 the sydney morning herald had written around 1750 australians have declared a total of 240 million in income and 1 7 billion in assets under the amnesty and another 800 expected to make voluntary disclosures the biggest individual disclosure by a taxpayer was 30 million in income 120 million in assets that had been held in liechtenstein and switzerland the smallest was a disclosure of 10 000 only 130 individuals made declarations about property the vast majority of voluntary disclosures were related to income and shares the prestigious australian media house had maintained in a warning to anyone feeling reluctant to come forward ato said it has an informer who has already handed them a list of 122 australians with swiss bank accounts switzerland proved to be the most popular destination for undeclared wealth 585 individual disclosures were made about money and assets hidden there followed by the uk 299 disclosures israel 231 disclosures singapore 123 disclosures hong kong 115 disclosures and liechtenstein 43 disclosures

holland pennsylvania building activity is what really matters for economic growth and right now that is softening housing starts rose 5 7 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 235 million units

reserve on thursday showed manufacturing activity in the mid atlantic region accelerated in may but factories reported receiving fewer orders and were less upbeat about capital spending over the next six months the survey was conducted before last friday s move by trump to hike tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese goods while business sentiment appears to have picked up lately it is unclear what types of assumptions respondents had about trade policy and many of the responses for these surveys likely were completed before the increase in tariffs implemented last friday said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york the housing market has been mired in a soft patch since last year investment in homebuilding contracted at a 2 8 annualized rate in the first quarter the fifth

cbn gov says saboteurs will be brought to book deji elumoye in abuja the governor of central bank of nigeria cbn mr godwin emefiele wednesday got encomiums from the senate committee on banking insurance and other financial institutions that screened him for confirmation for a second and final term of office president muhammadu buhari had last week reappointed emefiele for an unprecedented second term and requested the senate for speedy confirmation of the appointment after his presentation to the committee yesterday members praised him for his performance in the last five years and indicated that he would be recommended for confirmation we have done the screening as expected of us and the committee will now do its report and send to the senate for consideration at plenary the committee chairman senator adebayo ibrahim said adding that emefiele would be forwarded to plenary for confirmation ibrahim who spoke after the screening said the committee was impressed by emefiele s performance as governor of the apex bank the cbn governor had given an insight into what his second term in office would look like saying the apex bank will be hard on the nation s economic saboteurs we will push very hard to ensure that those who seek to undermine the policies of nigeria without respecting the laws of this country will be brought to book under any circumstances he said the cbn governor who appreciated the avalanche of prayers offered for his success by the committee members led by the chairman senator adebayo ibrahim acknowledged that the road ahead of him is very rough i thank you for praying for me because we need it and i say this because the road ahead is still rough and very tough he said he therefore called on the citizenry to cultivate the habit of respecting government policies and laws he said i want to appeal to all nigerians that a time comes in the history of a country where you have to learn to respect the policies and laws of a country part of the problem that we have seen in nigeria is lack of respect for the policies of this country nigeria is very good at putting in place policies that are sound and workable but implementation has always been almost zero and it is arising because we see people sabotaging government activities we see people when policies are made where they pick up the pieces of paper about the policy what they think about is how do we circumvent this policy emefiele told the committee that it is not true that nigeria operates a multiple exchange rate he explained we do not have multiple exchange rates when you talk of multiple exchange rates you talk about divergence in exchange rate substantially today our rates have converged around n360 to 1 because the investors and exporters will know which is the dominant market for procurement of foreign exchange today it hovers around that rate but what you will find is multiple windows and we don t have any apologies for it he further justified multiple windows of exchange rate saying when you talk about multiple windows the central bank has a responsibility to provide foreign exchange to everybody what we saw that resulted in us creating multiple windows we want to make sure that those who seek to travel who will normally go to our banks to ask for foreign exchange and the banks will turn them away and these people will seek to go to black market to buy foreign exchange we said no we will allocate specific sums of money to banks to allocate to people who want to travel we will allocate specific sums of money to you to allocate to those who are into the small and medium enterprise business and we will allocate funds to you for you to give to those who are in your corporate sectors so you will find multiple windows because the rates at which foreign exchange is traded through all these windows are substantially the same so there are no multiple exchange rates but i will admit there is multiple windows and it is for a good reason he said nigeria s population is expected to peak at 425 million people by year 2050 going by the imf world bank economic outlook according to him the cbn from the monetary policy side has come to realise that using the instrumentality of the anchor borrowers programme where access to credit is being provided to the masses all over the country will be a way to generate employment and boost economic activity among the rural population he told the senators we just came back from the imf world bank programme in april and in the world bank s imf s world economic outlook nigeria is positioned as a country whose population will grow and rise to over 425 million people by the year 2050 that will present nigeria as a country with the third largest population in the world after china and india and indeed surpassing the united states of america in population i worry and i do think that we all should worry that a lot of work needs to be done to make sure that we are able to put in place policies that will make life good for this 425 million people when we are the third largest population in the world so we from the central bank of nigeria from the monetary policy side have come to the realisation that using the instrumentality of the anchor borrowers programme where access to credit is being provided to our masses all over the country that it will be a way to generate employment and boost economic activity amongst our rural population the results are there to see that as a result of our anchor borrowers programme where we have disbursed over n190 billion to over 1 1 million smallholder farmers cultivating over 1 3 million hectares of land that we need to do more of this as we do this we make finance available at low interest rate we make access to credit easy for our people and in doing this we will be able to create jobs for them and improve the livelihood of our people that is a sole thing that we make and i am very optimistic that this can be achieved he continued i went to one asian country i entered the country happy but i came out of the country sadly sad because i could see the level of development that this country has achieved over the last 50 years and i cast my mind back and look at my country nigeria that what have we achieved this is what gives me the push that at my age of 57 i saw this country when it was good i am looking at the country today and i am saying i don t want to say it is bad but i want to say that we have a lot of work to do because the country has no doubt receded somewhat so from our side in the monetary policy we will do everything possible to ensure that with the mandate that is bestowed on us we will pull this country forward aside from the anchor borrowers programme we are also looking at special programmes targeted at wholesale growth of agricultural sector in nigeria aside from rice and other small good crop markets we have started looking at palm oil because we believe that this country has a lot of potentials in palm oil if you think about what this country was in the 50 s and 60 s nigeria being a country at that time that controlled 40 per cent market share in palm oil industry exporting its palm oil to different parts of the world but because we found crude oil we receded and abandoned it for some of you who are very good in doing calculations go and check today the price of a barrel of palm oil is more than the price of a barrel of crude oil so what happened to our country there are countries when they have the opportunities in agriculture and also have opportunities in the crude sector they didn t let their guards down the cbn governor however gave an assurance that the palm oil market would be grown back again after which cocoa in the south west area would be the next area of focus speaking on how the cbn bailed out the country during recession emefiele said when i resumed work in june 2014 i unveiled a five year vision for the bank and for the country achieving microeconomic stability was my main focus in trying to talk about what we achieved in the last five years we should take our mind back to the state of the economy in august 2008 about 62 billion was in our foreign reserve within the period we saw an increase in the price of crude oil despite this our reserve plummeted to about 40 billion by the time i assumed office the reserve was 32 billion as a result of the pressure on the reserve import was high export was reducing as a result exchange rate had to move coupled with the increase of fuel price inflation became high between january 2016 and january 2017 the period was bad the restriction of exchange rate was to reduce pressure on imports we have maintained the exchange rate at n360 to a dollar in the last three years in the last three years about n300 billion has been invested in small businesses senior special assistant to the president on national assembly affairs senator ita enang who presented emefiele for screening commended the speedy response of the senate to the request of the president to confirm emefiele enang said this confirmation will be seen as one of the fastest requests to be considered by the senate the executive is grateful i hereby present to you for confirmation godwin emefiele governor of the cbn a member of the committee senator fatima raji rasaki in her contribution urged the cbn boss to ensure that any time there are funds like the bailout funds the government is properly advised on how to disburse the funds for the benefit of nigerians senator hope uzodinma reminded his colleagues that the screening was for reappointment and not fresh appointment he noted that in the wisdom of the president the cbn governor passed his examination hence his reappointment for a second term senator shehu sani noted that when things are good everybody will come around but when things are bad everybody will run away the kaduna central senator advised the cbn boss to consolidate on the growth of cotton and textile industry especially in kaduna and katsina states reacting to certain attempts to smear the image of the cbn governor the chairman of the committee senator rafiu ibrahim noted that the good work the cbn governor was doing might have attracted distraction to him when you see a good thing some people want to distract it he said at least 17 senators attended the screening
16 05 2019 inequality soars worldwide while the rich have never had it so good writes michael roberts the risks are increasing the us federal reserve governor lael brainard in a speech in washington recently revealed the extent of rising inequality in the us using the latest data she outlined that the incomes and wealth of working class the american establishments like to use the term middle class households in the us have been squeezed in the last 50 years and particularly in the last 20 years average american households have still not fully recovered the wealth they lost in the great recession which began in 2007 at the end of 2018 the average middle income household had wealth of 340 000 mainly a home while those in the top 10 had 4 5 million up 19 from before the recession the latter s rise was mainly due to the surge in the stock market according to the fed s consumer survey one third of middle income adults say they would have to borrow money or sell something to be able to pay an unexpected 400 expense one fourth said they had skipped some kind of medical care in 2018 because of its cost and nearly three in 10 middle income adults carry a balance on their credit card most or all of the time meanwhile the share of income spent on rent by middle class tenants rose to 25 in 2018 from 18 in 2007 a rise of 40 the gini coefficient the basic measure of inequality for incomes is now at its highest ever in the us at a record breaking 0 48 up from 0 38 in the late 1960s which represents a rise of 30 brainard suggested that because this development is so pronounced reasonable living standards for most americans will never return in recent years households at the middle of the income distribution have faced a number of challenges that raises the question of whether middle class living standards are within reach for middle income americans in today s economy such a situation also threatened to weaken the economy with lower consumption per person research shows that households with lower levels of wealth spend a larger fraction of any income gains than their wealthier counterparts that has long term implications for consumption the single biggest engine of growth in the economy and it even risked democracy itself a strong middle class is often seen as a cornerstone of a vibrant economy and beyond that a resilient democracy said brainard such are the fears of one of the members of the pillars of american capital the federal reserve however while the middle class in the us and many other advanced capitalist countries is being squeezed the top 1 and even more the top 0 1 have never had it so good for them it is as though the great recession never happened the wealth of the world s richest people did decline by 7 to 8 56 trillion in 2018 according to wealth x which cited global trade tensions stock market volatility and a slowdown in economic growth and the number of billionaires fell 5 4 to 2 604 the second annual fall since the financial crash a decade ago but in america itself the richest were hardly affected there was a slight rise in the number of billionaires to 892 even if their wealth fell by 5 8 to a mere 3 54 trillion san francisco has more billionaires per inhabitant in the world with one billionaire for approximately every 11 600 residents followed by new york dubai and hong kong and there has not been a fall in billionaires in brexit britain according to the sunday times rich list just published there are a record 151 of them and to be a billionaire is like a god in the sky compared to the average wealth of households if we measure the difference in time say days it is staggering while an nhs nurse s annual salary would be the equivalent of half a day a billionaire s equals 11 500 a 32 year gap tipping point like climate change and global warming inequality around the world has now reached an irreversible tipping point the house of commons library reckons that if current trends continue the richest 1 will control nearly 66 of world s money by 2030 assuming a 6 annual growth in wealth they would hold assets worth approximately 305 trillion up from 140 trillion today this follows a report released earlier this year by oxfam which said that just eight billionaires have as much wealth as 3 6 billion people the poorest half of the world and the bank of england s chief economist andy haldane has produced an insightful study of how in britain the rich and poor are spread across the country this shows that the uk has the worst regional dispersion of income and wealth in europe even worse than italy it is concentrated in london and the south east although long hours and travel time seem to make londoners more miserable than their poorer fellow citizens in the north according to surveys rising inequality is creating conditions for rising risk and uncertainty in capitalist economies that is because the main way that the inequality of wealth has increased is through a rise in the price of financial assets marx called these assets fictitious capital as they represented a claim on the value of companies and government that may not be reflected in the earnings and assets of companies or government revenues financial crashes are regular occurrences often of increased severity and they can wipe out the value of these assets at a stroke such crashes can trigger a collapse thanks to the underlying weakness in the productive sectors of the capitalist economy meanwhile the latest report of the us federal reserve on the financial stability in the us makes sober reading borrowing by businesses is historically high relative to gross domestic product gdp with the most rapid increases in debt concentrated among the riskiest firms amid signs of deteriorating credit standards interest rates for loans are near an historic low so the borrowing binge among companies continues according to the fed debt owed by the business sector however has expanded more rapidly than output for the past several years pushing the business sector credit to gdp ratio to historically high levels moreover the sizable growth in business debt over the past seven years has been characterised by large increases in risky forms of debt extended to firms with poorer credit profiles or that already had elevated levels of debt and this borrowed money is not used to invest in productive assets but to speculate on the stock market indeed the main buyers of us stocks are companies themselves thus driving up the price of their own shares buybacks as long as interest rates stay low and there is no major collapse in corporate earnings this scenario of corporate borrowing and stock market buybacks can continue but if interest rates should increase and or profits fall then this corporate house of cards could tumble badly as the fed puts it even without a sharp decrease in credit availability any weakening of economic activity could boost default rates and lead to credit related contractions to employment and investment among these businesses moreover existing research suggests that elevated vulnerabilities such as excessive borrowing in the business sector increase the downside risk to broader economic activity naturally the fed s report concluded that things were going to be all right and the banks and corporations were resilient and healthy but overall uncertainty about the future for the major capitalist economies is rising according to the latest reading of the world uncertainty index a device that supposedly measures the confidence of capitalist investors globally the latest measure of the wui has risen sharply to a level higher than before the global financial crash and the recent drop in share prices driven by the ongoing trade war between

apparently furious at us move to sanction its telecom giant huawei tensions of the two sides is set to escalate further while there is no set timing for resuming the collapsed trade talks while trump might want to meet xi to clear out the outstanding issues to seal a trade deal at the upcoming g20 summit the two sides are actually moving farther apart trump s administration hit huawei on two heavy measures yesterday firstly the u s commerce department is adding huawei and 70 affiliates to its entity list that bans them from buying us technologies without government approval secondly trump signed an executive order banning us companies from using telecom equipment made by companies deemed to pose a national security risk as commerce secretary wilbur ross put the decision was to prevent american technology from being used by foreign owned entities in ways that potentially undermine u s national security or foreign policy interests chinese commerce ministry spokesman gao feng said today china has emphasized many times that the concept of national security should not be abused and that it should not be used as a tool for trade protectionism china will take all the necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights of chinese firms on trade gao warned the tariff hike by the united states will only bring greater difficulties to the consultations we urge the united states to cancel the wrong practices as early as possible avoiding greater losses to chinese and american companies and consumers and causing a recession like impact on the world economy gao also also clarified the three concerns on china firstly all tariffs must be removed in order to reach a deal secondly additional purchase of us goods is an issue to be resolved thirdly the text of the agreement must be balanced respecting each other s sovereignty gao emphasized to reach any agreement china s three core concerns must be properly resolved separately foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said negotiations and consultations to have meaning must be sincere first there must be mutual respect equality and mutual benefit second one s word must be kept and not be capricious bundesbank weidmann trade wars only know losers bundesbank president jens weidmann warned today that trade wars would damage the global economy and are useless in reducing current account deficit he said some expect higher tariffs to reduce current account balances but this hope may prove futile our analyses suggests also trump s new tariffs will pose risks to the us economy and retaliatory tariffs of other countries are likely to further weaken the global economy and world trade trade wars only know losers domestically he admitted that inflation is stubbornly low however if outlook allows it there

by francis a scotland director of global macro research don t think rates will riseâ maybe never again in my lifetime larry kudlow director of the national economic council during an interview on april 11 2019 white house national economic council director larry kudlow is 71 the life expectancy of the average 71 year old american male is an additional 13 7 years based on the 2016 period life tables published by the u s department of social security so kudlow s forecast is a bold one assuming his life expectancy is the average he is saying we are not even halfway through the historic period of rock bottom interest rates that has developed since the great financial crisis gfc change since the gfc this blog is about why he might be right the usual arguments that come up in this discussion are the deflationary ds demographics debt and the disruptions coming from globalization technology and competition the ds all support kudlow s case but my focus here is to show why kudlow s forecast is strengthened by a key macro regime shift that has been and remains in play since the gfc much of the research on the cause of the gfc has centered on the lack of regulatory oversight and the build up of financial system risk it ultimately resolved with a near collapse of the system itself but the recession that followed the gfc and the weak global expansion that has unfolded over the last 10 years has to do with other factors the main culprit has been a major slowdown in borrowing and spending in the global economy on the part of the world s most important private sector spender and source of aggregate demand namely the american household americans become savers for decades american household borrowing ran faster than income creation driving household leverage up and the personal savings rate down the perpetual cycle of borrowing helped prop up spending and inflated economic growth a phenomena that tony boeckh my former colleague and mentor at bca research was the first to describe as the super cycle of debt during my years at bca we wrote constantly about the sustainability of this debt cycle and worried what would happen when it came to an end chart 1 shows that the growth rate in household credit never retreated significantly below 4 5 at any time from 1946 right up to 2008 a relentless buildup in household leverage for six decades it all finally ended in 2008 with the gfc household credit collapsed to a 10 growth rate during 2008 the contraction did not stop for another four years after the gfc still today household credit is barely rising at 2 9 well below nominal income and gross domestic product gdp growth rates and well below any experience of the 60 years before the gfc the shock of the gfc catalyzed a decision among households to stop borrowing start saving and to de lever for baby boomers it was time to start saving for retirement after a decade which saw two 50 swoons in the stock market and a once in a lifetime real estate bust born minimalists millennial spending and borrowing remain underwhelming household debt to gdp has dropped 20 points from its peak of 100 in 2007 had this ratio sustained its 2007 peak for the last 10 years there would be have been over 6 trillion more in household credit creation 600 billion more per year another 3 5 annual credit growth and a lot more spending the impact of the collapse in u s private credit demand is very evident in inflation adjusted u s bond yields the 10 year real yield fell from a pre crisis level of roughly 2 25 and bottomed out at 80 basis points bps in late 2012 as credit stopped contracting since then real yields stabilized around 50 basis points as credit growth creeped back above zero before briefly piercing 100 bps last year china gears up but real yields reflect the intersection of the global demand and supply of credit the largest economy most directly affected by the collapse in u s household credit demand has been china china s ascendance during the 20 years prior to the gfc took place on the back of the massive savings surplus it was able to recirculate through the american spending and borrowing cycle for decades it was a win win relationship u s consumers borrowed and binged on a steady inflow of low cost chinese imports with american debt vendor financed by chinese savers the result was a steady side by side increase in u s household leverage and chinese economic growth the chinese government had few options when u s household borrowing finally caved in beginning in 2009 china aggressively boosted fiscal policy and total social financing to stave off a domestic cycle of over production and deflation after 10 years china s efforts to offset the effects of u s household deleveraging by spending domestically has left the economy over leveraged and with a central government budget deficit of almost 5 of gdp see chart 2 and closer to 11 of gdp if all levels of chinese government are considered in the meantime the u s budget deficit has risen to 6 7 of gdp owing to the trump tax cuts despite these large budget deficits in the world s two most important economies and 10 years of economic expansion japanese and german bond yields are at zero 10 year treasuries are 2 5 and the yield curve is flat any big spenders left the only way this story changes is if another big spender comes along but the two biggest contenders are already tapped out in the u s the senate won t entertain an infrastructure plan without financing details in china policy leaders don t want to keep gearing up the economy as for the private sector large population groups in the developed countries are shrinking and china s cresting supply of labor means it could get old before getting rich there is always a chance that corporate spending fills the void but so far that has not happened therefore it looks like the big dis savers are done spending for now and we are entering a new phase where old ideas resurface like the modern monetary theory mmt which asserts that governments should just keep spending and central banks finance directly to prop up nominal growth parts of the world have already been doing this the only difference is the half step of government debt issuance which the central banks of japan and europe have been buying that has not been the case in the u s at least not yet so kudlow could be right the federal reserve might be done tightening for the next 10 years

emerging and developed markets in march as negative returns in brazil and chile dragged on the region an underweight to chile was the largest contributor to relative performance from a sector perspective selection in it and energy benefitted the company selection in brazil as well as a lack of positioning in colombia the month s top performing country were the main sources of underperformance pockets of performance were felt on a stock specific basis software firm linx was the month s top performer as the company reported strong recurring revenues and growth from new

anchored inflation and a resilient labour market has helped drive domestic activity positioning was relatively unchanged over the month brazil remains our largest overweight however we continue to actively manage our exposure and have recently reallocated some risk away from the country selectively adding to mexico and keeping some dry powder on the side lines in brazil we notably trimmed financials exposure while also bringing our position in ambev to a modest underweight following a pick up in competitive pressures from heineken we are taking advantage of depressed valuations in mexico to top up positions in femsa and walmart de mexico we also initiated a position in airport operator gap on positive traffic and commercial revenue outlook we also added to argentine positions on weakness the portfolio ended the month being overweight brazil and mexico while being underweight chile peru and colombia we also maintain an off benchmark allocation to argentina at the sector level we are overweight the domestic consumer and real estate while being underweight utilities and financials brazil remains our largest overweight given our positive expectations for the incoming administration so far president elect jair bolsonaro has delivered on his campaign promises looking to reduce the size of government by initially reducing the number of ministries naming sector subject experts to lead cabinets and pointing to a continuation of the reform process initiated two years ago meanwhile the outlook for upcoming corporate results point to a continuation in the economic recovery providing strong momentum for growth into 2019 elsewhere the cancellation of naim the new mexico international airport reminded markets of the concerns regarding increasing populism for the incoming administration in mexico reiterating our cautiousness with mexican equities we remain underweight the andean region due to a combination of unattractive valuation and disappointing growth finally the dramatic sell off in argentina in 2018 leaves the stocks trading at attractive valuations while interest rates and currency have mostly stabilized providing a foundation for the

the drama surrounding the trade talks between china and the united states does not bode well for europe s efforts to defuse the crisis in its own relations with its most important ally and trading partner on april 15 the council accorded the commission negotiating authority to proceed on trade negotiations with the united states this decision was reached despite the opposition of france the union s second largest economy it came hot on the heels of the european parliament s failure to provide direction to the negotiations as a non binding resolution on talks with washington was defeated by a narrow margin unfortunately the eu us negotiations are unlikely to succeed even so trump s threat to impose auto tariffs if talks stall is unlikely to be carried out in the run up to the u s elections in november 2020 and before the united states mexico canada agreement usmca is ratified by the us congress should trump be re elected in november 2020 however the threat of auto tariffs will become far more credible and the eu will have to face up to some tough decisions the eu us negotiations aim to stabilise the world s largest bilateral trade and investment relationship but they are unlikely to succeed for three main reasons first the negotiating agendas of the two parties are extraordinarily far apart whereas in line with juncker s deal with trump last july the commission is preparing to negotiate solely on industrial products and an as yet unspecified conformity agenda how to reconcile disparate industrial standards the negotiating objectives put to congress by united states trade representative ustr lighthizer is a 14 page document which includes 24 headings these range from services to government procurement and to currency manipulation and crucially they include agriculture there is no escaping the fact that the negotiating agenda adopted by the ustr is entirely different than the one agreed by leaders in july so technically the eu is not bound by that agreement to negotiate more importantly it is very difficult to see how a deal that does not include agriculture a sector where the us sees an offensive interest but includes industrial goods which the us sees as a defensive interest can pass the us senate where farm states are powerfully represented insofar as the eu us agreement is a treaty which requires changes to the us tariff schedule it must pass the house of representatives and be ratified in the senate with a two thirds majority second it is difficult for two parties especially two giant economies with complex ratification procedures to reach a deal for relatively small stakes as became evident in various analyses done in preparation for the ill fated trans atlantic trade and investment partnership agreement ttip the gains to be had from a narrow deal centred on tariffs on industrial products are minuscule since tariffs are already very low at around 4 the gains from tariff reduction in industrial products are played up in the recent commission analysis which concludes that when and if tariffs are driven down to zero trade between the two parties will increase by between 8 and 9 by 2030 implying high combined price elasticity of demand and supply for traded products but even if one accepts this projection at face value the effect on the two blocs gdp would be almost imperceptible there is likely to be some displacement of trade with competitive third parties trade diversion which will reduce welfare still the agreement is likely to yield tiny net welfare gains that result from a small improvement of efficiency and from lower prices for consumers in some sectors the effect on aggregate demand would be near zero as shifts in imports and exports would offset one another the gains from the conformity agenda are as always difficult to assess but the ttip negotiations showed how thorny these exchanges can be even in a context where the negotiating agenda was very broad and there were many more opportunities for trade offs third as in the china case the topmost objective put forward in the ustr s negotiating objective is a reduction of the us bilateral deficit with the eu this implies that any deal must be one sided with the us committing to little or no new trade liberalisation leaving the eu to make the big changes as is evidently the case for china this will be difficult for the eu to swallow moreover even if the eu s negotiators wanted to deliver on the us demand that its bilateral surplus with the us must decline it is largely outside their power to do so a major shift in macroeconomic and structural policies in the eu s largest economies would be required to reduce the bloc s large current account surplus with the rest of the world even then it is unclear the extent to which the new demand created would benefit the united states instead of say china korea and japan or other eu members to complicate matters the eu takes the view that the commercial relations between the two parties are roughly in balance since looking narrowly at europe s surplus with the united states on goods and services fails to consider investment income which flows predominantly from the eu towards us corporations and investors there is some economic basis to the eu argument but the political reality is that us foreign investment in the eu and elsewhere is precisely what the trump administration dislikes and is trying to discourage trump s oft stated objective is to bring back manufacturing to the united states the commission s negotiators who are some of the world s best prepared are surely aware of these obstacles but they and above all their political masters fear auto tariffs which would be a calamity for european vehicle and parts manufacturers especially those in germany yet it would be extremely unwise for trump to impose auto tariffs in the run up to the presidential elections of november 2020 the president has delegated authority to congress to impose such tariffs following a finding by the department of commerce that auto imports including those from allies represent a threat to national security auto tariffs are widely opposed in congress and by virtually all major constituencies with the partial exception of some labour unions to date trump has been careful to ensure that his tariff hikes on china aluminium and steel etc affect producers but are largely imperceptible to consumers true tariffs have been imposed on washing machines and solar panels and these have hurt us consumers directly but these are relatively small budget items in contrast a study by the center for automotive research car concludes that 25 tariffs on automobiles and parts applied on all imports except those from canada mexico and south korea would add 2 750 to the price of the average car reduce us vehicle sales by 1 3m units and cause job losses in the hundreds of thousands over the next two or three years the job losses are due to a the reduction in car sales which affects the dealer distribution and after market service sector as well as us and foreign producers b the higher cost of imported parts which makes the us car industry less competitive c the disruption of value chains and the mismatch between available capacity and consumer demand an ihs markit study broadly confirms the car estimates the 20 or so democratic presidential candidates must be praying silently that the president raises auto tariffs preferably close to the election moreover trump needs as much goodwill in congress as he can muster for the usmca to win ratification in a recent column chuck grassley chairman of the senate finance committee stated that usmca will not pass unless tariffs on steel and aluminium are lifted because they have brought retaliation on american farm exports everyone understands that far more retaliatory measures including a possible fully fledged trade war will follow should auto tariffs be imposed but trump is also playing for time he is unlikely to support auto tariffs by the deadline may 18th under current rules and is instead likely to find ways to postpone the decision if trump is not re elected i expect the next president whether he or she is from the left or centre of the democratic party to continue to pursue a forceful trade agenda especially with regard to china however even if it remains demanding of its partners i would expect the us trade policy to become less adversarial and more predictable in that scenario whether the eu and the us will have sufficient appetite for another big trade negotiation after the sad experiences of recent years remains to be seen if on the other hand trump is re elected which some believe is quite likely his mercantilist america first agenda will have the wind in its sails if democrats win control of the senate as well as the house trump will be hobbled on many fronts but not necessarily on trade by the start of his second term he may or may not have concluded one sided deals with china and quite possibly with japan unlike the eu japan is willing to negotiate on agriculture along the lines already previously agreed under the now defunct trans pacific partnership tpp and japan which is utterly dependent on the us security umbrella in an increasingly difficult neighbourhood may turn out to be a more pliable partner than in the past if faced with a resurgent trump after november 2020 the eu will have some difficult decisions to make as it is compelled to enter a one sided negotiation will it adopt the broad negotiating agenda demanded by trump and lighthizer will the eu negotiate on agriculture a sector where it is the world s largest exporter and yet bestows some of the world s most generous subsidies is it willing to run the risk of tariffs on its most important export automobiles while canadian korean mexican and perhaps japanese producers avail themselves of more favourable terms are the european surplus nations such as germany and the netherlands willing to change tack and adopt policies that stimulate domestic consumption and investment are europeans willing to lower their high tariffs on cars garments shoes and many other products trade economists like myself can no doubt see a silver lining in these clouds since europeans should be embarking on these reforms anyway the context is unappetising but ultimately the changes required of them by trump s demands may turn out to be in the interest of europeans if however there is no deal to be had the future of the world s largest trade relationship will be in peril under that scenario two years from now the world trading system may be reeling from simultaneously raging eu us and china us trade disputes further contributing to the progressive unravelling of the rules enshrined in the world trade organization tariff peaks tariffs above 15 are found in approximately 250 tariff lines in the us and 150 tariff lines in the eu

lahore just a couple of days after premier imran khan led government had succeeded in reaching an accord with the international monetary fund to seek a 6 billion bailout in a bid to implement its structural reform agenda over a period of around 40 months a generous tax amnesty scheme called the asset declaration scheme has now been approved by the federal cabinet though public office holders would not be allowed to benefit from this privilege which is basically a premium for dishonesty under this scheme assets within the country and abroad except for real estate can be whitened after paying a charge of 4 per cent only contrary to a 45 per cent levy in india for people wanting to keep their whitened money abroad a rate of six per cent would be charged for the declaration of real estate its value would be considered 1 5 times more than the federal board of revenue assigned value to bring it at par with the market rate the amnesty scheme also has the facility for citizens to whiten their benami accounts and properties it is a pity that instead of enacting concrete laws to bring back looted money from swiss banks and other tax havens the ruling pakistan tehreek e insaaf government has thus toed the line of all its predecessors who had come up with such initiatives but to no avail as all such moves have historically failed in this part of the world a brief peek into the past money whitening schemes in pakistan pakistan had offered its first tax amnesty scheme in 1958 during the regime of ayub khan meaning thereby that not only have black economy and tax evasion been haunting the pakistani economy for well over six decades loot and plunder have also continued unabated since then this 1958 initiative had brought approximately 71 000 declarations and as many as 266 183 taxpayers had entered the fold contributing a total of rs1 12 billion to the kitty despite this tax collection remained at less than 10 percent of the total gdp in 1958 59 over rs142 million was collected through the 1997 tax amnesty scheme the year 2000 amnesty scheme was launched under the general musharraf led regime during this scheme some incumbent ministers had declared their assets approximately 79 200 declarations were filed bringing in rs 10 billion to the exchequer in 2001 a tax amnesty scheme called investment tax on income inserted vide section 120a of the income tax ordinance had given a similar facility to whiten untaxed money and assets by paying just 2 per cent the effort proved futile as only rs 2 5 billion was received during 2008 the then pakistan people s party regime had solemnly pledged before the parliament that after tax investment scheme of 2008 it would not introduce any more amnesty schemes which was a lollypop for critics however the ppp government had gone on to offer the same to stock exchange investors in april 2012 and all kinds of concessions were dished out to tax evaders during may and june 2012 to achieve the time s budget target of rs1 952 billion the target was missed by over rs70 billion though in 2013 the pakistan muslim league nawaz government had announced a money whitening scheme dealing only with assets held within the country this scheme was primarily intended for owners of imported cars who had brought them into the country without paying due taxes the 2016 scheme saw just 10 000 declarations coming forth contributing a mere rs0 85 billion research further shows that in november 2016 a national assembly panel had approved a blanket tax amnesty scheme to whiten an estimated rs7 trillion of black money invested in the real estate sector despite stiff opposition by the federal board of revenue although this scheme was seen as a defeat of the finance ministry which had vowed to force people to pay their taxes on property transactions at fair market values just five months back the national assembly had approved this mega tax amnesty scheme on december 1 2016 for the real estate sector the lower house of parliament had approved whitening of black money invested in this sector by paying only three per cent tax instead of recovering taxes in april 2018 the then pakistani prime minister shahid khaqan abbasi had given the tax dodgers a chance to come clean through what can be dubbed an extremely generous amnesty scheme for undeclared local and foreign assets by june 30 2018 nearly 5 000 people in pakistan had filed returns declaring their foreign assets and deposited approximately rs80 billion in taxes the scheme was launched by the pml n government and passed through parliament in a bid to boost the national foreign exchange reserves which were then hovering around the usd 10 billion mark sufficient to finance barely two months of imports as far as the 2018 tax amnesty scheme was concerned research conducted by the jang group and geo television network shows that hints about this initiative were actually dropped by disqualified prime minister nawaz sharif in january 2017 during an export trophy function held under the aegis of the federation of pakistan chambers of commerce industry fpcci nawaz sharif had assured a galaxy of industrial magnates in karachi that he would talk to ishaq dar his minister for finance revenue and privatization for promulgating a one time tax amnesty scheme however as luck would have it nawaz sharif was disqualified on july 28 2017 by supreme court of pakistan heading a country with just 1 2 million filers including only 0 7 million people who are actually paying taxes premier shahid khaqan abbasi had basically extended the proverbial olive branch to pakistani citizens who had failed to report their undeclared assets to the tax authorities research reveals that a lot of countries have launched such money whitening schemes in the past and have reaped lucrative financial dividends here follow some international precedents in this context in october 2016 the indian tax amnesty had drawn 9 8billion in asset declarations an october 2 2016 report of the financial times india had stated a four month amnesty for tax evaders in india has resulted in the declaration of hidden assets worth nearly 10bn the government has said as it seeks to fulfill an election pledge to crack down on illicit black money the income declaration scheme which ran from june through september allowed citizens to report assets previously undeclared to the tax authorities without risk of prosecution a charge of 45 per cent was to be levied on the assets declared under the scheme one of the most conspicuous initiatives in prime minister narendra modi s drive to tackle widespread corruption that is seen as a significant drag on the economy the widely subscribed indian media outlet had added arun jaitley finance minister told reporters at the weekend that assets worth rs652 5billion 9 8billion had been declared under the scheme implying a boost to government revenue of rs294billion the amnesty attracted 64 275 declarations with the average amount declared standing at rs10 2million the initiative followed a similar one launched in 1997 that yielded revenue of rs97 6billion but mr jaitley said that the latest drive was firmer in its treatment of evaders arguing that the previous effort had allowed them to make payments based on unduly low valuations of their assets it is imperative to note that in 1997 after the indian voluntary disclosure scheme was announced the civil society had strongly objected to the same and represented to the government to drop the proposal however the scheme was implemented in india more than 15 disclosure schemes have been introduced till date the financial times had maintained liases foras a property research company estimated in 2014 that 30 to 40 per cent of indian real estate transactions involved an illicit cash payment firm progress in reducing tax evasion would boost the credibility of mr modi s government which made this a key part of its 2014 election manifesto the us based group global financial integrity has estimated that indians sent 343 billion of assets abroad illicitly between 2002 and 2011 innumerable american states have had tax amnesties for example the los angeles administration had collected 18 6 million in its 2009 tax amnesty programme claiming that the amount was 8 6 million more than was expected and that businesses saved 6 7 million in penalties the state of louisiana had brought in 450 million from its 2009 tax amnesty programme three times more than what was expected on june 26 2012 the united states internal revenue service irs which the nation s tax collection agency had said its offshore voluntary disclosure programmes had collected more than 5 billion in back taxes interest and penalties from 33 000 voluntary disclosures made under the first two programmes in canada a tax amnesty scheme called the voluntary disclosure programme already exists for income tax and excise related offences the canada revenue agency has given this relief for a 10 year period prior to the date of filing and covers unfiled tax returns and unfiled information returns such as offshore asset form eligible taxpayers receive full penalty relief and avoid any possible tax evasion prosecution in belgium during 2004 the country s legislative house had adopted a law allowing individuals subject to belgian income tax to regularize the undeclared or untaxed assets they held before june 1 2003 in 2004 germany had also granted a tax amnesty in connection with tax evasion the largest islamic country indonesia had netted about 9 61 billion in march 2017 the country had previously given such incentives in 1964 1984 and 2008 also in 2003 south africa had enacted the exchange control amnesty and amendment of taxation laws act a tax amnesty in 2012 the spanish government had announced a tax evasion amnesty for undeclared assets or those hidden in tax havens repatriation was allowed by paying a 10 percent tax with no criminal penalty italy had first introduced a tax amnesty in 2001 in 2009 the italian tax amnesty subjected repatriated assets to a flat tax of 5 per cent and succeeded in whitening a huge amount about 80 billion euros in assets were declared which resulted in tax revenues of 4 billion euros the bank of italy had estimated that italian citizens held around 500billion euros in undeclared funds outside the country in 2007 a russian tax amnesty programme had collected 130 million in the first six months the russian programme however was not open to anyone previously convicted of tax crimes such as tax evasion on september 30 2010 the government of greece had granted tax amnesty to millions of greek citizens by paying just 55 percent of the outstanding debts in 2014 the australian tax office ato tax amnesty had netted billions but probes against rich with secret swiss accounts were not shelved on december 9 2014 the sydney morning herald had written around 1750 australians have declared a total of 240 million in income and 1 7 billion in assets under the amnesty and another 800 expected to make voluntary disclosures the biggest individual disclosure by a taxpayer was 30 million in income 120 million in assets that had been held in liechtenstein and switzerland the smallest was a disclosure of 10 000 only 130 individuals made declarations about property the vast majority of voluntary disclosures were related to income and shares the prestigious australian media house had maintained in a warning to anyone feeling reluctant to come forward ato said it has an informer who has already handed them a list of 122 australians with swiss bank accounts switzerland proved to be the most popular destination for undeclared wealth 585 individual disclosures were made about money and assets hidden there followed by the uk 299 disclosures israel 231 disclosures singapore 123 disclosures hong kong 115 disclosures and liechtenstein 43 disclosures

asean china japan and south korea collectively asean 3 announced earlier this month that they are considering adding local currencies to the dollar denominated regional currency swap arrangement while the language in the joint statement issued by the finance ministers and central bank governors did not specifically list which currencies could be made available alongside the dollar the chinese yuan and japanese yen are widely viewed as the most likely candidates efforts toward this end however are likely to be entangled in the politics between beijing and tokyo making the change difficult despite the economic benefits even though the south korean won may not be in contention seoul can play a major role in pushing through these talks as it has done in the past the regional currency swap arrangement traces its origins to the aftermath of the asian financial crisis still recovering from the crisis asean 3 countries formed the chiang mai initiative cmi 16 bilateral swap agreements totaling 84 billion known in 2000 to bolster emergency access to liquidity essentially the cmi allowed members facing a crisis to borrow dollars based on the presumption that the dollar is stronger and more stable than local currencies due to its widespread use from one another to stem the spread of contagion yet when the global financial crisis struck in 2007 2008 no country turned to the facility for help mainly because the fund was too small south korea instead looked to the u s federal reserve in 2008 for a 30 billion bilateral swap deal more than double what it could have drawn from the cmi to ensure its strength and relevancy for the next crisis member countries have since set out to improve the cmi in 2010 they launched the cmi multilateralization cmim which transformed the overlapping series of bilateral swaps into a self managed pool governed by a single contract at its inception cmim totaled 120 billion but was doubled to 240 billion in 2012 not only was the size of the fund increased but so too was the amount each member could borrow without triggering imf conditionality imf de linked funds were raised from 20 percent of a country s drawing quota to 30 percent creating the asean 3 macroeconomic research office amro in the process to take on greater regional economic surveillance responsibilities in addition to its crisis management function a credit line to prevent imminent crises was also created in 2014 as tempting as it may be to frame the addition of local currencies to the cmim as a china led endeavor to contest the dominance of the dollar and promote the yuan it is rather the latest push by members to improve the utility of the arrangement incorporating major currencies from members will also encourage trade in those currencies as continued access to a partner s money is ensured this serves to both limit foreign exchange risk and buffer economies in the region against outside shifts since the global financial crisis there has been particular concern about shocks from the united states reverberating in the region due to overdependence on the dollar seemingly heightened now by the white house s trade war with china that south korea japan and asean countries have all independently demonstrated interest in diversifying away from the dollar further challenges the notion that the proposed change to the cmim is a power play by beijing nonetheless power dynamics are still at play particularly between china and japan beijing will undoubtedly seek to promote the yuan through the cmim in line with its broader efforts and tokyo will want to ensure at least an equal if not greater standing for the yen on the grounds that its exchange rate is more liberalized getting to a solution that both can sign on to could prove difficult given their rivalry yet despite this competition the two have been able to cooperate and advance the regional financial safety net over the years this is due in part to their shared interest in ensuring the economic stability of the region but also to the ability of other asean 3 countries to facilitate agreement between them namely south korea seoul has played a key role in formulating and improving the regional currency swap arrangement this is perhaps most apparent in the negotiations to create the cmim with beijing and tokyo vying for greater voting power in the planning of the new institution seoul broke the deadlock by proposing a quota system giving each equal say which now forms the structure of the cmim there are various reasons why south korea has been essential in developing the regional financial safety net ramon pacheco pardo korea foundation free university of brussels korea chair argues that seoul has actively sought to be central to regional financial governance due to the growing importance of financial markets in the domestic economy a self perception and increasingly active role as a middle power and support for asean 3 institutionalization as asean centrality has diminished other scholars such as kaewkamol pitakdumrongkit at the s rajaratnam school of international studies also point out that south korea is seen as an impartial actor without the geopolitical aspirations of japan and china these factors also make seoul well positioned to help break through any potential impasse on implementing local currency contributions to the cmim this latest proposed upgrade to the cmim won t definitively answer questions about its usability though it would yield immediate results in addition to promoting trade in local currencies it could also help lessen the possibility that bilateral currency swaps in the region developed outside of the cmim would undermine regional cooperation just as it has been before seoul will be crucial

a new manufacturing standard just recently we installed the first print engine into vjet x this print engine is the heart of our new additive mass manufacturing solution and i firmly believe one of the most advanced piece of technology in the whole additive manufacturing industry the shifts we have made to our business and our deeper focus on the three core areas of innovation integration and speed are igniting the next phase of growth and profitability for voxeljet first quarter 2019 results revenues for the first quarter of 2019 increased by 10 2 to keur 5 565 compared to keur 5 052 in the first quarter of 2018 revenues from our systems segment which focuses on the development production and sale of 3d printers increased 75 6 to keur 2 415 in the first quarter of 2019 from keur 1 375 in last year s first quarter the company delivered two new and one used and refurbished 3d printer in the first quarter of 2019 compared to two used and refurbished printers delivered in last year s first quarter systems revenues also include all systems related revenues from consumables spare parts and maintenance the increase of revenues from our systems segment was mainly due to higher revenues from systems related revenues while revenue from the sale of 3d printers slightly increased the increase of systems related revenues reflects the higher installed base of 3d printers in the market and the associated growth in aftersales activities systems revenues represented 43 4 of total revenues in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 27 2 in last year s first quarter revenues from our services segment which focuses on the printing of on demand parts for our customers decreased 14 3 to keur 3 150 in the first quarter of 2019 from keur 3 677 in the comparative period of 2018 this was mainly due to lower revenue contributions from our german operation we received a lower number of orders mainly reflecting a lower demand from the automotive industry this was partially offset by increased revenue contributions from our subsidiary voxeljet america inc voxeljet america the increase in revenue at our american service center was mainly attributable to a volume contract which we entered into during the second quarter of 2018 cost of sales was keur 3 652 for the first quarter of 2019 compared to keur 2 919 for the first quarter of 2018 gross profit and gross profit margin were keur 1 913 and 34 4 respectively in the first quarter of 2019 compared to keur 2 133 and 42 2 respectively in the first quarter of 2018 gross profit for our systems segment increased to keur 829 in the first quarter of 2019 from keur 381 in the first quarter of 2018 gross profit margin for this segment increased to 34 3 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 27 7 in the first quarter of 2018 this was mainly due to higher gross profit margin contributions from systems related revenues resulting from a more favorable ratio of revenues to fixed costs compared to last year s first quarter gross profit for our services segment significantly decreased to keur 1 084 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to keur 1 752 in the first quarter of 2018 the gross profit margin for this segment decreased to 34 4 in the first quarter of 2019 from 47 6 in the first quarter of 2018 this was mainly related to lower gross profit margin from the german service center as a result of lower utilization our subsidiary voxeljet america also contributed lower gross profit margin due to higher depreciation expense as we added additional 3d printers to our american service center during the third quarter of 2018 including one vx4000 system selling expenses remained nearly unchanged at keur 1 676 for the first quarter of 2019 compared to keur 1 736 in the first quarter of 2018 despite an increase in revenues we incurred higher shipping and packaging expenses which vary from quarter to quarter depending on quantity and types of products as well as the destinations where those goods are being delivered administrative expenses were keur 1 439 for the first quarter of 2019 compared to keur 1 232 in the first quarter of 2018 this was mainly due to an increase in headcount resulting in higher personnel expenses as part of management s remediation efforts on the material weakness identified in the prior year in addition we incurred higher consulting fees as part of our project to expand our enterprise resource planning erp system we have hired additional employees in the it team for the management of sap erp system related tasks research and development r d expenses increased to keur 1 705 in the first quarter of 2019 from keur 1 597 in the first quarter of 2018 the increase of keur 108 was mainly due to higher personnel expenses as a result of a slight increase in headcount other operating expenses in the first quarter of 2019 were keur 13 compared to keur 358 in the prior year period this was mainly due to lower losses from foreign currency transaction for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 other operating income was keur 978 for the first quarter of 2019 compared to keur 402 in the first quarter of 2018 the increase was mainly due to higher gains from foreign currency transactions the changes in foreign currency gains and losses were primarily driven by the valuation of the intercompany loans granted by the parent company to our uk and us subsidiaries operating loss was keur 1 942 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to an operating loss of keur 2 388 in the comparative period in 2018 the improvement was primarily related to a significant increase of other operating income partially offset by a lower gross profit financial result was negative keur 858 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to a financial result of positive keur 678 in the comparative period in 2018 the significant decrease was mainly driven by the revaluation of the derivative financial instruments in connection with the european investment bank loan net loss for the first quarter of 2019 was keur 2 788 or eur 0 57 per share as compared to net loss of keur 1 716 or eur 0 46 per share in the first quarter of 2018 based on a conversion rate of five american depositary shares adss per ordinary share net loss was at eur 0 11 per ads for the first quarter of 2019 compared to a net loss of eur 0 09 per ads for the first quarter of 2018 earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to stockholders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the periods earnings per ads is calculated by dividing the above earnings per share by five as each ordinary share represents five adss business outlook our revenue guidance for the second quarter of 2019 is expected to be in the range of keur 5 000 to keur 5 250 we reaffirm our guidance for the full year ending december 31 2019 full year revenue is expected to be in the range of keur 27 000 to keur 30 000 gross margin is expected to be above 40 operating expenses for the full year are expected as follows selling and administrative expenses are expected to be in the range of keur 12 000 to keur 12 500 and r d expenses are projected to be between approximately keur 5 500 and keur 6 000 depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be between keur 3 750 and keur 4 000 adjusted ebitda for the second half of the year ending december 31 2019 is expected to be neutral to positive adjusted ebitda is defined as net income loss as calculated under ifrs accounting principles before interest income expense provision benefit for income taxes depreciation and amortization and excluding other operating income expense resulting from foreign exchange gains or losses on the intercompany loans granted to the subsidiaries capital expenditures are projected to be in the range of keur 2 000 to keur 2 500 which primarily includes ongoing investments in our global subsidiaries our total backlog of 3d printer orders at march 31 2019 was keur 3 422 which represents six 3d printers this compares to a backlog of keur 3 392 representing six 3d printers at december 31 2018 as production and delivery of our printers is generally characterized by lead times ranging between three to nine months the conversion rate of order backlog into revenue is dependent on the equipping process for the respective 3d printer as well as the timing of customers requested deliveries at march 31 2019 we had cash and cash equivalents of keur 8 482 and held keur 8 924 of investments in bond funds and keur 1 253 in one

defined as net income loss as calculated under ifrs accounting principles interest income expense provision benefit for income taxes depreciation and amortization and excluding other income expense resulting from foreign exchange gains or losses on the intercompany loans granted to the subsidiaries management believes adjusted ebitda to be an important financial measure because it excludes the effects of fluctuating foreign exchange gains or losses on the intercompany loans granted to its subsidiaries we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential full year financial impact of foreign currency translation because of volatility in foreign exchange rates therefore we are unable to provide a reconciliation our forward looking guidance for non gaap adjusted ebitda without unreasonable effort as certain information necessary to calculate such measure on an ifrs basis is unavailable dependent on future events outside of our control and cannot be predicted without unreasonable efforts by the company management regularly uses both ifrs and non ifrs results and expectations internally to assess its overall performance of the business making operating decisions and forecasting and planning for future periods management believes that adjusted ebitda is a useful financial measure to the company s investors as it helps investors better understand and evaluate the projections our management board provides the company s calculation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled financial measures reported by other peer companies adjusted ebitda should not be

voxeljet uk ltd and voxeljet india pvt ltd as well as voxeljet china co ltd which are collectively referred to herein as the group or the company our condensed consolidated interim financial statements were prepared in compliance with all applicable measurement and presentation rules contained in international financial reporting standards ifrs as set forth by the international accounting standards board iasb and interpretations of the ifrs interpretations committee ifric the designation ifrs also includes all valid international accounting standards ias and the designation ifric also includes all valid interpretations of the standing interpretations committee sic specifically these financial statements were prepared in accordance with the disclosure requirements and the measurement principles for interim financial reporting purposes specified by ias 34 the iasb issued a number of new ifrs standards which are required to be adopted in annual periods beginning after

condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the three months ended march 31 2019 and 2018 were authorized for issue by the management board on may 16 2019 2 summary of significant accounting policies except as described below the accounting policies applied in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are the same as those applied in the company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2018 which can be found in its annual report on form 20 f that was filed with the u s securities and exchange commission on march 28 2019 the changes in accounting policies are also expected to be reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ending december 31 2019 the group has initially adopted ifrs 16 leases from january 1 2019 a number of other new standards are effective from january 1 2019 but these do not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements ifrs 16 introduced a single on balance sheet accounting model for lessees as a result the group as a lessee has recognized right of use assets representing its rights to use the underlying assets and lease liabilities representing its obligation to make lease payments lessor accounting remains similar to previous accounting policies the group has applied ifrs 16 using the modified retrospective approach under which the cumulative effect of initial application is recognized in retained earnings as of january 1 2019 accordingly the comparative information presented for 2018 has not been restated and is therefore presented as previously reported under ias 17 and related interpretations the details of changes in accounting are disclosed below definition of a lease previously the company determined at contract inception whether an arrangement was or contained a lease under ifric 4 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease the company now assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease based on the new definition of a lease under ifrs 16 a contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration on transition to ifrs 16 the company elected to apply the practical expedient to grandfather the assessment of which transactions are leases it applies ifrs 16 only to contracts that were previously identified as leases contracts that were not identified as leases under ias 17 and ifric 4 were not reassessed therefore the definition of a lease under ifrs 16 has been applied only to contracts entered into or changed on or after january 1 2019 at inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component the company allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease and non lease component on the basis of their relative stand alone prices the company as a lessee the company leases assets including properties production equipment and vehicles as a lessee the company previously classified leases as operating or finance leases based on its assessment of whether the lease transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership under ifrs 16 the company recognizes right of use assets and lease liabilities for most leases these leases are on balance sheet however the company has elected not to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities for some leases of low value assets e g tools as well as short term leases leases with less than 12 months of lease term the company recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term the company presents right of use assets in property plant and equipment in the same line item as it presents underlying assets of the same nature that it owns the carrying amounts of right of use assets are as below property plant and equipment property production equipment others total in thousands balance at january 1 2019 3 134 112 280 3 526 balance at march 31 2019 4 759 104 277 5 140 the company presents lease liabilities within financial liabilities in the condensed consolidated statements of financial position leases under ifrs 16 the company recognizes a right of use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date the right of use asset is initially measured at an amount equal to the lease liability and subsequently at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date discounted using the company s incremental borrowing rate the lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made it is remeasured when there is a change in the future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee or as appropriate changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonable certain not to be exercised the company has applied judgement to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include renewal options the assessment of whether the company is reasonably certain to exercise such options impacts the lease term which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right of use assets recognized transition previously the company classified property plant and equipment leases as operating leases under ias 17 these include manufacturing facilities the leases typically run for a period of three to ten years some leases include an option to renew the lease for an additional three to five years after the end of the non cancelable period at transition for leases classified as operating leases under ias 17 lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted at the company s incremental borrowing rates for similar assets as of january 1 2019 right of use assets are measured at an amount equal to the lease liability adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments the company used the following practical expedients when applying ifrs 16 to leases previously classified as operating leases under ias 17 applied a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics applied the exemption not to recognize right of use assets and liabilities for leases with less than 12 months of lease term used hindsight when determining the lease term if the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease the company leases a small number of items of production equipment these leases were classified as finance leases under ias 17 for these finance leases the carrying amount of the right of use asset and the lease liability at january 1 2019 were determined at the carrying amount of the lease asset and lease liability under ias 17 immediately before that date the company as a lessor the company leases out a small number of 3d printers those leases have been classified as operating leases the accounting policies applicable to the company as a lessor are not different from those under ias 17 the company is not required to make any adjustments on transition to ifrs 16 for leases in which it acts as a lessor impacts on financial statements impacts on transition on transition to ifrs 16 the

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s housing starts increased more than expected in april and activity in the prior month was stronger than initially thought suggesting declining mortgage rates were providing some support to the struggling housing market land and labor shortages however continue to constrain builders ability to construct more lower priced houses the segment of the market that has suffered an acute shortage of inventory and weak sales those supply challenges were highlighted by a drop in the number of homes under construction to a seven month low in april related stories the housing market is coming back a little said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania building activity is what really matters for economic growth and right now that is softening housing starts rose 5 7 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 235 million units last month driven by gains in the construction of both single and multi family housing units the commerce department said on thursday groundbreaking was also likely boosted by drier weather in the midwest data for march was revised up to show homebuilding rising to a pace of 1 168 million units instead of falling to a rate of 1 139 million units as previously reported building permits rose 0 6 to a rate of 1 296 million units in april after three straight monthly declines single family building permits however fell for the fifth straight month suggesting a moderation in groundbreaking activity was likely economists polled by reuters had forecast housing starts would increase to a pace of 1 205 million units in april the 30 year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to 4 10 from a peak of about 4 94 in november according to data from mortgage finance agency freddie mac decreasing mortgage rates reflect a recent decision by the federal reserve to suspend its three year monetary policy tightening campaign a survey on wednesday showed confidence among homebuilders rose to a seven month high in may while lower borrowing costs are boosting demand builders said they continue to deal with ongoing labor and lot shortages and rising material costs that are holding back supply and harming affordability relatively cheaper home loans and a strengthening labor market characterized by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years are underpinning demand for housing in a separate report on thursday the labor department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 16

while u s treasury prices fell sluggish manufacturing the robust job market should also support the economy as the boost from the white house s 1 5 trillion tax cut package fades and president donald trump s escalating trade war with china disrupts supply chains at factories which are already struggling with an inventory bloat that has cut production a third report from the philadelphia federal reserve on thursday showed manufacturing activity in the mid atlantic region accelerated in may but factories reported receiving fewer orders and were less upbeat about capital spending over the next six months the survey was conducted before last friday s move by trump to hike tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese goods while business sentiment appears to have picked up lately it is unclear what types of assumptions respondents had about trade policy and many of the responses for these surveys likely were completed before the increase in tariffs implemented last friday said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york the housing market has been mired in a soft patch since last year investment in homebuilding contracted at a 2 8 annualized rate in the first quarter the fifth straight quarterly decline last month single family homebuilding which accounts for the largest share of the housing market increased 6 2 to a rate of 854 000 units single family homebuilding surged in the midwest which had suffered flooding in prior months single family starts also rose in the northeast and west but fell in the south where the bulk of homebuilding occurs permits to build single family homes dropped 4 2 to a rate of 782 000 units in april the number of houses under construction fell last month as did competitions starts for the volatile multi family housing segment advanced 4 7 to a rate of 381 000 units last month permits for the construction of multi family homes rebounded 8 9 to a pace of 514 000 units last month it looks like residential construction will move sideways

oil and petroleum products carolyn kissane academic director and clinical professor at the center for global affairs at new york university leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil faskianos thank you welcome to the final session of the winter spring 2023 cfr academic webinar series i m irina faskianos vice president of the national program and outreach here at cfr today s discussion is on the record and the video and transcript will be available on our website cfr org academic if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates as always cfr takes no institutional positions on matters of policy we are delighted to have carolyn kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil dr kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at nyu s center for global affairs where she is also a clinical professor she also serves as director of the energy climate justice and sustainability lab in the school of professional studies at nyu she was named in 2013 by breaking energy as one of the top ten new york women in energy and top ten energy communicator she s a member of the council on foreign relations and the national committee on u s china relations and serves on several boards so carolyn thanks very much for doing this we really appreciate it i thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed especially vis à vis russia s war in ukraine and opec s recent announcement to cut oil production kissane well first of all i d just like to say thank you so very much for having me i m really delighted i am a big fan of cfr s academic webinars so to have the opportunity to participate in this in this way is very meaningful to me so thank you so wow there is so much happening in this space the geopolitics of oil this has been a tremendous fourteen months russia s reinvasion of ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because russia is a significant producer one of the top three in the world and it s you know it s caused a kind of a reshaping a kind of a remapping of the of oil geopolitics and we ve seen some you know shifts in how countries think about oil security in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions and also on top of that is the ongoing energy transition coupled with you know climate change and the need to decarbonize so there s just it s been quite a you know a year and a half that has really sort of put energy security and oil security very much at the forefront of people s minds faskianos fantastic i thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us and if you could walk us through those the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life that would be fantastic kissane sure so before i do i have a couple of slides and before i share my slides i think it s really important that sort of we understand how interconnected sort of the global energy system is and how interconnected we are when it comes to the flows of oil you know some countries are very well resourced endowed so they have oil and other countries do not so they need to import oil there s really no country in the world that doesn t need oil for larger national security issues and i think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about is the amount of oil that gets produced every day so every day the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day and every day that 100 million barrels has to be has to be moved it has to be you know as part of getting it into the system getting it to its respective destinations and what we re not seeing which maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point is we re not seeing a reduction in demand but we re seeing an expansion in demand and much of that global demand is coming out of asia and we re also of course seeing the with the reopening of china lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in china for the 2023 2024 years whether or not they will they will sort of put extra pressure on global demand and you know irina just also you know it s i m going to share this in my slides but you know last week s decision from opec to reduce production of course had an impact on the price of oil so when the decision was announced on sunday by monday morning we saw an uptick in the price it s stabilized but we are sort of looking at 80 plus a barrel oil and again lots of uncertainty as to what that s going to mean across economies that are in recessions experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession and sort of what does it mean for the global economy where we may see sort of more energy inflation so one of the things that i really like to do when i teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals because i think again sort of really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced and where in the world are the are the importers and also just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen just this you know in the last week of course some of this you ll be familiar with those in the audience but this decision on the part of opec to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day again happening at a time not when we have an excess supply but when we re seeing a tight supply across the oil market so it came as a bit of a surprise to you know to even the most you know longstanding analysts and opec observers and again part of this is directed probably toward self interests on the part of saudi arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts but of course it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the united states what does it mean then for prices that americans pay at the gas pump so the biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed surprised that opec would make this decision now it s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular opec decision this is part of now a larger opec and opec does also include russia as well as other countries like kazakhstan and mexico so the opec that we have historically known is now different because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as opec and these are the countries that are part of opec and really the country that s considered to be sort of in the driver s seat of opec is that of saudi arabia because saudi arabia is the largest producer within the opec organization producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day venezuela has the largest reserves but it is far from being at capacity in terms of what it can what it can produce so just to kind of put that into perspective these are opec countries and their respective reserves and then non opec the united states being a non opec country but again this sort of this chart to the right shows you know again the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand but again to sort of link this to energy security energy security especially when it s in the context of oil security is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices so when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets that suggests that we re also going to see higher prices that s going to directly hit vulnerable economies and so again just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers the united states saudi arabia and russia russia remains in the top three canada as well our you know neighbor to the north and china is also a producer of oil the united states figure here also includes gas liquefied so liquid petroleum which the united states is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas and then the top oil consuming countries you have u s china and india now the united states is not the largest importer that position is now held by china but as far as consumption goes we consume over 20 million barrels a day again big question mark about china in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of china over the next year two years with china s reopening and what is being you know discussed as revenge tourism and more chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings 2 1 trillion how are they going to use that savings and whether or not after three years of being under lockdown restrictions whether or not we ll see impacts to demand and i think russia is there s lots of questions about russia and this is now we re fourteen months into you know russia s reinvasion of ukraine and i emphasize reinvasion because oftentimes we forget that you know russia invaded ukraine in 2014 but russia is still moving its oil and up until you know a few months ago its overall production and exports were as high at some points even higher than pre invasion now you have new countries that are takers of russian oil and they re buying it at discounted prices we see turkey singapore china has been a big buyer as well as india that they have been buying discounted russian oil lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to europe but i think the takeaway from this slide is that russia continues to produce oil continues to sell it selling at a discounted price but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take russian oil and again i m not going to go into this but i just love this slide to just emphasize the you know the world s pipelines these are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil something also that s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic so the tankers that carry oil around the world but again you know there are a lot of pipelines so twenty three two thousand three hundred and eighty one operational oil and gas pipelines again these are it s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day and then finally is this is you know one of the things that we oftentimes we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming over 75 percent of the world s oil is controlled managed by state owned oil companies so saudi aramco being one pdvsa of venezuela being another but it s really important to sort of recognize the position that state owned companies have the rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies exxonmobil chevron eni total and a host of other host of other companies but again i think the you know to understand that nocs as they re referred to are very very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil and again what we saw last week coming out of opec this decision this is also being driven by state budget concerns this is again it s about the production of oil but it s also about you know governments and their budgets and oftentimes you know there is a desire to add more rather than you know more revenues rather than less so those are the slides that i have and i hope that they sort of provide some sort of context and a little bit of you know that we can discuss in the questions that i really look forward to answering from the audience faskianos thank you carolyn that was great so now we re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments gives queuing instructions all right so i m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing amadine hom go to you first and please accept the unmute yourself pause you are still muted pause ok i don t know are you there oh i think ok let s go to morton holbrook q yes good afternoon dr kissane what a shocking presentation laughs a hundred million barrels a day and it s going up notwithstanding the paris climate agreement of 2015 is that agreement simply a dead letter or is it having any effect on oil on fossil fuel production particularly oil production or what s the best scenario in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels considering the oil market thank you kissane well hi morton thank you so much for that excellent question yeah that s kind of why i emphasize that number is because a lot of people sort of just aren t aware of how much oil we continue to consume and again what the demand expectations are moving forward and these demand expectations are you know coming out of forecasts from the international energy agency so i think there s a big question as to when we see peak demand and you know if you look at bp scenarios they expect peak demand to happen you know before 2030 where as you know others kind of contest that they that they think that peak demand won t happen until after 2030 i mean again a lot depends on you know what we are now experiencing in the energy transition and how sort of quickly are we can we transition away from oil i think what s really critical when we re looking at oil is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector so we re thinking about cars we re thinking about planes you know we re thinking about trucks and tankers and all these things but it s petrochemicals you know there s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer so it really is across our economy and across economies across the global system one of the things that i always tell my students is even during covid where you had many countries right much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown we did have a reduction in oil demand but it wasn t it wasn t like 20 million barrels it was under ten so the fact that now it s 2023 the world has reopened it s really hard to sort of see or to know with certainty is when we re going to see that see that reduction in demand now i think with the paris agreement what s also important is to note is you know if you re if you re in the oil and gas space and i was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation was you know what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production so how are they integrating carbon capture sequestration you know how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy in this case that we re talking about oil and i think one of the things that i think if you sort of follow oil markets or a country like saudi arabia they are marketing low emission oil now we could you know we could sort of challenge well what does that you know what does that really mean but you are having you know countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production in the production of oil and that s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at in the context of the geopolitics of oil is to kind of understand the variation across emissions across different countries in the production of oil so we are you know again we are going to be going into cop 28 this fall again we are not seeing you know and we haven t seen a you know reduction in fossil energy demand again lots of people are sort of you know hoping that we ll start to see it sooner rather than later but for the time being and again you know to irina s first question that you know the last fourteen months and with you know with russia s invasion of ukraine it has both shown us that you know europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition by building out more renewable energy and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles but there s still big swaths of the world that you know are still and have yet to move towards you know really reducing and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward as their economies grow faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from jovana vujanic who is a graduate student at lewis university how big of an of an impact will the decision of the saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia kissane love the question thank you so much yeah no it s a great one so my take is that of course this decision came as a bit of a surprise and it wasn t something that the united states you know wanted but i would say that the u s saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years and as part of that there are lots of different reasons for that but this is yet kind of another thing that saudi has done and again i think it s also saudi has taken a non alignment policy with relation to its position on russia and ukraine so it continues to you know it continues to have a relationship with russia it also has the relationship with ukraine as we saw you know china just brokered a very significant deal between saudi arabia and iran you know again saudi arabia and iran are two are two important producers for china so china is a large importer of oil so if you go back to world war the end of world war ii that s when the united states established the oil for security relationship with saudi arabia and as we have grown sort of more i wouldn t say independent but our as our own oil production has increased especially through the shale revolution our dependence on the middle east and saudi arabia more specifically has shifted so i think we re seeing a very different saudi arabia today which i think is going to be a challenge for the united states i think it s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds last summer the biden administration did tap into the u s strategic petroleum reserves the largest the largest take in the history of the reserves which started in 1975 you know taking 180 million barrels out you know not because there was massive supply disruptions but because you know as the administration said it was you know it was it was it was a war it was a war specific decision because the you know russia s invasion of ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket and to cushion the american consumer and to better cushion the sort of the global economy the united states withdrew from the spr so i think the summer is going to be very interesting but i think we re going to see definitely much more attention in the years to come between the united states and saudi arabia it s not the relationship of the past this is a kind of a very new relationship that s a great question faskianos thank you thank you let s go curran flynn who has a raised hand q hello faskianos we can hear you but we re getting feedback so you might have two devices open q can you hear me now faskianos yes q that s better ok faskianos that s better thank you thank you so much q so i m here at king fahd university in saudi arabia right next to aramco here with my class from international relations and one of my students has a question nasser al nasir ph here he is q so thank you mrs carolyn my question is how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s market the domestic market and the role of the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers through their rdif fund and thank you to mrs irina kissane thank you and dr flynn thank you so much for having your students join this webinar so i m a little so the question is about the east siberian pipeline just could you would you mind repeating it i just want to make sure i have it i m clear on the question q so how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s energy markets i mean domestically and the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers to the rdif fund kissane yeah and that s a great question you know i think that you know begs a lot of things that we could be looking at right in terms of you know russia s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around or find workarounds to the sanctions that were imposed and i think we ve seen sort of new markets so this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil we see that as kind of in technicolor right whereas you know a lot of russian oil would go west is now going east you know china india being takers and of course you know other countries as well you know what will be its impact on the on the u s market i think that s you know again i do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place so that there wouldn t be massive disruptions so we again you know russia produces over 10 million barrels a day and about 7 million of those barrels are exported so you know if we lost all of that that would be a you know that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally we already saw you know impacts to sort of grains grain exports and food security in many different parts of the world so you know russia is finding different ways you have shadow tankers that russia is using to move to move its oil as you pointed out the east siberian pipeline you know i think there s only so much the united states can do or and european countries that are part of the sanctions regime can do to curtail russian exports of oil but i think that you know i think russia again has a has a desire and also you know revenue needs they re funding a very expensive war that they re finding ways to get their to get their oil out i think an interesting question is you know what does this mean in the years ahead the lack of investment for example that s going into russian energy infrastructure a lack of sort of any kind of western investment that is that is going in and what that is going to mean but again you know i think to your question i think we will see some you know we are seeing some impacts right there s a big question as to what you know what the next six months to a year will look like with regards to the reduction from opec and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on russian oil and you know would the united states then tap more into the spr we re now at you know we re down to seven hundred thousand barrels which of course is not insignificant but we also sort of have to be you know judicious about how we use the spr but thank you for the question faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from michael let s see trevett a ph d candidate at the university of southern mississippi china and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the south china sea what are your estimates of the potential amount there and has china begun to extract any of this oil kissane michael thank you so much that s a great question so china already is an oil producing country so you do have oil production in china in the south china sea i can t i can t say exactly i know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves again you do have you know you do have territorial concerns about sort of where is this you know can china can china tap those or seek to explore and tap those reserves again if there are if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located so you know china again one of the things that s very interesting about china is that china is an oil producer but china has seen over the last you know the last decade they have seen that they have experienced peak demand so i mean sorry peak supply so they are not producing as much as they used to and so you re seeing a year on year reduction in the producing capacity you know if you go back maybe five or six years ago there was lots of questions about if china could kind of replicate what happened in the united states around the shale oil revolution i think one of the big challenges for china is that of the you know where the shale reserves are located it s not near water lots of questions as to and some of it basically some of the tests have shown that it s it definitely is proving harder that you know they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the united states so yeah no i think in the south china sea again i think we it s potentially possible that we might see it i wouldn t i wouldn t i wouldn t say it s soon faskianos thank you i m taking the next question from rob warren at the anglo american university of prague this question also got an upvote how do you foresee venezuela s role in the global oil market changing moving forward and can it be reintegrated into the global economy kissane oh these are all fantastic questions thank you all so much yeah venezuela is again you know venezuela has they have the largest reserves in the world as part of this webinar right you cfr had a kind of a primer on venezuelan and kind of you know you look at sort of where venezuela is and one of the biggest challenges confronting venezuela is both its politics but it s also it basically you know you don t have you don t have international oil service providers in the country i think the only the only one now that the u s the u s has sort of given a sanctions exemption to is that of chevron but i think yeah i mean if you were to see you know kind of shifts in the political regime and you were to see more openness then i think you could imagine you know venezuela having an opportunity or a pathway forward to be more integrated into the global energy system and the global oil system you know i think one of the big problems that venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point and it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential so you know venezuela is one of these countries that s not producing as much as it could right it has the potential to be producing 2 million plus more barrels per day but you know we ve seen that they really have just they went into freefall so i think that s a big issue and another big issue which god it goes back to an earlier question is that of emissions so the oil that comes out of venezuela is a very very heavy oil so it s it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil so that i think is again as we you know think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low emission producers you know venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its where its oil sector was again it has the capacity it has the reserves but getting that getting that oil out of the ground right now you have a lot of significant above ground risks faskianos thank you i m going to go next to clemente abrokwaa raised hand so please unmute yourself q can you hear me please faskianos yes we can q thank you thank you so much for your for your talk i was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day laughs i didn t know that but anyway i m from penn state university and my question is you just mentioned about the above ground you know effects and so the movement towards like electric vehicles and so on how do you think it is going to affect the african continent kissane thank you q i am i m thinking you know the economies and then infrastructure it will be very difficult for them to laughs move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles and so on i just wanted your take on that kissane thank you clemente it s an excellent question yeah i mean you have countries across the african continent that not only have oil reserves but are already producing right nigeria is a is an oil producing country also has more capacity but again you have some above ground risks you also have the need for investment of new infrastructure i think one of the things that has been very interesting and i think it s getting it s getting more attention as it deserves is how western governments are some of i think a challenge across africa is that a lot of western governments have sort of said listen we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or also financial institutions western financial institutions we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or new projects that are fossil based and that you know that s problematic when you look across the african continent where you still don t have you know 100 percent energy access you know the idea of the transition to electric vehicles which is taking a very very long time even here across the across developed economies so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into you know across the continent of africa for oil and gas that s for their economies and for their own economic growth i think is really really pivotal and i think this is something that you know is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions and also you know is it hypocrisy right for western banks that have you know kind of funded the oil and gas industry or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the united states and many different parts of the world and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to africa and they have the again they have the they have the resources so you know is it you know the equity of some of these decisions that are being made i think is one that s is one that s really important and again i you know i said earlier in this talk is that you know all most of the demand for oil is not coming from north america and from europe all of the demand that we re seeing and new demand that we re going to see is coming from asia and is going to come from africa so again you know how are we going to make sure that that demand is met again going back to that idea of energy security so there is there is accessibility so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices you know without sort of thinking about kind of a whole of energy approach so i think it s very it s a very complex issue and i think you know western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund when it comes to new oil and gas projects are getting sort of challenged as to you know what does that mean then for you know countries across africa that are still very much in need of more energy not less and again recognizing that you know evs that again are still are you know we re seeing adoption here in the united states and across europe but it s a big big big adoption in china but it s very uneven so how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of africa i think is a really critical question faskianos thank you i ll take the next question from kyle bales who is a senior at lewis university in romeoville illinois how is the war between russia and ukraine having an effect on the progress of the european green deal maybe you can tell us what the european define the european green deal for us carolyn give us the context for that kissane yes so again this is another fantastic question yeah the european green deal it s this is this is great yeah i mean a lot of people would say that the european green deal now is that the russia s invasion of ukraine has sort of said hey this is why the green deal is so important this is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy because look what look what happened when we were dependent on russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas and look when russia you know illegally invades ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas we are left very energy insecure it affects it affects consumers it affects industry across the continent so i think we re seeing not just through the green deal but we re also seeing through sort of european green industrial policy so in some ways akin to what you know we put into effect in this past summer is the inflation reduction act and we re seeing almost kind of this industrial competition around clean energy technologies and so europe is investing you know i think it s about 250 billion the united states it s about 370 billion towards the kind of the energy transition and helping to support domestic industries and companies to you know to be able to you know develop the technologies and to have the you know the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition so i think one thing though whenever i talk about europe it s really important is to sort of recognize that you know when you look across europe you have very different policies and kind of approaches to sort of thinking about energy and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition whereas others you know are probably going to experience a slower transition so just really interesting example as you talked about the green deal is the eu taxonomy the green taxonomy that went into effect in the january of 2022 and there you had like really a lot of contention between france and germany because france wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy germany was opposed right but germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy so ultimately in the end both natural gas and nuclear and again this was this predated russia s invasion of ukraine but in the eu green taxonomy you have you know you have both nuclear and natural gas in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change so you know i think you re seeing this kind of some people call it a race a competition you know ideally it s you know we re kind of working together to because we re all sort of going in the same direction to you know support the transition and to reduce to reduce carbon emissions and to bring in more sort of cleaner energy technologies into our system faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from dr laeed zaghlami q yes good afternoon this is laeed good afternoon irina good afternoon carolyn i m very pleased to be part of your program just to want to be back to africa and particularly to nigeria how practical the two projects that nigeria is advocating for pipelines one from through algeria and the other one to morocco through western african countries how practical are these pipelines to supply gas to europe and parts of some african countries faskianos and dr zaghlami you are at algiers university correct q indeed irina yes i am professor at university of algiers faculty of information and communication faskianos thank you kissane dr laeed can i can i keep you on for just one second can i ask you what is the what is the status right now is it it s planned under construction where is what is the status of those two pipelines my understanding is that it s they re proposed but q yes well actually in practically the pipeline between algeria and abuja which means through niger and so forth is already in progress whereas the other project through thirteen western african countries they are supposed to be implemented by 2047 but is it is there any political game or something of strategic inaudible how practical how logical how efficiently will be for nigeria to have two similar project s kissane yeah no it s again thank you for the question you know pipelines again that s why i wanted to show the laughs kind of the map of pipelines is because you know a lot of pipelines transverse you know multiple countries right and this is this requires not just you know a lot of cooperation but it requires technically it also can be very complex to build to build pipelines and when you re talking about something like as you as you point out these are you know crossing many countries you know i think one of the again one of the issues is whether or not since you know what already is under construction i think you can you know with confidence that one will be completed anything that s not yet under construction and again the timeline 2047 is way out there a lot of a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward for various reasons in terms of making sure that the investments are there someone i know that studies pipelines he says you know until the steel is in the ground you don t have the pipeline and so until you know that you ve got that you know you ve got all the oks and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it i think algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn t gotten enough attention in terms of algerian gas that has that has helped support europe over the last years we ve seen an increase in algerian gas going into europe again a lot of attention on u s lng and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into europe but also algeria has been you know very important for helping to support european energy security and make up for some of the losses of the of the russian gas and i think we ll see more attention on algeria and algeria s role as a you know as an important source of energy especially you know gas going into going into europe moving forward faskianos so i ll take the next written question from vincent brooks who is at harvard and diamondback energy board of directors how do you view the purchasing of discounted russian oil by india in particular relative to the purchasing by china how are they using the oil purchased and are you seeing more internal usage or external profit making sales in places like africa and what are the implications of all of this kissane right great great question so all of the above laughs in some ways right there is definitely sort of profits that are being made you know i was i was talking about this last week with someone and you know if you sort of put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of india right so india is a is a rapidly growing economy 1 4 billion you know if you had if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices that s going to have ripples effects across the indian economy and so you know when you have a kind of opportunity to buy you know pretty steep discounted oil which you know they had been able to buy from russia you know for purposes of national security they ve been buying the oil and one of the things that s very interesting about india is that actually india has been building out its refining capacity so a lot of that oil is both for domestic and some of it is being sort of re exported but i think what we ve seen is that they re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging refining power in asia and we see that in some ways in china too so china even though oil demand was down in 2022 much of the oil that they were buying from russia went into its strategic supplies which you know they now have access to and again i think you know a big question is what we re going to see moving forward around oil demand in china wood mackenzie just published a really interesting piece kind of very bullish on the expectations for oil demand in china so whether or not they re going to continue to buy you know russian oil and again sort of taking advantage of these lower prices you know and i think i think one of the things that it s kind of an inconvenient truth whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in europe so european trading houses were kind of the main the main points of russian oil trade a lot of that has been moved out so you know russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions and have set up in some cases they ve set up trading houses and some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that you know that they can sort of again bypass the compliance to the sanctions and you have some you have some russian oil traders that are making a lot of money laughs selling discounted oil and then reselling it a really interesting case a couple of months ago was out of malaysia malaysia announced or in the you know that they were that 1 5 million barrels were produced and sold but only malaysia doesn t produce that much so those were russian barrels that were sort of being sold under sort of the malaysian under the malaysian barrel so again i think china and india have you know have taken advantage some of this has again as i said has been re exported and some of it you know has been re exported through petroleum products because china and india you know both are building and have refining capacity faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from bhakti mirchandani at columbia university what global trajectory do you see for nuclear the russia ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy and so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy kissane bhakti thank you and i was just at columbia earlier today for the center for global energy policy s conference yeah nuclear is very interesting right so when we re thinking about you know decarbonizing our energy systems you know nuclear plays a very important role because it s zero emitting so in certain parts of the world china being one saudi arabia you know you have a lot of new nuclear build you know in other parts of the world you have a lot of contention about nuclear we saw that even in germany which have you know three remaining nuclear power plants and even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year there was still sort of pushback about no those nuclear power plants need to be shut down whereas you would think ok in light of energy insecurity let s keep them open so you know france is an interesting country france had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent but this past year they pivoted and they ve said no we re actually going to build out more nuclear and we re sort of we re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy and nuclear is very important for france s electricity system sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear and they re going to increase by i think almost 50 percent again part of this is their to meet their targets of net zero we also see japan japan you know the fukushima disaster really turned japanese the japanese public off of nuclear very very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants but this past year even though there s still safety concerns on the part of the public the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices so nuclear being a domestic source of energy so i think when you look at you know net zero pathways i have not seen a net zero pathway that does not include nuclear so here in the united states the net zero america project out of princeton very important place for nuclear we just have a really hard time laughs building nuclear at cost so it s very expensive usually it s significant cost overruns and of course there is the i think they have a really significant pr problem people there s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear so i think to your point it s very very important for decarbonizing energy systems but you re going to see i think very disjointed approaches some countries are going are embracing nuclear and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system faskianos we have so many questions and we are just not going to get to them all so i m going to take the next question from christian bonfili who s at torcuato di tella university in argentina so do you think carolyn that the landscape resulting from the ukraine invasion by russia vis à vis securitization of gas and energy between europe and russia could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy kissane great question i think in europe it is and i think you know many analysts would agree that the iea for example you know you had the you know how does europe continue you know to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on russia gas and a lot of that is through renewable energy you also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen and the role that hydrogen will play i think i think europe is being cautious and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas so as earlier questions are they getting gas from algeria or are they getting gas from norway are they getting more gas from the united states in the form of liquefied natural gas and then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from russia so we ve seen an increase in lng from russia going into europe that said i think all in you are seeing that you know countries across europe are saying ok you know how can we enhance our energy security how do we build more sort of domestic energy sources solar wind we re seeing you know more rapid deployment you ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that but i think overall i think the answer would be that it s quickening the energy transition faskianos so i will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on and just to give us your top three what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil as you look out over the next five to ten year horizon that you would leave us with to be looking for kissane ok you know so i think what we saw right tensions between saudi arabia and the united states we also have a you know a hot war cold war depending on you know the term you want to use between the united states and china and lots of sort of questions as to what that s going to look like i think there s you know i think there s concern that you know we re not reducing demands but we re seeing tightening supply and so that s going to have you know very significant impacts for economies especially economies that are already very fragile economically fragile politically fragile so that concerns me a lot in terms of you know what happens when you know economies don t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries that their that consumers you know are able that the lights can stay on and you can get you know if you re dependent on cars you re depending on trucks like all these kinds of things are really really critical so i think we have to be very cautious moving forward that we don t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not are not they re not decreasing i think they are increasing and becoming even more complex so i think there s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty and you know this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead faskianos carolyn kissane kissane excuse me thank
