introduction and summary the good news is that the economic evidence suggests there is indeed room for the government to address the country s current challenges and the economic research shows ways this can be accomplished by using spending and tax policy more effectively than how it has been used in the past the content of those investments is crucial smart investments that boost competitiveness and secure economic stability for working families will yield returns while wasteful tax cuts will create massive long term deficits without clear tangible benefits in short america still can do big things and it can do those more effectively than it has in the past each dollar spent on smarter more effective government programs and tax policy will then go a lot further in boosting the economy and strengthening a struggling middle class the u s economy finds itself at a crossroads of overlapping challenges long term productivity and economic growth are low while income and wealth inequality are high meanwhile the country faces a series of challenges from collapsing economic security for middle and working class americans to climate change and more 1 addressing these challenges will undoubtedly require the deployment of significant federal resources since the private sector has failed to do so existing debt levels simply as a stand alone matter pose manageable challenges the government has the room to increase spending and reform taxes while putting a lower priority on deficit reduction provided those investments are made in the smart way outlined herein the bottom line is that addressing this country s national challenges today and securing its fiscal future tomorrow can be done through a coordinated approach to spending tax revenue and borrowing that ensures a more competitive inclusive economy in the most expedient and effective way possible the economic research summarized in this report shows how this is doable this report seeks to lay out guideposts for fiscal policy to help congress and future administrations evaluate the choices they make going forward and better accomplish the goals of meeting today s national challenges in a financially responsible way for the future findings include to be clear the deficit busting 2017 tax cuts show that policymakers fighting for working families should not fall for letting the debt and deficit be used as a heads i win tails you lose political trick deployed against only working families economic priorities but the tax cuts also revealed the depth of their own flawed approach to debt yes policymakers still need to take seriously how to budget for economically appropriate and sustainable levels of debt and deficits but a large economic literature shows that debt incurred in a smarter way translates into faster growth which in turn makes repaying that debt far easier than the wasteful inefficient and ineffective supply side tax cuts that have dominated fiscal policy of the past two decades with such a smarter approach guided by economic evidence policymakers will be able to confidently say that america can build an economy that works for all while also meeting its financial obligations for the future how budgets and the economy link up the following sections then discuss the existing evidence on the potential causal relationships among the key variables specifically this report looks at how deficits influence interest rates economic growth and inflation a more thorough understanding on the causal relationships between these variables will permit a consideration of future trends in the debt to gdp ratio if the underlying causes of deficits such as tax cuts or spending increases result in faster growth without offsetting increases in interest rates the debt to gdp ratio may grow more slowly or even fall alternatively if deficits caused by past policy choices do not translate into faster growth the debt to gdp ratio will increase the growth of the debt to gdp ratio depends on deficits interest rates inflation and critically economic growth larger primary deficits and higher interest rates all else equal mean that the debt to gdp ratio will increase faster inflation and economic growth on the other hand will lead to a decline in the ratio gdp is measured here in noninflation adjusted terms so that faster price increases help to reduce the debt to gdp ratio importantly this is just an accounting statement not a theory on causal relationships between the key variables deficits interest rates inflation and growth 3 given that the united states is still far away from debt levels where such risks would begin to materialize as the summary discussion below shows the key question is how deficits could grow such that debt levels become a burden as the discussion on debt crises further below shows rather than a useful way of financing today s social needs first laying out how and why debt to gdp can increase stay the same or even fall will provide a useful organization for the rest of this report the key measure that economists consider in answering that question is the ratio of debt to gross domestic product gdp there is undoubtedly a level of debt to gdp that is too high for any country if a country reaches that point it could face a financial crisis whereby investors lose confidence in a government s ability to repay its debt the result would be quickly rising interest rates as money flees an economy falling exchange rates slowing economic growth and possibly a deep recession with sharp increases in unemployment but with a wealthy and largely productive economy a stable rule of law and efficient tax collection mechanisms the united states remains extraordinarily creditworthy 2 certain factors moreover make this additionally true such as the u s dollar currently being the leading global reserve currency whereby other countries want to invest their savings in u s dollars as a safe haven from all kinds of economic and political risks the u s government also has independent control over its currency which lowers the risk of sharp interest rate increases due to changes outside of the united states this is not always the case for other countries including the eurozone the european countries that share the euro as their common currency but even for the united states debt beyond a certain level could create challenges that deserve serious consideration and appropriate management public debt is not inherently bad in fact it can be quite useful depending on for what purposes the money was used it allows the federal government to make immediate investments that yield benefits now and in the future when done efficiently focusing on measures that have been shown to boost growth and reduce inequality debt has enabled the united states to achieve victory in both world war ii and the cold war build a modern infrastructure produce groundbreaking innovations recover from economic crises and more indeed maintaining a reasonable level of federal debt is actually economically essential for both the u s and the global economy u s debt forms the foundation of the u s financial system serving as collateral and liquidity for a wide range of financial markets and institutions worldwide assets are priced in relation to u s debt the question is not whether the united states should have debt instead it is how much deficits interest rates inflation and growth today s debt is the accumulation of past government deficits as noted there may be good reasons to run deficits but government deficits are not entirely like that of a business or family as the government has a special role to play in the macroeconomic cycle deficits often arise in the context of slow economic growth or recessions it is important though to distinguish here between cyclical and structural deficits a budget deficit may widen as the economy turns into a recession tax revenues fall and spending on social programs and other activities increases some of this is automatic due to the progressivity of income taxes for instance and the social insurance nature of many spending programs such as the supplemental nutrition assistance program social security and unemployment insurance in addition some part of the cyclically widening deficit may follow from legislative decisions to temporarily stimulate the economy with tax cuts and spending increases either way cyclical deficits may lead to a more stable economy than would be the case if governments actively engaged in policies to keep deficits from rising or even tried to reduce deficits in the middle of a recession a process commonly known as austerity structural deficits follow from longer term policy decisions that are often albeit not always intended to boost longer term or trend economic growth congress may decide to cut taxes especially corporate taxes and higher income earners personal taxes to lower the costs of capital for businesses in widely discredited supply side theory also often referred to as trickle down economics this should result in more investments and faster economic growth alternatively congress may decide to spend more on increasing the country s infrastructure invest more in education and raise benefits in social programs better infrastructure should reduce business costs as firms presumably can get their goods to market in a faster and more reliable way higher quality education should increase the skills and thus the productivity of workers and finally higher benefits in social programs could lower poverty and income inequality as well as improve children s future prospects less income inequality means that lower income and middle income families may see faster income growth than otherwise would have been the case they can both spend more and save more money or alternatively incur less debt the resulting economic security for many families could create pathways to more upward mobility and investments in commodities such as housing startup businesses and children s education all of which could have positive effects on economic growth over time a number of different schools of thought exist that link fiscal policy with long term economic growth especially in the current context of modest economic growth slow business investment gains persistent underemployment and very high income inequality many of these favor more government spending especially to boost infrastructure spending and reduce income inequality for example through larger social insurance programs as the evidence in this paper discusses the evidence on the effectiveness of fiscal policy to boost long term economic growth gained more attention from economists of all stripes amid the modest economic growth following the great recession some economists argued that the united states was stuck with unsatisfactorily slow growth due to structural problems 4 the need for additional government spending to strengthen the economy may then be especially important when structural problems such as massive inequality and financial bubbles hold back the economy from growing more quickly importantly monetary policy the other macroeconomic policy lever to increase economic activity may not work because interest rates are already near zero percent under those circumstances more public spending may have to offset the lack of private activity several structural problems such as low investment spending and high income inequality and thus limited demand that hampered economic growth immediately after the great recession continue while others such as tight credit after the bursting credit bubble have diminished the evidence reviewed in this report suggests that more public spending on infrastructure education and measures to reduce income inequality can boost economic growth debt relative to the size of the economy may even shrink in this case as economic growth outpaces debt growth from new deficits and interest rates the economic evidence discussed in this paper shows that more public spending on infrastructure education and measures to reduce income inequality is a much more effective and more efficient way of using government resources than cutting taxes for high income individuals and corporations it then also follows that a more effective fiscal policy will make it easier for governments to manage any associated deficits and public debt in fact the data indicate that effective investments even when financed with deficits could potentially result in less debt relative to the size of the economy because of faster economic growth that outpaces increases in debt cyclical deficits interest rates inflation and long term growth cyclical deficits go along with shorter term temporary downturns in the economy but there is also a link between these temporary deficits and longer term growth cyclical deficits reflect fewer taxes and more spending both less revenue and more outlays counter the underlying cause of a recession a drop in demand families and businesses will have more after tax income thus the underlying causes of the cyclical deficits will make a recession less severe than otherwise would be the case this is especially true when deficits increase as a consequence of more social insurance spending such as unemployment insurance and social security 5 whether cyclical deficits increase automatically due to the progressive features of taxes and spending so called automatic stabilizers or whether they result from discretionary policy responses to an economic downturn they will counteract recessions and quicken economic recovery a key implication is that a country can strengthen its automatic stabilizers and as a result its ability to counteract recessions with more progressive taxation and larger social insurance systems the impact of automatic stabilizers tends to be more pronounced in the european union than in the united states the evidence suggests that the automatic stabilizers in the european union mitigated income shocks resulting from the great recession more effectively than in the united states especially with respect to unemployment rates 6 some economists such as alberto alesina and silvia ardagna though argue against using spending increases and tax cuts to help a weak economy they assert that governments that have shrunk their deficits mainly by cutting spending and maintaining tax rates will ultimately be in a better position to grow again 7 under this expansionary austerity theory smaller deficits make consumers and businesses feel more confident about the future of their economies thus they spend and invest more than they otherwise would those effects outweigh the contractive effects of cutting government programs or increasing the government s revenue take this argument has occasionally been used to support cutting deficits or at least not expanding them to boost economic growth when it is weak in fact a number of politicians seized on the expansionary austerity theory and argued for more spending cuts immediately following the great recession 8 the underlying data used to support this viewpoint however rely on findings from just a few organization for economic cooperation and development oecd countries that were near or at full employment far away from an actual recession 9 moreover the research did not distinguish between planned fiscal policy measures and changes brought on by automatic stabilizers considering the entirety of the evidence on budget deficit reductions via spending cuts indicates that these cuts indeed tend to lower economic growth presumably harming an economy when it is in a recession or a phase of weak growth 10 thus the evidence does not support the notion of expansionary austerity economic research instead generally concludes that wider deficits during a recession help stabilize the economy the literature finds that spending measures especially those improving social insurance benefits and infrastructure spending tend to have the largest effects for each dollar spent on stabilizing the economy while tax cuts tend to have relatively mild effects 11 research on the economic effects of arra shows that it helped reverse the decline in the u s economy researchers find that arra alone boosted economic growth by more than 3 percent 12 while the great recession was the worst downturn in recent history the evidence suggests that arra and other policy responses prevented it from being far worse see figure 1 a large fiscal policy intervention to combat the great recession was especially warranted since the other policy lever lowering interest rates was ultimately limited when interest rates effectively fell to zero bradford delong and lawrence summers argued that deficit financed government spending amid very low interest rates and high unemployment could ultimately reduce the debt to gdp ratio not only in a cyclical downturn but also in an environment where the economy grows very slowly 13 in a recession the economy would grow faster than otherwise would be the case due to the additional government spending that fills in the gap left by the lack of private investment and consumer spending by definition there is a lot of room to grow in a recession illustrated for instance by low investment and high unemployment debt growth on the other hand is limited due to low interest rates when the government runs a deficit to be clear this research also implies that fiscal inaction comes with a substantial cost people will lose out on jobs and wage gains that would allow them to pay their bills and save for their future when the government decides that austerity and debt reduction should take precedent over investing in the economy and its people amid underemployment massive inequality and modest growth after the great recession the positive effect of stimulus spending came about because arra increased consumer spending especially for automobiles and retail sales at the same time the law had no measurable inflationary effect 14 it also raised employment above where it otherwise would have been especially from assistance to low income households and infrastructure spending 15 the bottom line is that a substantial temporary stimulus can help stabilize economic growth especially if it prioritizes aid to low income households and infrastructure helping low income households means that money will be spent right away spending on infrastructure typically boosts manufacturing and construction two sectors that are generally disproportionately hurt in a recession 16 more economic stability can then translate into more long term economic growth economic research has shown that countries that have smaller swings in economic growth over time tend to also grow more quickly over the long term 17 one key mechanism that is likely at work here is that smaller and less frequent economic swings make it easier for businesses to plan for the future and thus to invest in longer term projects 18 more productive investments following more economic stability will ultimately translate into faster long term economic growth however higher interest rates could offset the positive benefits from wider cyclical deficits they could emerge due to two factors first fiscal stimulus would increase the demand for goods and services in an economy if the economy is already running at a reasonable clip greater demand should result in higher prices second the federal reserve may become worried about increasing inflation and decide to increase short term interest rates moreover governments will typically borrow more money to finance wider deficits thus increasing the demand for debt the price of debt the interest rate should then in theory go up should ultimately interest rates rise economic growth will subsequently slow businesses will find it harder to finance their investments and households will have to pay more for their debt for everything from credit cards to home mortgages higher interest rates could then dampen the positive effects of wider cyclical deficits as economic growth is slower than it would be otherwise again the critical underlying question is for what purposes the deficits were used especially whether the underlying investments promoted faster economic growth in the context of an economic downturn there are typically few worries about higher interest rates first faster inflation may in fact be desirable to some degree since it makes it easier for people and businesses for example to pay back their debt it also makes it easier for the fed to use its traditional tools of monetary policy to bring the economy to full employment as a result it is unlikely that the fed will counter with higher interest rates a recession after all goes along with slowing inflation and the possibility of deflation declining prices if the recession is severe enough monetary policymakers and economists worry about slowing inflation and deflation for several reasons for one less inflation and deflation make debt more expensive and hold back businesses and individuals from making major purchases businesses and households may also hold off spending their money in the present in the expectation that things will be substantially cheaper in the future reducing the chance of deflation by returning to more normal levels of inflation is thus desirable and the fed will not respond by raising interest rates second a recession means that private market activity is slowing possibly declining businesses will borrow less as a result leaving more money to be lent to the government in other words the rising demand for government debt offsets the falling demand for private sector debt in the middle of a recession all of this was precisely what occurred at an extreme level during the great recession leading to the extraordinarily low interest rates that followed the economic evidence indeed finds no link among cyclical deficits inflation and higher interest rates instead countercyclical budget balances tend to be associated with shallower recessions and faster economic recoveries for instance bill dupor and his co authors find that arra successfully boosted consumer spending but had no significant inflationary impact 19 even outside such extreme events such as a financial crisis coupled with a severe recession temporary cyclical deficits do not contribute to higher interest rates 20 the bottom line is that wider cyclical deficits can have some positive effects on both short term and long term economic growth structural deficits and long term growth structural deficits by definition follow from policy decisions to either reduce taxes below the level necessary to fund existing and promised spending or to increase spending beyond the level of current and expected revenues many though not all structural deficits result from policies intended to promote faster long term growth 21 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 is the most recent example of using tax cuts to incentivize more investment that could result in faster growth the underlying argument of this policy change is that reducing marginal tax rates on corporations and high income earners would supposedly lower the cost of capital for firms 22 the lower cost of capital the argument goes would then translate into faster investment growth and ultimately result in more growth the evidence for both the united states and other countries however suggests that supply side tax cuts have a very small if any positive effect on long term growth 23 the reason for the lack of such a positive correlation between lower costs of capital and more economic activity should not be surprising businesses invest their money for a number of reasons these include the expectation of more customers in existing or new markets the quality of the infrastructure where they plan to invest and the skill levels of potential new employees among others 24 taxes play at best a small role in affecting investments lower taxes for high income individuals could lower the cost of capital because people save more money and give it to businesses but this matters only for more investments if businesses have a hard time finding adequate financing for their projects to begin with this does not seem to be the case as corporations hold a lot of liquidity interest rates are low and lending standards by banks for business lending have eased in recent years in addition lower corporate taxes could theoretically make it more attractive for businesses to invest as they can more quickly recover their investments 25 but effective corporate tax rates in the united states have been on a decline for some time due to special tax breaks as a result lowering corporate tax rates would have a very small effect on investment and economic growth moreover the boom in stock buybacks and the run up in corporate debt instead of using corporate resources for real investments highlight how business behavior is being corrupted by other forces including corporate short termism or insufficient competition lower taxes and supply side policies are ineffective at best and adding fuel to the fire of corporate misspending in all likelihood 26 alternatively structural deficits could emerge because governments increase spending additional spending could go toward new infrastructure measures higher education and larger social programs all three measures could in theory result in faster long term growth infrastructure measures include better roads fewer bottlenecks at harbors and airports faster broadband service and improved transit options among a range of other capital investments such investments can immediately reduce the costs of operation for business as it is easier to transport goods across the economy employees will also spend less time commuting due to this improved infrastructure resulting in increased productivity finally a better infrastructure can make it easier for people to innovate for example because they can more quickly communicate and collaborate with each other both lower business costs and more innovation make companies more productive they can produce more with the same amount of inputs boosting economic growth the economic evidence shows that more infrastructure spending higher quality education and more access to education systematically result in faster growth alicia munnell an economist at boston college for instance finds in an older paper that a 1 percent increase in total nonmilitary public capital core infrastructure such as roads and bridges hospitals schools and other buildings and conservation and development efforts boosts labor productivity by 0 31 percent 27 marianne baxter and robert king both professors of economics at boston university also using u s data find that permanent increases in government spending can lead to output multipliers exceeding 100 percent in both the short and long run 28 in other words a dollar spent by the government increases output by more than a dollar using data for 17 oecd countries abdul abiad an economist at the international monetary fund imf and his co authors also find that both in the short term and in the long term increasing public investment raises output crowds in private investment possibly because the public undertakes the riskier longer term ventures and reduces risks for private firms and decreases unemployment 29 similarly the imf in a review of the existing literature finds that public investment raises productive capacity 30 spending on all forms of education gives more people access to education and improves its quality more people gain skills crucial to compete in an innovative economy they become better at problem solving for example and boost productivity growth as they become more efficient in doing their jobs the existing evidence suggests that government spending on education indeed increases economic growth 31 in addition more education can help reduce income inequality by providing long term impacts on opportunities for employment 32 less income inequality boosts economic demand as it shifts money away from rich households who save instead of spend allowing companies to more easily sell their products it also means that households take on less debt which stabilizes economies and less inequality increases savings so that people are better prepared for the future they can more easily switch jobs when new and better suited opportunities emerge more easily start a business and better support their children s education all mechanisms that help boost long term growth while increased education is important for reducing income inequality in the long run additional social program spending can cover immediate needs effective measures include expanded unemployment insurance social security and health insurance programs increasing social security checks for example more or less immediately reduces after tax inequality jonathan fisher research scholar at stanford university and his co authors david johnson timothy smeeding and jeffrey thompson show that social security and unemployment insurance benefits were effective income buffers during the great recession 33 this suggests that social insurance benefits quickly and positively affected income inequality in comparison more education spending will take some time to lower income inequality although it will have a more persistent effect by for instance increasing income mobility miles corak professor of economics at the graduate center of the city university of new york in reviewing the existing evidence argues that more investments in human capital typically through formal education can translate into less inequality and more mobility in the united states over time 34 investments in children go beyond formal education spending helping families get out of poverty through the earned income tax credit for example increases economic upward mobility for their children in the future 35 medicaid can result in both better health and economic outcomes as young adults 36 public spending can thus reduce future inequality through a number of mechanisms not just more education spending in addition other recent research on the importance of reducing excessive inequality in the united states and other developed economies shows that public spending could contribute to faster economic growth over time 37 key pathways from less inequality to faster growth include more widespread and better educational outcomes stronger demand 38 and less debt and more savings 39 among others the bottom line is that structural deficits effect on long term economic growth depends on how and when the structural deficit comes about more progressive taxation for instance could strengthen economic growth mainly by reducing income inequality whereas supply side tax cuts have little to no impact a range of spending initiatives such as more infrastructure education and social spending could boost long term economic growth these measures are especially effective when the economy still has some slack it operates below its potential as is currently the case with continued underemployment modest business investment and comparatively slow economic growth and very high income inequality results of structural deficits that could offset faster economic growth positive growth effects from structural deficits can and likely will be offset to some degree by higher interest rates depending on monetary policymakers tolerance for wage growth or lack thereof higher interest rates could come about as the fed tightens monetary policy in response to faster inflation following increased demand there is also a chance of government borrowing partially crowding out private debt as total demand for debt increases pushing interest rates higher however there are instances where policymakers demonstrated preferences for or at least tolerance of widespread wage growth have through maintaining lower interest rates in the face of modest inflation boosted middle class income 40 there is ample evidence indicating that structural deficits result in higher real interest rates over time the empirical evidence though differs on the size of this effect table a 1 in the appendix summarizes the findings of several key studies as well as the underlying data and methodology at the low end of the estimates eric engen economist with the federal reserve board and glenn hubbard dean of the columbia university graduate school of business find that long term interest rates increase by 3 basis points or 0 03 percentage points if the debt to gdp ratio goes up by 1 percentage point 41 in comparison william gale economist at the brookings institution and peter orszag former director of the office of management and budget find that an additional percentage point in deficits relative to gdp which is close to a 1 percentage point increase in the debt to gdp ratio raises long term rates between 40 basis points and 70 points if higher deficits reflect a sustained increase and not just a temporary change in deficits 42 thomas laubach an economist at goethe university in frankfurt germany estimates that a 1 percentage point increase in the deficit relative to gdp as projected by the congressional budget office cbo will raise interest rates by 25 basis points 43 whether these findings hold in the current environment is another question as many of these studies were conducted before the great recession after all the united states has maintained very low interest rates even as structural deficits increased that is the effect of structural deficits on interest rates appears to be relatively small small increases in interest rates will have little offsetting effect on economic growth 44 the main issue then is whether structural deficits will boost economic growth and by how much overall well designed spending plans such as infrastructure investments can have large multiplier effects 45 these would likely offset any effects of higher interest rates 46 especially in an environment characterized by both persistent underemployment and unemployment as well as low interest rates 47 the growth effects of such well designed spending measures will dwarf negative interest rate effects from more debt most relevant to this argument olivier blanchard senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics and former chief economist for the imf argued that interest rates typically remain below the economy s long term expansion path posing no challenge to rolling over public debt 48 in other words using structural deficits to finance faster growth poses no public finance burden again the main concern then is whether governments use their deficit spending most efficiently to boost economic growth in the fastest way possible based on the existing evidence it is important to note that the fact that interest rates rise amid larger deficits indicates that these policies also increase private spending or at least do not reduce it enough to offset more government spending 49 one alternative argument though not supported by empirical evidence suggests that individuals and businesses will not increase their spending in response to wider deficits since they know that they will have to pay higher taxes in the future they will then save more and spend less as deficits widen keeping interest rates steady the argument goes the fact that interest rates increase shows that wider deficits have a direct tax and governmental spending effect and indirectly have a positive impact on nongovernment spending especially by giving people higher incomes through more jobs and possibly higher wages 50 widening trade deficits could pose another offsetting outcome to the growth effects of structural deficits wider trade deficits can adversely affect economic growth to the extent that they reduce industrial capacity at the technological frontier which means that productivity growth ends up being lower because of the wider trade deficit 51 debt relative to the size of the economy could then grow faster than would be the case without this adverse effect trade deficits can also contribute to growing inequality as some workers lose out from competing with low cost imports while others are protected and possibly gain from more global trade as a result trade deficits could exacerbate the economic gulf between certain regions and further weaken economic growth some economists assert that budget deficits in fact contribute to wider trade deficits on the grounds that higher interest rates raise the value of the dollar by attracting more money from overseas into the united states thus making u s exports less competitive and imports relatively less expensive 52 this argument is known as the twin deficits as it links budget deficits to trade deficits 53 the united states has indeed simultaneously experienced budget and trade deficits but the twin deficits theory does not always appear to be borne out empirically when examined over time trade deficits have widened when budget deficits fell trade deficits have shrunk when budget deficits widened the link between budget deficits and trade deficits is broken because a wide variety of factors other than the u s government needing to borrow money determine trade deficits 54 these factors include domestic savings by individuals the availability of money around the world to be invested in the united states as a safe haven for such investments labor and environmental conditions in other countries and intellectual property protections among others these factors determine the trade and capital flows and thus the exchange rate which can weaken or strengthen the effects of budget deficits that is budget and trade deficits can simultaneously occur but they are not necessarily correlated reducing structural deficits the discussion of the possible growth and interest rate effects of structural deficits depends on the timing of the deficits generally policies will have more of a positive growth effect and result in smaller interest rate increases when the economy is still operating under capacity with high unemployment the closer the economy is to full employment the more likely it is that new deficits will boost inflation and depending on monetary policymakers tolerance for faster wage growth force faster actions by the fed to tighten monetary policy relatedly policymakers will need to think about finding some additional revenue in the future tax cuts do not pay for themselves in one rather optimistic estimate greg mankiw president george w bush s head of the council of economic advisers and matthew weinzierl estimate that tax cuts recoup only between 15 percent and 32 percent of their initial costs through faster growth 55 similarly estimates of the dynamic effects of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 show that on average faster growth will only cover less than 20 percent of the costs of the tax cuts 56 that is supply side tax cuts have little offsetting effects in terms of faster economic growth even when making overly optimistic assumptions about their positive impact other fiscal policy measures such as infrastructure spending and efforts to reduce income inequality and increase income mobility will likely have larger offsetting effects as all of the evidence on their economic impact reviewed in this report suggests but dynamic scoring rules that combine current expenditures such as lower taxes with future estimated benefits largely apply to mandatory spending and revenue these rules then create an inherent bias toward tax cuts relative to spending increases 57 mcgraw hill financial now s p global the progressive policy institute and the american action forum estimated an example an infrastructure spending increase of 100 billion could generate 62 billion to 165 5 billion in additional output over a 20 year window 58 the cbo and imf estimate infrastructure spending multipliers fall between 1 3 and 1 4 but research suggests that the macroeconomic environment could skew these numbers 59 however it is unclear on whether the resulting faster growth will be enough to maintain a stable debt to gdp ratio without more revenue congress then will need to consider ways to generate more revenue or reduce spending when long term growth has accelerated moreover a further challenge here is that congress cannot pre commit itself or future generations of politicians to raising taxes and cutting spending this is known as a time inconsistency problem 60 politicians today increase deficits to boost growth and promise future actions to lower deficits again but then have no incentive to follow through on that promise politicians in the future will find themselves tempted to doing nothing or worse cut taxes and increase spending when economic growth accelerates some economists argue that this temptation results in a lack of commitment to addressing deficits on the part of both parties 61 but there is also evidence that after accounting for the wars in iraq and afghanistan and a recession the structural deficit would have stabilized and been on a declining path had it not been for the tax cuts that were first passed under presidents george w bush and donald trump 62 on net structural deficits can positively contribute to long term growth under specific circumstances policies that increase infrastructure investments and education as well as those that lower income inequality can have positive effects on long term growth some factors such as higher interest rates will play a small offsetting role when the economy still faces underemployment other factors such as higher trade deficits will not slow economic growth when following wider deficits as the economy nears full employment congress will need to identify ways to raise more revenue or lower spending to avoid unsustainable debt levels
a delicate moment for the global economy three priority areas for action as prepared for delivery 1 introduction good morning i would like to thank my friend tom donohue and the center for capital markets competitiveness for inviting me to this important event when i walked into this magnificent hall this morning i was struck by the powerful image of the 12 flags these are the banners of 12 great explorers who opened new avenues for trade and planted the seeds of commercial and industrial growth in the new world that spirit is at the heart of the us chamber of commerce which has been working hard for more than a century to help foster the american dream the chamber and the imf have much in common they both take an international perspective they both advocate for greater collaboration between government and the private sector and above all they both are deeply committed to promoting growth jobs and opportunities for all so this is a most fitting venue to discuss how to make growth more sustainable and inclusive how to reduce trade tensions and how to strengthen confidence and trust in the economy and institutions these are also issues that finance ministers and central bank governors will discuss next week at the imf and world bank s spring meetings here in washington they will confront a changing economic landscape that places a premium on the right kind of policy action as president theodore roosevelt once put it there is every reason why we should face the future seriously neither hiding from ourselves the gravity of the problems nor fearing to approach these problems with the unbending unflinching purpose to solve them aright i would like to focus on how we can harness this unbending purpose for the benefit of all 2 the global economy a delicate moment let me begin with the global economic weather map a year ago i said the sun is shining fix the roof six months ago i pointed to clouds of risk on the horizon today the weather is increasingly unsettled what do i mean by that in january the imf projected global growth for 2019 and 2020 at around 3 ½ percent less than in the recent past but still reasonable it has since lost further momentum as you will see from our updated forecast next week only two years ago 75 percent of the global economy experienced an upswing for this year we expect 70 percent of the global economy to experience a slowdown in growth but to be clear we do not see a recession in the near term in fact we expect some pickup in growth in the second half of 2019 and into 2020 so you see what i mean by unsettled indeed the global economy is at a delicate moment global growth has been slowing largely because of rising trade tensions and financial tightening in the second half of 2018 at the same time global economic activity is set to benefit from the now more patient pace of monetary normalization by major central banks led by the us fed and from increased stimulus in china for example these policy responses have supported an easing of financial conditions and increased capital flows to emerging markets where currencies have strengthened relative to the us dollar but again to be clear the expected rebound in global growth later this year is precarious it is vulnerable to downside risks including country related uncertainties such as brexit and broader uncertainties such as high debt in some sectors and countries tensionsaround trade policy and a sense of uneasein financial markets for example should there be a sharper than expected tightening of financial conditions it could create serious challenges for many governments and companies in terms of refinancing and debt service which could amplify exchange rate movements and financial market corrections 3 three areas of policy action so indeed this is a delicate moment that requires us to handle with care this means that we must not only avoid policy missteps but also be sure to take the right policy steps i see three mutually reinforcing areas of action in domestic policies in cross border policies and in coordinated efforts to tackle the major global challenges we all face let me touch on each of these a domestic policies to build more resilient and inclusive economies first and foremost policies must provide conditions at home for people to succeed you might have heard me say we should fix the roof especially when it comes to structural reforms that can help boost productivity and long term growth there is no one size fits all of course policies should be customized to meet the needs of individual countries broadly speaking however macroeconomic policy should aim to secure growth and stability monetary policy should remain accommodative where inflation is below target and should anchor expectations exchange rate flexibility should be used as needed to help absorb shocks and the financial sector should be strengthened and risks reduced by maintaining the impetus of regulatory reform the reality is that many economies are not resilient enough high public debt and low interest rates have left limited room to act when the next downturn comes which inevitably it will for many countries this implies making smarter use of fiscal policy which in turn means striking the right balance between growth debt sustainability and social objectives as a former finance minister i know that this is not so easily done it involves building fiscal buffers in good times while creating enough fiscal space to act in bad times it involves the continual hard work of upgrading tax systems mobilizing domestic revenue prioritizing growth friendly expenditure and reducing public debt where needed it also involves addressing excessive inequality here fiscal policy can play a key role including through progressive tax measures that would need to be country specific and stronger safety nets that can help address dislocations caused by technological change and globalization above all fiscal policy can help create broader opportunities by providing access to quality education healthcare and infrastructure especially for those who have been left behind or left out in many countries this means paying special attention to young people and to women this kind of policy action can help build confidence and trust and overcome perceptions of an unfair sharing of economic benefits one area where these perceptions are growing is in the increasing concentration of market power by a few corporate giants new imf analysis shows that over the past two decades rising corporate market power in advanced economies had only a very small effect on investment output and the share of national income paid to workers but we also found that a small number of highly dynamic companies accounted for the highest price markups in other words there is a winner takes most dynamic at play especially pronounced in the digital economy i am not saying that we currently have a monopoly problem but i am saying that we should take appropriate measures so that it does not become a problem that means reducing barriers to entry for new firms and reforming competition frameworks to ensure a level playing field in all sectors whether traditional or high tech b cross border efforts to provide a more level playing field this brings me to my second priority area for action cross border policies here there are a wide range of economic issues to be addressed upgrading financial regulations improving debt transparency tackling illicit financial flows to name a few but when it comes to leveling the playing field across borders no issue looms larger than trade this is an area where the chamber and the imf share much common ground we know that for many decades trade integration has helped to increase prosperity reduce poverty spread new technologies and boost productivity for people all over the world it has reduced the cost of living and created millions of new jobs with higher wages at the same time we know that not everyone has benefitted that there are distortions in the trade system and that it needs to be reformed we also know that trade barriers are not the answer more new research from the imf about to be released shows just how important it is to avoid policy missteps in this sphere analyzing experience from 180 countries over the past six decades we have found that trade integration clearly boosts investment in plant machinery and many other high job creating areas conversely trade barriers clearly damage investment and employment this finding is of particular relevance now at a time when trade tensions could further damage investment and at a time when investment is already weak so again it is a delicate moment and we should be careful specifically we have looked at what might happen if tariffs on all goods traded between the us and china went up by 25 percentage points that alone would reduce annual gdp by up to 0 6 percent in the us and by up to 1 5 percent in china these are potentially self inflicted wounds that should be avoided and yet discussions about trade distortions or unfair practices are often bound up with the concept of bilateral trade deficits and surpluses and tariffs the fact is that historically bilateral trade balances have been driven mostly by macroeconomic factors not bilateral tariffs in other words the most effective way to reduce a bilateral trade deficit is to steer clear of tariffs because tariffs on the goods of one country only divert trade flows to other countries nobody wins a trade war you might have heard me say that as well that is why we need to work together to reduce trade barriers and modernize the global trade system so that we all win that means addressing issues such as state subsidies intellectual property and data privacy it also means new deals to unlock the full potential of tradeable services and digital commerce and it means having rules based frameworks to ensure fair competition and a level playing field so as we move forward we need collective action to modernize the key functions of the world trade organization from negotiation to transparency to dispute resolution this will create a stronger and more flexible system of course leveling the playing field across borders is not only about trade in recent days as you may have seen the imf has also emphasized the need to improve the framework around international corporate taxation i have gone so far as to say the system is fundamentally out of date and i believe that we share the chamber s view that it is counterproductive for countries to take a unilateral approach we need a cross border effort reforming international corporate taxation is a challenge for all countries but developing economies rely especially on corporate tax revenues to fund essential investment in people and infrastructure our analysis shows that non oecd countries lose about 200 billion a year because companies are able to shift profits to low tax locations this foregone revenue makes it even more difficult for low income countries to increase growth employment and to meet the sustainable development goals by the agreed target date of 2030 the good news is that efforts to modernize the international corporate tax system are underway but there is a lot more to be done the imf has put forward some options on how to work together to make the system fairer and fit for the future i have so far talked about two priority areas for policy action domestic and across borders let me turn to my third and final priority area global challenges c partnership to address global challenges these are issues that no country can solve alone and the list is long demographics migration cyber risks and of course the existential threat of climate change on that issue i know that the chamber sees great potential in public private partnership as well as innovation and technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions we at the imf are also deeply engaged on this issue taking a macroeconomic perspective of course we have focused in particular on pricing carbon emissions and reducing energy subsidies which amount to about 5 2 trillion per year or 6 5 percent of global gdp both of these policy tools would go a long way to help mitigate the effects of climate change having just recently become a grand mother i must say that the challenge of making the planet a better place for our children and grand children has taken on a special resonance for me in my conversations with young people all over the world i have also learned that climate change is one of the two challenges that they see as of greatest importance to their future the other one is corruption this too is an area where the imf has stepped up its focus on the macroeconomic effects on our member nations the annual cost of bribery alone is over 1 5 trillion dollars roughly two percent of global gdp money laundering and the financing of terrorism are other serious dimensions of the problem where the imf has been working with over a hundred countries our latest research underlines the high fiscal cost of corruption leading to a massive loss in public revenue and lower quality public spending this new analysis confirms what we had all long suspected corruption lowers growth it increases inequality it feeds distrust is there any hope in combatting corruption we think there is and we do believe that the right policy responses can make a significant difference in a new study we estimate that within a group of similar economies less corruption is associated with higher tax revenues in fact a very significant difference of up to 4 percentage points of gdp between countries better governance is also associated with higher student test scores and more efficient spending on vital infrastructure from roads to schools to hospitals this highlights the potentially huge benefit of curbing corruption and not only fiscal benefit but also the potential benefit to society at large there is clearly an international dimension to this transparency international for example recently updated its corruption perceptions index where 100 means very clean by that measure two thirds of all countries score below 50 indicating that they have serious problems in preventing corruption certainly countries must accept responsibility for what happens within their own borders but corruption is an international plague to fight it effectively requires international cooperation 4 international policy cooperation and the imf i know that the chamber recognizes the value of cooperation ever since world war ii in country after country in crisis after crisis working together has served the world well the imf has often been at the center of those efforts during the global financial crisis the fund was able to commit over 500 billion to help prevent another great depression in the decade since we supported economic programs in over 90 countries and our work continues consider the fund s advice to countries to help them open up their markets and encourage investment or think about our recent support for critical country programs in egypt tunisia and jordan think about ukraine or argentina to do our job effectively of course we need to be sufficiently well resourced into the future for that we rely on the support of our 189 member countries this is another issue that i expect our ministers and governors will discuss at our spring meetings next week i am confident that the support from our membership remains strong conclusion to conclude i want to return to the inspirational nature of this magnificent building inscribed on the walls of the original chamber building was a quote from the great american statesman daniel webster he said let us develop the resources of our land call forth its powers build up its institutions promote all its great interests and see whether we also in our day and generation may

opinion 02 04 2019 listen dr masahiro matsumura the author in the turbulent world politics involving extensive international coverage stable and humdrum japan does not have much of a presence yet japan is the world s largest creditor nation while continuously playing significant roles in trade direct investment and economic assistance japan in the background has reinforced itself as a leading geo economic power while having almost thoroughly eliminated its huge non performing loans in the banking sector and other structural vulnerabilities over the so called lost two decades consequent on its bubble burst in the early 1990s let us examine it by deploying the famous 5 es of prof djawed sangdel emphasizing japan s world largest public debts that amount to nearly 240 of its gdp is misleading given that its public assets amount to nearly 200 and that the holding of the government bonds by the bank of japan practically a part of the government amount to more than 80 this is consistent with the good stability of a strong yen and very low long term prime rates on the other hand the u s faces deepening structural vulnerabilities in stocks that have resulted from the bankruptcy of lehman brothers in 2008 and the ensuing financial crisis while experiencing transitory booming inflows also the e u remains mired not only in serious structural vulnerabilities but also in a persistent recession consequently both the u s and the e u have a significantly less free hand in foreign economic policy while keeping themselves busy to obtain or retain comparative gains through their strategic interaction most notably in trade with the quantitative tightening of the u s the e u and finally the japanese central banks brics and other major developing economies encounter increasing difficulties in financing for investment and growth compounded by the shrinking of their u s and european export outlets particularly the chinese yuan is effectively pegged with the u s dollar while china s money supply in yuan is in fact based on its dollar reserves consequently china is sliding into a serious recession aggravated by the intense trade war with the u s no wonder that last october china made an abrupt about face on its persistent anti japan policy and concluded the currency swap agreement with japan that would surely furnish china with 3 trillion japanese yen or less than 270 billion u s dollars in the event of an acute liquidity crisis looking closely at the recent japan china interaction japan s quiet rise is more conspicuous for several years prior to the official reconciliation of october 2018 the two countries appeared to geo economically compete head to head centered on aid and development according to china s one belt one road strategy and japan s counter strategy or free and open indo pacific strategy china is undergoing serious setbacks because many recipient investee states have cancelled cut down or postponed china sponsored development projects these states have suffered china s debt trap and many of the projects have turned out to be financially environmentally and socially unsustainable china is increasingly constrained to finance development projects due to the hardly discernible yet significant dwindling of its dollar reserves that are statistically covered up by its foreign borrowings certainly china has succeeded in luring more than ninety developing and developed countries with its huge fabricated foreign reserves as show money to participate in the china led asian infrastructure investment bank but the country has failed to secure the aiib memberships of japan and the united states respectively the world s largest credit nation and the key currency nation with most developed financial and bonds markets without sufficient funds and staffs the aiib cannot but co finance projects with the world bank and the asian development bank to obtain a favorable credit rating necessary for financing through international financial markets in contrast japan has demanded china to observe international standards in aid and development and only agreed in october 2018 to selectively coordinate its policy with china only when the country meets these stringent conditions there has been no major successful coordination case between the two to date given that many of traditional japanese aid recipients are no longer low income countries the japanese approach will necessarily focus more on high quality aid and development in terms of sustainability through the public private sector cooperation the approach will be superior to china s at least over a medium to long run additionally japan plays a leading role to preserve the existing free and open international economic system against the tide of populism and protectionism most notably u s president donald trump s america first japan successfully led the formation of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership after the u s made an abrupt exit from an early tpp in the making and concluded the japan eu economic partnership agreement in nutshell japan s geo economic power and influence will be outstanding at least for a mid term yet the country is not free from serious risks and problems for a short term japan s rise will remain quiet and perhaps unnoticeable especially because its geo economic power and influence may be reduced by geopolitical risks and crises and because its vested bureaucratic interests hamper consolidation of its huge public debts and assets which involves the great risk of a liquidity crisis for the long term japan needs to find out a societal equation to cope with an unprecedented low birthrate and a high longevity rate the world must stay tuned on humdrum japan about the author dr masahiro matsumura is professor of international politics and national security faculty of law of the st andrew s university momoyama gakuin daigaku in osaka japan
overview after surging yesterday equities are struggling to maintain the momentum that carried that s p 500 to its best level since last october most asia pacific equity markets advanced japan s small losses were a notable exception the dow jones stoxx 600 has advanced in four of the last five sessions and is little changed while us shares are trading with a heavier bias yields edged up in asia but core yields in europe are a little lower and the us 10 year yield which jumped 10 basis points yesterday to 2 50 and re inverted the 3m 10 year curve that had many observers warning of a recession is consolidating now leaving it a couple basis points lower in the foreign exchange market the dollar is firmer against the majors with uncertainty over brexit as thick as ever sterling has joined the antipodean currencies as the worst performers while the yen and swiss franc are threatening to move higher note that yen and swiss franc enjoy among the highest correlations on a directional basis for the past 18 months asia pacific the australian dollar is a bit of a conundrum today the economic news seems supportive but the aussie has slipped to the lower end of its recent range 0 7060 the central bank s decision to leaves on hold was no surprise but the tone of the comments was more upbeat and did not sound like a central bank that was about to join the reserve bank in new zealand and signal an easing bias although it recognized that consumption has been impacted by weakness in disposable income due to house prices it noted that the strong labor market is underpinning wage growth this underscores the importance of the labor market in the reaction function of the rba and therefore the market will be particularly sensitive to employment and consumption data separately australia reported a monster jump in building approvals the median forecast in the bloomberg survey was for a loss of nearly 2 instead they surged 19 1 this was enough to slash the year over year decline from almost 29 to 12 5 separately though some may tie the rba s neutrality to it the government unveiled its pre election may budget it includes a 158 bln in tax cuts over the next ten years and a 100 bln increase in spending lastly the continued rally in iron ore prices new two year high may be helping to lift miner equity prices but it has not helped the australian dollar after reporting disappointing trade numbers yesterday south korea reported soft inflation data today the headline rate eased 0 2 in march the median forecast in the bloomberg survey expected a 0 2 gain the year over year rate eased to 0 4 from 0 5 it had been expected to rise to 0 7 the core rate eased to 0 9 which matches the cyclical low form last august it had been expected to be unchanged at 1 3 market moving news from japan and china were sparse we note that apple will reportedly cut iphone prices in china by 6 and foxconn indicated it may begin producing the iphone in india india is widely expected to cut interest rates on thursday it would be the second consecutive cut as the new central bank governor unwinds the two hikes that his predecessor delivered last year shades of draghi and trichet the dollar is in less than a 20 tick range against the japanese yen today trading mostly jpy111 30 jpy111 40 note that the downtrend line drawn off last month s highs is found today near jpy111 50 it may have to probe lower first before pushing closer to jpy112 00 where a 1 8 bln option expire tomorrow there are about 1 7bln in options struck between jpy111 05 and jpy111 20 that expire today the australian dollar is nearly 1 off yesterday s best levels it appears to have found support near 0 7065 there is an a 1 1 bln option expiring today at 0 7100 and another one for a 1 2 expires tomorrow lastly note that although mainland chinese bonds were including in the bloomberg barclay s benchmark the yield on china s 10 year bond rose from 3 05 at the end of last week to 3 15 today which is the highest since early march europe may was an accidental prime minister and many see her leadership as weak however her challenges are also formidable and the house of commons demonstrated yesterday the near impossibility of herding cats may s withdrawal bill may be detested it lost 3 votes and may yet lose a fourth but parliament itself cannot agree on an alternative much likely the debate about the affordable care act in the us four different alternatives were voted on and none received majority support the customs union was the closest it lost by three votes the tories themselves failed to support any measure no more than 37 conservatives supported any of the four measures may has called an extra long cabinet meeting today the risk of a national election appears to be growing as a way to break the logjam it would be the third election in four years cameron had led legislation to introduce a regular election schedule but like the idea that a referendum would unite the tory party this too is not working too well in practice while we have argued that article 50 was triggered prematurely and without giving much thought to its obligations under the good friday agreement others have argued that may s loss of a majority in the election she said she would not call in 2017 failed to lead to a change in strategy leading to the current mess while us and japanese trade talks are to being this month in the us europe and america s trade talks may take a little longer to formally begin reports suggest that it is macron who is balking it is not over agriculture which europe wants to exclude though reform of the common agriculture program cap would help eu free up funds that could be spent elsewhere and the us wants to include rather macron s objections are over the role of climate and environment a sore spot since the us withdrew from the paris accord the euro has been mostly confined to a 10 tick range on both sides of 1 12 where a 1 bln euro option expires today the 18 month low set in early march was a little above 1 1175 recall that it peaked near 1 1450 on the back of the dovish fomc it has fallen all but one day since it is spending more time below its previous 1 13 1 15 range it appears to be entering a new range we suspect the 1 1250 area may be the top end of the near term range sterling is trading inside yesterday s range and the price action is choppy there are around gbp1 5 in options struck between 1 3025 and 1 3055 that expire today on the topside yesterday s high was near 1 3150 and the 20 day moving average is almost 1 3165 america comments from bank of canada poloz yesterday did not seem like a central banker ready to adopt an easing bias while acknowledging that the economy still requires monetary stimulus which means not hike he saw the current slowdown as a temporary soft patch like australia canada also goes to the polls this year october and the government has already submitted its election budget with tax cuts and spending increases mexico s government cut its growth forecast this year s outlook was cut to 1 1 2 1 from 1 5 2 5 next year s forecasts were cut more now 1 4 2 4 from 2 1 3 1 the high frequency data points have been soft worker remittances in february were light by 100 mln vs expectations and the markit manufacturing pmi slipped below the 50 boom bust level in march to 49 8 from 52 6 the low q1 the us reports february durable goods orders today they were likely weighed down by a drop in aircraft orders excluding aircraft and defense a small gain is expected after a 0 8 gain in january however barring a significant disappointment the market and policymakers appear to be looking past q1 february retail sales reported yesterday were disappointing and although the upward revision in the january series offset the weakness in full it does appear that real consumption slowed considerably from the 2 5 pace in q4 18 the march ism is more promising broad gains were reported especially in employment biggest increase in four years and the strongest prices paid since september 2017 new orders increased for the third consecutive month construction spending rose 1 in february economists expected a small decline the january report was revised nearly doubling the initial estimate of 1 3 to 2 5 the us dollar is finding support against near cad1 3300 initial resistance is pegged near cad1 3340 all three drivers of the canadian dollar are supportive oil prices are firm with may wti near 62 a barrel note that 63 45 is a 61 8 retracement of the decline from q4 18 and our technical objective is near 67 the risk on mood is firm even if it is consolidating today the canadian discount to the us on two year money is the smallest in two months near 69 bp the dollar found support against the mexican peso a little below mxn19 15 we like the us dollar higher
this is ai generated summarization which may have errors for context always refer to the full article the world bank provided dictator ferdinand marcos a curtain of international legitimacy behind which he and his cronies plundered the public till in response to the efforts of marcos apologists to disseminate the image of the marcos dictatorship from 1972 to 1986 as a golden age many analysts have rightfully described it as more akin to a dark age what both sides often forget however is that marcos was not alone in creating what one side sees as an era of milk and honey and the other as years of infamy economic management during the marcos era was always a joint venture between the regime and the world bank this is of course a critical piece of history that the world bank which continues to have a strong institutional presence in the country would prefer to consign to oblivion but the fact is the bank provided marcos a curtain of international legitimacy behind which he and his cronies plundered the public till moreover the marriage of the bank s pro market policies and the regime s predatory practices gave birth to the worst of all possible worlds for filipinos looking back at the marcos era it is tempting to depict the marcos regime as a failed developmental state it was the promise of development that accounted for the way that marcos was able to initially assemble a coalition of left leaning people like blas ople military technocrats like alejandro melchor corporate managers like cesar virata and elite personalities like manda elizalde to support his thrust toward dictatorship in the early 1970 s revolution from the center marcos project building on his infrastructure building during his two terms as president was labeled as the revolution from the center that would break the democratic stalemate that had prevented development enthusiastically joining this ambitious project was the world bank then headed by robert mcnamara the former u s defense department chief who had managed the unsuccessful u s war in vietnam in the 1960s this program of conservative modernization or development from above was inspired by the apparent success of the brazilian military technocrat alliance in bringing about high growth rates in brazil in the late sixties and the concurrent push of the park chung hee regime to promote high speed growth in south korea by the early 70s these two experiences had created in political and economic development circles a zeitgeist of disillusionment with democracy as a development mechanism and a fascination with authoritarian approaches to modernization the appeal of marcos revolution from the center to western development specialists was its promise to weaken the power of land based elites that stood in the way of the capitalist modernization of the economy while stealing the thunder of left wing and nationalist forces advocating a more radical transformation of the economy it offered an opportunity to apply what had become the new silver bullet for breaking out of underdevelopment export oriented industrialization eoi which would open up limitless global markets that would substitute for the limited domestic market as an absorber of a country s products meanwhile stability in the countryside would be promoted by taiwan and korea style land reform that would create a conservative base of kulaks or small property owners that would serve as a barrier to peasant based insurgent movements in the division of labor to promote this scheme the world bank international private banks and foreign investors would supply the resources while marcos would provide the political will in terms of financing the venture the bank delivered with the philippines joining south korea brazil and indonesia all dictatorships at the top of the list of bank recipients the philippines was designated a country of concentration to which the flow of bank assistance would be higher than average for countries of similar size and income whereas prior to martial law between 1950 and 1972 the philippines received a meager 326 million in bank assistance between 1973 and 1981 more than 2 6 billion was funnelled into 61 projects if before martial law the philippines had ranked around thirtieth among recipients of bank loans in cumulative terms by 1980 it placed 8th among 113 developing countries seal of approval but the principal contribution of the bank was not financial though this was of course indispensable it was the provision of legitimacy the partnership with the bank provided marcos with a patina of moral approval that he exploited in drawing more financial resources from international banks and economic aid from western governments the private banks also delivered with debt owed to them rising from 27 3 of a total of 2 0 billion in total external debt in 1972 to 46 of 24 5 billion in 1983 the seal of approval given the regime by the world bank and the international monetary fund imf opened the coffers of a wide range of international banks as of 1985 the 4 commercial banks with the greatest exposure in the philippines were us based citibank 1 8 billion manufacturers hanover trust 489 million bank of america 487 million and chase manhattan bank 427 million behind them were bank of tokyo 404 million barclays bank 386 million bank of montreal 362 million banque nationale de paris 284 million credit lyonnais 267 million and morgan guaranty trust 252 million and fuji bank 251 million direct foreign investors seemed less sanguine from a superficial survey of the figures between 1973 and 1980 only 839 million entered the philippines a much smaller figure than the capital flowing to neighboring areas such as singapore hong kong or south korea moreover net inflow of foreign investment foreign investment inflow minus the outflow of investment income came to only 87 million between 1973 and 1979 this did not mean however foreigners were investing less indeed the bank asserted that in 1980 investment by foreign firms came to 500 per cent more than the annual average for the 1970s these new investments were financed mainly from local profits or borrowings from domestic capital sources thus while foreign capital inflow slowed to a trickle foreign corporations raised their cumulative borrowing from local sources from 1 9 billion in 1973 to about 3 billion in 1977 according to one estimate marcos expectations and performance what about marcos did he live up to the expectations of his patrons when it came to agrarian reform the creation of a kulak stratum that would defuse insurgency as in taiwan and south korea failed miserably announced with bombast at the beginning of martial law in 1972 the program gave birth to a mouse by the end of 1980 effective owners or those who received emancipation patents for their lands came to a meager 1700 tenants claiming to be a partisan of agrarian reform the world bank traced the failure of the program to what it called marcos lack of political will as the bank s agricultural loan officer put it land reform is not amenable to halfway measures either the landlord owns the land or the tiller does to make that radical change requires more commitment and energy than the marcos administration has yet been able to demonstrate when it came to export oriented growth the regime did set up export processing zones where foreign investors could exploit an unorganized cheap and largely female labor force and benefit from tax breaks however eoi was supposed to be accompanied by the dismantling of the protective tariffs and quotas that the bank saw as sheltering inefficient local industries from foreign competition reluctant to forfeit the political support of the owners of traditional industries marcos dragged his feet earning the ire of the bank marcos and those of his technocrats who believed in industrial policy were also unwilling to give up on their plan for import substitution in intermediate and capital goods industries unveiled in 1979 the so called 11 big industrial projects which included a copper smelter a petrochemical complex and an integrated steel project were conceived as the backbone of a modern industrial sector as it did in korea where it opposed the heavy and chemical industry hci program of the park regime the bank also strongly discouraged marcos from pursuing the heavy industry scheme on the ground that it would constitute an inefficient use of resources but unlike in korea where the park regime was able to hustle up internal resources to finance the hci program the world bank s disapproval effectively scuttled the philippine program by discouraging international private banks from providing external financing the failure to move against the tariff walls protecting philippine industry was not the biggest point of contention between marcos and the world bank this was reserved for marcos relationship with the powerful men of business who surrounded him who were deriving tremendous benefits from their closeness to him these people among them danding cojuangco herminio disini roberto benedicto and ricardo silverio were seen as derailing the program of foreign investment friendly capitalist modernization that the bank had in mind for the country not only were these people establishing new monopolies like cojuangco did over the whole coconut industry but a big part of the external borrowings of the government was being channeled to them and they in turn were recycling this to their private accounts abroad capital flight from the philippines exceeded that of brazil korea and even indonesia marcos and his family were of course the principal recyclers with estimates of their loot parked abroad ranging from 2 billion to 20 billion from developmental state to predatory state even as the regime s official rhetoric painted the regime as a developmental state the reality was that it was turning into what peter evans called the predatory state where as in mobutu s zaire the whole state apparatus was being turned into a mechanism for ruthlessly extracting resources by the president and his cronies without offering anything of value in return this could not go on indefinitely without endangering the rationale for pouring hundreds of millions of aid dollars into the country which were supposed to put it on the path of development moreover the gap between a favored few monopolizing resources and the many whose conditions of life was deteriorating threatened even more political instability the income of rice farmers declined by a whopping 53 between 1976 and 1979 while the wages of urban workers dived at roughly the same period by 50 per cent a poverty mission from the bank that visited the country in 1979 came to the disconcerting discovery that the real income of filipinos between the early sixties and 1975 had dropped in both urban and rural areas in all regions and practically all occupations it was at this point in the early 80s that the bank decided to take a more direct hand in the economic management of the country the time seemed auspicious since the cronies enterprises were suffering from mismanagement and the whiplash from the international recession wracking the world economy cabinet of technocrats one thrust of the takeover of economic policy was pushing marcos to accept a cabinet of technocrats headed by cesar virata a longtime bank ally while marcos acceded to this the cronies fought back and managed to get virata and the bank to agree to a bailout of their industries instead of allowing them to go bankrupt instead of decisively cutting off the cronies the bank focused its effort on tariff liberalization a move that hit a whole range of industrialists and entrepreneurs whose survival depended on tariffs and quotas on foreign products tariff liberalization was the centerpiece of a new type of world bank loan the structural adjustment loan that was directed not at supporting a discrete project but at reforming a whole sector of the economy in this case foreign trade on pain of incurring the wrath of the bank had it refused the marcos regime was one of only five governments that agreed to accept it in the early eighties the others being turkey kenya turkey and bolivia between 1981 and 1985 quantitative restrictions were removed on more than 900 items while the nominal average tariff protection was brought down from 43 per cent to 28 per cent leading to an inflow of foreign goods that led to numerous bankruptcies of local enterprises and a rise in unemployment other elements of the structural adjustment program were tight monetary and fiscal policies that practically tied the government s hands preventing it from taking a proactive stance in the economy fiscal and monetary intervention was critically important in the early eighties since already on the brink since the late seventies the philippines was pulled under by the deep global recession of that period partnership unravels it was during this economic crisis the most severe in the country s post war history that the marcos world bank alliance unraveled it was a downward spiral produced by the deadly brew of structural adjustment economic mismanagement predatory practices loss of political legitimacy on the part of the regime and an inhospitable international economic environment instead of allowing the government to promote countercyclical mechanisms to arrest the decline in private sector activity the structural adjustment framework intensified the downturn with its policy of high interest rates and tight government budgets not surprisingly the gross national product gnp shrank precipitously two years in a row contributing to the deepening of the political crisis that resulted in the ousting of ferdinand marcos in february 1986 between 1982 and 1985 the gross national product gnp plunged by 10 and gnp per capita by 15 inflation ran at 50 in 1984 and 23 in 1985 by the time marcos was overthrown the philippines foreign debt had risen from 5 billion in 1977 to 26 billion people living in poverty rose from 38 7 of the population in 1971 to 49 3 in 1985 the miserable economic performance during the whole period of the dictatorship was reflected in the fact that average annual gross domestic product gdp growth fell from 6 2 in 1962 1974 to 3 6 in 1974 1986 the policies of the marcos period left their mark on the edsa republic that succeeded marcos perhaps the key legacies were the servicing of the marcos debt and the institutionalization of structural adjustment following the good debtor policy forced on her by imf the world bank and foreign private creditors the corazon aquino administration committed itself to paying off the whole of the 26 billion that marcos regime had contracted a process that took the better part of the next two decades and involved devoting from 20 to 45 of the annual government budget of the succeeding administrations to debt service agreement to structural adjustment became the sine qua non of further loans from the bank and the imf and with this process came not just tariff liberalization and cutting back on spending but deregulation and privatization of public enterprises and public services like water and energy provision radical liberalization of tariffs especially during the ramos administration succeeded in killing off much of what remained of the philippine manufacturing sector and plunging agriculture into crisis paying off the marcos debt and structural adjustment had a depressive effect on philippine growth with the economy growing at a minuscule 1 5 per cent per annum between 1990 and 2010 the second lowest growth rate in southeast asia deadly legacy in sum philippine economic policy during the marcos period must be seen as the product of a partnership between the regime and the world bank the two had shared perspectives on the conservative direction of development but they had contradictions in other areas both embraced export led growth but they differed in other matters like the emphasis that should be put on agrarian reform and on ending the protectionist structure of philippine industry their most important point of divergence however was the role of the cronies whose close relationship to marcos prevented in the bank s view the necessary reforms because these would harm their interests the bank was also concerned with the fact that along with marcos they were taking a huge cut of the loans being contracted by the country and shipping this to foreign bank accounts in its later years the regime had degenerated into a purely predatory regime focused on extracting as much resources as possible from a collapsing economy the bank finally forced a world bank led cabinet on a reluctant president and the main task of this body became the imposition of structural adjustment the principal element of which was tariff liberalization which hit not so much the cronies but local industrialists dependent on a protected market as well as the workers of their establishments which were unable to withstand competition from foreign imports the partnership between the bank and marcos unraveled as the philippines entered its worst post world war ii economic crisis in 1983 86 which was brought about by a deadly mix of an international recession predatory practices on the part of marcos and his cronies and structural adjustment by the bank the legacy of the marcos period has been hard to shake off despite 5 7 growth rates over the last few years some 25 of the population lives below the poverty line probably the highest in southeast asia the country s gini coefficient the most reliable measure of inequality stands at a very high 50 at par with china s of course most of the blame for poor economic performance after 1986 lies with the administrations that came after marcos

commentary since the beginning of the sino u s trade war in march 2018 the chinese economy has been on the decline the chinese communist regime itself even admitted that difficulties are numerous with so called structural reforms unable to be initiated however by the end of the third quarter in 2018 china s foreign economic indicators began to show a prosperous trend the scale of foreign exchange reserves and foreign investment on average have maintained a slight growth and continue to trend up as a result during trade negotiations with the united states china s attitude has also become increasingly tough this state can be summarized with the chinese economy being hot on the outside and cold on the inside to analyze the impact this state has on future of the chinese economy one must first seek the underlying reasons to see whether such a fortuitous circumstance can cure the chinese economy growth of fx reserves and foreign investment brings the aid of three nobilities as of the end of january china s foreign exchange reserves stood at 3 09 trillion having re ascended for three consecutive months at this point china s financial regulatory agencies that have been staring unblinkingly at the gray rhinoceros that is foreign exchange fx reserves are finally able to take a breather another foreign economic indicator is foreign investment china s foreign investment administration within the ministry of commerce announced that the country s foreign investment in 2018 reached 135 0 billion a record high from january to february 2019 6 509 foreign invested enterprises were newly established nationwide the actual use of foreign capital was 21 7 billion an increase of 3 0 percent over the same period excluding banking security and insurance data affected by factors such as the sino u s trade war global cross border investment didn t perform well in 2018 according to a united nations conference on trade and development report total foreign direct investment in the first half of 2018 plummeted 41 percent over the same period and fell 69 percent for developed countries however in the second half of the year the chinese stock market which has made china s stockholders wealth evaporate several times has ushered in a spring of foreign investment according to statistics from financial services provider huixin total foreign funds entering china from hong kong and foreign countries in 2018 to purchase a shares were 294 2 billion yuan an increase of nearly 50 percent over the same period in the previous year according to central bank data net inflows of foreign capital in china s bond market in 2018 was about 100 billion accounting for 80 percent of the foreign capital inflows into emerging markets with the ongoing sino u s trade war and the weak growth of the chinese economy the continuous flow of foreign capital into the chinese market has brought great comfort to beijing which believes this to be proof that china s capital markets are receiving international recognition and the key to recognition lies in receiving rescue from the so called market nobility market nobility refers to two major stock market index companies in 2018 when china s economy was declining the world s largest index provider msci took the lead by announcing in may that china s a shares would officially be added into the msci emerging markets index the world s second largest index provider ftse russell announced in september that it officially included china s a shares in the ftse global equity index series in january 2019 the barclays global aggregate index announced the inclusion of chinese government bonds and policy bank bonds into its widely followed bond index with yuan denominated bonds set to become the fourth largest after the dollar euro and yen it s estimated that chinese bonds will be added into the barclays index and will lead to more than 700 billion inflows of foreign investment over the next five years these three institutions are endorsing china s stock and bond market with their own credibility making the chinese capital markets a must hold for global investors asset allocation american politics becomes the barometer of international economics international capital is optimistic about china this is entirely caused by the instability of domestic politics in the united states before the u s midterm elections in november 2018 the sino u s trade war caused the world to look down on the chinese market foreign capital withdrew or indicated that they were going to withdraw in succession and the global industrial chain reset had begun however after the midterm elections the democratic party gained a majority of seats in the house of representatives since then the democratic party instigated russia collusion as a threat to impeach the president and the prediction that trump could voluntarily resign from office in exchange for not being impeached became a theme of mainstream u s media and political commentary this type of u s political chaos has not only been a boon for china in the trade war but also international capital in 2018 among the major sources of investment in china south korea singapore the united states and the european union increased their investment in china by 36 percent 8 percent 44 percent and 39 percent respectively funds from the united states increased the most using the united states as an example in january 2018 the trump administration introduced a large tax reform a tax cut of up to 1 5 trillion this was expected to help boost corporate spending and increase employment at the time trump had predicted that companies would remit 4 trillion of overseas profits however due to the strengthening political opposition domestically only a total of 571 billion was remitted in the first three quarters and the trend is seen to be decreasing the intensification of political conflict has inevitably made u s capital take a wait and see approach to investing which has seriously weakened the impact this large scale fiscal stimulus could have on corporate investment according to a goldman sachs study in 2018 capital mostly flowed to the stock market and total repurchase of u s stocks exceeded 1 trillion in late january 2019 a quarterly business survey published by the national business economic association pointed out that although some companies reported that they had accelerated investment due to tax cuts 84 percent of respondents said that the tax reform had no impact on their recruitment or investment plans on march 24 the mueller report which cost taxpayers 25 2 million and summoned 2 800 people and 500 witnesses concluded that special counsel robert mueller s investigation didn t find conclusive evidence of collusion between donald trump and russia during the 2016 presidential election but the democratic party has indicated that it would continue to look for collusion clues therefore my view is that before the 2020 election results are announced u s capital will not return on a large scale since the democratic party s socialist campaign platform with the big welfare benefits it promises to voters could bring about high taxes and cast a shadow over the u s business community although business and high tech circles were strong supporters of hillary clinton they definitely are not fans of bernie sanders and others in the socialist camp they do not accept trump but they are more afraid of the increasingly socialist democratic party facing cold on the inside china has no plans to turn up the heat one can tell from reports on china by various western economic and financial media as well as the eu s attitude towards china that china s economic development prospects are still regarded as an important factor in the development of the global economy of course china also understands that the ultimate goal of the west is not to topple china but to force it to go on the right track of a market economy the u s business community s opposition of the u s trade war with china but firm support of trump in forcing china to change its structurally unfair trade behavior is evidence of this could china possibly satisfy the west s desires objectively speaking china wants to do this but it cannot this year at the two sessions political meetings the chinese communist regime also offered various solutions to help boost the economy the idea was to strategically increase local debts while ramping up three major stimuli reducing taxes promoting consumption and restarting infrastructural construction but the efficacy of these goals is somewhat contradictory taking tax cuts as an example the 2 trillion yuan in enacted tax cuts truly expressed the chinese regime s eagerness and sincerity in improving economic vitality but increased infrastructure investment means that government spending will also increase social security the military budget and other expenses have all put constraints on the chinese regime s finances in addition to the regulation that financial deficit be maintained at previous years levels there s almost no room in the budget for tax cuts promoting consumption will also be quite difficult the national development and reform commission and 10 other ministries and commissions jointly issued the implementation of optimizing supply to promote steady growth in consumption and promote the formation of a strong domestic market 2019 with the key of boosting rural consumption however china s wealth distribution is extremely unbalanced even with chinese leader xi jinping s approval a low income population accounting for 68 percent of the total population remains trapped by low disposable income and will be unable to expand consumption increasing infrastructure construction is a tactic that goes back ten years over the years the structural problems within china s economy have been market saturation and overcapacity the 4 trillion yuan spent in 2009 was mainly put into manufacturing infrastructure and real estate new excess capacity will be added which exacerbates the imbalance between supply and demand it will only make matters worse what can t be compared with ten years ago is that the besieged chinese economy back then relied on the real estate industry to rescue the chinese economy during this round of economic stimulus in 2019 the tired real estate industry is no longer able to pull up china s economy not to mention that china s per capita debt is about 170 000 yuan and most people have no money in their pockets looking at the history of modern economic development in the world no country whose economy was deeply entangled in structural problems has ever succeeded in being revitalized by solely relying on foreign capital what s more when foreign capital flocks into a country s stock and bond markets its purpose is not to help a country boost its economy but to follow speculative criteria to arbitrage the domestic political environment of the united states has decided that china still has a 20 month opportunity period during this period if china can t cure its inner cold disease with external heat it is bound to fall back into a siege he qinglian is a prominent chinese author and economist currently based in the united states she authored china s pitfalls which concerns corruption in china s economic reform of the 1990s and the fog of censorship media control in china which addresses the manipulation and restriction of the press she regularly writes on contemporary chinese social and economic issues
are emerging markets really worth the risk at a time when the us federal reserve has well and truly capitulated on its hiking path some emerging markets are not showing signs of relief against the dollar argentina s peso is close to an all time low the turkish lira is teetering near a year to date low and the south african rand is creeping back to december levels where would those currencies be in a world where the fed was still tightening dare i ask a higher interest rate in america is seen as detrimental to emerging markets as it leads to outflows in capital as bond investors look for higher yields in the us it also makes it harder for countries to pay off their dollar denominated debt a dovish fed may have taken the pressure off emerging markets but investors have now become more attuned to the mantra that not all of these economies are cut from the same cloth in fact the currencies that have suffered this year are not only the countries with high external dollar liabilities but also happen to be the ones facing the softest growth conditions argentina is in the depths of a recession it contracted 6 2 per cent in the last quarter of 2019 as president mauricio macri grapples with high levels of inflation and pressure from the international monetary fund to implement austerity measures all of this ahead of an election later in the year turkey is also in the midst of stagnation the economy contracted three per cent toward the end of 2018 inflation is just shy of 20 per cent and the lira depreciated 30 per cent in 2018 analysts have labelled the local elections this past weekend as a referendum on president recep tayyip erdogan s policies but one trader told me that more volatility is likely either way as locals continue to buy dollars and are worried about the growth outlook in a note last week robin brooks the chief economist at the institute of international finance said that markets would like to see a shift in the growth model away from a credit dependent model towards a more sustainable one according to brooks no one should assume that the trouble in turkey is an isolated event as investors become increasingly wary of financing countries that are too heavily indebted or dependent on credit the world was shaken up by a confluence of factors last year tightening financial conditions a slowing china a global trade shock and financial market instability with optimism about a china us trade deal the fed turning dovish and positive data out of china over the weekend one could say that the worst is behind us but what if the worst has merely been postponed as indebted countries have not used this time to repair their growth composition turkey is a good litmus test
recession signs everywhere this month the federal reserve joined its global peers by turning decisively dovish jerome powell and friends haven t just stopped tightening soon they will begin actively easing by reinvesting the fed s maturing mortgage bonds into treasury securities it s not exactly quantitative easing i ii and iii but it will have some of the same effects why are they doing this one theory which i admit possibly plausible was that powell simply caved to wall street pressure the rate hikes and qt were hitting asset prices and liquidity much to the detriment of bankers and others to whom the fed pays keen attention but that doesn t truly square with his 2018 speeches and actions the fed s march 20 announcement suggests more is happening i think two other factors are driving the fed s thinking one is increasing recognition of the same slowing global growth that made other central banks turn dovish in recent months the other is the fed s realization that its previous course risked inverting the yield curve which was violently turning against its fourth quarter expectations and possibly toward recession see chart below courtesy of wsj s daily shot that would not have looked good in the history books hence the backtracking on the second point too late the yield curve inverted and recession forecasts became suddenly de rigueur among the same financial punditry that was wildly bullish just weeks ago my own position has been consistent recession is approaching but not just yet yet like the fed i am data dependent and the latest data are not encouraging today we ll examine this and consider what may have changed cracks appearing let s start with a step back the global economy clearly hasn t recovered from the last recession like it did in previous cycles yes the stock market performed well so has real estate we ve seen some economic growth which in a few places you might even call a boom but for the most part it s been pretty mild unemployment is low but wage growth has been sluggish at best rising asset prices fueled by almost a decade of easy monetary policy also contributed to wealth and income inequality which fueled populist and now semi socialist movements around the world this slow recovery began fading in the last few quarters the first cracks appeared overseas leaving the us as an island of stability not coincidentally we also had slightly positive interest rates and thus attracted capital from elsewhere this let our growth continue longer but now signs of weakness are mounting here too recall this follows years of astonishing amazing unprecedented and astronomically huge monetary stimulus by the federal reserve bank of japan european central bank and others in various and sundry ways they opened the spigots and left them running full speed for almost a decade and all it produced was the above mentioned weak recovery chart below from my friend jim bianco again via the daily shot that alone should tell you that putting your faith in central bankers is probably a mistake we can t know how much worse the last decade would have been without their help but does this feel like success yet here we are with millions still in the hole from the last recession and another one possibly looming we also can t rely on historical precedent to identify where when or why it will start but we can make some educated guesses first domino earlier i called the us an island of stability other such islands exist too and australia is high on the list the last down under recession was 27 yes 27 years ago in 1991 no other developed economy can say the same the long streak has a lot to do with being one of china s top raw material suppliers during that country s historic boom but australia has done other things right too alas all good things come to an end while not officially in recession yet australia s growth is slowing university of new south wales professor richard holden says it is in effective recession with per capita gdp having declined in both q3 and q4 of 2018 by the way italy is similarly in a technical recession expect more such euphemisms as governments try to avoid uttering the r word as often happens real estate is involved australia s housing boom bubble could unravel badly last week grant williams highlighted a video by economist john adams digital finance analytics founder martin north and irish financial adviser eddie hobbs who say australia s economy looks increasingly like ireland s just before the 2007 housing collapse the parallels are a bit spooky australia s household debt to gdp was 120 5 per cent as of september last year according to the bank for international settlements one of the highest in the world in 2007 ireland was sitting at around 100 per cent at the same time the rba puts australia s household debt to disposable income at 188 6 per cent ireland was 200 per cent in 2007 while the us was only 116 3 per cent at the start of 2008 rba figures also show more than two thirds of the country s net household wealth is invested in real estate in 2008 that figure was 83 per cent in ireland and 48 per cent in the us meanwhile 60 per cent of all lending by australian financial institutions is in the property sector in 2007 the international monetary fund gave the irish economy and banking system a clean bill of health and suggested that a soft landing was the most likely outcome last month the imf said australia s property market was heading for a soft landing house prices in sydney and melbourne have fallen nearly 14 per cent and 10 per cent from their respective peaks in july and november 2017 coinciding with sharp drop off in credit flowing into the housing sector both for owner occupiers and investors real estate is by nature credit driven few people pay cash for land homes or commercial properties so when credit dries up so does demand for those assets falling demand means lower prices which is bad when you are highly leveraged it gets worse from there as the banking system gets dragged into the fray losses can quickly spread as defaults affect lenders far from the source this is not only an australian problem similar slowdowns are unfolding in new zealand canada europe and china it s a global problem and one company reveals the impact constrained hiring shipping and transport stocks are kind of a canary in the coal mine because they are among the first to signal slowing growth last week fedex reported its international shipping revenue was down and cut its full year earnings guidance its cfo blamed the economy reported cnbc slowing international macroeconomic conditions and weaker global trade growth trends continue as seen in the year over year decline in our fedex express international revenue alan b graf jr fedex corp executive vice president and chief financial officer said in statement despite a strong u s economy fedex said its international business weakened during the second quarter especially in europe fedex express international was down due primarily to higher growth in lower yielding services and lower weights per shipment graf said to compensate for lower revenue graf said fedex began a voluntary employee buyout program and constrained hiring it is also limiting discretionary spending and is reviewing additional actions fedex shares have dropped roughly 27 percent in the past year lagging the xli industrial etf s 1 percent decline this little snippet overflows with implications let s unpack some of them revenue fell due to higher growth in lower yielding services so those who ship international packages have decided lower costs outweigh speed likewise lower weights per shipment signals they are shipping only what they must when they must fedex is responding with an employee buyout program and constrained hiring the company is overstaffed for its present requirements this might also reflect increased automation of work once done by humans in any case it won t help the employment stats in addition fedex is limiting discretionary spending i m not sure what that means every business always limits discretionary spending or it doesn t stay in business long if fedex is taking additional steps then whoever would have received that spending will also see lower revenues they might have to constrain hiring too obviously fedex is just one company although a large and critically positioned one but statements like this add up to recession if they grow more common and they are tariff trouble one reason fedex is in the vanguard is that it s uniquely exposed to world trade the growth of which is diminishing for multiple reasons part of it is technology the things we ship internationally are increasingly digital and they travel via wires and satellite links instead of ships and planes these sorts of goods aren t easily valued for inclusion in the trade stats energy is another factor between us shale production and renewable energy sources we don t import as much oil and gas from across the seas as we otherwise would that shows up in both trade and currency values the us dollar is stronger now in part because we send fewer dollars to opec note the massive and stealthy growth in lng liquified natural gas exports in the past few years think what this will look like in a few years with not one but four lng export terminals on the us coasts natural gas is also the basis for much of the chemical and fertilizer industry abundant us supplies and prices less than half the cost of russian gas in germany help many us industries compete those are just signs of normal progress and change the economy can adapt to them the greater threat is artificially constrained international trade which is what the trump administration s trade war is creating last year i explained how trade wars can spark recession and trade deficits are nothing to fear i won t repeat all that here but we have since seen several market swoons rallies as harsher trade restrictions looked more less likely whether you like it or not asset values depend on the relatively free flow of goods and services across international borders interfere with that and all kinds of assets become less valuable starting a trade war at the same time growth is slowing for other reasons is more than a little unwise agricultural tariffs have already ripped through us farm country to devastating effect leaving losses some farmers may never recover the president s tariff threats had other impact as well companies raced to import foreign supplied components and inventory before the tariffs took effect this jammed ports and highways last year not with new demand but future demand shifted forward in time this is important and i think we will see the impact soon if we are not already transport and logistics companies geared up for last year s surge expanding their facilities and hiring new workers importers built up inventory in an effort to avoid tariffs that were supposed to take effect in january the deadline was extended but the threat is still alive at some point all this has to stop carrying inventory is expensive and will eventually outweigh the benefit of avoiding tariffs then the boom will come to a screeching halt imports will fall as companies work down inventory all those jobs and construction projects will disappear that combined with the other cyclical factors and high debt loads everywhere could easily add up to a recession exactly when is hard to say recessions usually get pronounced in hindsight so there s some possibility we are in one right now but i still think we ll avoid it this year getting into this box took a long time and so will getting out of it regardless we ll have a recession at some point i think the next subprime crisis will be in corporate debt next week we ll look deeper into the timing question what the yield curve tells us and why the next decade will bring little or no economic growth i realize this is not a happy conclusion but i call them as i see them i ll leave you with one final but critically important thought prepare don t despair tough times are coming but we can handle them you have a chance to get ready i highly suggest you take it rip andrew marshall the last warrior andy marshall who for the last 50 years has often been called the most important strategic thinker you ve never heard of quietly passed away last tuesday at age 97 starting at the rand think tank in 1949 he was persuaded to move from california by henry kissinger who wanted his intellect at the white house national security council in 1973 secretary of defense james schlesinger with whom he worked at rand brought him over to the defense department to set up the enigmatically titled office of net assessment it was basically a think tank designed to analyze long term threats and problems and help shape military strategy to deal with them he was reappointed by every president and defense secretary until his retirement in 2014 at the age of 94 in the 1970s andy famously contradicted the cia and the foreign policy establishment about the strength of russia s economy and predicted its collapse in the 1990s he quietly circulated his first memo saying china should become the main strategic focus of the us military like his russia analysis it was ignored at first called yoda within the military establishment andy s influence was enormous i first met him over 10 years ago as he hosted small gatherings of economists and strategists to talk about their views of the future i would find myself sitting at the table with names you would easily recognize but for some reason he kept asking me back he invited me to two of his famous week long sessions at the naval war college where he would mix an eclectic group of thinkers with high ranking military professionals to consider alternative futures he asked questions and then put us in a room for 12 hours a day plus long dinners afterward to discuss the opportunities and problems the scenarios might entail it was personally exhilarating and foundational for me at his retirement party a former vice president multiple defense secretaries abundant military brass and strategists gathered to honor this singular man s 40 years of continuous government service he spent 65 years focused on keeping our military prepared for the future i don t have enough room to properly pay tribute to one of the great futurists of our times andy brought the model of competitive thinking that he learned at the university of chicago to military strategy he basically invented the arena of inferential analysis just a few weeks ago andy again invited me to his apartment near the pentagon crammed full of books and journals to meet with other analysts andy was still mentally vigorous and primarily focused on china there in his room the net assessment of the potential problems with china were not sanguine i once asked andy why he kept inviting me back to his meetings and forums i truly had no idea every time i was in a room with him and the others he gathered i felt well out of my league he smiled and said because you don t think like other economists coming from andy that may be the finest and greatest compliment i have ever received andy marshall requiescat in pace starting sunday i will basically spend the night in each of the above cities before returning to puerto rico in cleveland we will check my eyes but i can tell you the surgery went very well i have some last minute meetings in chicago technically wisconsin then overnight in dallas before i fly to austin and then dallas for presentations i have been on the road too much this year but other than the sic in mid may my travel schedule looks rather tame for a few months we ll see have a great week think of a friend or two who you really need to connect with and then make it happen your thinking about possible futures and my own net assessment analyst
the euro could struggle to rally until a path towards emu deepening opens up says steen jakobsen chief economist and cio saxo bank the gulf between european valuations and their us counterparts remains high with europe trading at a massive discount part of this lies with the composition of business europe has less technology firms and more privately owned companies in fact the most truly successful companies in europe remain in private hands and for good reason as they refuse to cave to short term quarterly earnings report centred strategies the view from the outside is that europe is a perennial basket case this is an easy conclusion to reach if you don t understand europe s history its vested interests the peace dividend and the need for government to sell the naive illusion of fiscal self rule we firmly believe that any macro change has to come from a breakdown or a crisis and as such we see 2019 and 2020 as key years for europe s evolution we foresee populist parties getting 20 if not 25 of the popular vote in may s european parliament elections the most important factor though is the collapse of german growth we see a risk of recession there by q4 even without a trade spat with the us germany with its very successful industry 3 0 model is being left behind underinvestment in the technology sector leaves it unprepared as industry 4 0 rolls in and its internet speed ranking is just one of many symptoms germany needs to catch up in terms of digitalisation in terms of programmes for working women with new airports and more overall infrastructure spending the lapse of germany will reopen the franco german hotline as well as making the debt issue a pan european issue and not one of germany versus the piigs or austerity versus free spending investors long convinced by talk of basket cases would be unwise to count out europe it is after all perfectly positioned to benefit from automation ai digitalisation and a capital market that is cheap by any standard q2 will see the noise increase the basket case narrative will be spread far and wide and the eur led by the ecb will probably test 1 05 if not 1 03 versus the dollar the next 12 months however will be 2000 all over again against this uncertain backdrop saxo s main trading ideas and themes for q2 include equities the great divergence the depressing reality is that european companies have had negative real growth in operating earnings as the region lacks a strong technology sector that capitalises on the digital age peter garnry head of equity strategy said we remain defensive on equities until there is evidence of a turning point as contracting economies with below trend activity have historically delivered negative equity returns within europe this macro environment is typically bad for europe s cyclical equity markets such as germany italy the netherlands norway and france the equity markets that usually do relatively well in a poor economic environment are denmark spain sweden switzerland and the uk one of europe s biggest problems remains the banking sector the total return on europe s banking sector is zero since january 2003 in real terms it s 28 5 over a 15 year period this is an ugly parallel to japan s zombie banks after its meltdown in the 1990s europe has also agreed to implement costly banking regulations driving up costs on an already weak sector it has been 10 years since lehman brothers bankruptcy and europe s banking sector has still not healed this will continue to be an anchor constraining growth and equity returns the latest political attempt in germany to merge deutsche bank and commerzbank as a clear signal as to the current political system s ability to understand the nature of the problem banks are already too big and complex jeopardising the overall system and berlin wants to increasebanking sector concentration despite popular outcry a sensible approach would be to increase competition instead of limiting it fx europe has most to lose and most to gain europe is in a potential lose lose situation as we await the outcome of the us china trade negotiations the friendlier the deal the more likely that china could shift some of its import demand away from europe and towards the us with or without a friendly deal risks point to ongoing de globalization and a growth slowdown that would be double trouble for the european union the world s largest trade surplus economic bloc as europe stumbles towards recession later this year or early next year the old existential questions will inevitably rise once more to dog the eu political and financial landscape in short saxo believes that europe deserves a considerable portion of our attention as q2 will inevitably prove an important pivot point for the eu either we see escalating signs of further dysfunction or a more determined shift by eu governments to get ahead of the risks of rising populism and the unworkable fiscal european central bank foundation of the emu john hardy head of fx strategy said our least favourite currencies in a weakening global growth environment are the commodity dollar currencies where housing bubbles are in various stages of unwinding inevitably impacting the credit and therefore growth outlooks our longer term bullish call on commodities should eventually offset downside risks but these risks will prevail until central bank policy in these countries looks like it does for the rest of the dm i e more or less zirp and central bank balance sheet expansion to clean up the private credit mess growth risks remain a concern for emerging markets but we think china provides a backdrop of stability as it seeks to maintain a stable currency and attract capital inflows to deepen its capital markets and accommodate its transition to becoming a deficit country a key step in shifting the cny to an eventual reserve asset the jpy could do well during bouts of risk deleveraging this year but the japanese government is perhaps the most ready to switch on the fiscal stimulus with the bank of japan happy to cooperate as it seeks to avoid yen volatility commodities power ahead the commodity sector delivered a surprisingly strong return during the first quarter of 2019 with the bloomberg commodity index trading higher by 9 this remarkable development relates to the fact that the rise was led by growth dependent commodities such as energy 17 and industrial metals 12 5 markets including commodities began the year on the defensive with growth concerns and us federal reserve led liquidity tightening raising concerns about the prospects for 2019 the year however was only a few weeks old before global policy panic set in in early january the fed hit the pause button before abandoning it at the end of the quarter while calling a halt to further quantitative tightening the bank of japan and the european central bank followed suit with their own measures while in china the government stepped in with various initiatives to stabilise the economy as the chance of a trade deal between washington and beijing helped sentiment further ole hansen head of commodity strategy the dramatic recent turnaround at the fed is seen as bullish for gold as the return to a dovish stance highlights the risk of a gold supportive recession within the next 12 months the second quarter however may not yet provide the spark gold needs to break strong resistance between 1 360 oz and 1 380 oz into the second half however a formidable challenge could be seen amid support from a weaker dollar stable to lower bond yields and concerns about global stocks ability to forge higher amid raised growth concerns macro you can t fight gravity there has been a huge shift in the global macro backdrop over the last six months and it has huge structural significance for both asia and the world as a whole the crux of the matter is that central bankers led by the federal reserve and european central bank have unequivocally failed to attain escape velocity from quantitative easing the gravitational pull of addiction to lose money has led to pampered stock and bond markets as well as some remarkable events saxo believes that we shouldn t be surprised about escaping this qe world particularly given debt levels are now north of 250 trillion as compared to 175 trillion before the financial crisis the bank does feel though that the speed with which we have been pulled back in was surprising the implication is now that until a great debt reset read haircuts restructuring and a debt jubilee that could still be five to ten years away it s back to qe for life kay van petersen global macro strategist taking the world back to looser monetary policy and lower yields will be bullish for bonds and equities expect new cyclical lows in bond yields for example and as we have long mentioned australian 10 years are already taking out the 1 81 lows structurally speaking i also expect a much weaker usd over the course of the year the world needs a weaker usd to flourish and what the world needs it tends to eventually get it s also worth noting that while we are not far from all time highs in us equity indices we have already seen new all time highs in certain stocks shanghai at around 3 100 is still around 40 lower than its 2015 high of 5 180 we also have huge china equity inclusions in the msci em index coming that will take us from 5 to 20 in 5 increments slated for may august and november the bounce in chinese equities is likely telling us that for now at least we ve seen the worst in the underlying chinese economy and could be in for some positive surprises particularly in q2 19 growth data bonds why sovereign bonds are q2 s investor favourites the first quarter of 2019 saw a u turn in central bank policy with data pointing to a global slowdown policymakers do not wish to take chances saxo believes that is why we have seen the federal reserve stall its rate hike plans the european central bank commit to whatever support measures are needed and the people s bank of china push stimulus in the form of fiscal policy althea spinozzi bonds specialist added we believe that this global policy panic will play in favour of global sovereigns credit spreads will also be supported but investors should remember that dovish central bank policies may prolong the late cycle period they will not however be sufficient to entirely avoid the recession we believe is coming in q4 19 or early 2020 this means that while credit valuations will be supported for longer credit risk will remain very high in this context investors should stay cautious and avoid picking up unnecessary risk especially in the high yield and emerging market spaces the global policy panic sparked by the december selloffs has seen the fed turn away from quantitative tightening and its own rate hike schedule a dovish fed is good news for bond investors even amid muted economic growth treasuries will gain from the unconditional support even though if it is now clear that recession is coming macro a reality check for the euro area large declines in core european industrial production data can be observed especially in germany which accounts for one third of european industrial activity this slowdown came as a shock for many policymakers but saxo feels that it was predictable over recent quarters leading indicators notably credit impulse led us to warn clients and investors against the risk of lower growth in europe as economic data will continue to disappoint in the coming months saxo believes that a new consensus for looser fiscal policy will emerge in european countries in h2 19 an accumulation of negative german data could be the perfect trigger to set off expansionary fiscal policy in europe christopher dembik head of macroeconomic analysis said we see growing risks to growth in the periphery of the euro area and expect that germany will experience disappointing growth this year the outcome is likely to be more fiscal expansion after the eu parliamentary elections and further monetary stimulus in a tricky period for the ecb as it will be looking for its next president macro debt financed spending versus rising populism from trump and the china us trade war to brexit and the gilets jaunes the threats of this regime shift are evident the tectonic plates are shifting even if we are yet to feel the consequences of the extremist versions of these movements like a hard brexit after a 30 year spate of deregulation and laissez faire economics this new paradigm will create a different business and investment environment and the implications will be far reaching creating fresh headwinds and therefore risks eleanor creagh market strategist commented as the backlash intensifies so will the battleground making it increasingly difficult to price risk and determine the policy response against a complicated and polarising backdrop aside from reactive or palliative redistribution policies any response that will bring real improvement and tackle the misfortunes of those caught on the wrong side of globalisation seems a long way off the current new

growth slowed down since january but will rebound from late 2019 as central banks take a patient approach to monetary tightening and china boosts its economy the imf chief says the global economy is unlikely to fall into a recession this year despite slowing growthamid trade tensions and tighter financial conditions the international monetary fund imf managing director christine lagarde said central banks patient approach to monetary tightening and china s stimulus are expected to boost global economic output from late 2019 into next year after a disappointing first half of 2019 lagarde said in a speech ahead of the imf and the world bank s spring meetings next week in washington d c six months ago i pointed to clouds of risk on the horizon today the weather is increasingly unsettled lagarde said in remarks as prepared for delivery at the us chamber of commerce the imf in january projected global growth at around 3 5 for 2019 and 2020 a drop from 3 7 in 2018 and the previous 3 7 forecast for this year the economy has since lost further momentum as you will see from our updated forecast next week lagarde said the washington based institution will release its updated world economic outlook on april 9 the imf estimates that 70 of the global economy will suffer a slowdown this year compared to 75 experiencing an upswing only two years ago but to be clear we do not see a recession in the near term in fact we expect some pickup in growth in the second half of 2019 and into 2020 lagarde says global economic activity is set to benefit from the now more patient pace of monetary normalization by major central banks led by the us fed and from increased stimulus in china for example the imf chief explained as a result of these policy actions financial conditions have eased and capital flows to emerging markets increased she said china has announced plans to boost spending attract foreign investment and cut taxes to boost its slowing economy as it deals with trade negotiations with the united states downside risks for the global economy include uncertainty around the uk s withdrawal from the eu spillovers from high debt countries trade barriers and unease in financial markets such a delicate moment for the global economy demands right policy steps including an accommodative monetary policy where inflation is below target rate flexibility to absorb shocks and a stronger financial sector to reduce stability risks lagarde said the reality is that many economies are not resilient enough high public debt and low interest rates have left limited room to act when the next downturn comes which inevitably it will she said concentration of market power by a few large corporate groups is also a concern for the imf which estimates that higher markups have a very limited impact on investment output and labor income the highest price markups are in the hands of a few technology giants according to a new imf study although lagarde doesn t believe such dominance constitutes a monopoly problem she called for reducing barriers to entry for new firms and reforming competition rules the managing director called for removing distortions in the trade system including by modernizing the world trade organization and steering clear of trade tariffs the imf estimates that a 25 percentage point increase in tariffs on all goods traded between china and the us would reduceus annual gdp by 0 6 and china s economic output by 1 5 these are potentially self inflicted wounds that should be avoided lagarde said other topics on the agenda of global policymakers coming to washington d c next week include international corporate taxation climate change and corruption the annual cost of bribery alone is over 1 5 trillion approximately 2 of global gdp according to a new imf study within a group of similar economies less corruption drives tax revenues higher with a gap of up to 4 of gdp between countries
sky s ian king examines the pressures on turkey s fragile economy and says the market is currently only voting one way president erdogan has suffered setbacks in recent elections and may try to woo voters back rather than embark on a reform agenda turkey found itself the centre of attention in financial markets when last summer a diplomatic row with the united states spilled over into a full blown economic crisis president recep tayyip erdogan who had fostered a deterioration in sentiment by putting pressure on the turkish central bank not to raise interest rates retaliated after the us government imposed an asset freeze in august last year on two senior turkish officials due to their role in the detention of an american pastor within days donald trump had raised tariffs on turkish steel and aluminium exports the turkish lira was in free fall and the value of other turkish assets plunged sparking wider concerns in other emerging markets image a currency exchange in istanbul shows exchange rates as the plunge in the value of the lira gathered pace last year calm of a sort was restored in september when the turkish central bank shrugged aside pressure from mr erdogan and cranked up interest rates from 17 75 to 24 in an attempt to curb runaway inflation a visit to turkey in october from mike pompeo the us secretary of state also added to a sense that us turkish relations were back on track as did mr erdogan s co operation with the us in investigating the murder of jamal khashoggi the saudi arabian journalist image jamal khashoggi was murdered at the saudi consulate in istanbul the crash in the turkish lira also helped make the country s exports more competitive and between august and november last year turkey even ran a trade surplus that also helped restore confidence and even some bargain hunting among investors after a cataclysmic summer in which the turkish lira fell to nearly seven to the us dollar the lira had recovered to just over five to the us dollar by the end of january this year now though the worries are back and a number of factors have contributed to that firstly inflation has remained stubbornly high partly because the weaker lira has pushed up the cost of imported food while poor weather and flooding towards the end of last year and in january pushed up the price of fresh fruit and vegetables advertisement inflation stayed above 20 and in food was pushing 30 by january although the headline rate of inflation slipped back below 20 in february sentiment also took a knock when it was confirmed in early march that after the turkish economy contracted at an annual rate of 3 during the final three months of 2018 the previously fast growing country had entered a technical recession for the first time since 2008 09 image the weak turkish lira is beneficial for exporters and foreign tourists it was to this unpromising backdrop a recession rising unemployment stubbornly high inflation and business confidence plunging that mr erdogan entered a local election campaign that promised to be his toughest test at the polls since he first became prime minister in 2003 and president in 2014 on the campaign trail mr erdogan lashed out at what he called speculators accusing them of selling the lira this was followed by news last week that the authorities appeared to be trying to prevent further falls in the lira investors cracked down on short sellers investors selling lira they did not own in order to buy it back at a profit after it had fallen on foreign currency markets by stopping local banks from lending lira to foreign borrowers extraordinarily by wednesday last week the overnight swap rate in turkish lira a measure of how much it costs to borrow the currency had jumped 1 200 making it almost impossible for foreign speculators to bet against the currency but this only leached away at confidence and prompted a fall of more than 5 in the main turkish stock index the next day the cost of insuring against a default in turkish government debt also shot up and despite the restrictions the turkish lira continued to fall figures published towards the end of last week revealed that during march alone the turkish central bank had got through nearly a third of its foreign currency reserves trying to prop up the value of the lira ironically much of the more recent selling appears not to have been by speculators on the international currency markets but by ordinary turkish families seeking to protect the value of their savings by buying dollars and euros not that the heavy handedness of the authorities did mr erdogan any good his ruling ak party suffered a number of electoral setbacks including the capital ankara as well as istanbul controlled by parties linked to mr erdogan since he became the city s mayor 25 years ago the concern for investors now will be that mr erdogan engages in short term fixes in an attempt to rebuild his popularity rather than embark on the reforms needed to improve the turkish economy s competitiveness over the longer term government debt is relatively low but there are still high levels of debt in the private sector particularly among the banks with loans to foreign creditors of almost 180bn 137bn due for repayment this year economists have been downgrading their forecasts in anticipation of things getting worse before they get better goldman sachs which was previously forecasting that the turkish economy would contract by 2 5 this year warned on monday there was a risk that the deterioration turned out to be worse than that and ominously diplomatic relations with the us also appear to be under strain once again the us today halted delivery of equipment needed for the new f 35 stealth fighter jets turkey is buying from american defence giant lockheed martin the move is in response to mr erdogan s refusal to abandon an order for a russian built missile defence system that was enough to put the turkish lira on the skids again it has fallen by more than 2 against the us dollar today and has now fallen by 7 since last wednesday against the greenback the turkish central bank is expected to raise interest rates again later this month even that though is unlikely to do much to restore investor confidence in the country any time soon
uchenna uwaleke in its second bi monthly meeting held on march 25 and 26 this year the monetary policy committee of the central bank of nigeria delivered a pleasant surprise in the form of a minor cut to the monetary policy rate from 14 per cent to 13 5 per cent it was the first time the mpr would be tinkered with since july 2016 the mpc points to the relative stability in the key macroeconomic variables as well as the need to signal a new direction that is pro growth as justification for the 50 basis point reduction specifically the committee was emboldened by the continued moderation in inflationary pressure and the stability in the foreign exchange market although still in breach of the cbn s upper band target of 9 per cent headline inflation slowed to 11 31 per cent in february 2019 from a peak of 18 72 in january 2017 according to the national bureau of statistics on the external front the mpc equally found solace in the moderate improvement in crude oil prices and stable accretion to external reserves especially against the backdrop of current developments in the oil futures market which indicate that oil prices will remain considerably above the federal government s 2019 budget benchmark equally heartwarming for the monetary authority is the trend of declining long term yields in the united states of america in the wake of the federal reserve s shift to a more dovish stance and the likelihood that capital flows in the medium term may be redirected to frontier and emerging markets including nigeria without any doubt this move by the mpc bodes well for the nigerian economy which requires a great deal of real sector traction to achieve full recovery and inclusive growth typically as the mpr which is the rate at which banks borrow money from the cbn is reduced the banks in turn are expected to pass on the benefits to customers by reducing interest rates on loans admittedly a 50 basis point reduction may not be significant to translate to lower lending rates in the near term explaining in part why financial markets reaction to the surprise rate cut seemed subdued the equities market for instance closed in the red with the all share index shedding 0 67 per cent on wednesday being the first trading day following the announcement of the rate cut and only managed to eke out a gain of 0 01 per cent at the close of trading the following day nevertheless the mpc decision has opened the door which seemed shut for about 33 months to subsequent rate cuts in the medium term going forward against the backdrop of benign inflation an accommodative monetary policy will provide room for increased channeling of credit to the real sector thereby reducing the cost of funds for many small and medium enterprises the capital market stands to benefit from a low interest rate environment given that some of the increased liquidity will likely flow into the equities market it will also be positive for the government s fiscal position arising from cheaper bonds issuance considering that part of this year s budget deficit will be financed through borrowing from the domestic capital market it goes without saying that a dovish monetary policy stance is only enabled by low inflation and on this score the fiscal authorities equally have a role to play this is consistent with the fiscal theory of price level which postulates that the price level is primarily determined by government debt and fiscal policy with monetary policy playing an indirect role contrary to the monetarist view that considers money supply as the primary determinant of inflation the monthly consumer price index reports by the nbs which identify structural factors as the primary drivers of inflation in nigeria would appear to lend credence to this theory this fact is also acknowledged by the mpc which had noted in its latest communiqué that the upside risks to inflation are chiefly due to factors outside the ambit of monetary policy some of these factors highlighted by the committee include the high cost of energy infrastructure constraints insecurity in some parts of the country and anticipated increase in liquidity from the late implementation of the 2018 budget hence it is vital not to downplay the influence of fiscal policy on price level and within the framework of the ftpl harp on the need for greater fiscal monetary co ordination in order to tackle inflation and foster inclusive growth it is for this reason that the federal government is called upon to sustain its current effort aimed at stimulating output growth by executing the policies contained in the economic recovery and growth plan including through addressing the problem of weak power infrastructure as well as tackling the menace of smuggling and dumping of goods into the country in a bid to accelerate domestic production and create employment opportunities as noted by the mpc part of the complementary measures expected of the government also include the speedy passage of the other aspects of the petroleum industry bill to fast track the development of the value chain in the sector as well as the implementation of the new national minimum wage nonetheless it must be pointed out that if a new minimum wage can only be implemented by increasing taxes such as the value added tax then it simply amounts to digging a hole to fill a new one as the associated spike in the cost of goods and services will erode the purchasing power of any upward adjustment to the wage floor therefore any increase in vat can be productive only if it is part of a broad fiscal strategy of rebalancing the tax mix in favour of consumption tax which will entail also lowering the company income tax doing otherwise in an economy that is still grappling with double digit inflation weak growth and high unemployment rate will cause more distortions and jeopardize on going efforts at restoring sustainable economic growth the cbn projects the gross domestic product growth rate of 2 74 per cent for nigeria in 2019 higher than the 2 0 per cent and 2 2 per cent recent projections by the imf and the world bank respectively given that the economy expanded by 1 9 per cent in 2018 the cbn s optimistic projection can only materialise following the effective implementation of the capital component of the budget with emphasis on the employment elastic sectors of the economy regrettably the implementation of annual budgets particularly the capital aspect has over the years been challenged by the absence of timely passage as well as lack of matching funds while recurrent and statutory obligations like loan repayments always get fully implemented to this end no stone should be left unturned in getting the fiscal plan ready for implementation as the quick passage of the 2019 budget would reduce uncertainties in the business environment and boost investors confidence the cooperation of the national assembly is required regarding the speedy approval of any government borrowing programme linked to funding the capital component of the budget furthermore the finance ministry should ensure that funds are released on time and together with the ministry of budget and national planning put in place appropriate mechanisms for budget monitoring and evaluation as the mpc rightly noted the government can also help to reduce the non performing loans portfolio of the banking industry and stabilise the banking system by expediting action in settling all outstanding contractor related arrears now that the apex bank appears to have signaled its readiness to change the monetary policy stance from tightening to calibrated easing in support of output growth and employment generation it behoves the fiscal authorities to extend the much desired handshake through well targeted complementary measures copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other digital content on this website may not be reproduced published broadcast rewritten

key findings introduction although sometimes overlooked in discussions about corporate taxation capital cost recovery plays an important role in defining a business s tax base and can impact investment decisions with far reaching economic consequences when businesses are not allowed to fully deduct capital expenditures they spend less on capital which reduces worker productivity and wages since the 1980s statutory corporate income tax rates have declined significantly across the world and in oecd countries however the average treatment of capital allowances has become worse since then leading to broader tax bases that offset the benefits of lower statutory rates this broadening of tax bases is one of the reasons why tax revenues have been growing or stable around the world despite declining statutory rates currently businesses in the oecd are able to recover an average of 68 6 percent of the cost of capital investments covering buildings machinery and intangibles investments in machinery enjoy the best treatment with an oecd average of 84 3 percent followed by intangibles 76 6 percent and buildings 48 9 percent capital cost recovery varies greatly across oecd countries ranging from 100 percent in estonia and latvia to only 41 7 percent in chile and 56 6 percent in new zealand only few countries have made improvements in their treatment of capital since last year with the united kingdom s reintroduction of capital allowances for buildings and canada s adoption of expensing for machinery and accelerated cost recovery for buildings being the most remarkable ones the basics of depreciation schedules and capital allowances businesses determine their profits by subtracting costs such as wages raw materials and equipment from revenue however in most jurisdictions capital investments are not treated like other regular costs that can be subtracted from revenue in the year of acquisition instead depreciation schedules specify the life span of an asset and determine the number of years over which an asset must be written off by the end of the depreciation period the business would have deducted the initial dollar cost of the asset however in most cases depreciation schedules do not consider the time value of money a normal return plus inflation inflation is when the general price of goods and services increases across the economy reducing the purchasing power of a currency and the value of certain assets the same paycheck covers less goods services and bills it is sometimes referred to as a hidden tax as it leaves taxpayers less well off due to higher costs and bracket creep while increasing the government s spending power for instance assume a machine costs 1 000 and is subject to a life span of five years under straight line depreciation a business could deduct 200 every year for five years however due to the time value of money a deduction of 200 in later years is not as valuable in real terms if inflation is 2 5 percent and a required real return is 5 percent then at the end of the five year period the value of that deduction will be just 149 76 in today s terms in total the business will only be able to deduct 869 87 instead of the full 1 000 just 87 percent of the total this understates true business costs and inflates taxable profits which in turn increases the cost of capital investment the effect becomes exaggerated with longer depreciation schedules and higher inflation a higher cost of capital can lead to a decline in business investment and reductions in the productivity of capital and lower wages capital allowances are expressed as a percentage of the present value cost that businesses can write off over the life of an asset a 100 percent capital cost recovery rate represents a business s ability to deduct the full cost of the investment including a normal return plus inflation over its life e g through full immediate expensing or neutral cost recovery the lower the capital allowance the more a business s taxable income taxable income is the amount of income subject to tax after deductions and exemptions for both individuals and corporations taxable income differs from and is less than gross income is inflated and the more its tax bill is overstated making capital investment more expensive see the appendix for two examples of capital allowance calculations capital allowances in the oecd the treatment of capital allowances varies greatly across oecd countries while the lowest ranking country chile allows its businesses to recover only 41 7 percent of its capital investment this metric is 100 percent in the highest ranking countries estonia and latvia this wide range is largely due to nations vastly different corporate tax structures depreciation schemes and incentives designed to prioritize certain asset types over others table 1 net present value of capital allowances oecd 2019 country weighted average rank weighted average allowance machinery rank machinery buildings rank buildings intangibles rank intangibles note calculations assume a fixed inflation rate of 2 5 percent and fixed interest rate of 5 percent to calculate the present discounted values the

treatment with an oecd average allowance of 84 3 percent the united states and canada are currently above average at 100 percent due to temporary bonus depreciation bonus depreciation allows firms to deduct a larger portion of certain short lived investments in new or improved technology equipment or buildings in the first year allowing businesses to write off more investments partially alleviates a bias in the tax code and incentivizes companies to invest more which in the long run raises worker productivity boosts wages and creates more jobs s for investments in machinery estonia and latvia also have full cost recovery of machinery due to their cash flow tax systems the country with the worst tax treatment of machinery is chile with an allowance of only 63 3 percent followed by germany greece mexico and poland each at 73 8 percent investment in industrial buildings has relatively poor tax treatment in the oecd with an average allowance of only 48 9 percent estonia and latvia have the best treatment of industrial buildings at 100 percent each again due to their cash flow tax systems followed by lithuania 83 8 percent and slovakia 65 3 percent the countries with the worst capital allowances for industrial buildings are hungary japan and the united kingdom each at 27 9 percent the average capital allowance for intangibles is 76 6 percent in oecd countries estonia and latvia have the best treatment of intangible assets at 100 percent followed by lithuania 98 percent and italy 96 5 percent chile has the worst treatment of intangibles as it does not allow for any deductions followed by canada 49 percent australia 54 8 percent and ireland 54 8 percent estonia and latvia lead the oecd on tax treatment of capital assets estonia and latvia have both replaced their traditional corporate income tax systems with a cash flow tax model which allows for a capital cost recovery rate of 100 percent rather than requiring corporations to calculate their taxable income using complex rules and depreciation schedules every single year the estonian and latvian corporate income tax of 20 percent is levied only when a business distributes profits to shareholders this not only simplifies the calculation of taxable profit but it also allows for treatment of capital investment that is equivalent to full expensing since distributed profits are the tax base there is no need for depreciation schedules instead capital costs reduce profits in the year of investment this treatment of capital investment encourages businesses in estonia and latvia to use their profits to reinvest in their firms leading to new capital formation and increased economic growth uk system punishes investment in buildings the united kingdom is among the four oecd countries with the lowest recovery of capital investment costs in the uk investment costs of machinery are pooled together and depreciation schedules are set at an 18 percent reducing balance rate many businesses are also able to take a deduction of up to 200 000 266 667 each year for investment in plants and equipment this annual investment allowance was reduced from 500 000 666 667 at the end of 2015 the amortization of intangible assets such as patent rights trademarks and know how is deductible for tax a flat 4 deduction is granted if not amortized in the accounts however since july 2015 the amortization of goodwill and customer related intangibles is not tax deductible between 2012 and 2018 businesses in the uk were not allowed to depreciate nonresidential structures and buildings because capital allowances for this asset category had been set to zero only recently the government has adopted a capital allowance of 2 5 percent for nonresidential structures and buildings calculated on a straight line basis this new policy allows businesses to recover 27 9 percent of investment costs in structures and buildings which has significantly increased the uk weighted average of capital allowances of all three asset categories from 45 7 percent in 2018 to 57 2 percent in 2019 the reintroduction of capital allowances for buildings has substantially improved the treatment of investments in buildings in the uk however the uk is still among the three countries with the lowest depreciation rates for buildings in the oecd putting uk businesses at a disadvantage canada and the united states provide temporary expensing for equipment and machinery currently the united states tax code allows businesses to recover 67 7 percent of capital investment costs on average this is slightly below the oecd average of 68 6 percent the u s capital allowance for intangibles is 63 3 percent lower than the oecd average of 76 6 percent cost recovery of nonresidential structures is also low in the u s providing an allowance of only 35 percent over their rather long 39 year asset lives while the oecd average is 48 9 percent for machinery the u s currently has a 100 percent capital allowance due to temporary full expensing provided by the tax cut and jobs act tcja the oecd has an average of 84 3 percent for capital allowances for machinery notably the oecd highlighted the u s provision in its

off 15 percent of the cost in the first year up from 5 percent and first year write offs for investments in other nonresidential buildings have been increased from 3 percent to 9 percent improved capital cost recovery arrangements are particularly effective if they are implemented on a permanent basis tcja provides full expensing only through 2021 and phases it out over the 2022 to 2026 period

would be significantly higher if the changes were made permanent parts of both tax systems chile punishes investment with cost recovery provisions chilean businesses face the lowest capital allowances in the oecd averaging at 41 7 percent by asset category machinery has the highest cost recovery rate at 63 3 percent followed by buildings at 33 8 percent investment in intangible assets cannot be deducted at all making chile the only oecd country without capital allowances for intangibles these extremely low capital cost recovery rates make capital investment very costly in chile combined with a relatively high statutory corporate income tax rate of 25 percent chile s corporate tax code serves as a significant barrier to business investment impeding economic growth the czech and slovakian systems are unique among oecd countries while most oecd countries use depreciation schedules based on a straight line or declining balance method or a combination of both businesses in the czech republic and slovakia depreciate their capital investments with a unique method besides the straight line method taxpayers may elect to depreciate assets using a specific accelerated method under this method depreciation for the first year is calculated by dividing the cost of the asset by the number of years reflecting the useful life of an asset for subsequent years accelerated depreciation is calculated by multiplying the residual tax value of the asset by two and then dividing it by the remaining years of depreciation plus one year despite this comparably complex calculation of depreciation values slovakia ranks fourth 78 2 percent and the czech republic ninth 73 3 percent in our comparison of capital cost recovery in the oecd making them attractive places for business investment capital cost recovery in the oecd since 1983 the simple average of oecd capital allowances has decreased since 1983 with a slight increase over the last two years while oecd countries allowed their businesses to deduct approximately 72 5 percent of their capital investments in 1983 this number has decreased to 68 6 percent in 2019 weighted by gdp the average oecd capital allowance rate has also declined in the last four decades in 1983 the weighted average net present value of capital allowances was 72 2 percent since then this measure has declined to a current average of 65 4 percent as figure 1 shows the oecd average of capital cost recovery weighted by each country s gdp is consistently lower than the simple oecd average this is because smaller economies tend to have better treatment of capital allowances than larger economies this is also reflected in our ranking see table 1 estonia latvia lithuania slovakia and belgium all relatively small economies are the countries with the best treatment of capital assets in contrast chile new zealand japan the united kingdom and poland comparably larger economies have the lowest recovery rates figure 1 capital allowances and economic growth lower capital allowances lead to slower economic growth any cost recovery system that does not allow the full write off of an investment full expensing in the year the investment is made denies recovery of a part of that investment inflates the taxable income and increases the taxes paid by businesses lower capital allowances increase the cost of capital which leads to slower investment and a reduction of the capital stock reducing productivity employment and wages prior research has found that there is evidence that investment is sensitive to changes in the cost of capital kevin hassett and r glenn hubbard in a literature review found a consensus has emerged that investment demand is sensitive to taxation in other words as a result of either longer asset lives or a higher corporate income tax rate the demand for capital decreases and levels of investment decline reducing the growth in the capital stock a reduction in the capital stock leads to lower wages for workers and slower economic growth unequal capital allowances create a distortion among different investments in the economy it is also important to note that capital allowances can distort the relative prices of different investments and alter the mix of investment and capital in an economy a government could lengthen depreciation schedules and reduce capital allowances for machinery which would slow investment in machinery harming the manufacturing industry likewise if depreciation schedules are shortened or if businesses are allowed partial expensing of machinery this increase in the capital allowance may spur more machinery investment relative to other investment in the country in the case where a country is cutting its corporate tax rate while limiting capital allowances could shift the mix of business in the economy from more capital intensive businesses to sectors that rely on less capital investment this is the case of the uk which traded longer asset lives for a lower corporate tax rate and saw business investment suffer the differential treatment of capital intensive industry over other sectors will likely contribute to worsening of trends that have revealed significant difference in regional economic output in the uk tax changes in the united states have also changed the composition of investment in 2003 the united states passed the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 jgtrra part of this law allowed for partial expensing of certain capital equipment increasing capital allowances and reducing the cost of certain capital investments by as much as 15 percent research on this change found that investment increased the most for equipment with a longer recovery period and that bonus depreciation had a powerful effect on the composition of investment the best way to avoid such distortions is to grant equal treatment to all assets which is only accomplished through full expensing or neutral cost recovery corporate tax rates in the oecd corporate income tax rates more attention is generally paid to the corporate income tax rate rather than the income tax base a high corporate income tax rate reduces corporations after tax profits increases the cost of capital and slows the growth of the capital stock this leads to lower productivity lower wages and slower economic growth figure 2 stay informed on the tax policies impacting you subscribe to get insights from our trusted experts delivered straight to your inbox subscribe in the past 30 years countries throughout the oecd have repeatedly reduced their statutory corporate income tax rates pushing the average rate in oecd countries to approximately 24 percent the oecd average of corporate income tax rates weighted by each country s gdp has also decreased since the 1980s with a significant decline between 2017 and 2018 due to the cut in the u s corporate income tax from about 39 percent to 26 percent similar to capital allowances the oecd average of corporate income tax rates weighted by each country s gdp is consistently higher than the non weighted oecd average this implies that some smaller countries tend to not only have higher capital allowances but also lower corporate income tax rates making them more competitive than some larger economies cctb and capital cost allowances in eu countries in 2016 the european commission ec proposed several directives for reforming corporate taxation for european union eu member states one of these proposals is the common corporate tax base cctb the goal of the cctb directive is to unify definitions of the corporate tax base across the eu it is part of a general effort to shift some tax policy decisions in the eu to brussels rather than have them in individual national capitals eu member states each currently have veto power over many tax proposals from the ec and the cctb has not yet been adopted a recent compromise proposal for cctb was released in december 2018 and provides details for how the tax base would be defined among other things the compromise document provides information on capital cost allowances under this compromise proposal for cctb businesses would be able to deduct the cost of their assets over their defined useful lives on a straight line basis six specific asset categories and associated lives are defined in the proposal the present discounted value of the capital cost allowances can be estimated using similar methods as those used for individual countries on average across the three general asset categories of buildings machinery and intangibles the net present value of capital allowances under the cctb compromise is 67 3 percent this is approximately equal to cost allowances in the netherlands lower than in 14 of the current eu member states and higher than in 11 current eu member states including the uk figure 3 it is clear from this comparison that the cctb would be less pro growth than the tax bases of many eu countries especially some smaller eu member states although there are many other facets to the cctb debate it is important to note that the eu should pursue a tax base that is pro growth rather than one that penalizes business investment the following map also shows the extent to which businesses can deduct their capital investments varies greatly across european countries which is higher in many eu member states than the cctb proposal would put in place conclusion although it has been important to reduce the distortionary effects of corporate income taxes by lowering statutory rates around the world doing so without also considering capital allowances misses an important point of sound tax policy low capital cost allowances reduce incentives to invest leading to lower wages and slower economic growth besides pursuing policies of full expensing for capital investments it is also important to make capital allowance provisions permanent permanency implies certainty which is an essential factor especially for long term investment decisions so while the new temporary canadian and u s expensing and accelerated depreciation provisions are likely to spur economic growth in the short term their long term effects would be much higher if the changes were made permanent other individual countries and multinational organizations should also focus on promoting and adopting pro

also suppose the government allows investment in machinery to be deducted on a declining balance method of 20 percent for seven years this means the business can deduct 20 percent of the remaining cost of an investment each year for seven years in the initial year the business can deduct 20 percent 20 of the initial investment from taxable income that 20 is subtracted from the initial value of the machine the next year the machine has a remaining value of only 80 the initial 100 minus the 20 percent deduction in the initial year and once again 20 percent or 16 is deducted from taxable income and subtracted from the value of the machine in the next year another 20 percent is deducted from the remaining 64 value of the machine or 12 80 this method continues until the final year when the remaining 20 97 of the investment is deducted over time the present value of each year s write off declines due to the time value of money each subsequent year is reduced by the real discount rate

the green new deal can work here s how environment april 2 2019 jeremy brecher the green new deal gnd resolution recently submitted by rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny and sen ed markey d mass proposes a broad vision to transform the united states it calls for a mobilization to create a climate safe usa and thereby create millions of good high wage jobs virtually eliminate poverty provide unprecedented levels of prosperity and economic securing for all u s persons and counteract systemic injustices here s a strategy for how it can succeed mobilize government global warming has rightly been called history s greatest market failure correcting it cannot be left to the market the gnd will need bold economic planning industrial policies and public investment to guide and facilitate the process it will need full employment macroeconomic policies that prevent unemployment assure prosperity and encourage full use of economic resources during the transition and it will need public mobilization and redirection of human and material resources that are required for the transition therefore the gnd requires government institutions specifically designed to implement the transition to climate protection establish government agencies to oversee the transition mobilization for the gnd is an emergency that like mobilization for world war ii requires powerful governmental agencies dedicated to the purpose that can plan and implement the transition to a climate safe economy the green new deal agencies established by act of congress will raise capital implement labour force strategies organize funding for infrastructure such as transmission lines railways and pipelines fund research and development set and monitor energy efficiency standards for buildings appliances and equipment train and retrain workers and professionals set industrial location policies and coordinate the multifaceted activities of federal agencies state and municipal governments corporations and civil society organizations government initiative is necessary to cut through inertia bottlenecks and bureaucratic red tape use government to plan the transition climate protection requires the capacity to make long range plans that affect many aspects of life planning climate protection is in some ways similar to planning the nation s transportation system it requires making decisions such as whether to build highways or railways that will shape the life of the country for decades to come it requires the technical capacity to design and engineer such complex systems it requires taking into account a wide range of economic environmental and social factors and maximizing beneficial side effects while minimizing undesirable ones use regulatory powers to freeze phase out and replace all fossil fuel infrastructure in 1942 president franklin roosevelt banned the production of passenger cars to allow the reorganization of industry for war production the goals of the gnd require a similar though more gradual managed decline in fossil fuel production and use and its replacement by fossil free energy such a transition should be enforced by the regulatory powers of government state renewable portfolio standards rps provide an example a national rps should require replacement of fossil fuel energy by renewable energy at the annual rate necessary to meet gnd goals similar standards should be developed for conversion of transportation buildings industry and all other greenhouse gas ghg producing sectors establish green new deal agencies for reorganizing economic sectors a fossil free economy will require transformation not just of individual workplaces and companies nor just of the economy as a whole but of specific industries and economic sectors industry wide planning is necessary to capture synergies and economies of scale establish level playing fields and ensure that different parts of an emerging climate protection system work together large scale long term coordinations that cannot be provided by the market here public climate policies industry wide collective bargaining and cooperation among businesses in the same industry need to go hand in hand a prime example of such cooperation was the reconstruction of the u s auto industry under president obama s economic recovery plan auto corporations and the uaw agreed to a large long term increase in energy efficiency to cut carbon emissions this involved cooperative planning for retooling the industry large scale federal support for developing new technology and substantial public investment in modernizing the industry on a low carbon basis the result was a steady decrease in carbon pollution rates an increase of jobs for auto workers and an end to the crisis that threatened to nearly eliminate auto production in the united states similar sectoral programs are necessary for electricity transportation agriculture forestry manufacturing waste management finance and many other industries use the tools of macroeconomic policy the new deal used the tools of what came to be known as macroeconomic or keynesian economic policy to steer the economy as a whole to fight unemployment and support new deal programs it used fiscal policy such as budget deficits and monetary policy such as low interest rates while neoliberalism has condemned keynesian macroeconomic policies designed to provide full employment the abandonment of such steering led to the deepest economic crisis since the great depression and an ongoing aftermath of income polarization and impoverishment for working people the gnd should apply macroeconomic policies that ensure full employment to reduce the fear that climate protection may threaten prosperity and also to give working people a greater stake in the transition use the powers of government to rectify past and present injustices jobs protecting the climate will be made available to those individuals and groups who have been denied equal access to good jobs job recruitment should include strong racial gender age and locational affirmative action to counter our current employment inequalities programs will require standards for local hiring and minority business enterprises programs need to provide job ladders within and across employers lest those who currently face only dead end jobs continue to face only dead end jobs in the climate protection economy gnd projects will remedy the concentration of pollution in marginalized and low income communities and counter the deprivation of transportation education health and other facilities in poor neighborhoods protect low income energy consumers current fossil fuel energy costs are themselves a prime source of poverty and economic inequality the gnd should ensure that the energy bills of low income families are affordable generally defined as 6 per cent of gross household income the combination of investments in solar energy efficiency and weatherization will reduce the amount of assistance needed in many cases the bills will be below six per cent of income eliminating the need for assistance all new public and publicly subsidized low income housing should be net zero with solar panels onsite and or offsite empower community led initiatives today a large swath of community based local and regional programs are already engaged in promoting the transition to a climate safe economy and society even in a government led transition they can on their own initiative implement community based renewable energy production such as rooftop solar collectors energy use reduction measures such as residential weatherization financial mobilization through community investment funds and new patterns of consumption such as shared bicycles perhaps most important they can provide both popular participation in the transition to climate protection and a means to hold the institutions of transition accountable democratize democracy the green new deal agencies need to meet the highest level of transparency and be subject to internal inspectors general and the government accountability office and specialized equivalents an oversight agency independent of the executive branch should supervise the agencies and report to congress and the public on their progress identify problems and failures and initiate course corrections the gnd should establish standards for democratically determined climate action plans at every level similar to the environmental impact statements legally mandated by many environmental laws the gnd should encourage local community groups coalitions and governments to develop and implement their own climate action plans at the community level and require such plans for all projects it funds mobilize labour a green new deal mobilization will require millions of workers during world war ii the war labor board actively recruited workers to regions and industries where they were most needed and government took the leading role in the rapid expansion of education training child care and housing for the new workforce today a labour reserve of more than 20 million people who are unemployed underemployed or outside the labour force could be available to go to work protecting the climate the gnd will need to match these workers to the employment sectors where they are needed and match the jobs to the needs of the workers leave no worker behind while climate protection will produce far more jobs than it eliminates it may also threaten the jobs of some workers in fossil fuel producing and using industries it is unjust that any worker should suffer through no fault of their own because of a policy that is necessary to protect society a green new deal must create alternative jobs and or livelihoods or face mass unemployment and a resulting rebellion against climate protection generally jobs should be made available in the locations where workers are or want to be using their existing skills and providing comparable wages and conditions employers must retrain and find jobs for those affected give them priority for new jobs provide economic benefits that allow not only a decent livelihood but a start on a new life ensure decent retirement benefits for those who choose it and invest in local communities to provide them a future beyond fossil fuels all impacted workers and communities should be included in a deliberative process and have a voice in shaping transition plans protecting threatened workers and communities dependent on fossil fuel jobs needs to start before devastating economic disruption begins the green new deal will establish community and worker protection funds to collect money in advance to replace taxes and fees paid by fossil fuel facilities and to invest in good jobs in affected communities it will target investments in fossil fuel energy communities designed to create jobs before or at the pace that fossil fuel jobs are declining guarantee jobs for all to counter the insecurity of working class life in general and the specific fear that climate protection may lead to job loss climate protection policies need to incorporate the principle of a job for everyone who wants one where other policies have not led to full employment government should serve as the employer of last resort for all who want to work putting them to work on climate protection and other socially needed activities the federal jobs guarantee jg envisions a federal program somewhat like the new deal s works progress administration wpa that would provide funds for non profit organizations local governments and other agencies serving the public to employ anyone who wants a job at a wage roughly comparable to the demands of the fight for 15 campaign the jg will not exclude any individual or group of people who want to work it will make whatever special provisions are necessary to employ veterans at risk youth ex convicts people with disabilities and other people with special needs and or barriers to employment the jobs provided by this program will pay an estimated 15 per hour plus benefits including health insurance because it guarantees that every person who wishes to work can find a public option job with a wage twice the current federal minimum wage plus benefits the jg will establish a standard that must be met by all employers in the private public or nonprofit sectors ensuring that no working person will live in poverty it will provide education training and apprenticeship opportunities ensure worker rights and good union jobs the green new deal needs to include pay and benefit standards that provide a decent life and future for working families it needs to support high road employers prevailing wage provisions like those required by the davis bacon act and project labour agreements negotiated between unions and employers to ensure that climate protection jobs elevate rather than depress wages and working conditions the green new deal like the original new deal must establish a new framework that protects workers fundamental constitutional and human rights reinforcing the rights of workers to express themselves freely organize bargain collectively and engage in concerted action on the job should be an explicit part of gnd as it was for war industries during mobilization for world war ii mobilize money and material resources when people hear about the green new deal they are likely to wonder where will the money come from they understandably fear that the costs will be enormous and that they will have to bear that burden through higher taxes but this ignores the fact that a fossil free economy will be much cheaper than the current fossil fuel model it also fails to take into account the opportunity for correcting our extreme inequality by taxing the rich to help pay for climate protection it disregards the trillions of dollars that american banks corporations and investors have lying unused in their bank accounts much of it from government giveaways they have received as economic stimulus and it ignores the enormous resources of the fossil fuel industry that should be used to pay for the damage they have done to the earth and every one of its people the gnd will use the financial benefits of fossil free energy the trillions of dollars given away to corporations and the wealthy in tax breaks and subsidies and the wealth of the fossil fuel industry itself to ensure that ordinary americans are far better off as a result of the transition to climate safety capture the benefits of the transition to fossil free energy fossil free energy is now cost efficient it is cheaper and provides more benefits than burning fossil fuels in the long run climate protection will pay for itself large investments currently go to maintaining replacing and expanding fossil fuel infrastructure the gnd will redirect that investment stream to building a fossil free economy replacing lost energy jobs and other gnd programs likewise all the money that would have been spent on coal oil and gas can go into the pockets of consumers and help pay for the gnd make the polluters pay the fossil fuel industry can and should bear much of the burden for the damage it does to humanity and the planet through taxes fees permit costs and other charges which can be used to pay for the gnd tax policy can help discourage carbon emissions while reversing our growing income inequality progressive taxation particularly on carbon wasting luxury goods like private jets can counteract negative effects on income equality another potential source for funding the transition to climate safety can be legal damages and fines collected from corporations for environmentally harmful practices the gnd should include litigation and legislation to hold fossil fuel producers and emitters responsible for their colossal damage to the atmosphere and the colossal cost of remediating it cut wasteful and unnecessary spending the united states now spends as much on the military as the next seven highest spenders combined the use of this money aside from pure waste has been for a series of wars many of them illegal under national and international law none of which has been successful all of which have caused incalculable human and material harm and none of which has contributed to the security of the american people many of them have been motivated by the pursuit of fossil fuels and all have contributed to global warming confronting climate change will reduce conflict and promote global peace and security transfer of funds from the military budget to the gnd would enhance the security of individuals and our country mobilize investment public borrowing through bond sales can provide substantial and inexpensive funds due to the ability of the federal reserve to buy public infrastructure bonds at low rates public purpose banks credit unions and investment and loan funds can provide more decentralized financial resources especially for smaller scale and community based projects if need be the federal reserve can simply buy infrastructure bonds just as it did with treasury securities in 1940 to finance the war effort the gnd will establish a program of climate bonds for the public like the war bonds of world war ii these should be a good investment for individuals particularly as an alternative to today s gutted pension plans and unattractive retirement investments if we are to subsidize energy investment the benefits should go first and foremost not to the 1 but to ordinary citizens who can use them to increase their economic security and retirement savings global cooperation support and fund a global green new deal realizing the goals of the gnd requires global cooperation governments must work together to create a global framework that supports climate friendly jobs and development what has been called a global green new deal that requires the world to abandon neoliberalism and adopt a new strategy that puts the world s human resources to work meeting the world s desperate need for economic transformation that radically reduces ghg emissions a global climate protection investment fund is necessary on a scale that mobilizes all under utilized human and material resources worldwide rather than fighting each other for climate protecting jobs workers in different countries will benefit from national policies and international agreements that encourage countries to cooperate in sharing green technologies and expanding production for climate protection legally binding international agreements must phase out and ban the use of fossil fuels worldwide both climate protection and economic cooperation ultimately require demilitarization and policies of global common security globalization neoliberalism and free trade agreements have pitted the workers of the world against each other in a fight for climate protecting jobs a gnd will not pit workers against workers and discourage the growth of climate protecting industries and jobs abroad it will oppose both escalating trade wars and the free trade utopia of neoliberalism instead it will pursue mutually managed trade that encourages all countries to develop their climate protection industries and technologies as rapidly as possible while allowing the benefits to be shared in a way that protects workers in both developing countries and developed countries not to mention the planet as a whole conclusion the original new deal of the 1930s was not a single program or piece of legislation it was a whole era of turmoil in which contesting forces tried to meet a devastating crisis and shape the future of american society the new deal was part of a process of social change that included experimentation at a state regional and local level organization among labour unemployed rural urban elderly and other grassroots constituencies and lively debate on future alternatives that went far beyond the policies actually implemented in practice the gnd will similarly involve competing ideas and programs pushed in alliance and opposition by a wide range of constituencies and organizations that support the broad concept but disagree about details like the original new deal the gnd is trying to do something that has never been done before we will have to learn from experience and experiment and correct the mistakes we will inevitably make along the way but with these strategies we can make a start in the right direction this article first published on the common dreams website it is based on a discussion paper 18 strategies for a green new deal how to make the climate mobilization work from the labor network for sustainability
in american politics worries about the national debt are often closely followed by worries about the global reputation of the u s dollar that s because america s currency enjoys a unique role in the world virtually all international trade and financial settlements are done in contracts written in dollars this gives the u s some unique advantages but now democrats are talking about big policy ideas like a green new deal and medicare for all and about using deficits and borrowing to finance much of that agenda that s making some economists nervous that mounting debt could finally undo the dollar s global privileges how much more debt can you have on the u s balance sheet and not have global financial markets react i don t know the answer to that douglas holtz eakin a conservative economist and a former director of the congressional budget office told the wall street journal i see no reason to run the experiment when do we have a crisis let s just not but how would such a crisis unfold exactly and how much debt would it take subscribe to the week escape your echo chamber get the facts behind the news plus analysis from multiple perspectives subscribe save sign up for the week s free newsletters from our morning news briefing to a weekly good news newsletter get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox from our morning news briefing to a weekly good news newsletter get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox sign up let s start by looking at how things work for everyone else if you re not the u s and you want to trade with other countries you have to deal in dollars you get paid in dollars for your exports and you pay in dollars for imports in fact your exports are how you get the dollars to pay for your imports you can create as much of your own national currency as you want but you can t create more dollars you have to go get them somehow if an economic crisis wrecks your exports you can run out of dollars if you borrow dollars then you re saddled with debt in a currency you don t control if you run out of dollars you can t import more you default on your dollar denominated debt and your economy plunges into crisis that s what what happened in venezuela and turkey to take two recent examples thanks to the unique global role of the u s dollar america is free from this entire doom loop all the international trading we do is in dollars and we print all those dollars we ve run persistent trade deficits for a while now importing more than we export but we don t have to go out and get the currency to buy those imports from anywhere now what does our debt load have to do with all this if you need dollars for international trade but you can t create more of them you ll want a rainy day fund to protect yourself in a crisis as a result about two thirds of all foreign currency reserves around the globe are in u s dollars practically speaking the way countries get dollar reserves is by investing in dollar denominated financial assets mostly that means investing in u s treasury bonds and u s treasuries get created whenever america deficit spends and borrows the worry among economists like holtz eakin is that if the u s government issues enough treasuries it will completely saturate global demand at some point the theory goes the rest of the world will just say thanks we have enough treasuries and stop buying then it would fall to the federal reserve to soak up the excess supply the problem with that isn t that the debt could ever get too big any central bank can create limitless demand for the bonds the country s government issues in its own currency but if deficit spending is too big at the wrong time if it hits when the economy is already booming and near full capacity then the economy can t absorb the new spending without prices going up at that point higher interest rates are the only thing that will hold inflation in check but if the fed is buying up all those new treasuries then by definition it s keeping its interest rate target down a big bout of inflation in the u s dollar is ultimately what would destroy the currency s unique role in global trade if the inflation was bad enough and lasted long enough it would make it impractical for other foreign producers to keep doing international trades in dollars dollars w would be too cheap relative to other currencies and they d lose too much money eventually they d ditch the dollar for some other currency and then america would be in the same boat as the rest of the world but how likely are we to set off that kind of inflation crisis it s not just the timing of deficits that matters it s the nature of the deficits trump s tax cuts for instance created huge new deficits but haven t proven inflationary at all to overheat the economy your deficits have to create so much new consumer spending that the supply of workers and real resources can t keep up with aggregate demand trump s tax cuts just gave money away to rich people a green new deal and a job guarantee and medicare for all would certainly create way more demand than trump s tax cuts but even here the picture is complicated a job guarantee is designed to push the economy to full employment but not beyond a lot of medicare for all s spending wouldn t be inflationary because it simply replaces private sector spending and a green new deal is supposed to be a temporary policy that gets rid of demand for fossil fuels even as it ramps up demand for renewables in truth creating too much inflation by overheating your economy is just really hard to do the closest we came was probably world war ii when deficits hit 25 percent of gdp and the fed avoided interest rate hikes to support the war effort even then inflation didn t get much above 10 percent because the government managed prices in other ways these days the fed absolutely would raise interest rates if the democrats deficit spent on the new progressive agenda ten percent inflation for a while is probably close to a worst case scenario would that be enough to drive foreign exporters off the dollar ultimately there s no way to know holtz eakin is right insofar as there is a risk the question is whether it s riskier than a country without universal health care and a green economy
rio de janeiro the 1944 bretton woods conference established a multilateral framework for global cooperation on macroeconomic stability trade and development that has endured despite inevitable disruptions and adjustments for 75 years we should celebrate and praise these achievements and although this system of global economic governance is now under serious strain the bretton woods institutions together with more recently established international and regional forums will still have a meaningful long term role to play at the macro level bretton woods was based on fixed but adjustable exchange rates and relied on the newly created international monetary fund to monitor the consistency of national policies and provide financial support to countries facing external shocks the new world bank which began as the international bank for reconstruction and development provided support and advice on long term investment projects for development and reconstruction and another post war institution the general agreement on tariffs and trade expanded and re established as the world trade organisation wto in 1995 provided a framework for advancing free trade based on multilateral rules and dispute mechanisms this global arrangement allowed plenty of room for different national and regional approaches as long as policies did not lead to recurring balance of payments and inflation crises successful countries were able to accumulate more capital especially human and build institutions that made their gains more permanent in many ways the national strategies that paid off were convergence bets ones that aimed to narrow productivity gaps with more advanced economies alongside the economic advances many commentators saw clear signs of political convergence toward more liberal democratic regimes culminating in the fall of the berlin wall and the collapse of the soviet union the american political scientist francis fukuyama summarised this narrative with his famous end of history thesis over time the bretton woods regime faced numerous challenges and crises the move away from explicit exchange rate parities to a system of more flexible currencies in the early 1970s marked the end of the original post war monetary framework but formal and informal inflation targeting subsequently re anchored the system true many developing countries suffered far greater inflation and balance of payments problems than more mature economies but efforts to restructure their international debts and deal with high or hyperinflation were quite successful the world bank and regional development banks adapted to a world of ever greater capital needs by playing a more informational and catalytic role in areas such as infrastructure and institution building and despite slow or no progress at the wto level many bilateral and regional trade and investment arrangements were put in place today however global economic coordination has become more difficult if not outright impossible in some areas on trade despite the proliferation of regional arrangements there has been no meaningful multilateral progress since the uruguay round in 1994 on climate change and the environment a contemporary existential imperative recent negotiations have yielded limited results global public goods remain undersupplied in key areas such as security migration and global health and debt continues to grow in many countries often surpassing levels reached in the run up to the 2008 global financial crisis even some of the regional trade achievements of the past quarter century are now vulnerable such as the european union s single market assuming brexit happens the recently replaced north american free trade agreement latin america s mercosur bloc and the trans pacific partnership in parallel with these economic challenges there is widespread popular frustration at most countries inability to deal with the negative social implications of the current global development model in this context it is no surprise that newer forums such as the g 7 g 20 and the financial stability board have partly replaced the formal bretton woods institutions because decisions taken in international institutions often carry the force of law many countries increasingly prefer to meet in forums that issue mostly non binding statements a point often made by the late tommaso padoa schioppa a former european central bank board member and italian finance minister although not as strong as the original bretton woods design this evolving arrangement may indicate that the global system for economic governance is flexible and can adapt to changing circumstances but for the larger countries or blocs such as the united states the european union china and japan the formal bretton woods system is no longer central to macroeconomic stability trade or finance so what can we say about bretton woods in a world in transition first with the us less dominant and less willing to provide global economic and financial leadership systemic instability is likely to increase as the american economic historian charles kindleberger famously warned this typically occurs in transitional moments when a global hegemon is absent some signs of this are already visible in trade and regional tensions growing leverage and rising nationalism second bretton woods should now be seen to include not only the original institutions but also more recently established global forums and regional arrangements these mechanisms of cooperation constitute a realistic practical response to current challenges third one must ask whether developing countries will continue trying to converge with more advanced economies and whether the expanded bretton woods family of institutions can remain meaningful stewards of global progress my answers tend toward yes to both if one takes a long term view developing countries will aim to emulate the earlier successes of the asian tigers and eastern europe and countries will prefer dialogue and cooperation to the failures of those such as venezuela and north korea that opted out of the global system lastly this hopeful vision may now be under threat from the disturbing shift toward illiberal and populist political regimes around the world but history shows that liberal politics and economic policies have

expressed in terms is now close to c 82 barrel mr porter said gasoline prices can sometimes be bumped around temporarily by other factors seasonality competition and yes taxes but oil prices are a solid anchor he added and the rebound since the turn of the year has lifted canadian pump prices by 20 per cent from the early year lows even before the carbon tax still prices are a snick below

billion worth of canola products to china the largest vegetable oil consumer in the world they added in a report exports to china have been helping diversify canada s export base with growth to that nation outrunning increases in shipments to the u s however if tensions persist and china continues to block imports from canadian canola producers the frictions could show up as a drag on the trade balance as prices would likely fall even if producers sold the products to other destinations this would ripple through the trade sector as canada is trying to boost its non oil exports which is how

global growth has lost momentum since the start of the year leaving the world economy in a precarious position imf managing director christine lagarde said the global economy has weakened since the international monetary fund last updated its forecast in late january though a recession isn t likely in the near term lagarde said tuesday in remarks prepared for a speech at the u s chamber of commerce in washington in january the fund lowered its projection for world economic growth forecasting expansion of 3 5 per cent this year and 3 6 per cent in 2020 it was the imf s second cut in the outlook in three months the fund will release its new world economic outlook with an updated growth forecast on april 9 the global economy is at a delicate moment lagarde said her warning comes as global finance ministers and central bankers prepare to convene in washington next week for the semi annual meetings of the imf and world bank while confidence has been boosted by the federal reserve s switch to a more patient stance and signs of a trade deal between the u s and china investors remain concerned the global expansion may be running out of steam a decade after the financial crisis rate patience lagarde said the global economy is set to benefit from the patience of major central banks as well as increased stimulus by the chinese government the imf predicts global growth will pick up some in the second half of 2019 and into 2020 she said still that rebound remains vulnerable to a host of risks including britain s exit from the european union high debt in some sectors and countries trade tensions and a sense of unease in financial markets lagarde said given the state of the global economy it s important for policy makers to avoid missteps she said monetary policy should remain accommodative where inflation is below target while exchange rate flexibility should be used as needed according to lagarde regulatory reforms aimed at strengthening the financial sector should continue she added high public debt and low interest rates have left limited room to act when the next downturn comes which inevitably it will she said for many countries this implies making smarter use of fiscal policy the market power of corporations has been increasing with the highest price markups being imposed by a small number of highly dynamic companies a trend that is especially pronounced in the digital economy lagarde said market power i am not saying that we currently have a monopoly problem but i am saying that we should take appropriate measures so that it does not become a problem she said lagarde reiterated her warning for countries to avoid imposing new tariffs on each other an increase in tariffs by 25 percentage points on all goods traded between the u s and china would reduce annual output in the u s by up to 0 6 per cent and up to 1 5 per cent in china she said these are potentially self inflicted wounds that should be avoided lagarde said high level trade talks between the u s and china resume this week in washington amid hopes the world s two biggest economies can reach a deal to end their trade war

world trade will continue to face strong headwinds in 2019 and 2020 after growing more slowly than expected in 2018 due to rising trade tensions and increased economic uncertainty wto economists expect merchandise trade volume growth to fall to 2 6 in 2019 down from 3 0 in 2018 trade growth could then rebound to 3 0 in 2020 however this is dependent on an easing of trade tensions wto director general roberto azevêdo said with trade tensions running high no one should be surprised by this outlook trade cannot play its full role in driving growth when we see such high levels of uncertainty it is increasingly urgent that we resolve tensions and focus on charting a positive path forward for global trade which responds to the real challenges in today s economy such as the technological revolution and the imperative of creating jobs and boosting development wto members are working to do this and are discussing ways to strengthen and safeguard the trading system this is vital if we forget the fundamental importance of the rules based trading system we would risk weakening it which would be an historic mistake with repercussions for jobs growth and stability around the world trade growth in 2018 was weighed down by several factors including new tariffs and retaliatory measures affecting widely traded goods weaker global economic growth volatility in financial markets and tighter monetary conditions in developed countries among others consensus estimates have world gdp growth slowing from 2 9 in 2018 to 2 6 in both 2019 and 2020 the above average trade growth of 4 6 in 2017 suggested that trade could recover some of its earlier dynamism but this has not materialized trade only grew slightly faster than output in 2018 and this relative weakness is expected to extend into at least 2019 chart 1 this is partly explained by slower growth in the european union which has a larger share in world trade than in world gdp chart 1 world merchandise trade volume and real gdp growth 2011 2020 annual change the preliminary estimate of 3 0 for world trade growth in 2018 is below the wto s most recent forecast of 3 9 issued last september the shortfall is mostly explained by a worse than expected result in the fourth quarter when world trade as measured by the average of exports and imports declined by 0 3 until then third quarter trade had been up 3 8 in line with wto projections in recognition of the high degree of uncertainty associated with trade forecasts under current conditions chart 2 uses shaded bands to illustrate a range of possible trade outcomes in 2019 trade expansion in the current year is most likely to fall within a range from 1 3 to 4 0 it should be noted that trade growth could be below this range if trade tensions continue to build or above it if they start to ease chart 2 volume of world merchandise trade 2015q1 2019q4 seasonally adjusted volume index 2005 100 nominal trade values also rose in 2018 due to a combination of volume and price changes world merchandise exports totalled us 19 48 trillion up 10 from the previous year the rise was driven partly by higher oil prices which increased by roughly 20 between 2017 and 2018 chart 3 the value of commercial services trade rose nearly as much with exports totalling us 5 80 trillion in 2018 up 8 from the previous year detailed breakdowns of merchandise and commercial services trade by country and region are shown in appendix tables 1 through 4 and appendix chart 1 trade statistics in value terms are highly sensitive to fluctuations in prices and exchange rates and as a result should be interpreted with caution chart 3 prices of primary commodities jan 2014 feb 2019 indices january 2014 100 there were few changes in export and import rankings among major traders in terms of us dollar values the fastest merchandise export growth in nominal terms was recorded by oil producers including the kingdom of saudi arabia 34 8 and the russian federation 25 6 merchandise import values increased most for indonesia 20 2 brazil 19 8 china 15 8 and viet nam 15 4 among commercial services traders china registered strong increases in the value of its exports 17 and imports 12 india also recorded double digit growth in commercial services trade on both the export side 11 and the import side 14 the current trade forecast reflects downgraded gdp projections for north america europe and asia mostly due to macroeconomic considerations including the diminishing effect of expansionary fiscal policy in the united states the phase out of monetary stimulus in the euro area and the ongoing economic rebalancing of the chinese economy away from manufacturing and investment and toward services and consumption monetary authorities have put further rate hikes on hold in response to soft economic data but changes in monetary policy take some time to be felt trade measures announced in the past year are also reflected in underlying gdp assumptions but any additional ratcheting up of trade tensions is not factored in the impact of trade tensions on actual trade flows is difficult to quantify since it depends on the nature of any proposed measures and whether they are implemented or only threatened threatened measures can still have real effects by increasing uncertainty and discouraging investment wto economists have attempted to quantify the medium run economic impact of a wider trade conflict in which international cooperation on tariffs breaks down completely and all countries set tariffs unilaterally bekkers and teh forthcoming under this study such a worst case scenario would lead to a reduction in world gdp in 2022 of about 2 and a reduction in global trade of about 17 compared to baseline projections for comparison global gdp fell about 2 and global trade dropped about 12 in 2009 following the financial crisis other risks to the trade outlook are more difficult to quantify for example the effects of brexit will depend on the nature of any agreement that might be reached between the united kingdom and the european union with impacts mostly confined to these economies lower investment in the u k is likely in most foreseeable brexit scenarios which would tend to reduce productive capacity over time appendix chart 2 details on trade developments in 2018 the slowdown in merchandise trade volume growth in 2018 was broad based reflecting weaker import demand in both developed and developing countries although some regions were more strongly affected than others chart 4 shows seasonally adjusted quarterly merchandise exports and imports by level of development weakness was most evident in the fourth quarter of 2018 when export volumes declined by 0 1 and import volumes dropped 0 5 on the export side the slowdown was mostly due to reduced shipments from developed countries which contracted year on year in three out of the four quarters of 2018 on the import side developed countries recorded slow growth throughout the year particularly in the first half meanwhile developing economies saw imports fall sharply 2 1 in the final quarter despite stronger growth earlier in the year chart 4 world merchandise exports and imports by level of development 2012q1 2018q4 volume index 2012q1 100 chart 5 shows merchandise export and import volumes by region the deceleration of trade in 2018 was driven primarily by europe and asia due to their large share in world imports 37 and 35 respectively after recording strong increases in 2017 asia saw its trade growth moderate in 2018 meanwhile europe s exports stagnated throughout the year while its imports declined gradually chart 5 merchandise exports and imports by region 2012q1 2018q4 volume index 2012q1 100 a major exception to the trend was north america where a buoyant us economy contributed to strong import growth of 5 0 in 2018 table 1 other regions encompassing africa the middle east and commonwealth of independent states saw export growth accelerate to 2 7 south america s trade flows have continued to recover gradually but have been buffeted by weaker external demand and domestic economic shocks heightened trade tensions cannot explain all of the trade slowdown in 2018 but they undoubtedly played a significant role as consumers and firms anticipated new trade measures taking effect trade and output were also influenced by temporary shocks including the federal government shutdown in the united states and production problems in the automotive sector in germany toward the end of the year these shocks are more likely to have transitory effects causing consumers and businesses to postpone purchases and production decisions rather than cancelling them outright world commercial services trade recorded strong growth in 2018 for the second consecutive year this is illustrated by chart 6 which shows growth in the dollar value of services exports by major categories goods related services registered the strongest expansion with an 10 6 increase in current dollar terms the weakest growth was in transport which rose by 7 1 commercial services overall grew 7 7 in 2018 chart 6 growth in the value of commercial services exports by category 2014 18 change in us values outlook for trade in 2019 and 2020 forward looking trade indicators have turned negative in recent months including the wto s world trade outlook indicator wtoi in

china to the extent that economic uncertainty deters investment it can have a negative impact on trade since capital goods tend to have high import content conversely a lowering of trade tensions would be expected to stimulate both investment and trade chart 8 global economic policy uncertainty jan 2005 feb 2019 index average 1997 2015 100 if current gdp forecasts are realised the wto expects

â global growth has lost momentum since the start of the year leaving the world economy in a precarious position imf managing director christine lagarde said the global economy has weakened since the international monetary fund last updated its forecast in late january though a recession isn t likely in the near term lagarde said tuesday in remarks prepared for a speech at the us chamber of commerce in washington ms lagarde characterized the slowdown as a synchronized deceleration during a panel discussion after her speech in january the fund lowered its projection for world economic growth forecasting expansion of 3 5 per cent this year and 3 6 per cent in 2020 it was the imf s second cut in the outlook in three months the fund will release its new world economic outlook with an updated growth forecast on april 9 the global economy is at a delicate moment ms lagarde said in her speech her warning comes as global finance ministers and central bankers prepare to convene in washington next week for the semi annual meetings of the imf and world bank while confidence has been boosted by the federal reserve s switch to a more patient stance and signs of a trade deal between the us and china investors remain concerned the global expansion may be running out of steam a decade after the financial crisis ms lagarde said the global economy is set to benefit from the patience of major central banks as well as increased stimulus by the chinese government the imf predicts global growth will pick up some in the second half of 2019 and into 2020 she said still that rebound remains vulnerable to a host of risks including britain s exit from the european union high debt in some sectors and countries trade tensions and a sense of unease in financial markets ms lagarde said given the state of the global economy it s important for policy makers to avoid missteps she said monetary policy should remain accommodative where inflation is below target while exchange rate flexibility should be used as needed according to lagarde regulatory reforms aimed at strengthening the financial sector should continue she added high public debt and low interest rates have left limited room to act when the next downturn comes which inevitably it will she said for many countries this implies making smarter use of fiscal policy the market power of corporations has been increasing with the highest price markups being imposed by a small number of highly dynamic companies a trend that is especially pronounced in the digital economy ms lagarde said i am not saying that we currently have a monopoly problem but i am saying that we should take appropriate measures so that it does not become a problem she said ms lagarde reiterated her warning for countries to avoid imposing new tariffs on each other an increase in tariffs by 25 percentage points on all goods traded between the us and china would reduce annual output in the us by up to 0 6 per cent and up to 1 5 per cent in china she said these are potentially self inflicted wounds that should be avoided ms lagarde said high level trade talks between the us and china resume this week in washington amid hopes the world s two biggest economies can reach a deal to end their trade war bloomberg

from birch gold group this week your news to know rounds up the latest news involving precious metals and the overall economy stories include why the fed s policy shift is good for gold russia is dumping u s dollars in favor of gold and how silver often takes first place for both collectors and investors the fed s policy u turn is decidedly good for gold last week the federal reserve announced that it will probably not hike interest rates at all this year and downgraded its growth forecast for 2019 according to a recent article on kitco the announcement shot down market expectations that 2019 would see a minimum of two rate hikes perhaps more importantly the dovish sentiment by fed officials stood out in stark contrast to the hawkish rhetoric of 2018 gold prices fell immediately after the announcement and have lingered around the 1 300 level but to john reade chief market strategist at the world gold council there is no question that the fed s latest meeting was a highly bullish development for gold the general consensus is that tightening cycles place downwards pressure on gold prices and the latest wrap up will remove a major hurdle for the already well performing metal furthermore the previous two ends to hiking cycles resulted in significant long term gains for gold in the latter case when the fed stopped raising rates in 2007 gold prices wound up nearly 20 higher within 12 months of the policy change the dollar has held up so far yet many of its supporting factors such as economic weakness in europe and emerging market volatility also strongly support gold after the fed s announcement reade is certain that the greenback s persistent strength will soon begin to wane there are other historical precedents that point to good things in store for the yellow metal as nearly every hiking cycle in the u s has triggered a recession there is reason to believe that a crisis could be looming especially given the now confirmed growth slowdown with equities teetering on the brink of a prolonged bearish cycle reade believes investors should seize the opportunity and bolster their portfolio with a significant gold allocation russia is dumping u s dollar to hoard even more gold bullion russia s quest to rid itself of u s currency in favor of gold has been well documented according to newsmax the country has continually led the way in central bank purchases by a wide margin and the trend of voracious acquisitions appears to be intensifying data from russia s central bank shows that the country s holding of gold rose by one million ounces in february the most since november the country s appetite for gold has led some to believe that russia s own mines could soon be depleted and that the nation s officials will proceed to import gold to meet their goals last year marked the first time that bullion demand exceeded mine supply analysts have started to speculate on the potential impact of the so called de dollarization on the global economy although russia s purchases will be hard to beat newsmax reports several central banks have already shown a desire to diversify their reserves away from the dollar and into gold french president emmanuel macron recently told cnn that he feels as if european companies are too reliant on the greenback the comments come after a record year in terms of central bank gold purchases one that saw countries around the world buy more than 600 tons of bullion combined poland hungary and several other nations surprised market watchers with multi ton gold purchases in 2018 supporting the notion that global central banks are moving away from the dollar what this will mean for the global reserve currency remains to be seen although it s clear that intense central bank buying has done much to support gold prices oleg kouzmin a former bank of russia official and chief economist at the renaissance capital in moscow said that russia is also motivated to purchase bullion due to growing geopolitical risks how silver often takes first place for both collectors and investors while silver is sometimes treated as a runner up to gold a recent article by greysheet revealed how the metal has frequently shed its second place moniker to become a preferred investment among collectors silver coins are frequently the most sought after possession whether it s for standard mints or rare and valuable pieces this like the metal s myriad of industrial uses serves to showcase silver s versatility and oft underestimated potential yet despite silver s perpetual foothold in numismatics and manufacturing it is most often talked about as an investment over the past four decades silver has enjoyed numerous bull markets that have seen the metal s price shoot up multi fold these periods were generally brought about by economic hardship and nowhere was this more apparent than in the 1979 1981 stretch a time of high unemployment high interest rates and double digit inflation during that time silver approached values of 50 an ounce or 115 in today s inflation adjusted terms while the dire three year stretch may not be repeated to the same extent there are reasons to believe that 2019 will be a year of hardship for many americans for some the most prominent has been the u s china trade standoff which could somewhat ironically result in heightened unemployment in the u s besides numerous other threats to the domestic and global economy there is also the issue of a dwindling silver mine supply with equally worrisome prospects all this is happening during a time when silver is by most accounts trading at bargain prices many analysts concur that the metal s price is ripe for an increase of up to 25 based on historic data to greysheet however significant price gains are merely icing on the cake the greysheet article says silver investment should be seen for what it is a guard against inflation a chance to obtain something of tangible value and a guaranteed store of wealth even during times when all other asset classes and currencies betray the confidence of their holders after 8 long years of ultra loose monetary policy from the federal reserve it s no secret

but don t government agencies also exist to grow have you ever heard of one that offered to shrink don t departments in government also seek more authority power and money aren t the men and women who work in government as interested in advancing their careers as men and women in business school textbooks teach kids that businesses exist to make money while governments exist to serve the public but in the world beyond textbooks businesses and governments exist first and foremost to serve their customers for businesses it s the people who buy their products or services if that happens they make profits that satisfy their investors and shareholders if they don t serve their customers then profits don t happen and eventually the business stops happening for government however when it comes to setting policy the recipient of a government service is usually not the customer witness how seattle spends its money on homeless policy nor is it the taxpayer the ultimate customers are usually the interest groups that subsidize campaigns of elected officials and then lobby for their agenda here s a quick example public schools they exist to educate children if students and their parents were the customer in olympia there would be no k 12 teacher tenure teachers would not be paid largely by seniority and individual merit would be part of their compensation how do i know this show me a successful private school no matter how progressive that makes it next to impossible to terminate a substandard teacher after three years and pays strictly by seniority there isn t one because it would produce an inferior product parents would choose a different school the school would lose its real customers in olympia priorities are largely shaped by the state teachers union the washington education association different customer very different priorities so what happens when a string of organizations with an interest in more spending and higher taxes team up and successfully elect a clear majority of candidates to office we are now finding out in the past six years state spending has already soared more than 45 percent about three times the combined growth of inflation and population our much maligned tax system has generated record tax revenues enough to allow government to grow another 13 percent in the next two years again three times the anticipated growth in population and inflation but somehow that s not enough democrats controlling the majority demand even higher budgets and expanded programs all to be financed by additional taxes not one tax but especially in the house half a dozen maybe more there will be if present trends continue higher taxes on businesses on home sales on investment income and up to four separate additional taxes and regulations that drive up the price of gasoline plus possibly authorizing higher local property taxes after the legislature at the prompting of the state supreme court slammed the door on that idea just a year ago when the government 1 grabs all the unexpected additional money on the table and demands more 2 creates new taxes and raises existing ones to fatten additional revenue streams and 3 shows virtually zero concern for taxpayers this is greed that s olympia right now the counter to all this of course is that the democrats are building out government only to meet additional demands demands for more mental health spending more aid for the developmentally disabled more special education spending more counselors in schools more money to rebuild hundreds of millions of dollars worth of fish culverts because state attorney general bob ferguson came up short at the u s supreme court etc but there are always demands for more spending when they happen at the household level and incomes aren t rising we usually trim spending in other places has anyone in the majority party suggested scrubbing the existing 44 7 billion budget that is a purely rhetorical question because everyone knows the answer is no so here is a question for all good liberals everywhere how much does the government have to take before you call it greedy the immediate response is that the wealthy should pay more because our tax system is unfair to middle class and poor people that s why the governor is pushing a capital gains tax on investments 9 9 percent on investment income over 100 000 per person hitting about 14 000 people to start ok got it so what tax is he lowering for working class people as part of this package none that s not reform it s an add on seattle played that same game in 2017 when the city passed a progressive income tax in the name of shrinking the tax gap between rich and nonrich households no tax break for the poor and middle class just a hike on the rich the state senate budget proposal imposes the same tax as the house but at least uses part of it to reduce people s tax burden but both versions are as unconstitutional as the seattle income tax which similarly argued that it wasn t a tax on income it was really an excise tax a sale on a transaction no dice ruled superior court judge john ruhl and yet legislators are now reading that same script comparing a tax on one s income from the sale of securities or dividends to the sale of a home here is why it won t fly say you buy a home for 500 000 and sell it 15 years later for 2 million you will be accessed a tax on the 2 million sale that s an excise tax now let s say you buy 500 000 in stock in a company and sell it 15 years later for 2 million you will be accessed a tax on 1 5 million the difference between the purchase price and the sales price which represents income small wonder that the internal revenue service has stipulated in writing that a capital gains tax is an income tax jason mercier of the washington policy center disclosure i m a co founder and former president pointed out in last sunday s seattle times that every state with a capital gains tax refers to it as an income tax the state constitution pointedly says such income must be uniformly applied which neither bill comes close to doing so why do the democratic majorities in both houses press ahead it s because they are serving their customers some customers such as unions want higher taxes for economic reasons other customers want them to satisfy political agendas legislators will use whatever creative interpretation of the law they can muster combined with the political muscle required to push them through they ll call it leadership but it s actually greed

what happens in europe doesn t stay in europe in market strategy commentary today joe quinlan head of cio market strategy for merrill and bank of america private bank discusses why europe is hugely important to the overall and long term success of many u s multinationals and by extension the u s economy he says of the 200 economies that make up the global economy the big three united states china and europe account for 60 of world gdp and global consumption and 55 of world trade and cross border investment with or without the uk the eu is a formidable economic entity minus the uk the eu s output was still almost 20 larger than china s last year while much has been given to the rise of the middle class consumer in china and associated market opportunities china remains a difficult place to do business u s affiliate firms doing business there posted just 13 3 billion in earnings in china down 1 1 from the year prior meanwhile u s corporate earnings in europe hit a record 284 billion last year up 7 europe remains by far the most important market for u s multinational companies as the uk and eu struggle to find a solution on brexit and as political populism gains traction across the continent at risk are large cap u s corporate earnings get the full warren buffett series in pdf get the entire 10 part series on warren buffett in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q4 hedge fund letters conference scoops etc joe s full report with supporting charts can be found below the first chart shows the relative strength of the world s big three economies separately and combined the global slowdown europe is the one to watch the world economy is composed of nearly 200 economies but only three can significantly move the needle when it comes to global growth trade investment and related activities the united states china and the eu the rest of the world follows along the big three account for over 60 of world gross domestic product gdp and global consumption and more than half of world trade and cross border investment exhibit 1 with or without the uk the eu is a formidable economic entity with output totaling over 18 trillion in 2018 minus the uk the eu s output 16 trillion was still almost 20 larger than china s 13 5 trillion last year underscoring the economic heft of the region add in the bloc s 500 million people with a healthy per capita gdp of 34 000 and europe s influence on global economic activity and global earnings becomes even clearer to this point recall that it was europe that was at the forefront of the global economic slowdown of 2018 as exhibit 2 highlights the region s purchasing managers index pmi peaked in january 2018 and economic growth was subsequently dragged lower by a stronger euro rising oil prices and industrial capacity constraints accelerating the move to the downside the announcement of u s steel and aluminum tariffs in march 2018 which battered business confidence in europe and disrupted transatlantic trade volumes over the second half of the year rising u s china trade tensions and the attendant negative effect on china s real growth squeezed eu exports to china in particular and the world in general more eu exporters have greater leverage to china today than the u s so when china sneezes europe catches a cold notably those nations with a relatively high share of exports to gdp e g germany the netherlands belgium and ireland in addition to softening external demand the messy uncertainty of brexit has hardly helped matters sapping consumer and business confidence on both sides of the channel against this backdrop europe limped into 2019 euro area growth forecasts have been continuously marked down over the past few months with the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd for instance now forecasting euro area real growth of just 1 this year versus 1 8 back in november 2018 the outlook for growth next year is hardly gangbusters 1 2 that s the bad news the good news a great deal of negative news is already priced into european equities what s more the reflationary policies of both the u s aka fed on hold and china more pro cyclical spending should likely limit the economic downside in europe in the next few months as should more accommodating policies from the european central bank ecb and mild stimulative fiscal positions of most euro states add in a u s china trade deal that dramatically de escalates global trade tensions and the economy most dependent on trade for growth the european union looks better this backdrop is why european large cap equities have been among the best performers so far this year exhibit 3 the buoyancy of europe equities reflects market expectations that the u s and china could likely successfully reflate global growth with export dependent eurozone nations among the main beneficiaries one caveat the uk crashing out of the eu which cannot be ruled out at this juncture the oecd estimates that should the two parties separate without a deal boosting tariffs between the two parties the effect would reduce gdp by around 2 in the uk over the next two years 21 the negative spillover effects would hurt smaller european exporters most exposed to the uk notably ireland the netherlands and denmark what happens in europe doesn t stay in europe we believe the u s economy is the most resilient and dynamic of the big three or the united states china and the european union but the united states is hardly immune to troubles across the atlantic as we have highlighted in the past europe matters significantly to u s corporate earnings for instance data released last week from the bureau of economic analysis show that u s corporate earnings in europe hit a record 284 billion in 2018 up 7 from a year ago putting that number into perspective u s affiliate income in europe was about three times more than the affiliate income of all of latin america 96 billion or asia 93 billion europe remains by far the most important market for u s multinational companies with the region as a whole accounting for 55 of global foreign affiliate income wealthy consumers respect for the rule of law the ease of doing business credible institutions all of these factors and more have long made the eu a more attractive place to do business for american firms while much attention has been given to the rise of the middle class consumer in china and associated market opportunities the country remains a difficult place to do business u s affiliates posted just 13 3 billion in earnings in china in 2018 down 1 1 from a year ago meanwhile the more profitable u s affiliates are in europe the more earnings are available to the parent firm to hire and invest at home dole out higher wages to u s workers and or increase dividends to u s shareholders in other words u s corporate success in europe is hugely important to the overall and long term success of many u s multinationals and by extension the u s economy the more successful u s affiliates are in reaching new consumers in europe and leveraging the continent s resources the better off are the foreign affiliates u s parent companies u s workers shareholders and local communities are considered in other words america s transatlantic partnership with europe has proven to display significant dividends despite a more challenging economic environment in europe last year u s foreign affiliate profit growth remained strong however rising investment uncertainty and structural issues throughout europe could lead to a more challenging operating environment for u s multinationals which have long counted on europe to drive the bulk of their non u s earnings growth in the end the future of the eu remains critical to the long term health of the global economy in other words what happens in europe doesn t stay in europe as growth slows in the eurozone as the uk and eu struggle to find a solution on brexit and as political populism gains traction across the continent at risk are large cap u s corporate earnings however global reflationary policies are falling into place that should help to limit the profits downside to u s firms the named research analysts in these materials certify that the views expressed in these materials accurately reflect the analysts personal opinions

source xinhua 2019 04 02 21 45 16 editor li xia video player close washington april 2 xinhua the bloomberg barclays global aggregate index started including china s yuan demoninated bonds monday with a 20 month phase in period the inclusion of the 356 bonds issued by the government and policy banks in the index is expected to attract foreign inflows into the chinese bond market and foster a further opening up of the country s financial sector foreign inflows after their full inclusion chinese renminbi rmb denominated bonds will become the fourth largest currency component following the u s dollar the euro and the japanese yen china s weight would reach approximately 6 percent of the index using data as of jan 31 this year it will effectively lead to more purchases of chinese bonds by foreigners and provide investors globally with an opportunity to diversify their assets alfred schipke the international monetary fund imf senior resident representative for china told xinhua in a recent interview goldman sachs estimated in february that total inflows into china s bond market prompted by this inclusion would be 120 135 billion u s dollars over the 20 month scale in period morgan stanley meanwhile expects to see 80 100 billion dollars of inflows into the government bond market in 2019 compared to 35 billion dollars on average between 2015 and 2018 it sees as much as 120 billion dollars going into china s government bond market annually from 2020 to 2030 according to a february report china s bond market stood at about 86 trillion yuan 12 84 trillion dollars by the end of 2018 with about 1 8 trillion yuan 260 billion dollars or 2 percent held by global investors up 46 percent from a year earlier according to the people s bank of china deutsche bank s projections suggest that foreigners will own as much as a fifth of central government debt in five years bloomberg reported last week an expected growth in inflows will make the foreign investor community an increasingly significant stakeholder in china s financial system bloomberg said important milestone the inclusion is an important milestone in china s financial integration into the world economy said changyong rhee director of the imf s asia and pacific department at a book forum held in washington d c in march this development follows the establishment in 2017 of the so called bond connect which allows foreigners to enter the chinese bond market as well as the authorities recent commitments to further develop and open the market rhee said in his opening remarks at the event according to a government work report delivered in early march china will implement reform and opening up measures in the financial sectors and improve policies on opening the bond market schipke noted that the inclusion of the renminbi rmb in the special drawing rights sdr basket in november 2016 was associated with operational improvements in china s bond market which has triggered a surge in global investor interest more foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds have bought rmb bonds as part of their reserves he said as holdings of rmb reserves by foreign central banks have gone up about 100 percent since 2016 citing the co movement of the rmb with other currencies in the world schipke said the international monetary system might be moving away from the bipolar u s dollar and the euro blocs to a tripolar system that probably means that there will be additional demand for rmb bonds he said china s bond market the third largest in the world is reaching a tipping point as regulation market access investor demand and benchmarks are firmly in place li bing head of bloomberg china said in a statement china s inclusion in the index has been a journey as financial reforms deepen and as its capital markets become more transparent to global investors li said further opening up bloomberg suggested china enhance market liquidity improve its rating system increase hedging tools and address operational concerns in order to promote the healthy development of china s bond market li said as foreign rating agencies start operating in the chinese bond market its rating system has to improve to meet global standards li said adding that it is critical for the next evolution of china s corporate bond inclusion into the bloomberg barclays index bloomberg found it encouraging to hear that a key task for the people s bank of china this year is to provide sufficient financial hedging instruments to allow investors to effectively manage risks li said goldman sachs thinks that the operational issues should improve over time as teething issues are addressed during the phased inclusion which should pave the way for other bond indices to include china two other major global bond indices include the ftse world government bond index and the j p morgan government bond index emerging markets we expect all three major bond indices to include china or at least announcement of plans to include china by the end of 2020 goldman sachs said in the february report schipke one of the editors of the book the future of china s bond market published by the imf in march said the team thinks that china s financial sector integration in the next decade will bring many opportunities for investors globally to diversify their portfolios looking ahead the book s contributors believe that a careful sequencing of reforms could help minimize risks and promote the development of china s bond market the team suggested that china strengthen the capacity of financial regulators boost foreign participation and improve communication among other things it is important to further the quantity of information that is available for investors schipke said adding that more transparency should be conducive to the development of china s bond market last year china celebrated its 40th anniversary of reform and opening up which contributed to china s trade and product integration said schipke but if you re looking at the future our view is that the future will be about china s financial sector integration with the world and the bond market will play a particular role he said
photo getty images global uncertainty casts a shadow over asian financial forum in hong kong earlier this year i travelled to hong kong to attend the asian financial forum the forum now in its 12th year brings together financial and business leaders global policy makers and financial regulators from over 40 countries and regions while the theme of the forum this year was creating a sustainable and inclusive future it was unsurprising this was clouded by the uncertainty hanging over the united states china trade negotiations fears of growing protectionism populism and wider geopolitical tensions in her opening address hong kong s chief executive carrie lam wished attendees success in finding innovative new ways to excel in 2019 but acknowledged it will likely be a considerable challenge this year she was of course referring to the trade discord between the world s two largest economies as well as lingering uncertainties in other parts of the world for many economies including hong kong moderated growth and for many companies diminished business and financial results appear inevitable she said the more than 3300 attendees agreed the audience were given the chance to vote on sentiment throughout the forum when asked about the outlook for the global economy in 2019 just 15 per cent of respondents were optimistic 47 per cent were pessimistic this is in dramatic contrast to the 2018 forum where 58 per cent were optimistic and just 6 per cent were pessimistic a follow up question asked the source of risk for global financial stability this year us china trade tensions came out on top with 77 per cent of respondents this was followed by monetary policy normalisation 10 per cent cyber breaches and security risks 7 per cent and brexit and fiscal discipline in the european union 6 per cent perhaps in light of the concern around china uncertainty attendees at the forum felt that southeast asia offered the best guarantee of investment return for 2019 39 per cent this was followed by china 35 per cent the united states 16 per cent japan 3 per cent and western europe 2 per cent hong kong s financial secretary paul chan said that global uncertainty weighs heavily on global investment and business sentiment and adds downside risk to economic growth and increased volatility in financial markets although hong kong is part of china under the one country two systems principle it has distinct advantages for attracting investment including operating with a strong rule of law based on english common law independence of the judiciary a simple tax system and respected intellectual property protection a woman walks past a board showing the hong kong share index outside a hong kong bank last month photo ap chan said hong kong s position as the freest economy in the world comes with an assurance that protectionism won t happen there we support free trade and the multilateral trading system as well as the free flow of capital people and information indeed it is the cornerstone of our economy he says the international monetary fund has commended hong kong s prudent macroeconomic policies the fund noted that our long standing buffers will help hong kong maintain stability despite the increasing risks confronting global growth he noted that the government is enhancing the regulatory regime and the resilience of the financial markets to help hong kong maintain financial stability amid heightened external uncertainties but us china trade tensions the economic slowdown in china cooling property prices and volatility in the stock market have had a demonstratable impact the trade reliant hong kong economy expanded at just 1 3 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year significantly down on the 2 9 per cent gdp growth recorded in the third quarter export growth was near zero a dramatic decrease from the 6 per cent average in the first three quarters retail sales were also down denis beau first deputy governor of the bank of france told the forum the world economy is facing a maturing financial and economic cycle but we are far from a downturn overall financial intermediaries were much better equipped to withstand shocks than during the financial crisis in 2008 burkhard balz executive member of deutsche bundesbank germany s central bank said uncertainty was significantly higher than 20 years ago due to disintegration referencing brexit political disturbances and trade tensions but by historical standards volatility is not high other keynote speakers including vice president of the china banking and insurance regulatory commission wang zhaoxing recognised that despite the challenges there were still many opportunities he was confident the chinese economy would remain stable because of the potential for supply and demand in the country and said although the opening up of china s banking and insurance sector had so far been gradual president xi announced an acceleration which has been welcomed globally wang said china s central government would focus on five key areas this year the real estate market local government debt the influence of global markets monetary policy in developed countries and the trade relationship between china and the united states china will continue to work with other asian countries to strengthen collaboration and promote the development of the asian economy and financial markets he said in response to the forum s theme participants were polled on what the biggest challenge was to achieving a sustainable future globally a total of 43 per cent said it was a reluctance to trade higher cost today for better sustainability for future generations this was followed by reluctance by some governments to adopt policies for sustainable development 23 per cent insufficient attention to environmental social and governance factors in asset markets 21 per cent lack of financially viable green projects 10 per cent and lack of green funding 3 per cent tim mccready travelled to the asian financial forum as a guest of the hong kong government
alexander baldwin s historic bishop street headquarters is a sepia colored landmark of hawaii s old plantation economy but the building is now filled with dozens of devices that symbolize a decidedly different economic future for hawaii the energy innovation business the carbon lighthouse an energy efficiency startup has deployed 85 sensors each about the size of a deck of cards all over the building to measure things like temperature light and foot traffic it s like an energy efficiency audit backed by a massive database of information that carbon lighthouse has collected from sensors deployed at dozens of other locations the idea is to get more data than anyone has ever seen and mine it to find ways for building managers to reduce their energy use says louis concato carbon lighthouse s executive account manager for hawaii the company likens the process to oil exploration using technology to find hidden resources and money in this case 10 to 30 savings for clients a b one of hawaii s old big five companies isn t alone in embracing new energy technology gov david ige has made energy innovation a centerpiece of his public policies centered on a push to adopt renewable energy resources some economists meanwhile say the industry presents one of the brightest new business opportunities for hawaii and a chance to create alternatives to the tourism related jobs that dominate local employment economists at the university of hawaii s economic research organization believe identifying these small but growing sectors could inform solutions to the state s age old dilemma how to diversify the islands economy so it includes more higher paying jobs that allow people to afford living in one of america s priciest states cory lum civil beat 2018 where is that growth particularly sustainable growth that s compatible with hawaii s lifestyle and doesn t further erode the environment going to come from that s a critical question for policymakers business leaders and ordinary citizens about this series for our new series hawaii s changing economy civil beat is exploring the state of hawaii s economy and its future we ll look at where traditional industries such as tourism are headed and the best opportunities for innovation job growth and lessening our dependence on visitors all with an eye on the most critical question can we create a sustainable economy that produces well paying jobs that allow people to stay in hawaii hawaii s changing economy is supported by a grant from the hawaii community foundation and its change framework program read more about the grant here it s challenging at this time to have a conversation about economic growth said paul brewbaker a former bank of hawaii chief economist who now runs his own economics consulting firm but that s the conversation we need to have you have to be able to talk about it without getting shouted down by the hippies or whoever tourism is still king hawaii s beaches waters and culture remain the state s biggest export industry tourism which has come to overwhelmingly dominate the state s business during the last three decades is booming edging toward 10 million visitors annually the industry employs more than 123 000 workers statewide or nearly one in five non farm jobs although the trade transportation and utilities sector was slightly larger the bulk of those jobs some 70 000 positions altogether were retail jobs including many stores catering to tourists meanwhile hawaii s scant manufacturing sector has declined in the past three decades most of the 14 000 workers left are making goods like food products other areas have grown for example from 1990 to 2018 health care and private education jobs grew by about 88 to 84 700 jobs from 45 100 when adjusted for seasonal fluctuations and professional and business services jobs also increased to more than 81 000 from about 48 500 the construction industry has about 35 000 workers earning solid middle class wages of about 77 000 annually click on graphic to see full size but such industries tend to serve local people and bring little new money into hawaii when asked about the possibility of expanding hawaii s export industries brewbaker said tourism is pretty much it tourism is the list brewbaker said there s nothing else on the list good times can be deceiving on the surface the state s economy looks like a success story hawaii s real gross domestic product which measures goods and services produced is about 90 billion that places hawaii around 40th among u s states not bad for a small island economy accounting for hawaii s relatively small population the numbers look even better hawaii s per capita gdp places it in the top 20 ahead of states like pennsylvania ohio georgia and michigan in addition hawaii s median household income of about 75 000 is about a third higher than the national median of 57 000 but scratch just below the surface and problems quickly appear consider growth for example hawaii s real gdp grew just 9 4 from 2007 to 2017 while the u s real gdp grew by about 20 a bigger problem is hawaii s notoriously high cost of living once you factor in cost of living things change fairly quickly said carl bonham executive director of the university of hawaii economic research organization it s really stark it s scary in reality hawaii s seemingly robust median household income is barely enough for many families to eke out a life a 2015 report by the hawaii united way organizations estimated that a family of four including two adults an infant and preschooler would need a household income of more than 72 000 to afford basics like food clothing transportation health care and housing even if not technically in poverty families with income below the threshold are struggling the report said it had a term for such families asset limited income constrained employed or alice the report estimated 48 of people in hawaii were living below the alice threshold if not impoverished then just able to make ends meet in a vicious cycle the high living costs and relatively low incomes are contributing to the slow economic growth despite an unemployment rate of less than 3 people are leaving the state dissipating the workforce and the high living costs also make it hard to attract workers for many specialized and skilled jobs that all makes it hard to grow especially in an economy based on relatively low paying service jobs that need people to increase productivity more visitors for the same money one of the problems with being overly dependent on tourism is that the jobs don t pay all that well in 2017 according to the hawaii department of labor the annual average salary in the accommodations and food services sector was 33 136 which isn t much above the alice threshold of 28 128 perhaps more worrisome though is how many tourists it takes to fuel the economy only now are the inflation adjusted visitor expenditures totaling what they were at their peak in 1989 there were just 6 5 million visitors then now to bring in the same amount of money hawaii needs more than 50 more visitors an additional 3 5 million people that means many more negative side effects including more people driving on roads more people using trails and beaches an explosion of illegal vacation rentals in neighborhoods far from waikiki and a greater carbon footprint from air travelers these impacts are causing a backlash among environmentalists neighborhood groups and average citizens hawaii s decline in average per visitor spending since the 1980s might not be much different than other locales said jennifer chun director of tourism research for the hawaii tourism authority but chun said the phenomenon is real millions more tourists for the same amount of money we really can t deny the math she said that s what the math says looking for new opportunities one idea is to identify export industries that already have a budding presence in hawaii despite the challenges to spot such industries uhero in 2017 conducted a study on something known as traded industry clusters popularized by the harvard economist michael porter export industry clusters are concentrations of related businesses that give particular regions a competitive advantage over other regions when it comes to attracting new businesses clusters consist of concentrations of skilled workers and managers professionals like accountants and attorneys accustomed to working in the field banks and investors with industry knowledge willing to fund ventures all those factors can help create a snowball effect when it comes to growing a region s economy by attracting firms that want to tap those resources classic clusters are hollywood s movie business and silicon valley s technology industry when these advantages exist because the cluster is strong the cluster acts as a magnet bonham said uhero identified hawaii s clusters in a 2017 report titled a new perspective on hawaii s economy understanding the role of clusters even if a cluster is small it shows that the private sector has started to set up shop here said bonham beyond tourism there are other notable clusters including transportation and logistics research and development and energy innovation there s some reason to believe that those industries have a chance of being successful bonham said bullish on renewable energy hawaii s energy sector offers some of the brightest potential for business expansion and the addition of good jobs state energy policy set by law requires 100 of the electricity sold in the state to be produced by renewable resources by 2045 state policy is pushing for dramatic integration of renewable sources for electricity beyond what has occurred elsewhere uhero noted the goal means a massive shift from fossil fuels to solar wind and other renewable sources along with integration of storage technology and demand side management the shift could spur as much as 2 9 billion in investment and thousands of new jobs according to a 2018 study conducted by rhodium group for hawaii s elemental excelerator an incubator for energy startups the study reported that energy jobs all pay above hawaii s median that includes jobs related to making electricity from fossil fuels but jobs related to energy innovation pay the best with wages in the energy efficiency sector topping 30 per hour meanwhile companies like carbon lighthouse show how energy innovation jobs are rooting in hawaii although based in san francisco carbon lighthouse now has four employees here including two engineers the elemental excelerator which funds energy related startups is an investor so is the ulupono intitiative a hawaii based social investment firm focused on renewable energy local food production and waste management ulupono was founded by civil beat publisher pierre omidyar and his wife pam omidyar the company recently announced another project to deploy sensors at hawaiian airlines headquarters flickr billsophoto while the elemental excelerator ulupono and companies like blue planet energy are investing to develop emerging technology large companies like eurus energy and tesla are developing big solar and wind farms and rooftop solar installation while declining still goes on still dawn lippert the elemental excelerator s chief executive said maximizing the economic benefits of hawaii s energy policy will take long and persistent work we have the policy framework she said but it s a long term investment selling knowledge although not as large as tourism the fastest growing cluster identified by uhero is known as the education and knowledge creation cluster which includes jobs in research and development the sector added 3 550 jobs to total just under 8 700 jobs the idea of jobs related to research and development might seem ideal for hawaii whose geographic isolation makes it hard to lure manufacturing for example bonham said r d is big on the neighbor islands in part because of kauai s seed corn industry and the big island s telescopes on the summit of mauna kea both however are controversial the growing of seed corn is enormously unpopular among anti gmo environmentalists and people concerned about the industry s heavy use of pesticides part of the work done in hawaii has involved creating genetically modified pesticide tolerant corn so cornfields can be sprayed with chemicals like roundup to kill weeds without damaging corn meanwhile the hawaii supreme court recently cleared the way for construction of the 1 billion thirty meter telescope on mauna kea but opposition persists to building a new telescope on the mountain which is considered a sacred space for native hawaiians nonetheless the jobs can be lucrative research jobs on the big island for example paid an average wage of 84 000 in 2014 uhero reported many of these were related to astronomy uhero said cory lum civil beat 2015 of course not all knowledge creation jobs are controversial thousands are in hawaii s public and private universities and many others are high paying jobs with private r d related firms such as oceanit pelatron trex enterprises bae spectral solutions the oceanic institute and hawaii biotech the natural energy laboratory of hawaii a science and technology park in kona also supports a substantial number of r d jobs uhero reported ultimately the r d positions have one thing in common they re good paying jobs bonham said farms and bases the decline of sugar and pineapple wiped out an industry that once employed masses of workers and dominated hawaii s economy agriculture in the state now has two distinctly different branches one aims to grow food to eat locally the other to grow crops for export ige s vision calls for developing the former he wants hawaii to grow 30 of its food by 2020 but hawaii s agricultural economy is still dominated by crops grown for export hawaii s most valuable crop export seed corn has undergone a sharp decline with the value of the crop grown here dropping from almost 250 million in 2011 to 121 million in 2017 that s still more than twice the value of other cash crops like macadamia nuts and coffee of course to some the steep decline of hawaii s most controversial cash crop is a good trend hawaii has about 7 000 farms spread across the islands u s department of agriculture data show but most are small only about 3 of those farms had sales of 250 000 or more in 2017 the most recent year for which data are available behind seed crops are products like macadamia nuts cattle and coffee mostly speciality commodities but how to transform agriculture so the land can feed the people it really is about changing the systems that support agriculture to support local food production rather than sugar and pineapple ige told civil beat in february finally the military remains one of the biggest economic forces in hawaii as of 2014 uhero reported annual military spending of 6 7 billion made up almost 10 of state gdp and military personnel and families totaled almost 7 of the island s population the armed services don t just bring troops to hawaii they also spin off big government contracts which in turn create civilian jobs a case in point is the pearl harbor naval shipyard and its repair operations according to data cited in uhero s cluster study as of 2014 hawaii s biggest military contractor was bae systems which hires civilian workers to repair vessels at the shipyard the contract totaled 136 7 million in 2014 according to uhero and it s grown since then recent testimony before the hawaii legislature by a retired u s navy commander william clifford estimated the 2018 total at more like 180 million to 200 million former u s rep colleen hanabusa who served on the house armed services committee is a longtime supporter of the shipyard and its apprentice program as a way to train workers for well paying careers they almost are guaranteed a phenomenal job opportunity in an industry that continues to grow and challenge them hanabusa said in an interview contractors like bae bring hundreds of millions of dollars into the economy and the question is how to use the money to create well paying jobs especially for younger people our problem here is that we lose so many young people hanabusa said what s the action plan whether state and local government officials can play an effective role expanding and diversifying hawaii s economy remains to be seen the results of past efforts are mixed at best for example taxpayers are still paying for an ill fated tax credit program that aimed to make the islands a technology hub it created few lasting high tech success stories despite 1 billion paid out to startups as incentives perhaps more successful has been a motion picture incentive program that subsidizes hawaii based productions like television shows and movies the incentive supports a small army of production jobs however the program is expensive and requires continual expenditures producers and workers say hawaii has lost business because it limits total annual subsidies to 35 million mike mccartney acting director of the department of business economic development and tourism so far has outlined a high level strategy for growing the economy during an interview mccartney showed a whiteboard with an elaborate diagram explaining his vision producing more of the food and energy we consume here means we don t have to send our money elsewhere money spent to import food and energy is like water leaking from a barrel and the idea is to plug the barrel exporting food and renewable energy technology and expertise is like adding more water to the barrel mccartney said stewart yerton civil beat 2019 he pointed to the natural energy laboratory of hawaii authority a big island alternative energy incubator highlighted in uhero s cluster report as a productive asset the state can use but mccartney offered few details about the state s strategy sen glenn wakai chairman of the senate economic development committee said the state desperately needs an overall business plan like uhero wakai is bullish on fields like alternative energy and astronomy as well as aquaculture areas where he says hawaii has a competitive advantage but wakai also says hawaii s observatories on the big island for example need to do more to train and employ local residents absent local people being involved of course you re going to get pushback he said wakai said people need to be galvanized to understand the connection between creating high paying jobs and their ability to afford to live in hawaii but he said the state also needs a clear plan and people willing to step up and execute it who s responsible for it and what s the action plan he said until government leaders define that it s up to private companies like the carbon lighthouse and organizations like the elemental excelerator to grow hawaii s energy innovation sector to the elemental excelerator s lippert the government can help spawn growth by enhancing public education broadband telecommunication systems and multimodal transportation systems assets that can help all businesses and the community in general it s a question of building a sustainable economy in a place where regular working people can afford to live in order for people to be able to live in the nice places we re building and to live in the islands at all we re going to have to have higher paying jobs she said
federal minister for finance asad umar on monday said that there was no unbridgeable gap between pakistan and the international monetary fund amid brewing troubles among cabinet ministers over the adverse fallouts of an imf deal the finance minister gave the statement hours before prime minister imran khan called an urgent meeting of his economic team to finalise a strategy to deal with growing criticism against the government s economic policies the prime minister has not asked for anything new the minister said and added we have already developed one he wanted to know when we are going to release it he said and added had discussed it in the national assembly standing committee on finance the prime minister had directed umar to present an economic roadmap before the end of the week highlighting the benefits the countrymen would derive after passing through the painful phase sources in the finance ministry told the express tribune umar is already preparing an economic roadmap in consultation with the imf which has caused troubles for the government due to its adverse implications on the people the finance minister spoke with the media and his confidence suggested that the government was very near to signing a deal with the imf there is nothing left where i can see an unbridgeable gap between pakistan and the imf and we are at the landing stage the finance minister said while responding to a question about fulfilling remaining two major conditions of the imf in november last year talks between pakistan and the imf broke due to disagreement on the issues of exchange rate policy interest rates fiscal and taxation measures and quantum and sequencing of increase in electricity and gas prices since then the government had started increasing the interest rates and kept devaluing the rupee against the dollar which was aimed at coming to a point where a deal with imf could be struck but the issues of fiscal and taxation measures and an increase in electricity and gas tariffs remained unresolve sources said the key difference between pakistan and imf four months ago was on the timings of the corrective measures said umar and added that pakistan s position was that the past measures had started yielding results and the current account deficit had been largely contained responding to a question umar said that imf wanted pakistan to announce a new exchange rate regime and it would be done once the programme was finalized the finance minister said that he would be visiting washington at the end of the week to attend the world bank imf spring meetings the date of imf mission s visit to pakistan for a final round of negotiations would be decided on the sidelines of the spring meetings he said he however said that the size of the imf programme would be relatively small and its annual injection would not be more than 2 billion to 3 billion but the imf programme would open avenues for eurobond flotation and policy loans by the wb and the adb the last cabinet meeting held on march 26 was quite unusual as at least four cabinet ministers had serious differences over energy sector policies highly placed sources told the express tribune one energy minister there are two ministers each for petroleum and power division distanced himself from the recent increase in the gas prices as well as future plans to increase rates the sources maintained the energy minister observed that the decisions for his division were taken by others without taking him into confidence he also distanced himself from any further increase in the gas prices the sources added the sui northern gas pipelines limited sngpl and the sui southern gas company ssgc have forwarded petitions to the oil and gas regulatory authority ogra to increase up to 144 percent gas prices with effect from july the energy minister said that people would not accept any reason for increasing the almost 300pc price of gas after pakistan tehreek e insaf came into power at least two federal cabinet ministers severely opposed any further hike in gas prices saying that this would create troubles for both the government as well as for the consumers they were of the opinion that instead of protecting the interests of the gas companies the government should look after the interests of the people a federal minister who holds the portfolio of a division that looks after the work of infrastructure criticized the performance of the power division the sources said he was of the opinion that the measures taken by the power division would not solve the problems of the energy sector the federal minister went on to say that if disconnecting electricity connections and registering firs were the benchmarks then pakistan muslim league nawaz s khawaja asif had done a better job the minister was also of the view that the bureaucracy was misleading the cabinet during prime minister s last week interaction with media both petroleum division and power division ministers were missing there will be disagreement in the cabinet meetings and if there is no disagreement then it is not a cabinet meeting but a montessori classroom said the finance minister when he was asked to comment on the growing disagreement in the cabinet over economic policies in the last meeting too people expressed their views but once a decision is taken all the cabinet ministers own that umar said answering a question about cabinet endorsing the imf deal umar said that the cabinet had owned all the initiatives and supported them and there was no reason that it would not support the future actions of the government the finance minister was of the view that inflation had risen due to controlling the balance of payments crisis he said that the country was on the verge of bankruptcy and for that purpose the government had to take certain steps
in their 75 years of existence the twin institutions born at the bretton woods conference have undergone adaptation and transformation in response to the evolution of the world economy and the challenges it has posed to them morphing institutions the imf was created and continues to have as its primary function safeguarding international monetary stability but its functions and instruments changed as the international monetary system abandoned the regime of fixed and adjustable exchange rates in 1971 1973 international capital mobility expanded and the imf became a monitor of the world economy a crisis manager and a coordinator of programs for rescuing countries using the institution s resources the world bank in turn was established for the financing and technical support of investment projects in the reconstruction of countries devastated by the second world war and in developing countries over time as high income economies graduated and exited as clients it expanded the focus on the intermediation of concessional resources to low income economies however as financial globalization proceeded the share of world bank resources shrank relative to the global flows of private capital to developing economies the two institutions in addition to their role as sources of financing for countries with short term deficits and or long term financing needs in conjunction with regional development banks also started to operate in policy advice as a catalyst for financial flows and private investments as hubs of knowledge and data collection as well as with their advocacy and support in the provision of global public goods the twins were complemented by another post war institution the general agreement on tariffs and trade expanded and re established as the world trade organization wto in 1995 which provided a framework for promoting free trade based on rules and mechanisms of dispute resolution more recently three changes in the international order have imposed a new round of challenges to those institutions the emergence of new geo economic poles the prominence of nationalist policies in relation to multilateralism and fragmentation in the system of plurinational institutions new geo economic poles the emergence of new geo economic poles has brought a challenge to the governance structure of the twin institutions as the largest contributors of financial resources to them members shareholders from north america europe and japan maintained their domain while china s economic openness and the fall of the soviet empire made such institutions effectively global globalization has brought strong expansion and per capita income convergence in emerging economies especially china and other asian countries it has also brought about the deepening of interdependence in trade private capital flows and exposure to global systemic events with the interdependence and the reduction of the gap between those economies and major shareholders members the pretension to change that structure of governance also grew the perception that the performance of such institutions would inevitably reflect the predominant balance of power in their governance was reinforced by the resistance of major shareholders members to significant changes in voting and capital structures the perception of double standards in imf operations during the asian crises inflexible in the emphasis on fiscal adjustments considered unnecessary and in the eurozone when the imf accepted european pressure for financing greece despite the clear need to restructure its public debt was also strongly reinforced initiatives to build alternatives already occurred in the wake of the asian crisis the prolonged real devaluation of exchange rates by asian countries in addition to strengthening processes of export led manufacturing growth served to generate continuous current account surpluses and the accumulation of international reserves as a mechanism of self insurance in the same direction the chiang mai initiative sought to establish an agreement for sharing foreign exchange reserves for mutual support of balance of payments between countries in the region the creation of the new development bank and an arrangement for sharing foreign exchange reserves by brics as well as the asian infrastructure investment bank under china s leadership can be seen as a reaction to the perception of resistance to changes in governance and sizes of the bretton woods institutions along the same lines other regional institutions led by emerging economies the islamic development bank the andean development corporation and the eurasian development bank underwent capital increases nationalistic pressures another source of challenge comes from the recent prominence of nationalist pressures to the detriment of multilateralism in large shareholders members of the institutions the us option in the trump government for bilateralism and trade wars instead of the plurilateral trade negotiations of the obama era as well as brexit and the rise of anti immigration movements in continental europe reflected a perception that progress in emerging economies has been to the detriment of jobs in traditional sectors for a portion of the population in those countries this fueled pre existing tensions about development assistance through the twin bretton woods sisters in the imf s case despite the us congress s approval in 2015 of the quotas increases agreed in 2010 there has been a sharp decline in its stockpile as a proportion of external liabilities in the global economy on the side of the world bank it is no coincidence that the basis of donor country contributions in the last three year round of fundraising for ida s concessional finance windows was lower than in previous times a fact only disguised by permission granted to the agency to use the repayments of old loans and issue debt securities to expand its resource envelope in turn the capital increase agreement for the world bank s ibrd and ifc arms last year in addition to being small enough to avoid dilution of portions of major shareholders was stricken with targets of relative containment on lending flows to upper middle income countries such as china brazil mexico and others such a limitation tends to have two consequences in addition to the operations with these countries being a special source of transferable learning for the other client countries the ability of both ibrd and ifc to leverage their equity through the issuance of debt securities will lose the favorable risk return profile of operations with these countries the world bank s decline in terms of relative size tends to remain fragmentation of the plurinational system of institutions the fragmentation of the plurinational system of institutions is a third source of challenge for the twin sisters largely as a consequence of the previous two in addition to the multiple emergence of new development banks there has been a proliferation of vertical funds and competition from other funding and assistance channels by ngos foundations and private investors the proliferation and reinforcement of institutions and channels parallel to the bretton woods twins provided them with challenges in terms of resource allocation coordination and consistency on cross compliance requirements in their operations this challenge was amplified by the expansion of bilateral financing by emerging countries particularly china morphing into fragmentation the three sources of challenges tend to remain into the near future just remember that last year prior to the agreement on a deal of a capital increase package for ibrd and ifc future world bank president david malpass in a testimony to the us congress defended the graduation of china and other upper middle income countries in the ibrd as a pre condition for any capital increase the package finally agreed among shareholders already contemplated some containment strongly supported by other major shareholders like uk france and japan but now attention will move on to its implementation the us china confrontation around the 2019 meeting of the inter american development bank which should have taken place last month in chengdu china and was cancelled in the eve may have been a harbinger of a battleground ahead inside those institutions much attention shall also be dedicated to the fulfillment of commitments regarding climate change related operations included in the world bank capital package among development banks although examples of cooperation and co financing have been seen in specific projects the search for harmonization and convergence of standards tends to be hampered by the low tide of multilateralism difficulties to adjust financial resources available to the twin sisters should also remain they will have to mutate and adapt to operate in a context of institutional fragmentation and possible arm breaks between shareholders members to continue fulfilling their missions to be presented at 7ã me ã dition des dialogues stratã giques crise du multilatã ralisme et

yves here after the great job american financiers did in almost destroying the financial system and nearly taking down the global economy with it one has to wonder why making the world safe for big finance is such a priority one of the reasons i am skeptical is i had a ringside seat upon what happened in japan when the us forced japan to embrace extremely rapid bank deregulation in the 1980s similarly the world bank s international finance corporation has been working since the 1980s if not earlier to promote the creation of capital markets in emerging economies yet the last thing developing economies need is highly liquid markets they need sticky investments like foreign direct investment hot money inflows and outflows are destabilizing and on a higher level the model of mobile capital that the world bank keenly promotes is a lousy idea carmen reinhart s and ken rogoff s work on financial crises found that high levels of international capital flows are strongly correlated with frequent and severe financial crises by jomo kwame sundaram a former economics professor was assistant director general for economic and social development food and agriculture organization who received the wassily leontief prize for advancing the frontiers of economic thought in 2007 and anis chowdhury adjunct professor at western sydney university university of new south wales australia who held senior united nations positions in new york and bangkok originally published by inter press service the world bank has successfully legitimized the notion that private finance is the solution to pressing development and welfare concerns including achieving the sustainable development goals sdgs through agenda 2030 a recent mckinsey report estimates that the world needs to invest about us 3 3 trillion or 3 8 per cent of world output yearly in economic infrastructure with about three fifths in emerging market and other developing economies to maintain current growth the world financing gap is about us 350 billion yearly if new commitments such as the sdgs are considered the gap would be about thrice the currently estimated gap as available public resources alone are not enough thus for the bank the success of agenda 2030 depends on massive private sector participation maximizing finance the bank s maximizing finance for development mfd strategy marks a new stage it presumes that most developing countries cannot achieve the sdgs with their own limited fiscal resources and increasingly scarce donor overseas development assistance oda bank prioritization of financial inclusion presumes that fintech powered digital financial inclusion would increase growth create jobs and promote entrepreneurship in developing countries the mfd purports to respond to the g20 s april 2017 principles of mdbs strategy for crowding in private sector finance for growth and sustainable development the g20 has offered the roadmap to infrastructure as an asset class for energy transport and water inter alia the 2017 mfd strategy recycled the bank s 2015 billions to trillions transforming development finance arguing that mdbs should increase financial leverage via securitization to catalyse private investment thus promoting capital markets by transforming bankable projects into liquid securities the mfd presumes that public money should mainly be used to leverage private finance particularly institutional investments to finance the purported us 5 trillion sdg funding gap financialization coalition the mfd strategy seeks to enable financialization and transition to securities based financial systems in developing countries complementing other initiatives by the bank imf and g20 such initiatives are expected to encourage investors to use environmental social and governance criteria to attract mobilize and sustain needed financing the mfd presumes that public money should mainly be used to leverage private finance particularly institutional investments to finance the funding gap government guarantees are deemed necessary to de risk projects especially for public private partnerships ppps meanwhile the international finance corporation ifc a bank subsidiary is helping subsidize capital market involvement in infrastructure development the mfd strategy envisages capital markets in green bonds social impact bonds infrastructure bonds and so on securities markets are supposed to enable institutional investors to make desirable social and environmental impacts mfd advocates claim that capital markets provide new solutions to development challenges such as inadequate infrastructure and poor access to schooling clean water sanitation and housing the financial stability board has also proposed measures to transform shadow banking into securities based finance while the european commission s sustainable finance initiative seeks to similarly reorient institutional investors and asset managers cascading financialization the bank s cascade approach seeks to institutionalize this bias for private financing it seeks to facilitate securities lending by enabling repo market financing and hedging and rehypothecation i e allowing securities to be used repeatedly for new lending the cascade approach seeks to accelerate financialization with measures to accommodate new asset classes enable banks to engage in securities and derivatives markets with minimal regulation deregulate financial institutions creating tradable assets from ppp projects and facilitate capital flows ostensibly for development it presumes market imperfections and missing markets deter the private sector from financing sustainable development projects and proposes to address such bottlenecks by internalizing externalities and providing subsidies and guarantees to de risk investments tito cordella notes that it prioritizes private finance even when a project is likely to be profitable if undertaken with public funds he notes the tensions between maximizing private financing and optimizing financing for development and some implications public options are only to be considered after all private options are exhausted or fail thus the cascade approach presumes that the private sector is always more efficient despite actual experiences clearly it not only reflects an ideological preference for private finance but also seeks to promote securities and derivatives markets as market liquidity is among the core g20 principles of mdbs strategy for crowding in private sector finance hijacking development finance the strategy would thus commit scarce public resources to de risking such financing arrangements to transform bankable development projects into tradable assets this means that governments will bear more of the likely costs of greater financial fragility and crises such government measures will inadvertently undermine needed financial institutions such as development banks there is no reason to believe that mfd will somehow create the capital market infrastructure to improve finance for smes or needed development transformations once a project s future revenue streams are securitized the multilateral development banks environmental and social safeguards no longer apply contracts to repay securitized debt held by investors would be disconnected from the underlying project financed and its consequences holders of these securities have no incentives to prioritize social or environmental goals private equity and hedge funds that have short term incentives for profit taking including by asset stripping are not concerned with social environmental or other public interests not surprisingly considerable doubt exists as to whether private capital markets and institutional investors can be incentivized to finance long term public goods as these mechanisms serve the profit motive not public welfare
this article was first published 5 years ago the simultaneous decline of several trade related indicators should put policy makers on guard for a sharper slowdown illustration uttam ghosh rediff com financial year 2019 20 fy20 begins on a rather sombre note despite expectation of a rate cut by the reserve bank of india rbi and buoyancy in the equity markets various global and domestic factors are at play casting doubts on achieving a sustained and robust economic recovery global economic growth is expected to decelerate this year in a report issued two months earlier the international monetary fund estimated 3 7 per cent for 2018 as in the october 2018 world economic outlook forecast despite weaker performance in some economies notably europe and asia the global economy is projected to grow 3 5 per cent in 2019 and 3 6 per cent in 2020 respectively 0 2 and 0 1 percentage point below last october s projection the world bank said global economic growth would lessen to 2 9 per cent this year from a downwardly revised 3 per cent in 2018 citing rising downside risks to the outlook a world trade outlook indicator issued last month by the world trade organization wto says trade weakness is likely to extend into 2019 the simultaneous decline of several trade related indicators should put policy makers on guard for a sharper slowdown should current trade tensions remain unresolved says the report the rupee is around 69 to a dollar thanks to speculative inflow in the stock markets this could hurt export and encourage import however rbi is unlikely to intervene in the foreign exchange markets its stated policy is to act only for curbing excessive volatility so export is unlikely to accelerate this year and domestic producers might even see erosion of their pricing power the united states has alleged at the wto that our export promotion schemes are actually subsidies that should be abolished it appears the merchandise exports from india scheme meis will not survive the challenge at wto s dispute resolution process the government has said it is working on schemes compatible with the wto discipline the precise implications can be gauged only when details of these are known however the impact of possible meis withdrawal cannot be under estimated the us has served a notice to withdraw duty concessions it had extended to india under the generalised system of preferences our commerce ministry has downplayed the impact of the action arguing concessions worth only 190 million are at stake still it is likely to affect the export of price sensitive items the impact would be more if other developed countries follow suit domestic consumption is showing signs of revival with increased social sector spending however important job generating sectors such as automobiles and construction are not growing keeping in view the low inflation rate rbi might cut interest rates to boost domestic consumption and revive private sector investment however higher consumption might also mean more of import rather than significantly higher capacity utilisation by domestic industries it is more than likely that the government diverts more funds to enhance the capabilities of our armed forces thus cutting the allocations for infrastructure and the social sectors again this is likely to mean more import overall it is better not to get carried away by slogans of better days ahead
fed chairman jerome powell s decision in december to raise the federal funds target by 25 basis points to 2 25 2 50 percent and to continue raising rates at least twice in the new year upset financial markets the dow and s p each dropped at least 8 7 percent logging their worst december declines since 1931 it looked like the powell put was about to end however as criticism of the fed s tighter money policy mounted powell surprised markets early in the new year on january 4 he told several thousand economists at the american economic association meeting in atlanta we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves the call for patience was put into action on march 20th when the federal open market committee voted unanimously to maintain the fed s 2 25 2 50 target while signaling that 2019 would see no rate increases moreover details emerged on the fed s plan to halt its balance sheet unwind given this backdrop several issues need special attention as the fed reviews its formulation conduct and communication of monetary policy throughout 2019 the major conference at the chicago fed this june is just the place to be asking whether patience reliance on the dot plot as a communication tool and paying interest on excess reserves are the best we can do in trying to create macroeconomic stability without any credible long run rule to guide monetary policymakers there is still much uncertainty about future policy another crisis could prompt a new round of large scale asset purchases by the fed further intervention in credit markets and lower even negative interest rates meanwhile the fed s new operating system provides a backstop for the fed to absorb government debt without any apparent short run inflation consequence tempting congress to delegate fiscal authority to the fed to understand why inflation has remained low and stable even as the fed experimented with near zero policy rates and three rounds of quantitative easing i e large scale asset purchases requires knowledge of the new operating system which became fully operational in 2015 under the new system the fed uses interest on excess reserves and overnight reverse repos to administratively set a range for the fed funds rate in doing so the fed has divorced the size of its balance sheet from its policy interest rate target prior to 2008 banks had little incentive to hold excess reserves rather than lend them out however when the fed began to pay interest on excess reserves in october 2008 banks rapidly increased their balances at the fed especially when the interest rate on reserves exceeded the opportunity cost of holding those reserves at the fed the strong demand for reserves stymied the normal monetary transmission mechanism that had operated up to then hence the fed s large scale asset purchases increased the monetary base but did not lead to an excessive growth of broader monetary aggregates or runaway inflation today the fed continues to hold a large portfolio of longer term treasuries and mortgage backed securities and interest rates are still low historically in 2000 the real i e inflation adjusted fed funds rate was 4 percent now it is 0 25 percent in this sense the stance of monetary policy is extremely stimulative according to greg ip by promising to hold rates lower for longer and to maintain the size of its massive balance sheet the fed continues to signal that a primary goal of policy is to support asset prices and encourage risk taking yet neither objective is found in section 2a of the federal reserve act which states the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the federal open market committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy s long run potential to increase production so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates fed officials need to consider what vincent reinhart chief economist and macro strategist at mellon investments calls the normative issue of the appropriateness of a large and lingering fed footprint in markets in a forthcoming article in the cato journal he argues the revealed preference of policymakers is that they do not have sufficient confidence in market mechanisms or respect for the role of risk in directing the efficient allocation of resources a healthier respect for both would place stricter limits on the extent to which a central bank leans against financial market volatility than was the case the problem is that the precedent lowers the bar for future intervention and leaves the fed operating under too large an ambit in our market economy a promise of patience is not a substitute for a credible long run monetary rule in bringing about macroeconomic stability and reducing regime uncertainty policymakers need to recognize the limits of monetary policy in generating economic growth protect the long run purchasing power of the dollar and let markets determine the allocation of credit the lack of any systematic policy rule to guide long run decisions has increased regime uncertainty policymakers err by paying too much attention to short run remedies and too little attention to the long run consequences of current decisions a rules based approach to monetary policymaking needs to be part of the discussion at the fed s june meeting the case for rules versus discretion in the conduct of money policy was well stated by karl brunner a cofounder of the shadow open market committee in 1980 we suffer neither under total ignorance nor do we enjoy full knowledge our life moves in a grey zone of partial knowledge and partial ignorance a nonactivist regime emerges as the safest strategy it does not assure us that economic fluctuations will be avoided but it will assure us that monetary policymaking does not impose additional uncertainties on the market place when chairman powell meets with his colleagues in june he should recall brunner s advice and consider that while patience is a good virtue when roaming in the dark it is not a good rule to reduce regime uncertainty the fed s dot plot which is part of the summary of economic projections sep issued at each fomc meeting since october 2007 has been highly unreliable because of its subjective nature and the misunderstanding of its intended use there is

twenty years ago on january 1 1999 the euro was launched with the highest of political and economic expectations today its twentieth anniversary is being commemorated amid deep disappointment at its economic and political results both dismal this has to raise questions anew as to whether the euro might have been fatally flawed from the start it also has to raise doubts as to whether the euro is likely to survive the next global economic downturn high hopes the euro s architects had high hopes that its launch would substantially improve europe s economic prospects by minimizing transactions costs it was hoped that the introduction of a single currency would promote intra european trade it was also hoped that by increasing competition among member states the euro would force countries in the eurozone s periphery to radically reform their sclerotic economies beyond providing economic advantages the euro s architects hoped that it would promote deeper european political integration and institution building they also hoped that it would constitute a challenge to the u s dollar s dominance as the world s international reserve currency disappointing economic results it would be an understatement to say that the euro has not delivered on its economic promises especially since the 2008 lehman crisis whereas over the past decade the u s economy has grown by some 15 percent the overall eurozone economy has barely recovered its precrisis 2008 peak level meanwhile far from narrowing the economic disparity between the eurozone s prosperous north and its sclerotic south those disparities have increased as an example while germany s economy is now some 10 percent above its pre 2008 crisis peak the italian economy remains around 5 percent below that peak this is not to mention the greek economy which is barely recovering from an economic depression that has been worse in both severity and duration than that experienced by the united states in the 1930s the euro has also failed to deliver on its founders lofty hopes that it would in time supplant the u s dollar as the world s international reserve currency in reflection of the euro s poor economic and political performance as well as of the eurozone sovereign debt crisis twenty years after its launch the euro constitutes only 20 percent of the world s international reserves that is a level little changed from that prevailing at its launch increased political disunity as to the hope that the euro project might have promoted political unity and harmony it would seem that it has done just the opposite those countries in the eurozone s economic periphery deeply resent the austerity that has been imposed on them by the prosperous north in general and by germany in particular they blame that austerity for their poor economic performance and their high unemployment levels at the same time those countries in the prosperous north have grown increasingly resentful of having had to bail out a european economic periphery that they believe has been too slow to reform its errant economic ways more disturbing yet especially since 2008 europe s poor economic performance has undermined public confidence in europe s political elite thereby contributing to a wave of populism across the continent a recent example of this populist trend has been the coming to power of the five star movement and the league in italy as well as the presentation by that government of an expansive budget that has put it on a collision course with its european partners other examples have been the rise of the yellow vest movement in france the plunge in french president emmanuel macron s poll ratings and the fact that in the first round of last year s french presidential elections around 50 percent of the votes were cast for candidates on the extreme left and the extreme right of the political spectrum equally troubling for the euro s longer run outlook have been recent german political developments that have to cast serious doubt on that country s continued willingness to bail out as needed countries in the eurozone periphery with the rise of the alternative für deutschland party and with the rightward shift in the christian democratic party angela merkel who was so central to keeping the euro together during the eurozone sovereign debt crisis would now seem to be a spent political force fundamental flaws in the run up to the euro s 1999 launch american economists like milton friedman and martin feldstein presciently warned of the great risks of attempting economic union before attaining political union they also noted that the eurozone was not an optimum currency area especially in the sense that it lacked the labor mobility the wage flexibility or the centralized fiscal authority to make it work over the past decade the eurozone s experience has also underlined the inevitable tensions that would rise from locking together in a monetary union a country like italy that is characterized by a poor productivity record with a productivity powerhouse like germany without the ability within the euro to regain competitiveness through currency devaluation italy was bound to progressively lose competitiveness to germany that in turn was bound to result in highly disparate economic performance between those two countries the fundamental flaws in the euro currency arrangement which became all too apparent during the eurozone sovereign debt crisis have been papered over to date by the forceful action of the european central bank in mid 2012 at the peak of the crisis the ecb declared that it would do whatever it takes to keep the euro from failing it backed up this statement by action first by the introduction of an outright monetary transaction program and then by a massive round of quantitative easing that saw a us 3 trillion expansion in the size of the ecb s balance sheet the need to reform sadly the eurozone has been very slow to make those institutional changes to the euro s architecture that might have placed the single currency on a sound longrun footing these shortcomings are most apparent in the failure to complete the eurozone s banking union by establishing a common deposit insurance scheme in the absence of a fiscal union with a common eurozone budget and in the failure to enhance the eurozone s crisis fighting instruments for the contingency that a large eurozone country such as italy might face another sovereign debt crisis more serious yet has been the failure of a number of countries in the eurozone periphery and most disturbingly italy to take advantage of a favorable global economic and liquidity environment to reform their economies or to reduce their excessively high public debt levels this leaves those economies very vulnerable to another round of the sovereign debt crisis in the event of a global economic recession this would seem to be particularly the case now that the ecb has ended its bond buying program and now that german political resistance is growing to any future bailout programs for countries in the eurozone periphery in 1999 had the euro s architects known as we know today how troubling the eurozone s economic and political performance would have been over the subsequent two decades it is doubtful whether they would have launched the single currency with the eurozone s populist trend firmly in place with the world economy slowing and with the coming to an end of the era of ultra easy global liquidity there is strong reason to doubt whether the euro will make it in its present form to its next ten year anniversary

re discussing the steel industry i m your host nick sciple and today i m joined by motley fool contributor jason hall via skype how are you doing jason jason hall go braves i m just going to start with that sciple hey it s opening day baseball is in the air spring is coming shorts weather is around the corner it s exciting masters weekend is going to be here before we know it really excited to see the start of baseball season what do you think about the braves chances this season jason hall i have to say i m going to give a shout out to my good friend and former fool colleague john erik koslosky who s a big phillies fan the braves are starting off the season in philadelphia we might have a wager over some adult beverages over the outcome of this first series honestly i don t feel super confident the braves are starting a guy that nobody expected would even be with the team as their opening day starter then they ve got two rookies starting over the weekend so eh we ll just leave it at that let s talk about steel i m a little more comfortable talking about steel to start the baseball season off sciple yeah long season 162 games with the first series we ll see how it plays out definitely exciting jason you mentioned we re going to be talking about steel today looking back at the last year at steel tariffs talking about one of our favorite investments that happens to be in the steel industry first jason we just can t seem to get away from airline news last time you were on the show boeing had just been forced to ground its 737 max plane worldwide today we have another set of planes being grounded that has caused a lot of stress to travelers worldwide can you tell us about this latest piece of news and what it means hall i was having my morning coffee and just perusing the headlines and saw that wow air a small privately held airline based out of iceland it s a really unique low cost budget operator they fly transatlantic flights and they go through iceland to europe and back into the u s that sort of thing i actually flew on wow air a few years ago they just ceased operations when i say ceased operations i don t mean they said hey we re going to stop flying in a week if you bought a ticket after that we re going to give you your money back no people are at the airport and there s not a plane for them to get on over a thousand passengers stranded and people just stuck it s ugly it s really ugly sciple yeah crazy news from just reading a little bit in the articles it looks like the company had been trying to negotiate with bondholders to maintain some liquidity didn t work out they had to ground all their planes the ceo came out saying we wish we could have gotten this handled maybe we waited too long it sounds like the company may be done for after today really feel bad for these passengers it s been a rough month for the airline industry all around something to be mindful of and something to keep watching going forward jason for our main story today we re going to talk about the steel industry off the top of the show the first half of the show i want to do a look back over the past year what s gone on in steel march 8 2018 just a little bit over a year ago president trump levied a 25 tariff on imported steel into the u s the goal of that tariff was to bolster the domestic steel industry that had lost 35 of its size over the past 20 years or so it raised a lot of controversy trump s national economic council chairman resigned we had lots of retaliatory actions from other countries jason as we look back on these tariffs a year later what if anything can we say about their effectiveness and whether they ve accomplished what president trump set out to do when he put them in place hall i think the first thing to understand is the context from the perspective of the steel industry what they were looking for versus how it was sold to the american public in general there was this idea that it would be good for steelmakers because they would hire a bunch of people steelmakers pay pretty good wages so it would create a bunch of jobs the reality is it has been very good for the steel industry for steelmakers here s a sampling of some of the biggest steelmakers nucor steel dynamics ak steel u s steel pretty much across the board they ve all seen their gross margins increase sharply over the past year they ve generally seen free cash flows improved they ve seen cash from operations get better so it certainly made the steel industry much healthier from a financial perspective what it really hasn t done is create a lot of jobs that s twofold first of all a lot of the more modern steel industry is a little more automated doesn t require as much manual labor for these steelmakers they ve been able to increase production without necessarily having to add a tremendous amount of workers sciple it s really been good for the steel industry in the u s as you mentioned the u s saw its highest capacity utilization rate of its steel factories since 2008 about 78 but what we have seen jason you mentioned this before the show there was a disconnect between what folks might have thought would have happened and what the steel companies were maybe looking for we actually saw the trade deficit in steel balloon last year by over 1 billion we had fewer inputs coming into the country but the exports that our producers lost on a dollar basis lost out however it was a huge decline in imports from overseas which is really what the tariffs were designed to do jason can you talk about that disconnect between what the steelmakers were looking for versus what we got from a trade deficit point of view and what that means hall absolutely i think it s important to understand the premise of the tariffs we actually have to go back to under the obama administration the steel industry has been screaming for years and years that a tremendous amount of steel that was being imported into the united states was being illegally subsidized by countries like china india turkey a few others they were creating an artificial price that made it very difficult for a lot of americans steelmakers to compete against and it s a violation of international trade law that they were doing this what the steel industry was simply looking to do was to drive this anti competitive steel out of the u s market and cause prices to increase if you look at what s happened that s exactly what s happened so on a dollar basis yeah the trade deficit maybe hasn t improved but the u s steel industry wasn t looking to increase the amount of steel it was sending out of the united states it simply wanted to keep a large amount of imported steel out of the u s so that it could take back that market share that it was losing to a large extent a lot of it was illegally subsidized now obviously the trump administration passed much broader tariffs than anyone expected a lot of those tariffs aren t necessarily against steel that a lot of people think is really truly being subsidized and is really anti competitive so on a dollar basis yeah the trade deficit didn t really improve but if you look on a volume basis because steel prices have increased so much over the past year there s a lot more domestic steel that s being consumed vs imported steel that s being consumed that s where the big win for the u s steelmakers is if you look at the capacity utilization steelmakers used over 78 of their steelmaking capacity last year that s the highest it s been in a decade since basically right at the peak before the global financial crisis and great recession happened a decade ago sciple sure so basically the takeaway there is depending on how you want to look at it the tariffs have really accomplished their goal of getting foreign steel off the market allowing some breathing space for some u s steel producers we ll talk on the second half of the show how that has led to some investments from u s steel producers related to that from nucor specifically in the past year or so we ve gotten all this supply off the market as we start looking forward to maybe these tariffs rolling off or those sorts of things can we take any signals from the past year as to where the industry is going to go forward or do we just have to look at this past year as an outlier because of the effects that tariffs had on the market and those sorts of things hall i think you have to be really careful with any of these short term near term predictions the reality with the steel industry is that it can be viciously cyclical these steelmakers tend to have very high fixed operating costs their floor they have to produce at least that amount of steel simply to cover their basic expenses they can be very profitable above that but if they slip a little bit below that they can very quickly go from turning a modest or a really nice profit to losses within a quarter or two and you don t see it coming with that caveat i think if you look at what you re hearing from u s steel that s talking about revitalizing and reactivating a lot of blast furnaces in different facilities that it s idled over the past decade you look at nucor and all these greenfield investments they re making in building new steel mills in kentucky and in florida the industry is saying we re in growth mode because we have an opportunity now to build out these assets to meet higher demand for steel that we re going to make in the united states that s a healthy signal at least in terms of the long term that these steelmakers say we can make money in this environment if it persists sciple sure we have the tariffs things that overhang those could roll off and change the market there s another wild card out there that we ve seen talked about for a couple of years that s maybe gaining a little bit of traction that s an infrastructure bill coming out of congress we had vice president pence recently say to u s governors that we re going to get that bill passed in the next year if that were to take place trump campaigned on a 1 5 trillion infrastructure package that would obviously be bullish for steel again as you mentioned jason really tough to track these cycles there is currently a global oversupply of around 600 million tons according to the organization for economic cooperation and development that oversupply makes it really difficult to ride the cycle we ll talk about this on the back half of the show because of that what really differentiates these steelmakers is their ability in capital allocation being able to maintain their operations throughout the cycle and make prudent investments when the cycle is advantageous to them when you look at steelmakers how important to you is their capital allocation ability is that the no 1 thing you look at when you look at these businesses hall there s two things and it s kind of a 1a and 1b when it comes to steelmaking capital allocation obviously is critically important because the business is very cyclical if a company leverages itself too much making an acquisition or investing a substantial amount of capital in a new plan and it takes two or three years to build that new plan before it can get any return those are things that can really be problematic u s steel for example has taken a beating because of some bad timing on some acquisitions that have financially handcuffed the company the other part of it is low cost operations and having operations that you can be as variable in your cost structure as possible again because of the cyclical nature if you have a cost structure for your operations that maybe you re not as super profitable at the peak of volume but you have the ability to lower costs more quickly when demand weakens that s a real durable competitive advantage in the steel market the companies that make for good investments in steel are the ones that can at least tread water when the market goes to a downturn and have financial strength to make smart acquisitions when everybody else is weak sciple jason on the second half of the show we re going to talk about our favorite steel investment and really one of our favorite investments in the industrial space that s nucor jason before we dive too deep into nucor you mentioned just a second ago how important capital allocation is and how important low cost production is for a business what does nucor have that checks those boxes for you and makes it stand out as a steel investment folks should really pay attention to hall if you look at the company s history nucor s interesting it s not like some of the other big steelmakers that have been around for a century and they still have foundries that are based on the legacy way we ve been making the steel for hundreds of years the company started off in the nuclear business then they started making this transition into steel management made the decision to focus on buying recycled scrap and using electric arc mini mills to take that scrap and reproduce new steel from it the benefit of this mini mill strategy is a variable cost structure you also tend to require less employees per ton of steel that you produce by starting with that foundation of the mini mills that give you that variable cost structure an ability to ramp up and ramp down production more quickly than with a traditional foundry nucor is set up to be a real leader in riding out the ups and downs of the market they ve proven the ability to be able to do that how that s paid off is through the ceos that have been in charge of the company john ferriola is the current ceo his predecessor was the ceo for a couple of decades ferriola has been at the company for about 30 years they re very steeped in understanding the industry really well but the key is that starting with that operational structure being able to take advantage of the swings in the cycle to allocate capital to fund great opportunities for growth when the cycle is weak when the steel industry is down there are a lot of opportunities to buy assets sometimes at fire sale prices when you have another steel producer that s really struggling the opportunity to buy those assets at low multiples for their cash flow generating capacity over the past decade nucor has spent 8 billion or 9 billion and a lot of that has been bolt on acquisitions of expanding their capacities into other kinds of steel that they don t necessarily do well or they have a lot of business in now they ve added to their ability to buy scrap which lowers their input costs all of these little bolt on things through smart capital allocation have allowed it to continue to get bigger and bigger while its competitors were still struggling just to make it through it s really really paid off sciple right you talk about nucor they have the best balance sheet in the sector they also have from a technological point of view you mentioned these mini mills that can really adjust through the cycle they require less headcount you compare that to a company like u s steel that still uses traditional blast furnaces they re not as nimble as the cycle changes as well as they don t have as healthy of a balance sheet which has prevented them as we talked about before the show from making investments like nucor has into these mini mills to maybe transition their production capacity into something that maybe is more flexible with the market nucor has positioned themselves from a balance sheet point of view from the assets they have from their mills as well as as you mentioned john ferriola and their management to really be in a position to continue to have success in the steel market moving forward i want to talk about jason specifically how nucor lays out their capital allocation strategy they put it out straight for you in the 10 k they have a three legged stool they look at they want to invest in the business for profitable long term growth they want to reward shareholders with dividends and they want to repurchase shares when they are attractive in the market going through these one by one let s talk first about how they re investing their money you mentioned over the past several years they ve invested many billions of dollars in acquisitions to bring new businesses into nucor however they have recently shifted that strategy to doing more greenfield investments themselves can you talk about what s behind that transition in strategy for nucor and what they re doing moving forward with those investments hall it s interesting if you follow the steel industry over time nucor s capital allocation strategy actually is an interesting barometer that you can use to judge the health to a certain extent of the industry when nucor is buying other steelmakers or steelmaking assets the industry is generally probably struggling a little bit because it s able to buy those assets for better multiples and get accretive returns in other words it can spend 500 million to buy this distributor today and it will start adding to its cash flows pretty much as soon as it integrates into the business there s a big benefit in terms of per share value for shareholders for acquisitions when you can buy them cheaply about a year ago nucor started changing that strategy and started announcing these new projects it s building a couple of facilities in florida it just announced i think it was just yesterday one of its biggest single greenfield projects in a very long time 1 35 billion to build a new mill in kentucky it s going to take about three years to kick in here s the other side of it having shifted to these greenfield investments these take a long time the one announced yesterday i think it said it would begin operation in 2022 you re talking about three plus years before this 1 35 billion it s going to spend is going to start generating any returns that says right there that the price that it would have to pay to buy somebody else s steel mill is just too high to even consider buying it even getting the benefit of that accretive potential return i think that s a really good indicator where we are right now the steel industry is pretty healthy and the multiples are high enough that s why for the past year nucor says we re just going to build our own projects we ll get a better return sciple sure whenever they first announced their intentions to pursue this big 1 3 billion investment in a new facility you mentioned ceo john ferriola he said on a call with analysts that part of the reason they re making this investment has to do with some of the trade actions that have taken place he said from the look of the trade actions that we ve been so successful in bringing against violators in the plate steel market they make plate steel at this new factory in kentucky we have confidence that the trade remedies give us better long term protection and we re confident that not only that import levels today are down substantially they re confident that those levels are going to continue to remain low in the future allowing nucor s new plant that they re bringing into production to fill that gap of where those imports have left it s a testament to we have one of the best capital allocators in the steel industry saying hey these tariffs have worked we expect them to continue to work we re allocating capital on reliance on those continuing to work i think that s something powerful to notice for investors hall let me add something to that that i think is important to note too if you look at the kinds of investments that nucor makes it s not just buying more volume in a certain category the company has identified where the demand is going to be for example the u s energy industry has exploded over the past half decade there s a lot of steel that s consumed by that industry nucor has done a really good job of building out capacity for the things that the steel industry wants to consume in terms of steel and also geographically putting that capacity close to the industry the kentucky steel mill is a good example it s going to be producing a plate that it s going to have access to logistics to get it to where the end demand is that s a cost advantage transportation of steel is expensive it s not just that they buy it s what and where they buy and where they build it s really impressive sciple sure the other acquisitions that they ve been making obviously this new plan is a greenfield acquisition but over the past couple of years you mentioned they ve been making some acquisitions they ve been moving further down the value chain buying more value added steel products over the past three years the company has invested over 3 billion in building out its tubular products division acquired four or five different businesses so they could vertically integrate a lot of those businesses my girlfriend worked for one of the companies that was acquired they bring these companies in really are able to change the culture bring costs down integrate them into the greater part of the nucor ecosystem a lot of these acquisitions too were using nucor steel as their input so obviously when nucor acquires these the cost of that steel go straight to the margin for nucor there really some exciting moves that they ve made to position the company going forward now jason let s talk a little bit about the dividend nucor i believe it s a dividend aristocrat it s been paying out dividends consistently since i believe the 1970s yielding 2 8 today when you look at that dividend how attractive is nucor to you if you re a dividend growth investor looking for a reliable company that s going to continue paying out year over year hall i think it s interesting i think nucor is pushing 55 years of consecutive growth of its regular dividend there s a caveat i want to put in here if you actually go back to the global financial crisis timeframe and look at a chart showing the dividends paid you ll actually see nucor s dividend dropped that s because it was paying a special dividend that s something they ll occasionally do is pay a special dividend it s kind of a here you go so if you look at the chart it looks like the dividend dropped at some point but the regular dividend what they say they re going to pay every single quarter has gone up modestly every year for like 55 years at this point now i will say this if you re looking for a stock that s going to grow its dividend pretty sharply these are pretty modest increases but it s definitely enough to keep you ahead of inflation i think there s definitely some real value there the thing is when it comes to the steel industry if you want to exposure to for example the infrastructure we re talking about that s not just in the u s there s going to be a big global demand for steel for infrastructure i think over the next decade a lot of that excess capacity is going to get soaked up by demand in other parts of the world that s healthy for nucor and the u s for that to happen then you have the energy industry with big demand the auto business a lot of domestic production has been added over the past decade nucor s shifted volumes to produce steel for the applications in that area as well i think that dividend again it s going to be locked in it s going to be safe but i wouldn t count on it for super hyper growth i think that s really important sciple sure yeah last thing on the safety of the dividend over the past three years they ve averaged about 28 of their operating cash flow to be paid out obviously that means they ve got lots of extra cash pretty well covered dividend something to watch out for let s talk about that third leg of nucor s capital allocation stool and that is opportunistically repurchasing shares when their cash position is strong relative to the growth opportunities what does that mean that means when with the cash on hand they can get a better rate of return buying their own stock vs investing in new greenfield development in the past year nucor rolled out a new 2 billion repurchase program in september they repurchased 854 million of stock in 2018 at an average price of 60 19 it s trading today at 57 50 jason as you look at these repurchases the stock is down from where they bought it however it is exciting to see the business repurchasing there what are your thoughts as you look at these repurchases particularly over the past year hall to me when you have somebody like ferriola who has a clearly good track record of capital allocation with acquisitions with investments and building out new assets it s hard to question the stock is down 15 or so over the past year whether or not those are smart moves i think it s reasonable there was a period of time where the company was transitioning from planning out some greenfield investments and not really identifying any acquisition opportunities taking that excess capital and investing it putting it toward buying back shares has certainly made sense i think they still have 1 billion or maybe more on their approved i m not sure what the total board amount is sciple 1 5 billion hall 1 5 billion so they have a pretty substantial amount of money that s sitting out there that s approved to be able to buy back shares i think again you have a ceo that s proven that he s going to put the money where it s going to be most effective to generate per share returns generally we can say stock buybacks ceos suck at it they re just not good at it but when you have somebody good at capital allocation you give them the benefit of the doubt sciple right we re going to look at whether these stock repurchases were intelligent not over the six months since they were put in place but really over the next five or 10 years when you look at the cycle of the steel industry it s not a one year cycle it s a multi year cycle we have to trust that ferriola has really proven over time that he has a strong track record of capital allocation i don t think he s magically lost those skills in the past year i think as we look forward these repurchases are going to look more prudent over time jason we ve talked about nucor s capital allocation strategy how they have some structural advantages from the nature of their mills and how they use recycled scrap to make their steel their management has a really strong track record in capital allocation as you look out over the next steel cycle the next five years or so if you re an investor who takes a position in nucor what should you be really paying attention to with this business looking forward hall i think you want to look at their operating ratio of their mills what is that percentage are they still in the 90s are they consistently in the 90 percentile in terms of keeping their steel mills running that s a really major thing to follow that tells you the health of the industry itself i think you want to focus on that a couple of things that you can look to measure again you can t look at it from quarter to quarter but look at it over a year or two year period look at return on invested capital look at return on assets to see if nucor is continuing to deliver the kind of returns that it has historically historically this is a company that s returned through the cycle 16 to 20 return on invested capital if you compare that to somebody like u s steel over the past decade they ve spent a lot of time with negative returns on capital so i think that s a really important thing one thing that s important to see because of this transition to these greenfield investments those return numbers are probably going to drop it s going to spend capital that s going to take two three four five years in some cases to really fully start generating anticipated cash flows that s an important thing to remember for me the biggest signal with a company like nucor as long as you continue to see the high operating rates you continue to see above industry average returns if the steel industry goes into a down cycle and the stock drops again as long as the other things continue to look above average that becomes a buying opportunity because it is a cyclical business and the best time to buy is on the downside of the cycle you get the best prices you get the biggest gains on the upswing sciple sure following up on that jason we ve looked over the past year and really the entire steel industry we mentioned has seen some big bumps from tariffs really all their operating metrics have been up however shares have been flat to down i think u s steel is down 50 nucor is down 15 or so as you look at that obviously the market thinks the steel industry is not going to maintain that growth maybe we re about to turn over into the bottom half of the cycle as you look at the way things are trending from that perspective is nucor a buy today or is it something where we want to wait for that cycle that the market is starting to price in starting to turn over to wait for that actually to come into fruition to create a better buying opportunity what do you think hall if you go back to march 1st of last year the beginning of the tariffs nucor s stock is down 15 since that day it peaked after the tariff announcement it s down 17 from its high over the past year everybody else is down 30 to 60 the market is clearly saying we re concerned about the fact that interest rates have gone up these companies use a lot of debt that affects their costs we re concerned about macroeconomic concerns we re concerned that the yield curve inverted or whatever there s all these signals that say that a recession is imminent and yeah a recession is imminent it s always imminent we just don t know if it s going to be next quarter next year or five years from now with all of those things baked in i think if you look on a valuation basis we re talking about single digit price to earnings for the projections for 2019 earnings it s certainly cheap again if we don t see the collapse of the cycle and again i would say if you like nucor if you like the idea of owning the best steelmaker this isn t one that you throw all your money at one time you buy it and then you never buy it again i think now is as good a time as any to buy it if we do hit that the cyclical downturn you just need to have some dry powder so you can take advantage of that weakness and buy more if that makes sense sciple yeah i think if you re going to look in the steel industry i think you look at nucor and that s it i don t think i could make a case for investing in ak steel or u s steel steel dynamics you can make an argument they re in that same mini mill industry nucor is in however the track record of the management i think makes nucor stand out a little bit but if you want to be invested in the steel industry if you want some exposure to this infrastructure push that is going to have to happen sooner or later on a global scale i think nucor is the way to go they really have a strong track record have the right assets to ride throughout the cycle a strong balance sheet really really a great business again it s one of those if you buy at the wrong time in the cycle you might have a bad time at least in the near term with your investment but it s one of the few steelmakers you can buy and if you re going to hold it for the long term it s going to work well for you hall i think the only exception to that is if you bought nucor in like 2008 it was right at the peak it s still actually still down from that point but think about it you re talking about buying it right before the worst financial crisis in almost a century at this point so that s the one exception to that but i think you buy right now you look back 10 years from now i would be stunned if investors did not make money there s no doubt about that sciple awesome really exciting company i think all our listeners should add it to their watchlist and really pay attention to it even you don t invest it s a good way to track like jason said the way they allocate their capital is a good signal for folks about where we might be in the cycle particularly the industrial cycle that nucor operates in jason thanks so much for coming on the show i m going to let you get to your tv watch some braves baseball and enjoy the opening day thanks for joining us looking forward to having you on again soon hall fool on go braves sciple awesome as always people on the program may own companies discussed on the

recently the world steel association wsa has revised the october 2018 forecasts of country wise steel consumption and these figures are being formally announced in april 2019 meeting the global demand for finished steel at 1 711 6 mt in 2018 is slated to reach 1 734 mt 1 3 and 1 750 mt in 2020 the volume growth in steel consumption during 2018 was 54 mt and the anticipated growth in consumption for the current year is around 53 mt this growth in global demand would originate largely from the asian region in such a manner that the demand in asia forms 69 of the total global steel consumption in 2019 in asia the revision in china s demand growth has made all the difference it is felt that falling gdp growth in china resulting from consumption led growth as opposed to the investment led one would not decrease steel consumption thus it has been estimated that chinese demand for steel in 2018 has increased by 54 mt from the substantial investment in real estate that has boosted steel demand india has been projected to consume 96 mt of steel in 2018 which would rise up to 102 8 mt in the current year and would grow up to 110 2 mt in 2020 the latest steel demand estimates for india are not much of a revision of the earlier ones made in october 2018 infrastructure growth would continue to remain india s primary driver of demand for the commodity in the next few years slowdown in the pace of construction in roads rail and metro rail connectivity dedicated freight corridors industrial corridors upgradation of existing major airports and the construction of minor ones ports upgradation and mechanisation shipbuilding rural and urban infrastructure real estate etc in the next few months would imply a hindrance to the projected demand volume of steel for a short period and then picking up the pace again this feature has been a regular phenomenon in the economic growth of many countries this only implies that the incremental consumption growth of 14mt of finished steel in the next two years may not follow a uniform pattern of growth this may overshoot if the pace of construction is speeded up after the election process completes indian economy is exhibiting a substantial growth and it is heartening that gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of gdp current prices has moved up to 29 in april december 2018 from 28 7 in the corresponding period of last year india is however facing a wider current account deficit at 16 9 billion at the end of the third quarter of fy19 that stands at 2 6 of gdp though the net foreign direct investment rose to 7 5 billion in q3 the portfolio investment recorded a net outflow of 2 1 billion along with the depletion of foreign exchange reserve in q3 the global financial scenario is uncertain with renewed efforts by the us to cut down its trade deficit with china the stimulus measures in china usa and japan are providing more capital investment for capacity building this is also pushing up exports india needs to monitor its steady import growth steel imports during the first 11 months at 8 03 mt is 2 5 more than the previous year while steel exports during the period at 7 77 mt is much lower at 27 2 compared to the previous year wsa report summarises a country wise assessment of steel intensity of gdp arrived at by dividing the apparent steel usage volume by millions of real gdp in us dollar according to this at an average 59 6 china continues to have the highest steel intensity in gdp other than vietnam a country with poor gdp level and is much above the global average of 20 7 south korea has 34 9 turkey has 31 2 and russia has 29 0 india with average 36 5 steel intensity has to enhance consumption to reap the benefits of higher gdp growth in the coming years based on the estimated demand figures for 2019 and 2020 it has been estimated that per capita steel consumption in india is likely to exceed 75 kg by 2019 this is against the global average of 225 kg and chinese figure of 594 kg the current steel making capacity in the world has been assessed by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd at 2 234 billion tonnes by december 2018 a marginal reduction from the previous year with global crude steel production at 1 818 tonne in 2018 the current capacity utilisation stands at 81 4 which is quite respectable and minimises the adverse implications of excess capacity the oecd estimates also indicate about 88 mt of fresh capacities involving 107 proposals are planned to be activated asian region holds the maximum 61 of the total of these followed by west asia a region in the midst of geo political uncertainty the global steel market is seized with trade uncertainty fuelled by the us china conflict europe is not immune to steel imports diverted from the us market with internal demand showing little signs of upward movement while india needs to enhance its steel exports meeting the domestic demand should be the basic determinant of capacity augmentation efforts source financial express

to determine the kind of europe that should evolve especially as the continent encounters chinese direct investment opportunities through beijing s belt and road initiative bri bilateral trade between china and italy hit a record 54 23 billion in 2018 and the rome beijing agreement last week will undoubtedly expand this figure in 2019 europe is revaluating its options concerning international commerce in total xi and his italian counterparts completed 29 deals worth approximately 2 8 billion in the sectors of agriculture finance and energy and secured additional access to chinese markets for italian energy and engineering firms the china communications construction company cccc will also develop and manage italy s largest port in genoa and attempt to revive trieste along the slovenian border as an export hub into central and eastern europe italy s state lender cassa depositi e prestiti cdp also signed an agreement with the bank of china to allow the sale of panda bonds a name for debt sold by foreign entities to investors in mainland china cdp will issue bonds worth 5 billion renminbi 744 5 million cdp and bank of china will also co finance italian companies for 4 billion renminbi also the italian plant builder danieli will construct a steel plant in china which will eventually move to azerbaijan and china s suning e commerce group will more heavily promote italian exports and tourism the deals also included calls for cooperation between chinese and italian companies in gas turbine technology and wealth management worries in washington earlier this year both us secretary of state mike pompeo and vice president mike pence warned european allies about political and economic indebtedness to china and russia concerning telecommunications direct investment natural resources and security in march just before president xi s visit to rome last week us national security council spokesman garrett marquis stated that italy did not need to lend legitimacy to china s vanity infrastructure project opponents of the bri in washington view the global infrastructure plan as a geopolitical instrument for strategic influence and label the high levels of debt owed by african and south asian nations to china as economic evidence of chinese domination in sum the cold war lafeber described almost thirty years ago is alive and well but the choice is between maintaining the old post wwii order or shifting to beijing s proposed 21st century silk and maritime roads the latest and most symbolically significant development of this conflict occurred this past week when president xi jinping visited rome to welcome italy a g7 economy into the 1 trillion bri as professor of global history at oxford university peter frankopan suggests the seemingly innocuous move comes at a sensitive time for europe and the european union where there is suddenly a great deal of trepidation not only about china but about working out how europe or the eu should adapt and react to a changing world last month the european commission released a joint statement on china s growing economic power and political influence it presented a single unified agenda in which it deemed china a systemic rival and recently both berlin and paris expressed firm positions concerning chinese investment as the china us trade war continues however italy among other eu states is pursuing a more independent foreign policy economic and cultural relations between china and rome go back 2 000 years when the ancient silk road connected them in a letter addressed to the italian people in the daily corriere della sera president xi called for a win win global strategic partnership focused on infrastructure telecommunications and ports among other things with the italian entrance into the bri europe is split on economic neutrality between the east and west despite us concerns thirteen european countries have already opened up to chinese investment and choices between traditional western partners and the east are threatening a solid continental consensus on issues such as telecommunications infrastructure or foreign investment screening chinese benefits and italian needs the italian endorsement grants china additional legitimacy in its pursuit of reshaping international trade and facilitates china s penetration of western markets with crucial infrastructure projects like the ports of genoa and trieste after the morandi bridge in genoa collapsed and tragically killed 43 people last august the topic of infrastructure investment has reentered mainstream italian politics combined with the recession which hit italy at the end of 2018 the populist coalition government dominated by the five star movement and the northern league searches for foreign investment to revitalize the economy italian national debt is among the highest of the eurozone the coalition which entered power in june 2019 hopes to integrate port cities like trieste and genoa into the proposed chinese maritime routes advocates look to the successes of the greek port of piraeus which grew in activity fivefold after chinese firms acquired 51 michele geraci the italian undersecretary at the ministry for economic development argues that the bri is an opportunity for our companies to take the opportunity of china s growing importance in the world geraci also notes the hypocrisy of eu critics who benefited from large amounts of chinese investment but disapprove of italy s signing of the memorandum of understanding mou this past week deputy prime minister minister for economic development and five star movement leader luigi di maio and minister of economy and finances giovanni tria along with prime minister giuseppe conte all support the deal enthusiastically and believe it will increase chinese investment in italy and provide increased access to chinese markets and raw materials however not everyone in rome is thrilled about the deal interior minister matteo salvini and leader of the northern league emphasized that he did not want to see foreign countries colonizing italy salvini a supporter of the trump administration in the us also expressed security concerns surrounding mobile phone data related to huawei s involvement in europe european union hypocrisy however while overall chinese investment in europe decreased this past year activity grew in many european countries just last year chinese investors made acquisitions worth 1 83 billion in france up 86 percent from 2017 chinese direct investment in germany totaled 2 52 billion up 34 percent while in italy investment was down 21 percent to 800 million the numbers suggest that the french and germans are hypocritical in criticizing italy over the signed mou referencing xi s italian visit french officials have described the rome beijing accord as a breach of a united front against china s pursuit of economic domination however as the numbers indicate italian investment is only a fraction of overall chinese activity in france or other european states sovereignty and self interest similar to prior policies of other euro sceptic governments an italian deal with china demonstrates economic independence from the eu bureaucracy populists might argue that italy should not depend on eu subsidies to reform its infrastructure and revitalize its economy similar pivots have occurred concerning eu migration and fiscal policy geraci had stated that he did not want a single eu policy on investment screening we have 28 different economies with 28 different interests he said but assured that all business dealings would occur within the scope of our existing alliances with the eu with nato italy similar to hungary and other eu states pledges to remain loyal to the us and nato but is seeking to deviate from western views to maximize national interests in the context of lafeber s 1992 article and as emphasized by italian journalist alessandra bocchi washington seems to be less dominant in dictating europe s foreign policy indeed europe sits as a battleground between the china us trade war though the us adversary has changed european dependency relationships just like during the cold war are again dominating world affairs and lafeber s concerns lasted deeper into the 21st century than initially expected
published tuesday 2 april 2019 print disqus the slides for the powerpoint presentation accompanying these remarks can be found here remarks by chris powell secretary treasurer gold anti trust action committee inc mines and money asia conference hong kong convention and exhibition centre tuesday april 2 2019 mining investment asia conference intercontinental singapore bugis hotel singapore thursday march 28 2019 most of us come to this conference to discover what mining assets are worth financially most people go to financial conferences generally to discover what various assets are worth for almost 20 years my organization the gold anti trust action committee has documented why mining assets particularly and other assets generally can not be valued accurately or even valued at all without first taking into account the largely surreptitious intervention in the markets by governments and central banks surreptitious intervention that lately has become almost comprehensive government intervention against the price of gold is not mere conspiracy theory but an old story fully documented in government s own archives it is official policy going back to the united states government s enactment of the gold reserve act of 1934 which created the u s government s exchange stabilization fund this policy of gold price suppression continued through the london gold pool of the 1960s a coordinated scheme of gold reserve dishoarding by the u s government and seven allied governments to hold the international gold price at 35 per ounce the objective of these interventions always has been to defend government currencies and bonds against competition from gold as a currency and store of value but by the early 1970s the governments participating in gold price suppression had lost too much of their gold reserves to continue suppressing the gold price by dishoarding in the open so they began operating against gold mostly in secret through gold leasing swapping and futures market manipulation usually shorting the futures through the large investment banks that trade the monetary metals and execute other market interventions for governments in recent years this scheme has been admitted many times by central bankers themselves sometimes when they think no one outside their circle is listening sometimes when they have written their memoirs this and other documentation is archived at gata s internet site and several days would be needed to review it all with you today i will try to summarize the most important documentation and developments of the last year let me start with what is perhaps the documentation of the last year that most clearly establishes the comprehensiveness of market rigging by governments and central banks it is the schedule of discounts provided to governments and central banks by cme group operator of the major futures exchanges in the united states for their secret trading of all major futures contracts this schedule is posted on cme group s internet site and copied to gata s internet site the discount trading program has been in effect for several years now and a few weeks ago it was renewed for another year with slightly changed rates the current discounts range from a mere 3 percent for bitcoin futures contracts and 7 percent for two year u s treasury futures contracts to a whopping 52 percent for interest rate futures the huge discount for central banks and government trading of interest rate futures implies that they do a lot of secret trading there apparently to defeat speculators shorting bonds and driving up interest rates discounts of 15 percent are offered to governments and central banks for secretly trading gold and silver futures as well as metals and energy futures discounts of 14 percent are available to them even for secretly trading agricultural futures of course the trading discount schedule doesn t prove that such secret trading by governments and central banks is actually occurring the proof of such secret trading comes from cme group s annual 10 k form filings with the u s securities and exchange commission wherein cme group specifies that its customers include governments and central banks mainstream financial news organizations refuse to report this secret trading by governments and central banks even though it implies the overthrow of the market economy throughout the world it implies the suppression of the prices of all mining products throughout the last year the bank for international settlements the central bank of the central banks has continued to trade secretly in the gold market on behalf of its members as far as i can determine only one person in the world outside of central banking documents this secret trading gata consultant robert lambourne the trading is confirmed not by any regular and candid announcement by the bis but by changes in the line item for gold in the bank s monthly statement of account which is obscurely posted at the bank s internet site subtracting the gold owned by the bis itself from the valuation reported by the bank for gold loans and swaps lambourne concludes that the bis is swapping dozens of tonnes of gold every month 56 in february alone what is the purpose of these swaps what is the bis aiming to achieve in the gold market and for whom are lambourne s calculations correct gata put those questions to the bis in november 2017 the bank promptly replied that it provides no information about its activity in the gold market the bis referred gata to its member central banks which of course also refuse to provide information about their activity in the gold market a few weeks ago craig hemke of the tf metals report noticed that lambourne s calculation of 56 tonnes of bis gold swaps in february corresponded almost exactly with the decline in the gold inventory held by the gold exchange traded fund gld over about the same period 57 tonnes had the bis borrowed gold from gld to dump it into the market in february and march to push the gold price down or is the similarity of the numbers here just a coincidence when powerful government organizations refuse to answer for themselves it becomes less likely that suspicious developments involving them are mere coincidence also recently refusing to answer gata s questions about its operations is the u s commodity futures trading commission by letter in september gata asked the cftc if it has jurisdiction over manipulation of a commodities market that is undertaken by the u s government itself directly or through intermediaries or whether market manipulation instigated by the government is authorized by federal law after all such manipulation seems to be authorized by the gold reserve act of 1934 which established the treasury department s exchange stabilization fund and authorized it to trade secretly in any market in the world the cftc has refused to answer gata s questions which may be construed as confirmation that the u s government indeed is authorized to rig the commodity markets and indeed is doing so u s rep alex mooney r west virginia objected to the cftc s refusal to answer gata s questions in february he wrote to the cftc himself making gata s questions his own mooney also asked the cftc why its own investigation of the silver market from 2008 through 2013 could find no manipulation when the u s justice department and fbi recently obtained a confession from a former trader for jpmorganchase that he had manipulated the silver market and the gold market during that period further mooney asked whether in light of that trader s confession to manipulation the cftc will reopen its investigation of silver market manipulation two months have passed and the cftc has not replied to the congressman either last april mooney performed an even greater service to accountability in government he wrote to the federal reserve and treasury department and asked them to specify which markets they are trading in mooney wrote records in the archives of the historian of the u s state department describe u s government policy in recent decades as aiming to drive gold out of the world financial system in favor of the federal reserve note or special drawing rights issued by the international monetary fund is this still u s government policy toward gold if not what is the u s government s current policy toward gold mooney continued i have heard complaints that the u s gold reserve has not been fully audited for many decades particularly as there seems to have been no acknowledgement of or account for swaps and leases of gold or arrangements for such to which the u s government has been a party does the u s government through the treasury department the federal reserve system or any other agency or entity transact in gold or gold derivatives either directly or through intermediaries if so what are those transactions and what are their objectives does the u s government undertake any transactions in gold or gold derivatives through the bank for international settlements bank of england or other central banks or governments if so what are these transactions and their objectives federal reserve chairman jerome powell replied to mooney but only in part powell denied that the fed is trading gold but failed to answer whether the fed is trading in other markets and if so which ones powell said the treasury department would reply on its own behalf but a year has passed and the treasury has not replied apparently an honest answer about secret market intervention by the u s government would be against the u s government s interests an honest answer might reveal that complaints of such secret intervention are far more than conspiracy theory then there have been the usual criminal activities in the gold and silver markets by agents of big investment banks banks that are commonly brokers for the u s government in november last year former jpmorganchase trader john edmonds pleaded guilty in federal court to manipulating the gold and silver markets for about seven years in his confession he says his superiors and other traders at jpmorganchase knew what he was doing and conspired with him in october last year the bank of nova scotia whose metals division scotia mocatta is renowned in the gold and silver business a bank that has participated in the daily london gold price setting mechanism admitted to the u s commodity futures trading commission that its traders had used spoofing trades to manipulate the gold and silver markets from 2013 through 2016 for this spoofing the cftc fined the bank of nova scotia a mere 800 000 maintaining that the bank deserved such leniency because it had reported itself and deutsche bank which in 2016 agreed to pay nearly 100 million to settle class action lawsuits in the united states charging manipulation of the gold and silver futures markets also agreeing to provide evidence against other banks agreed in february to settle a similar class action lawsuit in canada in canada deutsche bank will pay c 5 5 million and as in the united states provide evidence against other market manipulators in november last year former federal reserve chairman paul volcker published an updated edition of his autobiography excerpts of which first saw print in the nikkei weekly in japan in 2004 in the new edition volcker recalls his desire for central bank intervention against gold during an international currency revaluation in 1973 while he was an assistant secretary of the treasury volcker writes the newly agreed exchange rates and gold price 42 22 in my view would be highly vulnerable to renewed speculation to convey a sense of confidence we should be prepared to intervene collectively to stabilize the gold market in effect to create a new gold pool that unfortunately was not agreed while all of this is hard documentation not mere speculation or conspiracy theory few mainstream news organizations will touch it apparently because it is too sensitive to their governments but sometimes some notice slips through in august last year the hong kong economic journal took note of gata s work in a commentary headlined gata is not wrong the hong kong economic journal s essayist shin lin shu wrote gold prices are often artificially depressed indeed as shown by the u s state department cables exposed by wikileaks in 2011 china long has known about gold price suppression by the united states and the u s government knows that china knows three weeks ago a major newspaper in italy il sole 24 ore the sun 24 hours asserted plainly that central banks have been manipulating the gold futures market to push the gold price down so they more easily can acquire real metal to build their reserves this the italian newspaper said was being done in anticipation of the formal remonetization of gold under the so called basel 3 standards devised by the bank for international settlements whereby as of last friday gold in the vault is to be considered an asset as good as cash and government bonds the newspaper s premise echoed the hypothesis published in 2012 by the u s economists paul brodsky and lee quaintance that central banks were redistributing gold reserves in favor of countries with large u s dollar denominated foreign exchange positions to hedge those countries against the devaluation of the dollar and an upward revaluation of gold that would reliquefy dollar overweight central banks what does all this mean to mining companies and their investors first it means that metals and minerals are underpriced along with most commodities because of the price suppression engineered by central banks to defend their currencies and government bonds central banks and governments in the developed world don t want gold silver other metals and other commodities to compete with their currencies as stores of value as the recent acquisition of gold by russia china and other governments suggests gold price suppression has been figured out at last and certain countries are turning to gold to regain financial sovereignty second it means that there is a vast and uncoverable short position in the monetary metals and other strategic commodities thus they have great potential for price appreciation third it means that western central banks are not likely to surrender this short position without a fight or another negotiated international currency revaluation fourth since governments can create infinite money it means that if you are trading against secret trading by the government you are likely to lose fifth it means that if commodity prices ever regain free markets commodity producers should be prepared for stiffer royalty requirements and windfall profits taxes and sixth it means that people in the mining and commodities businesses may have an obligation to their investors and clients to inform them of the opposition of major governments to free markets and higher commodity prices it means we all may have an obligation to clamor for governments to tell us the truth about their surreptitious interventions in the markets for this price suppression works only through deception because it depends entirely on government for its mining claims royalty requirements and enforcement of environmental regulations the mining industry is the industry most vulnerable to government any government can shut down any mining company on any pretext at any time and since the mining industry is also the most capital intensive industry with a billion dollars or more required to start a large mine the industry is also the most dependent for its financing on the major investment banks that are the agents of government in the markets so objecting to price suppression will require courage from the mining industry but if the industry united against price suppression there would be strength in numbers besides the industry s choice may be only whether to die on its knees or risk dying on its feet sometimes the truth is stronger than you think i will be delighted to answer your questions here if we

project markets are qatar remains the world s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas and it will run its first budget surplus in three years in 2019 due to higher energy prices the surplus is expected to reach qar4 3 billion about usd1 2bn or eur1 billion qatar s economy will grow by 3 1 in 2019 according to the international monetary fund imf the state budget for 2019 focuses on developing new housing areas for nationals enhancing food security projects and establishing infrastructure and facilities in free zones special economic zones and industrial and logistics zones the construction and projects market continues to deliver projects despite the supply chain disruption that followed the imposition of trading restrictions by saudi arabia the uae bahrain and egypt in june 2017 the influence of turkish construction and engineering firms is expected to grow as ankara remains one of the key allies for doha the construction industry s main focus is on completing the projects for the fifa 2022 world cup as well as ongoing projects in healthcare education and transportation with many megaprojects on the brink of completion there is an increased risk of disputes to boost overseas investment in qatar the government has announced economic reforms related to labour laws privatisation free zones and higher foreign ownership limits that will make it easier to invest and operate in the country the main laws are the amended law no 34 of 2005 on investment free zones establishing the free zone authority and the new law no 1 of 2019 regulating the investment of non qatari capital see question 37 major projects qatari diar remains the biggest project client in qatar by value of projects in execution and its usd17 billion mixed use lusail city is still considered one of the biggest projects in the country msheireb downtown doha regeneration project led by qatar foundation and doha metro led by qatar rail are nearing completion other major projects include the fifa world cup 2022 stadiums extension of the new doha port project extension of hamad international airport expressways and road drainage projects run by the public works authority ashghal development of the free zones led by the newly established free zone authority procurement arrangements 2 which are the most common procurement arrangements if the main parties are local are these arrangements different if some or all of the main parties are international contractors or consultants traditional or split procurement where the employer engages a design consultant to design a project and then awards a construction contract to a contractor to construct the project in accordance with that design is most common for local small scale projects design services and construction works procured by local public sector employers are generally awarded by competitive tender pursuant to law no 24 of 2015 on regulation of tenders and auctions tenders law less common in local projects but more popular in large scale international projects are procurement schemes based on design and build or on an engineering procurement and construction epc turnkey approach in a design and build contract the contractor will be responsible for both the design of the project and for the construction works to meet the contractual specification in epc contracts a single contractor is responsible for all design engineering construction and procurement of a project on a turnkey basis other procurement arrangements and forms of contracts including engineering procurement construction management epcm partnering alliancing new engineering contract nec or american institute of architects aia contracts are not popular in qatar transaction structures 3 what transaction structures and corporate vehicles are most commonly used in both local and international projects similarly to procurement arrangements see question 2 transaction structures usually vary according to the size of the project rather than its parties for smaller projects local contractors and consultants usually transact alone as single legal entities the most common corporate structure for such local contractors and consultants is a limited liability company llc for mid size and large projects contractors often a local contractor teaming up with an international contractor will form a consortium or a joint venture most commonly incorporated as a single llc especially when engaged on publicly tendered projects the employer will usually require parent company guarantees from all consortium joint venture partners finance 4 how are projects financed how do arrangements differ for major international projects local and public sector projects are generally government funded it is likely that some of the public sector projects will be increasingly financed by private sector through public private partnerships ppp especially after introduction of the long awaited law on ppps private small or medium sized projects are often financed by local banks either on a conventional or islamic financing basis for major international projects particularly in major oil and gas petrochemical or integrated power and water projects project financing is common security and contractual protections 5 what forms of security and contractual protections do funders typically require to protect their investments security security typically taken by lenders in qatar does not differ significantly from other jurisdictions under the qatar civil code the commercial companies law and the commercial code various forms of security interest are available and these cover the lenders ability to mortgage a registered freehold interest in land and transfer leasehold interests in land assign certain contractual rights to third parties including the rights to debts and receivables provide a commercial mortgage over moveable assets pledge shares in a joint stock company subject to certain qualifications pledge a sum held in a bank account contractual in a government funded project the employer usually requires the contractor to provide performance bonds and advance payment bonds pursuant to the tenders law in addition some public sector clients such as ashghal or qatar rail will often require collateral warranties from sub contractors or sub consultants in favour of the client as well as parent company guarantees from main contractors in major project financed schemes the lenders typically require direct agreements giving them the ability to step into the position of the borrower sponsor in the event of a default under a project contract which might otherwise entitle the project contractor in question to terminate or suspend that contract standard forms of contracts 6 what standard forms of contracts are used for both local and international projects which organisations publish them local projects the majority of contracts are bespoke agreements with regard to small and private sector projects these are often poorly drafted international federation of consulting engineers fidic forms of contract typically the 1999 version are generally the only contract templates recognised countrywide for local projects these are mainly the conditions of contract for construction red book conditions of contract for plan and design build yellow book conditions of contract for epc turnkey projects silver book ashghal uses bespoke forms for various types of their projects from minor to large ashghal has revised its suite of contracts in 2018 to make it more contractor friendly drawing on the drafting style of the fidic suite of contracts astad has also recently prepared its suite of contracts sanad and promotes it among the local construction industry other public sector projects often use their own bespoke forms of contracts which are often heavily amended variations of fidic red or yellow books international projects fidic forms of contracts are common on major international projects bespoke forms are often used contractual issues contractors risks 7 what risks are typically allocated to the contractor how are these risks offset or managed there is no typical risk allocation for construction contracts in qatar however contracts with the public sector typically involve a heavy transfer of risk from the employer to the contractor meaning the contractor often has limited grounds on which to seek an extension to the time for completion or increase in the agreed contract price typical risks allocated to the contractor include risk of non completion on time see question 11 risk of volume of resources in lump sum contracts typically sits with the contractor risk of errors in information provided by the employer depends on the project but quite often information is provided for information only meaning that the risk of inaccuracies is assumed by the contractor risk of unforeseen ground conditions in epc contracts this usually sits with the contractor force majeure see question 10 those risks can be mitigated at the tender stage for example by way of requests for clarifications analysis of the employer s requirement proper programming of works and by way of diligent contract administration and record keeping from the commercial point of view contractors will price those risks and reflect them in the proposed contract price excluding liability 8 how can liability be excluded or restricted under local law limitation of liability clauses are commonly used in construction contracts in qatar and any terms which either exclude or cap damages will be generally enforceable by qatar courts or by extension arbitral tribunals some exceptions include liability resulting from fraud or gross mistake cannot be limited or excluded by the parties to a contract article 259 civil code article 711 of the civil code under which contractors and designers give a guarantee for ten years from project completion decennial liability which covers total or partial collapse of fault in the buildings even if the collapse or fault has resulted from a defect in the land itself or the employer accepted the defective buildings this strict liability cannot be contractually limited or excluded article 715 civil code where damages are pre agreed their amount may not be due if the debtor can show that no loss has been suffered the amount of damages was exaggerated to a considerable degree or the obligation has been partially executed article 266 civil code in those instances the court or by extension arbitral tribunal can reduce the compensation due and any agreement to the contrary will be void this provision is often used by contractors to reduce the amount of liquidated damages agreed in the construction contract in turn the employers cannot apply to the court to claim a higher amount of liquidated damages even if they show that their loss is greater than the pre agreed compensation unless they can show that the debtor contractor or consultant committed fraud or gross mistake article 267 civil code caps on liability 9 do the parties usually agree a cap on liability if yes how is this usually fixed what liabilities if any are typically not capped caps on liability are common in construction contracts there is no typical cap but overall caps on liability typically range from 50 up to 200 of the contract price liability for liquidated damages for delay is often capped at between 5 to 10 of the contract price it is also common to agree on carve outs from the overall liability cap with liabilities or indemnities for intellectual property rights or property damage being often outside the agreed cap under qatar law some liabilities cannot be contractually limited such as liability for fraud or gross mistake article 259 civil code or liability arising from mandatory provisions such as article 711 of the civil code on decennial liability qatar courts retain the discretion to vary any such limitation of liability to make the compensation equal to the actual loss suffered see question 8 force majeure 10 are force majeure exclusions available and enforceable force majeure clauses are commonly seen in construction contracts in qatar and are generally enforceable typically a construction contract defines the force majeure event and provides for various reliefs for parties if such an event occurs usually subject to additional obligations to notify and minimise delay in performance of obligations in the absence of any contractual provisions in this respect various civil code provisions dealing with force majeure will apply for example under article 204 which provides that if a party can demonstrate that a loss has arisen due to an external cause that is not of their making the party is not liable for the damages unless the parties have contractually agreed otherwise further under article 171 2 a debtor can apply to the court or by extension arbitration tribunal to adjust the burdensome obligation to a reasonable level if unforeseen exceptional circumstances occur article 258 permits parties to contractually agree to allocate risks for force majeure to the contractor under article 700 the contractor cannot avoid or vary its contractual obligations as a result of an increase in prices in the market for raw materials labour or other elements but subject to a general principle stated in article 171 2 of the qatar civil code that where fulfilment of the contractual obligation though not impossible becomes excessively onerous a judge can reduce the excessive obligation to a reasonable level 11 what contractual provisions are typically negotiated to cover material delays to the project more sophisticated contracts especially those based on fidic forms provide for an extensive list of circumstances allowing the contractor to be granted an extension of time the extent of relief available to the contractor will depend on the risk profile under the contract but typically these will involve various failures of the employer causing the works to be delayed such as for instance failure to grant to the contractor access to the site on time failure to supply to the contractor agreed facilities information equipment or services failure to obtain approvals within the times prescribed in the contract any other breach of the contract by the employer or any delay or act of prevention attributable to the employer parties to contracts with private employers typically negotiate provisions on liquidated damages compensation for delay as well as variation clauses see question 12 contractors will want to ensure that they are not obliged to pay liquidated damages in circumstances where delay occurred through no fault of the contractor such as in the event of force majeure variations requested by the employer or defaults of third parties the tenders law and its regulations impose own liquidated damages regime for delay which cannot be varied by the contract for instance under this regime liquidated damages for delay must not exceed 10 of the total contract value 12 what contractual provisions are typically negotiated to cover variations to the works on public sector projects of all sizes contract terms with the client including provisions on variations are rarely negotiable in medium to large scale contracts with private sector employers provisions on variation often adopt the fidic approach the parties typically negotiate what constitutes a variation whether contractor may initiate a variation pricing of varied works contractor s entitlement to relief arising out of the variation and time limits for bringing a claim concerning variations under the civil code in a measurement contract a contractor is entitled to claim an increase in the costs if the actual costs based on an agreed design exceed the estimated measurements in turn the employer can terminate this contract if the difference in costs is significantly high article 708 civil code in a lump sum contract a contractor cannot claim any relief for costs unless amendments or additions to the agreed design were caused by the employer or the employer authorised the changes in design article 709 civil code other negotiated provisions 13 what other contractual provisions are usually heavily negotiated by the parties in addition to the clauses set out in questions 8 to 12 it is common to negotiate the following terms of the construction contract payment terms requirement to provide bonds parent company guarantees and collateral warranties termination and suspension rights subcontracting taking over and completion intellectual property rights any back to back provisions with other project agreements architects engineers and construction professionals 14 how are construction professionals usually selected following selection how are they formally appointed construction professionals can be selected in various ways depending on the nature and scope of the project on public sector projects they will be usually selected through a public tender process in accordance with the tenders law on private sector commercial projects competitive tenders are carried out typically only for mid size to large scale projects in any selection process price personal contacts recommendations and contractor s reputation play and important role the appointment is under a contract or an engagement retainer letter 15 what provisions of construction professionals appointments are most heavily negotiated are liabilities commonly limited or capped in construction professionals appointments negotiated provisions consultants often have little or no opportunity to negotiate contract terms with a public sector client bound by the tenders law in private sector appointments the most heavily negotiated provisions typically include payment terms liquidated damages compensation for delay requirement to provide bonds parent company guarantees and collateral warranties levels of professional indemnity insurance standard of skill and care to be adopted by the consultant intellectual property rights any back to back provisions with the construction contract or other project agreements liability subject to mandatory provisions of law see question 8 the consultant s liability is commonly capped at 100 to 200 of the consultant s fee liability for indirect or consequential losses is often excluded payment for construction work 16 what are the usual methods of payment for construction work are there ways for the contractor and consultants to secure payment or mitigate risks of non payment under local law methods of payment typically the contractor is paid in arrears either periodically for example monthly or on achieving certain milestones construction contracts usually provide for certification of the requested payments by the employer or engineer payments to contractors and consultants are usually made directly into a bank account held in qatar late payments are common both in private and public sector contracts in public sector contracts often due to employer s reliance on funds to be obtained from the ministry of finance advance payments for construction works of between 10 and 15 of the value of the works are common and the contractor is typically required to provide the employer with the advance payment bond securing the repayment of the advance payment under the tenders law advance payment bond is required with some exceptions to contractors being small and medium sized enterprises securing payment from a commercial point of view to minimise the risk of loss contractors often expect payments to be heavily front loaded by substantial advance payments or otherwise this is often not achievable in relation to public sector contracts payment guarantees from the employer are not very common but letters of credit are sometimes used especially in small to medium projects contractually sophisticated contractors want to ensure that payment certification provisions are unambiguous and that any variations are precisely dealt with in the contract as always meticulous contract administration helps in managing this risk pay when paid clauses are common and enforceable in subcontracts however sub contractors have a right to claim payments directly from the employer for the work that is due to be paid by the main contractor article 702 civil code contractors also usually want to expressly incorporate a right to interest for late payment within their contracts courts or by extension arbitral tribunals can nullify such provision where they consider the interest rate exorbitant in many public works contracts if that payment is delayed the contractor has the right to receive additional allowance for the cost of financing on such delayed payment usually at a fixed rate referenced to the qatar central bank annual minimum lending rate subcontractors 17 how do the parties typically manage their relationships with subcontractors sub contracts and sub consultancy agreements usually incorporate provisions from the main contract with the employer to ensure that the risks and liabilities that are relevant to the sub contract are back to back with the main agreement typically sub contractors and sub consultants are required to comply with the main agreement under the main contract the contractor is often obliged to deliver to the employer or engineer a collateral warranty signed by the key sub contractor allowing the employer direct recourse against the sub contractor further the main contract often requires that the contractor obtains prior consent from the employer to any sub contract subcontract incorporates certain provisions listed in the main contract contractor not terminate the sub contract without the employer s or engineer s consent contractor provides the employer or engineer with details of any dispute under the sub contract which may delay the project licensing 18 what licences and other consents must contractors and construction professionals have to carry out local construction work are there any specific licensing requirements for international contractors and construction professionals unless registered in qatar financial centre or any of the free zones all entities carrying on business in qatar must be properly registered with the ministry of commerce and industry each individual or each office performing engineering works in qatar must obtain a licence from the licensing committee in accordance with the law no 19 of 2005 on engineering profession the requirements for obtaining an engineering licence are extensive and the definition of engineering is also very broadly construed for example architects and other designers usually fall into the definition of engineer for these purposes the licence takes time to obtain and has many fixed criteria such as the requirement for numbers of professionals on the ground in qatar arabic language skills and locally procured insurance as a rule international engineering offices need to be registered as well however there are certain exceptions for instance if they are contracted to provide certain technical services required in the public interest 19 what licences and other consents must a project obtain before this will vary according to the nature of the project and its location typically before the project commences the following licences and consents must be obtained planning permission from the ministry of municipality and environment and approval of file opening fire safety clearance from the civil defence clearance for power and water service from qatar general electricity and water corporation kahramaa building permits from the ministry of municipality and environment during during the project various authorities have a right to inspect the project in addition some consents are required depending on the nature of the works or tasks concerned for instance consents are needed when transporting special hazardous or heavy goods on completion on completion typically the following are required fire safety approval from the civil defence certificate of completion from the ministry of municipality and environment registration of the building with the municipality utilities supply and connections projects insurance 20 what types of insurance must be maintained by law are other non compulsory types of insurance maintained under contract compulsory insurance architects and engineering offices are required to have certain insurances particularly professional indemnity pi insurance while registered in qatar vehicles must also be insured non compulsory insurance generally it is up to the parties to the contract to agree on any insurance programme required for the given project typically contractors are required to take out and maintain all risks insurance employment laws 21 what are the main requirements for hiring local and foreign workers local workers in line with the qatarisation policy governmental initiative devised to increase the number of qatari citizens employed in public and private sectors the labour law gives priority to qatari nationals over non qataris when an employer is seeking to fill a role qatari nationals seeking jobs can register with the ministry of labour for potential job placements foreign workers employers are given a quota of different nationalities from which they can hire and which must not be exceeded employers seeking to hire non qataris will have to first obtain permission from the government and once obtained they will need to apply for a work visa so that the employee can enter qatar to work and reside in qatar employees need to obtain a residence permit 22 which employment laws are relevant to projects construction employees are subject to the labour law no 14 of 2004 as amended labour law employees of governmental entities are subject to law no 15 of 2016 on civil human resources human resources law apart from these laws some employment affairs are regulated by special laws and or project specific employment rules 23 must an employer pay statutory redundancy or other payments at the end of a project are all employees eligible there is no requirement to pay statutory redundancy at the end of a project however employees who were employed for more than one continuous year are entitled to an end of service gratuity benefit for each complete year of their service the amount of the gratuity is as agreed on by the parties provided that it is not less than a three week basic salary excluding any allowances or benefits for every year of employment any partial year of service is calculated on a pro rata basis the end of service gratuity is not payable when the employee has been dismissed without notice in circumstances provided for in the labour law for instance when the employee violates more than once the written instructions of the employer concerning safety at work health and safety 24 which health and safety laws apply to projects there are several laws setting out health and safety requirements relevant to projects in qatar the key provisions governing health and safety are found in part 10 the labour law and in ministerial decisions implementing it in addition to the provisions under the labour law the government established the national committee of occupational health and safety within the ministry of administrative development labour and social affairs which is responsible for high level policy and enforcement environmental issues 25 which local laws regulate projects effects on the environment air water waste there is a range of environmental laws in qatar but law no 30 of 2002 on environment protection environment law regulates the most relevant aspects of protection of air and water and waste treatment as a rule the project owner must take all necessary precautions and measures to prevent air or water pollution in major projects contractors are typically required to submit to the employer engineer a construction environmental management system which ensures compliance with any environmental requirements it is common for employers to impose penalties for environmental infringements environmental impact assessments eias the environment law and the executive bye law provides for the procedural framework of obtaining clearance through submission and approval of eias the supreme council for the environment and natural reserves scenr decides whether the project is approved whether to grant the environmental permission with conditions to reject the application the decision of scenr must be taken within ten days and the project proponent will have 30 days to appeal in case of rejection of the application sustainable development sustainable development practices are used and have increased in popularity in the qatar construction sector see question 26 26 do new buildings need to meet carbon emissions or climate change targets new buildings do not need to meet specific carbon emissions or climate change targets however qatar actively promotes the concept of green buildings and encourages following green building practices especially in public sector projects qatar has established its own building certification system called global sustainability assessment system gsas formerly qatar sustainability assessment system qsas and has incorporated qsas into the qatar construction specifications qcs making the implementation of certain criteria mandatory for buildings developed in qatar most of the buildings developed by ashghal and the ministry of municipality and environment are gsas certified in addition many new developments are under the leadership in environmental energy and design leed certification system for example most of the buildings in msheireb downtown doha and education city prohibiting corrupt practices 27 are there any rules prohibiting corrupt business practices and bribery particularly any rules targeting the projects sector what are the applicable civil or criminal penalties rules the state of qatar has ratified several international and regional conventions relevant to combating corruption which have the force of law at national level in accordance with the constitution of qatar amiri decree no 6 of 2015 mandated the administrative control and transparency authority to implement the united nations convention against corruption which was ratified by qatar in 2007 in qatar it is punishable among other things for public officers to ask or accept a bribe for him herself or another party or to seek a bribe after the event to offer a bribe to a public officer even if the bribe is declined for any employee to ask for a bribe for his her benefit or for that of another party for money or a benefit or a promise of something in return without the knowledge of his employer and his consent to undertake any of the duties assigned to him or abstain from so doing articles 140 to 147 of the qatar penal code in addition under the tenders law the public works contract is deemed terminated if it is proved that the contractor has attempted directly or indirectly to bribe a public official under the labour law and the human resources law employees including ministry governmental and public authority employees are prohibited from accepting gifts or payments in the course of their employment penalties the offence of bribing a public officer carries a penalty of five years imprisonment and a fine of up to qar15 000 applies to any person who receives money or a benefit pretending that it is bribery for an officer while he she intends to keep it or part of it any person who receives money or profit while knowing its purpose even if the officer intended to receive the bribery did not appoint him her or did not know about him provided that he she is not an intermediary in the bribery with respect to offences relating to being bribed the penalties are up toten years imprisonment and a fine of what was received or promised but not less than qr5 000 for a public official seven years imprisonment and a fine of up to qar15 000 applies to a public officer who accepts money or benefit from a person for doing not doing something relating to his her office or seeks to obtain such a reward up to three years imprisonment and or a fine of up to qar15 000 for an employee who asks for a bribe dismissal from office and confiscation of the bribe bankruptcy or insolvency 28 what rights do the client and funder have on the contractor s bankruptcy or insolvency all insolvency proceedings are conducted under the supervision of the court under chapter 6 of the qatar commercial code article 653 of the commercial code provides for the court to consent to any distribution of assets of an insolvent entity in contracts an employer often has a right to terminate the contract for the contractor s default in the event of the contractor s insolvency public private partnerships 29 are public private partnerships ppps common in local construction projects if so which sectors commonly use ppps historically high revenues from liquefied natural gas have meant that the qatar government has been able to fund its energy and infrastructure needs without private sector involvement notable exceptions were the independent power and water project in ras laffan procured by kahramaa in 2015 qatar s first true ppp various concession projects for workers accommodation facilities and build operate transfer projects bots in the real estate sector however interest in ppp projects is increasing and qatar is currently working on legislation to facilitate ppps the adoption of the new law is expected to be followed by a government supported list of ppp projects to be implemented in various sectors including transport healthcare and education 30 what local laws apply to public private partnerships ppps there is currently no statutory or regulatory framework which specifically applies to ppps in qatar see question 29 ppps in qatar including various concessions and bot projects are implemented on the basis of general legislation including the civil code and the tenders law 31 what is the typical procurement or tender process in a public private partnership ppp transaction does the government or another body publish standard forms of ppp project agreements and related contracts there is no typical procurement or tender process in a ppp transaction in qatar and there are no standard forms of ppp project agreements or related contracts it is expected that once the ppp market matures some of the government entities will develop their standard form of a ppp contract similar to standard forms of construction contracts and other project agreements that have been developed by them in the past dispute resolution 32 which are the most common formal dispute resolution methods used which courts and arbitration organisations deal with construction disputes formal dispute resolution methods litigation in the qatar courts is the most common formal dispute resolution method for small and medium size projects and the majority of disputes with public sector entities all proceedings in local courts are carried out in arabic and all documents must be translated into arabic during the proceedings the court often appoints a construction expert to provide an expert report and this report is often heavily relied upon by the judge arbitration is less popular in public sector contracts this is because under the tenders law the parties to a publicly tendered contract may resort to arbitration to settle a dispute only upon the approval of the minister of finance this law does not apply among others to qatar petroleum qp and qp regularly provides for arbitration in its contracts some other major employers such as qatar rail as well as many private sector entities engaging in medium to large projects have arbitration clauses in their contracts most adopt the international chamber of commerce icc rules with doha as the seat of the arbitration and english as the language of the proceedings courts and arbitration organisations there are no specialised construction courts in qatar and any construction disputes can be heard initially before the court of first instance then on appeal before the court of appeal and finally before the court of cessation where a construction contract provides for arbitration the relevant local institutions are qatar international court and dispute resolution centre qicdrc this was established by qfc law no 2 of 2009 amending certain provisions of the qatar financial centre qfc and consists of a first instance circuit and an appellate circuit qicdrc covers civil and commercial disputes that arise between qfc registered companies the qfc itself or entities which the qfc or a qfc registered company has contracted with this was established by qfc law no 2 of 2009 amending certain provisions of the qatar financial centre qfc and consists of a first instance circuit and an appellate circuit qicdrc covers civil and commercial disputes that arise between qfc registered companies the qfc itself or entities which the qfc or a qfc registered company has contracted with qatar international centre for conciliation and arbitration qicca qicca was established within the qatar chamber of commerce and industry by decision no 5 8 of 2006 the qicca is located in doha and has its own arbitration rules where the parties have chosen the qicca as the forum for their arbitration the rules are modelled on the uncitral arbitration rules 33 what are the most commonly used alternative dispute resolution adr methods sophisticated construction contracts will usually provide for a multi tier dispute resolution procedure which requires a dispute to be referred in the first instance to an engineer a mutually appointed expert or to senior management of the parties before the parties resort to the court or arbitral tribunal dispute adjudication boards are not common although one developer barwa has used dabs on several of its projects obtaining positive feedback from all stakeholders informal negotiation aimed at resolving the dispute amicably is often used especially before initiating any court proceedings or arbitration other adr methods including mediation are not yet popular tax 34 what are the main tax issues arising on projects there are no taxes particular to the construction sector generally apart from customs duties on imports of certain construction materials 10 corporate tax is applicable to all construction companies unless they are fully owned by qatari nationals further a withholding tax of 7 is applicable on non resident income commissions brokerage fees and other payments made to non residents for services carried out partly or wholly in qatar there are currently no plans to introduce value added tax vat in 2019 in construction contracts the contractor is typically liable for the payment of all taxes levied by authorities in relation to the construction works and the employer especially if government related often reserves the right to withhold the payment to the contractor pending demonstration of compliance with applicable tax regulations in qatar 35 are any methods commonly used to mitigate tax liability on projects are there any tax incentives to carry out regeneration projects mitigating tax the industry is expected to explore tax mitigation methods once the vat law is introduced see question 34 tax incentives tax exemptions can be granted to certain projects supporting critical areas of economy such as agriculture or tourism but presently there are no tax incentives applicable specifically to carrying out regeneration projects under new law no 1 of 2019 raw materials and semi manufactured items for production which are not available in the local market will be exempted from custom duties on their imports other requirements for international contractors 36 are there any specific requirements that international contractors or construction professionals must comply with see question 18 reform 37 are there any proposals to reform construction and projects law a few new laws and regulations either recently enacted such as new law no 1 of 2019 regulating the investment of the non qatari capital in economic activity see below or planned to be adopted in near future such as the new law on ppps see question 29 will inevitably have an impact on the construction and projects market in qatar the new law on non qatari investments is aimed at opening the way for foreign investors to have 100 ownership in all sectors and support investors entry into the qatari market the law offers investment incentives including allocation of land to non qatari investors to establish investment and certain import and tax reliefs it remains to be seen how this law will be implemented in practice yet it is widely perceived as a major step to further open up the qatari economy qatar has delayed plans to introduce vat initially anticipated for 2019 to our knowledge there are currently no other proposals specifically related to the reform of construction law

files gata hongkong slides 04 02 2019 pdf remarks by chris powell secretary treasurer gold anti trust action committee inc mines and money asia conference hong kong convention and exhibition centre tuesday april 2 2019 mining investment asia conference intercontinental singapore bugis hotel singapore thursday march 28 2019 most of us come to this conference to discover what mining assets are worth financially most people go to financial conferences generally to discover what various assets are worth for almost 20 years my organization the gold anti trust action committee has documented why mining assets particularly and other assets generally can not be valued accurately or even valued at all without first taking into account the largely surreptitious intervention in the markets by governments and central banks surreptitious intervention that lately has become almost comprehensive government intervention against the price of gold is not mere conspiracy theory but an old story fully documented in government s own archives it is official policy going back to the united states government s enactment of the gold reserve act of 1934 which created the u s government s exchange stabilization fund this policy of gold price suppression continued through the london gold pool of the 1960s a coordinated scheme of gold reserve dishoarding by the u s government and seven allied governments to hold the international gold price at 35 per ounce the objective of these interventions always has been to defend government currencies and bonds against competition from gold as a currency and store of value but by the early 1970s the governments participating in gold price suppression had lost too much of their gold reserves to continue suppressing the gold price by dishoarding in the open so they began operating against gold mostly in secret through gold leasing swapping and futures market manipulation usually shorting the futures through the large investment banks that trade the monetary metals and execute other market interventions for governments in recent years this scheme has been admitted many times by central bankers themselves sometimes when they think no one outside their circle is listening sometimes when they have written their memoirs this and other documentation is archived at gata s internet site gata org taxonomy term 21 and several days would be needed to review it all with you today i will try to summarize the most important documentation and developments of the last year let me start with what is perhaps the documentation of the last year that most clearly establishes the comprehensiveness of market rigging by governments and central banks it is the schedule of discounts provided to governments and central banks by cme group operator of the major futures exchanges in the united states for their secret trading of all major futures contracts this schedule is posted on cme group s internet site and copied to gata s internet site www gata org files cmegroup centralbankincentiveprogram feb2019 p the discount trading program has been in effect for several years now and a few weeks ago it was renewed for another year with slightly changed rates the current discounts range from a mere 3 percent for bitcoin futures contracts and 7 percent for two year u s treasury futures contracts to a whopping 52 percent for interest rate futures the huge discount for central banks and government trading of interest rate futures implies that they do a lot of secret trading there apparently to defeat speculators shorting bonds and driving up interest rates discounts of 15 percent are offered to governments and central banks for secretly trading gold and silver futures as well as metals and energy futures discounts of 14 percent are available to them even for secretly trading agricultural futures of course the trading discount schedule doesn t prove that such secret trading by governments and central banks is actually occurring the proof of such secret trading comes from cme group s annual 10 k form filings with the u s securities and exchange commission wherein cme group specifies that its customers include governments and central banks investor cmegroup com node 43571 html mainstream financial news organizations refuse to report this secret trading by governments and central banks even though it implies the overthrow of the market economy throughout the world it implies the suppression of the prices of all mining products throughout the last year the bank for international settlements the central bank of the central banks has continued to trade secretly in the gold market on behalf of its members as far as i can determine only one person in the world outside of central banking documents this secret trading gata consultant robert lambourne the trading is confirmed not by any regular and candid announcement by the bis but by changes in the line item for gold in the bank s monthly statement of account which is obscurely posted at the bank s internet site subtracting the gold owned by the bis itself from the valuation reported by the bank for gold loans and swaps lambourne concludes that the bis is swapping dozens of tonnes of gold every month 56 in february alone www gata org node 18923 what is the purpose of these swaps what is the bis aiming to achieve in the gold market and for whom are lambourne s calculations correct gata put those questions to the bis in november 2017 the bank promptly replied that it provides no information about its activity in the gold market the bis referred gata to its member central banks which of course also refuse to provide information about their activity in the gold market www gata org node 17793 a few weeks ago craig hemke of the tf metals report noticed that lambourne s calculation of 56 tonnes of bis gold swaps in february corresponded almost exactly with the decline in the gold inventory held by the gold exchange traded fund gld over about the same period 57 tonnes www gata org node 18937 had the bis borrowed gold from gld to dump it into the market in february and march to push the gold price down or is the similarity of the numbers here just a coincidence when powerful government organizations refuse to answer for themselves it becomes less likely that suspicious developments involving them are mere coincidence also recently refusing to answer gata s questions about its operations is the u s commodity futures trading commission by letter in september gata asked the cftc if it has jurisdiction over manipulation of a commodities market that is undertaken by the u s government itself directly or through intermediaries or whether market manipulation instigated by the government is authorized by federal law after all such manipulation seems to be authorized by the gold reserve act of 1934 which established the treasury department s exchange stabilization fund and authorized it to trade secretly in any market in the world home treasury gov policy issues international exchange stabiliza the cftc has refused to answer gata s questions which may be construed as confirmation that the u s government indeed is authorized to rig the commodity markets and indeed is doing so u s rep alex mooney r west virginia objected to the cftc s refusal to answer gata s questions in february he wrote to the cftc himself making gata s questions his own gata org node 18832 mooney also asked the cftc why its own investigation of the silver market from 2008 through 2013 could find no manipulation when the u s justice department and fbi recently obtained a confession from a former trader for jpmorganchase that he had manipulated the silver market and the gold market during that period further mooney asked whether in light of that trader s confession to manipulation the cftc will reopen its investigation of silver market manipulation www gata org files mooney letter cftc 2 5 2019 pdf two months have passed and the cftc has not replied to the congressman either last april mooney performed an even greater service to accountability in government he wrote to the federal reserve and treasury department and asked them to specify which markets they are trading in gata org node 18210 gata org files mooneyletter 04 24 2018 pdf mooney wrote records in the archives of the historian of the u s state department describe u s government policy in recent decades as aiming to drive gold out of the world financial system in favor of the federal reserve note or special drawing rights issued by the international monetary fund is this still u s government policy toward gold if not what is the u s government s current policy toward gold mooney continued i have heard complaints that the u s gold reserve has not been fully audited for many decades particularly as there seems to have been no acknowledgement of or account for swaps and leases of gold or arrangements for such to which the u s government has been a party we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us does the u s government through the treasury department the federal reserve system or any other agency or entity transact in gold or gold derivatives either directly or through intermediaries if so what are those transactions and what are their objectives does the u s government undertake any transactions in gold or gold derivatives through the bank for international settlements bank of england or other central banks or governments if so what are these transactions and their objectives federal reserve chairman jerome powell replied to mooney but only in part powell denied that the fed is trading gold but failed to answer whether the fed is trading in other markets and if so which ones powell said the treasury department would reply on its own behalf but a year has passed and the treasury has not replied apparently an honest answer about secret market intervention by the u s government would be against the u s government s interests an honest answer might reveal that complaints of such secret intervention are far more than conspiracy theory then there have been the usual criminal activities in the gold and silver markets by agents of big investment banks banks that are commonly brokers for the u s government in november last year former jpmorganchase trader john edmonds pleaded guilty in federal court to manipulating the gold and silver markets for about seven years in his confession he says his superiors and other traders at jpmorganchase knew what he was doing and conspired with him gata org node 18596 in october last year the bank of nova scotia whose metals division scotia mocatta is renowned in the gold and silver business a bank that has participated in the daily london gold price setting mechanism admitted to the u s commodity futures trading commission that its traders had used spoofing trades to manipulate the gold and silver markets from 2013 through 2016 gata org node 18531 for this spoofing the cftc fined the bank of nova scotia a mere 800 000 maintaining that the bank deserved such leniency because it had reported itself and deutsche bank which in 2016 agreed to pay nearly 100 million to settle class action lawsuits in the united states charging manipulation of the gold and silver futures markets also agreeing to provide evidence against other banks www reuters com article us deutsche bank settlement silver idusk www reuters com article us deutsche bank settlement gold iduskbn agreed

org node 18622 volcker writes the newly agreed exchange rates and gold price 42 22 in my view would be highly vulnerable to renewed speculation to convey a sense of confidence we should be prepared to intervene collectively to stabilize the gold market in effect to create a new gold pool that unfortunately was not agreed while all of this is hard documentation not mere speculation or conspiracy theory few mainstream news organizations will touch it apparently because it is too sensitive to their governments but sometimes some notice slips through in august last year the hong kong economic journal took note of gata s work in a commentary headlined gata is not wrong gata org node 18701 the hong kong economic journal s essayist shin lin shu wrote gold prices are often artificially depressed indeed as shown by the u s state department cables exposed by wikileaks in 2011 china long has known about gold price suppression by the united states and the u s government knows that china

gold price down so they more easily can acquire real metal to build their reserves www gata org node 18930 this the italian newspaper said was being done in anticipation of the formal remonetization of gold under the so called basel 3 standards devised by the bank for international settlements whereby as of last friday gold in the vault is to be considered an asset as good as cash and government bonds the newspaper s premise echoed the hypothesis published in 2012 by the u s economists paul brodsky and lee quaintance that central banks were redistributing gold reserves in favor of countries with large u s dollar denominated foreign exchange positions to hedge those countries against the devaluation of the dollar and an upward revaluation of gold that would reliquefy dollar overweight central banks www gata org node 11373 what does all this mean to mining companies and their investors first it means that metals and minerals are underpriced along with most commodities because of the price suppression engineered by central banks to defend their currencies and government bonds central banks and governments in the developed world don t want gold silver other metals and other commodities to compete with their currencies as stores of value as the recent acquisition of gold by russia china and other governments suggests gold price suppression has been figured out at last and certain countries are turning to gold to regain financial sovereignty second it means that there is a vast and uncoverable short position in the monetary metals and other strategic commodities thus they have great potential for price appreciation third it means that western central banks are not likely to surrender this short position without a fight or another negotiated international currency revaluation fourth since governments can create infinite money it means that if you are trading against secret trading by the government you are likely to lose fifth it means that if commodity prices ever regain free markets commodity producers should be prepared for stiffer royalty requirements and windfall profits taxes and sixth it means that people in the mining and commodities businesses may have an obligation to their investors and clients to inform them of the opposition of major governments to free markets and higher commodity prices it means we all may have an obligation to clamor for governments to tell us the truth about their surreptitious interventions in the markets for this price suppression works only through deception because it depends entirely on government for its mining claims royalty requirements and enforcement of environmental regulations the mining industry is the industry most vulnerable to government any government can shut down any mining company on any pretext at any time and since the mining industry is also the most capital intensive industry with a billion dollars or more required to start a large mine the industry is also the most dependent for its financing on the major investment banks that are the agents of government in the markets so objecting to price suppression will require courage from the mining industry but if the industry united against price suppression there would be strength in numbers besides the industry s choice may be only whether to die on its knees or risk dying on its feet sometimes the truth is stronger than you

by jim miles the end of the myth from the frontier to the border wall in the mind of america greg grandin metropolitan books henry holt co new york 2019 much of current political news swirls around president trump and his persistent and somewhat pathological prevarications about the mexico u s border and the need to build a border wall while greg grandin s the end of the myth leads up to this current preoccupation it goes well beyond it surveying the whole of the empire and its history to reveal the foundational myth of the u s empire and it is done superbly this is a wonderful work of history drawing the reader in through anecdotal stories and comments combined with a strong factual research background grandin s style of writing avoids the pitfalls of a dry history creating a theme and a storyline that consistently exposes the creation reworking and alterations to the imperial myth as it crosses time and place the frontier in a single word the myth is that of the frontier it is one word that carries cartloads of baggage and contains many other subordinate but necessary mythical structures that support and extend the idea the idea of frontier necessitates the idea of boundaries and borders as the frontier moves so do the boundaries mythological psychological as well as physical it carries along with it the whole mythology most frequently recognized in our modern era with ronald reagan ayn rand clint eastwood margaret thatcher and others of their ilk as rugged individualism and individual liberty unconstrained by governments and rules of society another important associated idea is that of a safety valve this idea was recognized early by the political leaders of the day and still in use today where the frontier served as a release for antagonisms created by the massive influx of immigrants into the already crowded and frequently poverty laden regions of the burgeoning east coast cities as well as antagonisms aimed more directly at their own lies and misdeeds superimposed on it all is racism this invokes more than the racism of slave labour more than the racism of indian removal then military slaughter more than the racism of incoming migrants from many different homelands more than the racism concerning religion and nationalities it is a synergy of them all into a white anglo saxon supremacist ideal where the other really does not matter extending from the rugged individual to corporate internationalism and then yes the wall features of the frontier the frontier and its myths are explored through the history of actions and ideas combined it is a fixed physical construct with forts rivers trails and transportation routes and maps to identify them but it was also a blurry indistinct place where white settlers fled to escape routinization a place that goes on forever it is a multistoried affair where the royal proclamation of 1763 the indian removal act of 1830 and the conflicts with slavery and abolition pushed the boundaries of the frontier into mexican territory and the invasion of 1846 all these wars came to be both valve and throttle with each conflict simultaneously venting the hatreds produced by the last while creating the conditions for the next and as war begets war a state born out of ceaseless expansion could only be maintained through ceaseless expansion 1898 marks a redefinition of the frontier the frontier reached a physical limit in north america and by necessity expanded overseas creating an american history fast turning into an endless public parade of war and more war overseas war had the effect of unifying the country this time not some sections against others but the whole nation the military became the primary means of social mobility allowing both whites and blacks shelter from the capitalist market grandin s history continues through the roosevelt era and into the new deal pre war era after the second world war the frontier was rejuvenated as a future that might be obtained it involved a u s security frontier already established in the western hemisphere now expanded to a global position a major part of that was linking the cold war and its anti communism to a new politics of expansion in particular the global economy as a new frontier globalization in all its manifestations this expanded with reagan with his promises of freedom from restraint with no limits to growth individual and economic rights markets overpowered human and social rights the violence and racism ongoing along the mexican border was redirected to cold war counter insurgencies leading to many more immigrants the u s was still a beacon a magnet for all the pilgrims from all the lost places reagan s successor gwh bush expanded on the frontier idea in the frontiers ahead there are no boundaries nafta one of the big surprises in the book and if i had thought about it carefully should not have been was the emphasis grandin placed on the north american free trade agreement even before the agreement was enacted there were already 1925 work plants in mexico taking advantage of the low wage labour and the lack of labour and environmental regulations with the huge increase in interest rates in 1980 to an average of seventeen percent many u s businesses and farmers lost their livelihoods those same interest rates created a huge debt repayment problem in mexico leading to the imf shock doctrine of austerity privatization cut spending lax foreign investment controls weaken labour laws and stop land reform in short even before nafta mexico had succumbed to u s economic expansion and control nafta affected the poor farmers as subsidized u s corn dairy and pork killed their subsistence living they were forced into cheap wage labour for u s corporations into drug trafficking and into the urban sprawl of mexico city the corporations had their new frontier the blowback to this was increased immigration and the rapid rise in border patrol actions the border patrol was a frontline instrument of white supremacist power the u s became a country that increasingly defines itself by what it hates a decade of free trade neither created an international community of prosperous peace loving nations nor overcome domestic political divisions with the administration of george bush the 9 11 attack offered a chance to turn away from the border and look out at the world anew now clarifying the mission as we will extend the frontiers of freedom turning inwards but as with the vietnam war and the many other smaller counterinsurgencies foreign wars produce domestic disruption as the struggle turns inwards the backlashes to decades of disastrous policies piled up one after the other until the backlash to the backlashes came trump the mexican border wall fits into the underlying racism of u s culture it is a valve that needs to be turned off or on as convenient for political purposes it is also a valve for the many war vets to release their frustrations against a targeted other along with the veterans it allows many others to practice their rugged individualism as vigilantes along the border expressing their racist white supremacism against groups of aliens created in the most part by u s imperial actions trump s new freedom is freedom from constraint his cruelty and hedonism giving permission to many others to accept those actions and also to practice them still more frontiers while grandin focuses on the image of the mexican border wall as a sign of the closure of the frontier he does not delve into contemporary u s military actions around the world the imperial frontier is faltering in many respects as events in ukraine and syria and the failure of past actions in iraq afghanistan and libya have well demonstrated but it is still there perhaps more as bluster and rhetoric as witnessed with venezuela than a true frontier a rhetorical ideological rant to redirect domestic concerns and attempt to somehow keep the empire alive and its frontiers still an active zone the strength of the end of the myth is that it does not take any imagination to extend the myth into other areas of u s foreign policy grandin has explored the myth very effectively highlighting the idea of frontier as it changed over time leaving us with trump as the ultimate characterization of the state of the union at this point in time a fascinating work it defines the psychological mythical constructs of the u s imperial mind very well jim miles is a canadian educator and a regular contributor columnist of opinion pieces and book reviews to palestine chronicles his interest in this topic stems originally from an environmental perspective which encompasses the militarization and economic subjugation of the global community and its commodification by corporate governance and by the american government

the construction and projects country q a tool overview of the construction and projects sector 1 what are the main trends in the local construction and projects market what are the most significant deals the main trends affecting the local construction and project markets are qatar remains the world s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas and it will run its first budget surplus in three years in 2019 due to higher energy prices the surplus is expected to reach qar4 3 billion about usd1 2bn or eur1 billion qatar s economy will grow by 3 1 in 2019 according to the international monetary fund imf the state budget for 2019 focuses on developing new housing areas for nationals enhancing food security projects and establishing infrastructure and facilities in free zones special economic zones and industrial and logistics zones the construction and projects market continues to deliver projects despite the supply chain disruption that followed the imposition of trading restrictions by saudi arabia the uae bahrain and egypt in june 2017 the influence of turkish construction and engineering firms is expected to grow as ankara remains one of the key allies for doha the construction industry s main focus is on completing the projects for the fifa 2022 world cup as well as ongoing projects in healthcare education and transportation with many megaprojects on the brink of completion there is an increased risk of disputes to boost overseas investment in qatar the government has announced economic reforms related to labour laws privatisation free zones and higher foreign ownership limits that will make it easier to invest and operate in the country the main laws are the amended law no 34 of 2005 on investment free zones establishing the free zone authority and the new law no 1 of 2019 regulating the investment of non qatari capital see question 37 major projects qatari diar remains the biggest project client in qatar by value of projects in execution and its usd17 billion mixed use lusail city is still considered one of the biggest projects in the country msheireb downtown doha regeneration project led by qatar foundation and doha metro led by qatar rail are nearing completion other major projects include the fifa world cup 2022 stadiums extension of the new doha port project extension of hamad international airport expressways and road drainage projects run by the public works authority ashghal development of the free zones led by the newly established free zone authority procurement arrangements 2 which are the most common procurement arrangements if the main parties are local are these arrangements different if some or all of the main parties are international contractors or consultants traditional or split procurement where the employer engages a design consultant to design a project and then awards a construction contract to a contractor to construct the project in accordance with that design is most common for local small scale projects design services and construction works procured by local public sector employers are generally awarded by competitive tender pursuant to law no 24 of 2015 on regulation of tenders and auctions tenders law less common in local projects but more popular in large scale international projects are procurement schemes based on design and build or on an engineering procurement and construction epc turnkey approach in a design and build contract the contractor will be responsible for both the design of the project and for the construction works to meet the contractual specification in epc contracts a single contractor is responsible for all design engineering construction and procurement of a project on a turnkey basis other procurement arrangements and forms of contracts including engineering procurement construction management epcm partnering alliancing new engineering contract nec or american institute of architects aia contracts are not popular in qatar transaction structures 3 what transaction structures and corporate vehicles are most commonly used in both local and international projects similarly to procurement arrangements see question 2 transaction structures usually vary according to the size of the project rather than its parties for smaller projects local contractors and consultants usually transact alone as single legal entities the most common corporate structure for such local contractors and consultants is a limited liability company llc for mid size and large projects contractors often a local contractor teaming up with an international contractor will form a consortium or a joint venture most commonly incorporated as a single llc especially when engaged on publicly tendered projects the employer will usually require parent company guarantees from all consortium joint venture partners finance 4 how are projects financed how do arrangements differ for major international projects local and public sector projects are generally government funded it is likely that some of the public sector projects will be increasingly financed by private sector through public private partnerships ppp especially after introduction of the long awaited law on ppps private small or medium sized projects are often financed by local banks either on a conventional or islamic financing basis for major international projects particularly in major oil and gas petrochemical or integrated power and water projects project financing is common security and contractual protections 5 what forms of security and contractual protections do funders typically require to protect their investments security security typically taken by lenders in qatar does not differ significantly from other jurisdictions under the qatar civil code the commercial companies law and the commercial code various forms of security interest are available and these cover the lenders ability to mortgage a registered freehold interest in land and transfer leasehold interests in land assign certain contractual rights to third parties including the rights to debts and receivables provide a commercial mortgage over moveable assets pledge shares in a joint stock company subject to certain qualifications pledge a sum held in a bank account contractual in a government funded project the employer usually requires the contractor to provide performance bonds and advance payment bonds pursuant to the tenders law in addition some public sector clients such as ashghal or qatar rail will often require collateral warranties from sub contractors or sub consultants in favour of the client as well as parent company guarantees from main contractors in major project financed schemes the lenders typically require direct agreements giving them the ability to step into the position of the borrower sponsor in the event of a default under a project contract which might otherwise entitle the project contractor in question to terminate or suspend that contract standard forms of contracts 6 what standard forms of contracts are used for both local and international projects which organisations publish them local projects the majority of contracts are bespoke agreements with regard to small and private sector projects these are often poorly drafted international federation of consulting engineers fidic forms of contract typically the 1999 version are generally the only contract templates recognised countrywide for local projects these are mainly the conditions of contract for construction red book conditions of contract for plan and design build yellow book conditions of contract for epc turnkey projects silver book ashghal uses bespoke forms for various types of their projects from minor to large ashghal has revised its suite of contracts in 2018 to make it more contractor friendly drawing on the drafting style of the fidic suite of contracts astad has also recently prepared its suite of contracts sanad and promotes it among the local construction industry other public sector projects often use their own bespoke forms of contracts which are often heavily amended variations of fidic red or yellow books international projects fidic forms of contracts are common on major international projects bespoke forms are often used contractual issues contractors risks 7 what risks are typically allocated to the contractor how are these risks offset or managed there is no typical risk allocation for construction contracts in qatar however contracts with the public sector typically involve a heavy transfer of risk from the employer to the contractor meaning the contractor often has limited grounds on which to seek an extension to the time for completion or increase in the agreed contract price typical risks allocated to the contractor include risk of non completion on time see question 11 risk of volume of resources in lump sum contracts typically sits with the contractor risk of errors in information provided by the employer depends on the project but quite often information is provided for information only meaning that the risk of inaccuracies is assumed by the contractor risk of unforeseen ground conditions in epc contracts this usually sits with the contractor force majeure see question 10 those risks can be mitigated at the tender stage for example by way of requests for clarifications analysis of the employer s requirement proper programming of works and by way of diligent contract administration and record keeping from the commercial point of view contractors will price those risks and reflect them in the proposed contract price excluding liability 8 how can liability be excluded or restricted under local law limitation of liability clauses are commonly used in construction contracts in qatar and any terms which either exclude or cap damages will be generally enforceable by qatar courts or by extension arbitral tribunals some exceptions include liability resulting from fraud or gross mistake cannot be limited or excluded by the parties to a contract article 259 civil code article 711 of the civil code under which contractors and designers give a guarantee for ten years from project completion decennial liability which covers total or partial collapse of fault in the buildings even if the collapse or fault has resulted from a defect in the land itself or the employer accepted the defective buildings this strict liability cannot be contractually limited or excluded article 715 civil code where damages are pre agreed their amount may not be due if the debtor can show that no loss has been suffered the amount of damages was exaggerated to a considerable degree or the obligation has been partially executed article 266 civil code in those instances the court or by extension arbitral tribunal can reduce the compensation due and any agreement to the contrary will be void this provision is often used by contractors to reduce the amount of liquidated damages agreed in the construction contract in turn the employers cannot apply to the court to claim a higher amount of liquidated damages even if they show that their loss is greater than the pre agreed compensation unless they can show that the debtor contractor or consultant committed fraud or gross mistake article 267 civil code caps on liability 9 do the parties usually agree a cap on liability if yes how is this usually fixed what liabilities if any are typically not capped caps on liability are common in construction contracts there is no typical cap but overall caps on liability typically range from 50 up to 200 of the contract price liability for liquidated damages for delay is often capped at between 5 to 10 of the contract price it is also common to agree on carve outs from the overall liability cap with liabilities or indemnities for intellectual property rights or property damage being often outside the agreed cap under qatar law some liabilities cannot be contractually limited such as liability for fraud or gross mistake article 259 civil code or liability arising from mandatory provisions such as article 711 of the civil code on decennial liability qatar courts retain the discretion to vary any such limitation of liability to make the compensation equal to the actual loss suffered see question 8 force majeure 10 are force majeure exclusions available and enforceable force majeure clauses are commonly seen in construction contracts in qatar and are generally enforceable typically a construction contract defines the force majeure event and provides for various reliefs for parties if such an event occurs usually subject to additional obligations to notify and minimise delay in performance of obligations in the absence of any contractual provisions in this respect various civil code provisions dealing with force majeure will apply for example under article 204 which provides that if a party can demonstrate that a loss has arisen due to an external cause that is not of their making the party is not liable for the damages unless the parties have contractually agreed otherwise further under article 171 2 a debtor can apply to the court or by extension arbitration tribunal to adjust the burdensome obligation to a reasonable level if unforeseen exceptional circumstances occur article 258 permits parties to contractually agree to allocate risks for force majeure to the contractor under article 700 the contractor cannot avoid or vary its contractual obligations as a result of an increase in prices in the market for raw materials labour or other elements but subject to a general principle stated in article 171 2 of the qatar civil code that where fulfilment of the contractual obligation though not impossible becomes excessively onerous a judge can reduce the excessive obligation to a reasonable level 11 what contractual provisions are typically negotiated to cover material delays to the project more sophisticated contracts especially those based on fidic forms provide for an extensive list of circumstances allowing the contractor to be granted an extension of time the extent of relief available to the contractor will depend on the risk profile under the contract but typically these will involve various failures of the employer causing the works to be delayed such as for instance failure to grant to the contractor access to the site on time failure to supply to the contractor agreed facilities information equipment or services failure to obtain approvals within the times prescribed in the contract any other breach of the contract by the employer or any delay or act of prevention attributable to the employer parties to contracts with private employers typically negotiate provisions on liquidated damages compensation for delay as well as variation clauses see question 12 contractors will want to ensure that they are not obliged to pay liquidated damages in circumstances where delay occurred through no fault of the contractor such as in the event of force majeure variations requested by the employer or defaults of third parties the tenders law and its regulations impose own liquidated damages regime for delay which cannot be varied by the contract for instance under this regime liquidated damages for delay must not exceed 10 of the total contract value 12 what contractual provisions are typically negotiated to cover variations to the works on public sector projects of all sizes contract terms with the client including provisions on variations are rarely negotiable in medium to large scale contracts with private sector employers provisions on variation often adopt the fidic approach the parties typically negotiate what constitutes a variation whether contractor may initiate a variation pricing of varied works contractor s entitlement to relief arising out of the variation and time limits for bringing a claim concerning variations under the civil code in a measurement contract a contractor is entitled to claim an increase in the costs if the actual costs based on an agreed design exceed the estimated measurements in turn the employer can terminate this contract if the difference in costs is significantly high article 708 civil code in a lump sum contract a contractor cannot claim any relief for costs unless amendments or additions to the agreed design were caused by the employer or the employer authorised the changes in design article 709 civil code other negotiated provisions 13 what other contractual provisions are usually heavily negotiated by the parties in addition to the clauses set out in questions 8 to 12 it is common to negotiate the following terms of the construction contract payment terms requirement to provide bonds parent company guarantees and collateral warranties termination and suspension rights subcontracting taking over and completion intellectual property rights any back to back provisions with other project agreements architects engineers and construction professionals 14 how are construction professionals usually selected following selection how are they formally appointed construction professionals can be selected in various ways depending on the nature and scope of the project on public sector projects they will be usually selected through a public tender process in accordance with the tenders law on private sector commercial projects competitive tenders are carried out typically only for mid size to large scale projects in any selection process price personal contacts recommendations and contractor s reputation play and important role the appointment is under a contract or an engagement retainer letter 15 what provisions of construction professionals appointments are most heavily negotiated are liabilities commonly limited or capped in construction professionals appointments negotiated provisions consultants often have little or no opportunity to negotiate contract terms with a public sector client bound by the tenders law in private sector appointments the most heavily negotiated provisions typically include payment terms liquidated damages compensation for delay requirement to provide bonds parent company guarantees and collateral warranties levels of professional indemnity insurance standard of skill and care to be adopted by the consultant intellectual property rights any back to back provisions with the construction contract or other project agreements liability subject to mandatory provisions of law see question 8 the consultant s liability is commonly capped at 100 to 200 of the consultant s fee liability for indirect or consequential losses is often excluded payment for construction work 16 what are the usual methods of payment for construction work are there ways for the contractor and consultants to secure payment or mitigate risks of non payment under local law methods of payment typically the contractor is paid in arrears either periodically for example monthly or on achieving certain milestones construction contracts usually provide for certification of the requested payments by the employer or engineer payments to contractors and consultants are usually made directly into a bank account held in qatar late payments are common both in private and public sector contracts in public sector contracts often due to employer s reliance on funds to be obtained from the ministry of finance advance payments for construction works of between 10 and 15 of the value of the works are common and the contractor is typically required to provide the employer with the advance payment bond securing the repayment of the advance payment under the tenders law advance payment bond is required with some exceptions to contractors being small and medium sized enterprises securing payment from a commercial point of view to minimise the risk of loss contractors often expect payments to be heavily front loaded by substantial advance payments or otherwise this is often not achievable in relation to public sector contracts payment guarantees from the employer are not very common but letters of credit are sometimes used especially in small to medium projects contractually sophisticated contractors want to ensure that payment certification provisions are unambiguous and that any variations are precisely dealt with in the contract as always meticulous contract administration helps in managing this risk pay when paid clauses are common and enforceable in subcontracts however sub contractors have a right to claim payments directly from the employer for the work that is due to be paid by the main contractor article 702 civil code contractors also usually want to expressly incorporate a right to interest for late payment within their contracts courts or by extension arbitral tribunals can nullify such provision where they consider the interest rate exorbitant in many public works contracts if that payment is delayed the contractor has the right to receive additional allowance for the cost of financing on such delayed payment usually at a fixed rate referenced to the qatar central bank annual minimum lending rate subcontractors 17 how do the parties typically manage their relationships with subcontractors sub contracts and sub consultancy agreements usually incorporate provisions from the main contract with the employer to ensure that the risks and liabilities that are relevant to the sub contract are back to back with the main agreement typically sub contractors and sub consultants are required to comply with the main agreement under the main contract the contractor is often obliged to deliver to the employer or engineer a collateral warranty signed by the key sub contractor allowing the employer direct recourse against the sub contractor further the main contract often requires that the contractor obtains prior consent from the employer to any sub contract subcontract incorporates certain provisions listed in the main contract contractor not terminate the sub contract without the employer s or engineer s consent contractor provides the employer or engineer with details of any dispute under the sub contract which may delay the project licensing 18 what licences and other consents must contractors and construction professionals have to carry out local construction work are there any specific licensing requirements for international contractors and construction professionals unless registered in qatar financial centre or any of the free zones all entities carrying on business in qatar must be properly registered with the ministry of commerce and industry each individual or each office performing engineering works in qatar must obtain a licence from the licensing committee in accordance with the law no 19 of 2005 on engineering profession the requirements for obtaining an engineering licence are extensive and the definition of engineering is also very broadly construed for example architects and other designers usually fall into the definition of engineer for these purposes the licence takes time to obtain and has many fixed criteria such as the requirement for numbers of professionals on the ground in qatar arabic language skills and locally procured insurance as a rule international engineering offices need to be registered as well however there are certain exceptions for instance if they are contracted to provide certain technical services required in the public interest 19 what licences and other consents must a project obtain before this will vary according to the nature of the project and its location typically before the project commences the following licences and consents must be obtained planning permission from the ministry of municipality and environment and approval of file opening fire safety clearance from the civil defence clearance for power and water service from qatar general electricity and water corporation kahramaa building permits from the ministry of municipality and environment during during the project various authorities have a right to inspect the project in addition some consents are required depending on the nature of the works or tasks concerned for instance consents are needed when transporting special hazardous or heavy goods on completion on completion typically the following are required fire safety approval from the civil defence certificate of completion from the ministry of municipality and environment registration of the building with the municipality utilities supply and connections projects insurance 20 what types of insurance must be maintained by law are other non compulsory types of insurance maintained under contract compulsory insurance architects and engineering offices are required to have certain insurances particularly professional indemnity pi insurance while registered in qatar vehicles must also be insured non compulsory insurance generally it is up to the parties to the contract to agree on any insurance programme required for the given project typically contractors are required to take out and maintain all risks insurance employment laws 21 what are the main requirements for hiring local and foreign workers local workers in line with the qatarisation policy governmental initiative devised to increase the number of qatari citizens employed in public and private sectors the labour law gives priority to qatari nationals over non qataris when an employer is seeking to fill a role qatari nationals seeking jobs can register with the ministry of labour for potential job placements foreign workers employers are given a quota of different nationalities from which they can hire and which must not be exceeded employers seeking to hire non qataris will have to first obtain permission from the government and once obtained they will need to apply for a work visa so that the employee can enter qatar to work and reside in qatar employees need to obtain a residence permit 22 which employment laws are relevant to projects construction employees are subject to the labour law no 14 of 2004 as amended labour law employees of governmental entities are subject to law no 15 of 2016 on civil human resources human resources law apart from these laws some employment affairs are regulated by special laws and or project specific employment rules 23 must an employer pay statutory redundancy or other payments at the end of a project are all employees eligible there is no requirement to pay statutory redundancy at the end of a project however employees who were employed for more than one continuous year are entitled to an end of service gratuity benefit for each complete year of their service the amount of the gratuity is as agreed on by the parties provided that it is not less than a three week basic salary excluding any allowances or benefits for every year of employment any partial year of service is calculated on a pro rata basis the end of service gratuity is not payable when the employee has been dismissed without notice in circumstances provided for in the labour law for instance when the employee violates more than once the written instructions of the employer concerning safety at work health and safety 24 which health and safety laws apply to projects there are several laws setting out health and safety requirements relevant to projects in qatar the key provisions governing health and safety are found in part 10 the labour law and in ministerial decisions implementing it in addition to the provisions under the labour law the government established the national committee of occupational health and safety within the ministry of administrative development labour and social affairs which is responsible for high level policy and enforcement environmental issues 25 which local laws regulate projects effects on the environment air water waste there is a range of environmental laws in qatar but law no 30 of 2002 on environment protection environment law regulates the most relevant aspects of protection of air and water and waste treatment as a rule the project owner must take all necessary precautions and measures to prevent air or water pollution in major projects contractors are typically required to submit to the employer engineer a construction environmental management system which ensures compliance with any environmental requirements it is common for employers to impose penalties for environmental infringements environmental impact assessments eias the environment law and the executive bye law provides for the procedural framework of obtaining clearance through submission and approval of eias the supreme council for the

increased in popularity in the qatar construction sector see question 26 26 do new buildings need to meet carbon emissions or climate change targets new buildings do not need to meet specific carbon emissions or climate change targets however qatar actively promotes the concept of green buildings and encourages following green building practices especially in public sector projects qatar has established its own building certification system called global sustainability assessment system gsas formerly qatar sustainability assessment system qsas and has incorporated qsas into the qatar construction specifications qcs making the implementation of certain criteria mandatory for buildings developed in qatar most of the buildings developed by ashghal and the ministry of municipality and environment are gsas certified in addition many new developments are under the leadership in environmental energy and design leed certification system for example most of the buildings in msheireb downtown doha and education city prohibiting corrupt practices 27 are there any rules prohibiting corrupt business practices and bribery particularly any rules targeting the projects sector what are the applicable civil or criminal penalties rules the state of qatar has ratified several international and regional conventions relevant to combating corruption which have the force of law at national level in accordance with the constitution of qatar amiri decree no 6 of 2015 mandated the administrative control and transparency authority to implement the united nations convention against corruption which was ratified by qatar in 2007 in qatar it is punishable among other things for public officers to ask or accept a bribe for him herself or another party or to seek a bribe after the event to offer a bribe to a public officer even if the bribe is declined for any employee to ask for a bribe for his her benefit or for that of another party for money or a benefit or a promise of something in return without the knowledge of his employer and his consent to undertake any of the duties assigned to him or abstain from so doing articles 140 to 147 of the qatar penal code in addition under the tenders law the public works contract is deemed terminated if it is proved that the contractor has attempted directly or indirectly to bribe a public official under the labour law and the human resources law employees including ministry governmental and public authority employees are prohibited from accepting gifts or payments in the course of their employment penalties the offence of bribing a public officer carries a penalty of five years imprisonment and a fine of up to qar15 000 applies to any person who receives money or a benefit pretending that it is bribery for an officer while he she intends to keep it or part of it any person who receives money or profit while knowing its purpose even if the officer intended to receive the bribery did not appoint him her or did not know about him provided that he she is not an intermediary in the bribery with respect to offences relating to being bribed the penalties are up to ten years imprisonment and a fine of what was received or promised but not less than qr5 000 for a public official seven years imprisonment and a fine of up to qar15 000 applies to a public officer who accepts money or benefit from a person for doing not doing something relating to his her office or seeks to obtain such a reward up to three years imprisonment and or a fine of up to qar15 000 for an employee who asks for a bribe dismissal from office and confiscation of the bribe bankruptcy or insolvency 28 what rights do the client and funder have on the contractor s bankruptcy or insolvency all insolvency proceedings are conducted under the supervision of the court under chapter 6 of the qatar commercial code article 653 of the commercial code provides for the court to consent to any distribution of assets of an insolvent entity in contracts an employer often has a right to terminate the contract for the contractor s default in the event of the contractor s insolvency public private partnerships 29 are public private partnerships ppps common in local construction projects if so which sectors commonly use ppps historically high revenues from liquefied natural gas have meant that the qatar government has been able to fund its energy and infrastructure needs without private sector involvement notable exceptions were the independent power and water project in ras laffan procured by kahramaa in 2015 qatar s first true ppp various concession projects for workers accommodation facilities and build operate transfer projects bots in the real estate sector however interest in ppp projects is increasing and qatar is currently working on legislation to facilitate ppps the adoption of the new law is expected to be followed by a government supported list of ppp projects to be implemented in various sectors including transport healthcare and education 30 what local laws apply to public private partnerships ppps there is currently no statutory or regulatory framework which specifically applies to ppps in qatar see question 29 ppps in qatar including various concessions and bot projects are implemented on the basis of general legislation including the civil code and the tenders law 31 what is the typical procurement or tender process in a public private partnership ppp transaction does the government or another body publish standard forms of ppp project agreements and related contracts there is no typical procurement or tender process in a ppp transaction in qatar and there are no standard forms of ppp project agreements or related contracts it is expected that once the ppp market matures some of the government entities will develop their standard form of a ppp contract similar to standard forms of construction contracts and other project agreements that have been developed by them in the past dispute resolution 32 which are the most common formal dispute resolution methods used which courts and arbitration organisations deal with construction disputes formal dispute resolution methods litigation in the qatar courts is the most common formal dispute resolution method for small and medium size projects and the majority of disputes with public sector entities all proceedings in local courts are carried out in arabic and all documents must be translated into arabic during the proceedings the court often appoints a construction expert to provide an expert report and this report is often heavily relied upon by the judge arbitration is less popular in public sector contracts this is because under the tenders law the parties to a publicly tendered contract may resort to arbitration to settle a dispute only upon the approval of the minister of finance this law does not apply among others to qatar petroleum qp and qp regularly provides for arbitration in its contracts some other major employers such as qatar rail as well as many private sector entities engaging in medium to large projects have arbitration clauses in their contracts most adopt the international chamber of commerce icc rules with doha as the seat of the arbitration and english as the language of the proceedings courts and arbitration organisations there are no specialised construction courts in qatar and any construction disputes can be heard initially before the court of first instance then on appeal before the court of appeal and finally before the court of cessation where a construction contract provides for arbitration the relevant local institutions are qatar international court and dispute resolution centre qicdrc this was established by qfc law no 2 of 2009 amending certain provisions of the qatar financial centre qfc and consists of a first instance circuit and an appellate circuit qicdrc covers civil and commercial disputes that arise between qfc registered companies the qfc itself or entities which the qfc or a qfc registered company has contracted with qatar international centre for conciliation and arbitration qicca qicca was established within the qatar chamber of commerce and industry by decision no 5 8 of 2006 the qicca is located in doha and has its own arbitration rules where the parties have chosen the qicca as the forum for their arbitration the rules are modelled on the uncitral arbitration rules 33 what are the most commonly used alternative dispute resolution adr methods sophisticated construction contracts will usually provide for a multi tier dispute resolution procedure which requires a dispute to be referred in the first instance to an engineer a mutually appointed expert or to senior management of the parties before the parties resort to the court or arbitral tribunal dispute adjudication boards are not common although one developer barwa has used dabs on several of its projects obtaining positive feedback from all stakeholders informal negotiation aimed at resolving the dispute amicably is often used especially before initiating any court proceedings or arbitration other adr methods including mediation are not yet popular tax 34 what are the main tax issues arising on projects there are no taxes particular to the construction sector generally apart from customs duties on imports of certain construction materials 10 corporate tax is applicable to all construction companies unless they are fully owned by qatari nationals further a withholding tax of 7 is applicable on non resident income commissions brokerage fees and other payments made to non residents for services carried out partly or wholly in qatar there are currently no plans to introduce value added tax vat in 2019 in construction contracts the contractor is typically liable for the payment of all taxes levied by authorities in relation to the construction works and the employer especially if government related often reserves the right to withhold the payment to the contractor pending demonstration of compliance with applicable tax regulations in qatar 35 are any methods commonly used to mitigate tax liability on projects are there any tax incentives to carry out regeneration projects mitigating tax the industry is expected to explore tax mitigation methods once the vat law is introduced see question 34 tax incentives tax exemptions can be granted to certain projects supporting critical areas of economy such as agriculture or tourism but presently there are no tax incentives applicable specifically to carrying out regeneration projects under new law no 1 of 2019 raw materials and semi manufactured items for production which are not available in the local market will be exempted from custom duties on their imports other requirements for international contractors 36 are there any specific requirements that international contractors or construction professionals must comply with see question 18 reform 37 are there any proposals to reform construction and projects law a few new laws and regulations either recently enacted such as new law no 1 of 2019 regulating the investment of the non qatari capital in economic activity see below or planned to be adopted in near future such as the new law on ppps see question 29 will inevitably have an impact on the construction and projects market in qatar the new law on non qatari investments is aimed at opening the way for foreign investors to have 100 ownership in all sectors and support investors entry into the qatari market the law offers investment incentives including allocation of land to non qatari investors to establish investment and certain import and tax reliefs it remains to be seen how this law will be implemented in practice yet it is widely perceived as a major step to further open up the qatari economy qatar has delayed plans to introduce vat initially anticipated for 2019 to our knowledge there are currently no other proposals specifically related to the reform of construction law
from birch gold group this week your news to know rounds up the latest news involving precious metals and the overall economy stories include why the fed s policy shift is good for gold russia is dumping u s dollars in favor of gold and how silver often takes first place for both collectors and investors the fed s policy u turn is decidedly good for gold last week the federal reserve announced that it will probably not hike interest rates at all this year and downgraded its growth forecast for 2019 according to a recent article on kitco the announcement shot down market expectations that 2019 would see a minimum of two rate hikes perhaps more importantly the dovish sentiment by fed officials stood out in stark contrast to the hawkish rhetoric of 2018 gold prices fell immediately after the announcement and have lingered around the 1 300 level but to john reade chief market strategist at the world gold council there is no question that the fed s latest meeting was a highly bullish development for gold the general consensus is that tightening cycles place downwards pressure on gold prices and the latest wrap up will remove a major hurdle for the already well performing metal furthermore the previous two ends to hiking cycles resulted in significant long term gains for gold in the latter case when the fed stopped raising rates in 2007 gold prices wound up nearly 20 higher within 12 months of the policy change the dollar has held up so far yet many of its supporting factors such as economic weakness in europe and emerging market volatility also strongly support gold after the fed s announcement reade is certain that the greenback s persistent strength will soon begin to wane there are other historical precedents that point to good things in store for the yellow metal as nearly every hiking cycle in the u s has triggered a recession there is reason to believe that a crisis could be looming especially given the now confirmed growth slowdown with equities teetering on the brink of a prolonged bearish cycle reade believes investors should seize the opportunity and bolster their portfolio with a significant gold allocation russia is dumping u s dollar to hoard even more gold bullion russia s quest to rid itself of u s currency in favor of gold has been well documented according to newsmax the country has continually led the way in central bank purchases by a wide margin and the trend of voracious acquisitions appears to be intensifying data from russia s central bank shows that the country s holding of gold rose by one million ounces in february the most since november the country s appetite for gold has led some to believe that russia s own mines could soon be depleted and that the nation s officials will proceed to import gold to meet their goals last year marked the first time that bullion demand exceeded mine supply we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us analysts have started to speculate on the potential impact of the so called de dollarization on the global economy although russia s purchases will be hard to beat newsmax reports several central banks have already shown a desire to diversify their reserves away from the dollar and into gold french president emmanuel macron recently told cnn that he feels as if european companies are too reliant on the greenback the comments come after a record year in terms of central bank gold purchases one that saw countries around the world buy more than 600 tons of bullion combined poland hungary and several other nations surprised market watchers with multi ton gold purchases in 2018 supporting the notion that global central banks are moving away from the dollar what this will mean for the global reserve currency remains to be seen although it s clear that intense central bank buying has done much to support gold prices oleg kouzmin a former bank of russia official and chief economist at the renaissance capital in moscow said that russia is also motivated to purchase bullion due to growing geopolitical risks how silver often takes first place for both collectors and investors while silver is sometimes treated as a runner up to gold a recent article by greysheet revealed how the metal has frequently shed its second place moniker to become a preferred investment among collectors silver coins are frequently the most sought after possession whether it s for standard mints or rare and valuable pieces this like the metal s myriad of industrial uses serves to showcase silver s versatility and oft underestimated potential yet despite silver s perpetual foothold in numismatics and manufacturing it is most often talked about as an investment over the past four decades silver has enjoyed numerous bull markets that have seen the metal s price shoot up multi fold these periods were generally brought about by economic hardship and nowhere was this more apparent than in the 1979 1981 stretch a time of high unemployment high interest rates and double digit inflation during that time silver approached values of 50 an ounce or 115 in today s inflation adjusted terms while the dire three year stretch may not be repeated to the same extent there are reasons to believe that 2019 will be a year of hardship for many americans for some the most prominent has been the u s china trade standoff which could somewhat ironically result in heightened unemployment in the u s besides numerous other threats to the domestic and global economy there is also the issue of a dwindling silver mine supply with equally worrisome prospects all this is happening during a time when silver is by most accounts trading at bargain prices many analysts concur that the metal s price is ripe for an increase of up to 25 based on historic data to greysheet however significant price gains are merely icing on the cake the greysheet article says silver investment should be seen for what it is a guard against inflation a chance to obtain something of tangible value and a guaranteed store of wealth even during times when all other asset classes and currencies betray the confidence of their holders

federal reserve chair jerome powell says that the growth of economic activity has slowed the usually optimistic international monetary fund projects u s economic growth will drop to 1 8 percent in 2020 despite trillion dollar annual deficits and the fed putting off any more interest rate hikes for the rest of the year if powell and the projections are right the long recovery that began after the obama administration saved an economy that was in free fall is nearing its end yet president donald trump trumpets the best economy ever touting low unemployment so this is what we get at the height of recovery this is as good as it gets it s true that wages have begun to rise a bit with demand for workers and minimum wage hikes in states and localities finally giving a boost to those on the bottom but the average weekly pay has grown less than 1 percent per year for the decade low wage workers hourly pay in 2017 barely surpassed what they earned in 1979 while that of high wage workers has increased nearly 50 percent inequality is at extremes not seen since 1928 workers are still not capturing a fair share of the increased productivity that they help to create and while incomes have stagnated key costs have soared health care remains remarkably expensive millions go without insurance or are underinsured gallup reports that since trump took office the number of americans without health insurance has increased by a stunning 7 million female younger and lower income workers have seen a greater decline than those who are male older and or wealthier life expectancy has declined for the third year in a row the lack of health care explains part of that the savage opioid epidemic a disease of despair accounts for another chunk student debt continues to build 44 million americans hold 1 5 trillion in student loans second only to housing debt for borrowers leaving school in 2017 the average debt was at 28 650 not surprisingly given the financial pressures nearly one third of 18 to 34 year olds live with their parents delinquency and default devastating reversals for young borrowers are rising 7 7 million borrowers are either in default or in forbearance racking up higher debts our retirement crisis grows worse as well 45 percent of americans report that they have zero savings for retirement a similar amount not surprisingly expects to be financially insecure when elderly companies continue to eliminate pension plans most small businesses don t even offer 401 k plans nor have we used the recovery to head off real and growing challenges the threat of climate change grows by the season our infrastructure remains dangerously decrepit trump s top end and corporate tax cuts worsened inequality without producing a surge in investment as corporations used the tax breaks to pay out dividends or buy back their own stocks boosting executive bonuses this list could go on and under current assumptions these are the good times trump wants his people to applaud all the winning that he s doing he wants credit for the good economy but he s basically stayed with the traditional conservative republican playbook cutting taxes for the wealthiest first slashing protections for workers and consumers throwing money at the pentagon while seeking to cut back domestic investments remaining bizarrely in denial about climate change progressive democrats have begun to call for bold reforms medicare for all the green new deal a 15 minimum wage empowering workers getting big money out of politics and reversing growing corporate concentration not because as republicans put it democrats have lurched into socialism nor is it because of trump derangement syndrome although that surely is widespread it s because the current arrangement doesn t work for working people even when it is as good as it gets americans aren t tired of winning they are tired of struggling hard merely to stay afloat trumpism has failed them even at the height of the recovery it s time for a completely new deal katrina vanden heuvel editor and publisher of the nation magazine writes a weekly online column for the washington post
adnan r khan politicians who bullied their way to power through fear like trump and turkey s erdogan have failed to delivered economic prosperity and voters are noticing two political failures less than five months apart offer some hope that the rampant right wing populism we re seeing around the world today will pass first back in november last year u s voters delivered a noteworthy rebuke to the leadership of president donald trump in midterm elections on march 31 turkish voters punished their president recep tayyip erdogan with a defeat in local elections that many observers here are calling a pivotal moment of change in turkish politics the specific reasons for the losses were somewhat different but the similarities were striking in the lead up to the midterms worried about losing their majority in the house of representatives republican candidates leaned heavily on trump s popularity with their conservative base at campaign rallies trump was the focus of attention with candidates taking a back seat to his ranting oratory it seemed the election was less about local issues and more the trumpian vision for america and its place in the world what was ignored was what mattered most to voters health care jobs declining incomes and a precarious economic future the republicans lost the house in a landslide in turkey the governing ak party also concerned about losing control over local politics in its municipal elections turned to their own popular and populist leader erdogan embarked on an epic campaign in support of the ak party s candidates for mayor in cities across turkey delivering as many as eight speeches a day like trump he eschewed local issues like turkey s deepening economic crisis rampant inflation or high unemployment he barely acknowledged the candidates he was supposed to be endorsing instead he talked about the greatness of turkey the threats it faced and how only the ak party and presumably erdogan himself could lead the nation to the global eminence it deserves at the polls turks punished the ak party for it the capital ankara and the economic hub istanbul turkey s biggest cities and for years ak party strongholds both fell to the opposition people s republican party or chp though the ak party is challenging the tight results in istanbul other cities that had been under ak party control fell too in both cases trump and erdogan turned politics into a personality cult erdogan made this election about his leadership and his vision for turkey ilter turan professor emeritus of political science and international relations at istanbul s bilgi university said and now he will have to deal with the fallout of the ak party s defeat is populist leadership failing not everywhere of course but in western democracies at least the experiment with right wing populism appears to have run into a few snags with brexit britain s right wing ideologues have hurtled their country down the path of economic crisis in hungary prime minister viktor orban s populist economic policies including slashing borrowing costs and opening the floodgates to cheap credit have triggered concerns at the european central bank in italy the anti immigrant and anti eu coalition government led by giuseppe conti can t seem to get anything done populists in all of these countries not to mention trump and erdogan bullied their way into office through fear of immigrants socialists liberals or anything else that has the scent of non traditional values and have maintained their power through a toxic blend of populist economic policies and keeping up the façade of enemies constantly plotting the destruction of the nations they govern what they have failed to do is deliver on the prosperity their nationalist policies were supposed to produce erdogan is the longest serving example when he came to power in 2002 he promised to transform turkey s economy for years he seemed to be succeeding by 2013 gdp per capita had nearly quadrupled according to the world bank massive infrastructure projects transformed turkey s cities and foreign investors flocked to what looked like the golden goose of the emerging economic world order but the boom was built of a house made of cards much of the economic growth rested on government spending and cheap credit when the crunch time came the illusion of prosperity crumbled now turkey faces its worst economic crisis in two decades the problem according to gunduz findikcioglu the chief economist at dunya newspaper turkey s leading economic publication lies in how ideologically driven populist leaders like erdogan and trump are so enamoured with their own worldviews that they are incapable of digesting contrary facts they have such strong views that they don t listen to experts he says they believe they and they alone are right on occasion they may cede to advisors but it usually doesn t last and they return to beliefs that have no basis in any logical economic theory erdogan for instance has shocked economists by claiming that the way to control inflation is to lower interest rates trump has said that tariffs are a net benefit to the u s economy but recent data shows they are costing the u s 1 4 billion a month that disconnect from reality ultimately produces a cost at the ballot box in the u s most economists agree that the real pain from trump s economic policies are yet to come crises they say often take years to emerge after the policies generating them are implemented in turkey that economic reckoning is now the loss of istanbul was especially painful for erdogan whose years as its mayor propelled him to the national stage under his rule however the ak party and its political predecessors have lost the city for the first time since 1994 fortunately for him there won t be another election in turkey until 2023 enough time to right the economic course but will he as recently as last week he again argued that turkey s central bank needs to lower interest rates to bring inflation under control and blamed the economic crisis on a u s led plot to destroy turkey through economic warfare ignoring warnings from business leaders and economists that what turkey needs most is to reassure investors it is prepared to make the necessary structural reforms to inject predictability into its markets trump has less time according to economic predictions the u s will face the brunt of the negative impacts of his economic policies in 2020 an election year it seems unlikely he will shift course before then or even if he does if there will be enough time for any shifts to work their way into the economy whether he pays for it at the ballot box remains to be seen but the record of populist leaders suggests he s in for a rough ride people will put their ideological beliefs aside when their economic prosperity is at stake and the only thing populists know is how to push ideological buttons when it comes to economic levers they pull with reckless abandon and they fail more by adnan r khan
the opening plenum of the boao forum for asia annual conference 2019 is held on march 28 xinhua the coastal town of boao in hainan province is blessed with all the necessary elements for a popular

conference concluding the forum the message this conference wishes to convey is unequivocal we are on the same planet in the same boat and with a shared future said bfa chairman ban ki moon at the opening plenum there is no alternative solution to our common challenges such as climate change income inequality and sustainable growth we must work together under the multilateral framework through close coordination cooperation and dialogue and with concerted actions a globalized world the forum was held amid a downturn in international trade and investment and rising protectionism the world economy shows weakening momentum with growing uncertainties and volatility recently major international institutions have lowered their expectations for world economic growth in 2019 on march 28 while addressing the opening plenum premier li keqiang stressed that all parties should work together to uphold the un centered international system and rules based multilateral trading system and advance reform in the global governance system decades of progress in economic globalization has shaped a sophisticated international division of labor and linked up the industrial innovation and value chains of various countries making them ever more interdependent in economic development premier li said in the face of world economic headwinds and other common challenges no country can stay immune or resolve all the problems he called on countries to seek mutually beneficial cooperation and boost world economic development with an open mind an inclusive approach and concerted actions the trajectory of the world economy after the second world war shows that multilateralism is the right way to ensure lasting prosperity and development premier li commented china stands for fair trade and has taken concrete actions to uphold fairness and equity the lack of which would make trade unsustainable he said leaders from other countries and some business elites have also reiterated their support for globalization free trade and multilateralism from their respective perspectives li baodong noted the bfa secretary general said that participants called for developing an open world economy and agreed that countries must adapt to globalization rather than resist it and moreover they should rebuild confidence in multilateralism multilateralism is an important guarantee for globalization said chen deming former minister of commerce noting that china adheres to multilateralism complemented with regional cooperation under the multilateral system differentiated economic and trade treatment for developing countries addresses the imbalances of development in different regions and enables relatively fair competition between emerging countries and developed countries he said liu zhenmin un under secretary general also stated his support for multilateralism in global governance i am very concerned about the threats to globalization and the consequences of the absence of multilateralism on global governance he warned unilateral actions aggravate confrontation between countries said james bacchus director of the center for global economic and environmental opportunity at the university of central florida he is a founding judge and former chairman of the appellate body of the world trade organization wto only by working together can the value of the wto and its 164 members be given full play bacchus said lakhdar brahimi former un and arab league joint special representative for syria and former foreign minister of algeria expressed his frustration with unilateralism if one country any country does not follow the rules it will be bad he said if a country just stands its own ground and imposes its ideas on others this cold war mentality is typical unilateralism he said stating that countries should advocate multilateralism and revitalize international organizations revamping governance the existing global governance system was established after world war ii and has existed for more than 70 years but in recent years the rise of unilateralism protectionism and populism has posed unprecedented challenges to the system while a good number of bfa participants advocate multilateralism they also believe the current global governance system needs an overhaul the world economic system rests on three pillars namely the international monetary fund the world bank and the wto said jin liqun president of the asian infrastructure investment bank he said that the system set up decades ago no longer fits since the balance of economic power has changed over seven decades many things have changed and many developed countries have lost their competitiveness in many sectors this has led to domestic problems in these countries because they refuse to reform on their own and instead look to blame other countries he said on the global level the system needs to be overhauled at a domestic level you have to reform and adapt he added we should sit down and reform the multilateral system in order to adapt to changes in the world s political and economic pattern the global governance system should be moved toward a fairer and more equitable direction in order to provide stronger support to global growth premier li said however he also stressed that reform does not mean starting all over again or serving the interests of a handful of countries premier li reiterated that china supports necessary reforms to the wto but insisted that its basic principles and core values must be adhered to the interests and concerns of all parties must be effectively addressed and the differences in countries development levels must be factored in in particular much attention needs to be given to protecting the rights and interests of developing countries and narrowing the north south gap he said a great challenge for the wto is that it is being marginalized said chong quan president of the china society for world trade organization studies pointing out that the most pressing issue for the wto is to revitalize its dispute settlement mechanism resolving trade disputes is one of the wto s core activities its members have agreed to use the multilateral system of settling disputes instead of taking unilateral action the wto s dispute settlement body decides the outcome of a trade dispute on the recommendation of the dispute panel and for appealed cases on a report from the appellate body the appellate body is made up of seven permanent members with each serving a four year term an appeal must be heard by at least three judges at present due to various reasons such as judges poor health or the expiration of their term the appellate body urgently needs to add new members the selection process for members can only be started with a unanimous agreement by all wto members however due to u s obstruction it has been difficult to start the judge selection process meanwhile understaffing will soon result in a backlog of trade disputes or even the paralysis of the organization currently bacchus said the appellate body has only three members and in december there will only be one judge left leaving the wto dispute solution system bogged down posing an existential crisis he suggested that the number of appellate body staff should be increased from seven to 10 and that they should be full time rather than part time in addition he proposed that some members be allowed to serve a second term the wto decision making body is not efficient enough which is one of the reasons why it is facing problems said zhou xiaochuan vice chairman of the bfa and former governor of the people s bank of china he said that in 2008 when the global financial crisis broke out the leaders of the group of 20 strongly pushed forward the doha development round and hoped to reach an agreement as soon as possible however after so many years the progress of the doha round is still unsatisfactory indicating that the mechanism is not efficient enough and needs reform carlos gutierrez former u s secretary of commerce said he believes that the wto s failure to keep pace with the times is also a cause of many of its problems he said technology has evolved very fast and the wto has not caught up with what has developed or what is coming gutierrez noted that rebuilding confidence in multilateralism is crucial to the success of wto reform we have an administration that does not like multilateralism he said referring to the donald trump administration s withdrawal from a number of international treaties entering multilateral treaties is an expression of sovereignty while the current administration in washington believes the contrary he explained zhou also pointed out that the prerequisite for wto reform is that member states should have a sincere desire if most countries support multilateralism wto reform will be agreed upon and progress will be made he said a shared future through these brainstorming discussions this conference has achieved some very important consensus such as strengthening international cooperation building an open world economy persistently promoting structural reform pursuing high quality development and driving economic development through innovation including in technology process institution and concept li baodong said in his summary of the four day conference while hailing the conference as a feast of ideas he also called on people to act together in the interest of all here in boao let s bring our voices together now showing that we share the same future and will not wait until after the earth wanders as depicted in the sci fi movie the wandering earth he suggested putting aside conflicts and disputes and focusing on common development after an intellectually intense day you may want to enjoy the starry night of this small coastal town li baodong told participants if viewed from the vast universe the earth which is inhabited by over 7 billion people is nothing but a tiny spot making any conflict or dispute happening in this world simply insignificant copyedited by rebeca toledo
nine months ago as us treasury yields were drifting lower from a seven year high reached in may of last year we pointed out a curious development in the market for us sovereign debt that to our complete lack of surprise had been overlooked by the mainstream financial press in april and may russia s central bank liquidated 81 billion in treasurys nearly its entire holdings the drop was so significant that russia fell off the treasurys list of the 30 or so largest treasury holders and in the months that have followed as the us has imposed more economic sanctions and feuded with putin over the fate of venezuelan leader nicolas maduro vladimir putin has turned instead to alternative reserves as the country s de dollarization push continued over the same period of time russia was a conspicuously large buyer of chinese yuan as goldman sachs noted and as we highlighted well earlier today helping contribute to a spike in yuan buying by reserve managers last year as the imf pointed out in a recent report but given the yuan s still limited convertibility it has its limitations as a reliable reserve for foreign central banks which is probably why moscow has relied on another reserve option that s popularity has endured for most of the history of human civilization gold data from the russian central bank cited by bloomberg show that its gold reserves have nearly quadrupled over the past ten years and that 2018 marked the most ambitious year yet for russia gold buying which coincided with the central bank of russia s mass dumping of its treasury holdings and in a rare if muted acknowledgement from the american financial press that de dollarization is a contemporary threat that should be taken seriously bbg said that analysts who have coined the term de dollarization speculate about the global economic impacts if more countries adopt a similar philosophy and what it could mean for the dollar s desirability compared with other assets such as gold or the chinese yuan while russia s dependence on exporting commodities like gold means it must continue to depend at least in part on the greenback three quarters of russia s 600 billion of trade is conducted in dollars per bbg this voracious gold buying is setting an example for other countries in the west as well as in the east last year russia s gold buying outstripped its gold production for the first time and as relations with the us continue to deteriorate as longstanding arms control treaties are torn up and belligerent rhetoric spouted by both trump and putin the russian central bank might start importing more gold which could have a positive impact on the global price per two analysts russia has singlehandedly put a floor under the price of gold though some suspect that since the cbr is now a known quantity in international gold markets it would need to markedly accelerate its purchases to have a material impact on the price though few expect russia to stop buying now the new case for gold rickards james best price 0 25 buy new 6 99 as of 11 36 utc details central bank buying has helped strengthen gold from a weak hand to a strong hand and supported gold prices in recent years according to ronald peter stoeferle managing partner at liechtenstein based asset manager incrementum ag bullion has risen more than 20 percent since the start of 2016 it traded up 0 5 percent at 1 297 15 per ounce at 12 40 p m in london if it wasn t for russia s central bank last year would have been the worst year for gold buying in a decade so it helped put a floor on the price said adrian ash head of research at gold brokerage bullionvault ltd however russian buying is now well known so it would take a significant increase in their purchases to materially impact the gold price but perhaps the most notable aspect of putin s rhetoric about de dollarization is how it s apparently influencing leaders of states that are still at least nominally friendly toward the us french president emmanuel macron said in an interview late last year that europe is too dependent on the greenback declaring it an issue of sovereignty this from one of the most ardently pro eu politicians on the continent and last year poland and hungary surprised the market by making the first substantial purchases of gold by eu member states in more than a decade so the next time you hear an analyst on cnbc categorically dismiss the notion that the loss of the dollar s reserve currency status isn t something that markets should take seriously even as several credible voices have warned that it should be you d do well to remember this chart reprinted with permission from zero hedge the best of tyler durden

london in the political realm no one knows how brexit s long running theater of the absurd will end but for much of the business world britain s departure from the european union has effectively happened nearly three years of uncertainty since the june 2016 referendum has forced companies to plan for the worst the prospect that britain could crash out of the bloc without a deal governing future relations the twisting road to brexit has already slowed economic growth discouraged investment and damaged the reputation of the nation as a haven for commerce global banks and other financial services companies are steadily shifting thousands of jobs and more than 1 trillion in assets to european cities to ensure that they are able to serve customers across the english channel regardless of the rules that national regulators impose after brexit japanese automakers have scrapped plans to expand in britain in part because brexit undermines the country s virtues as a hub for european trade whatever comes next a deal with europe an unruly exit or another vote that could cancel the proceedings making brexit the mother of all mulligans the jobs and the money are unlikely to return multinational companies came here with a clear understanding that britain would offer a stable place to do business in exchange for access to the european union said peter dixon a global financial economist at commerzbank ag in london the brits have reneged on that contract it s destroyed if you like the sense that britain is such a great place to do business it s a credibility hit it s a deep wound advertising since the 1980s japanese automakers have invested in factories in britain to exploit the country s duty free access to europe before the 2016 vote nissan warned that leaving the european union could force the company to reassess its plans for its plant in sunderland in the north of england months after the vote prime minister theresa may offered nissan a mysterious cocktail of promises that won nissan s confidence but in february the company said it would not build a new suv in sunderland at about the same time honda said it was closing a factory in southwest england in the town of swindon eliminating 3 500 jobs honda s decision was motivated partly by a trade agreement that japan struck last year with the european union the deal eliminates the need for a factory in britain because honda can now ship cars made in japan directly into europe without incurring duties if britain leaves the european market it would lose the benefits of the bloc s trade deals in short just as japan and europe are liberalizing trade with each other britain is moving to impede trade with both the big worry is investment said mike hawes ceo of the society of motor manufacturers and traders an industry trade group investors are just waiting to see is it worth continuing to commit to the u k automotive industry the british economy is now 1 to 2 5 smaller than it would have been without the brexit vote economists estimate much of the damage has come via the drop in the british pound which has shed more than 10 of its value against the dollar since the referendum advertising the fall in the pound amounts to the market s expression that trade has been obstructed britain sells nearly half its exports within the european union given that britain imports more than it exports the falling currency has pushed up prices on a broad range of goods from fruits and vegetables to machinery inflation was the primary factor in median household income remaining flat in 2018 according to an analysis by the institute for fiscal studies an independent research firm in london across britain business investment is expected to decline by 1 this year in what would be the weakest performance since the global financial crisis a decade ago according to a recent forecast from the british chambers of commerce the impact will probably fall heavily on areas that need investment the most manufacturing dependent communities in the north of england and wales where jobs and living standards have declined such areas mostly voted to leave europe as people blamed globalization and immigration for diminishing opportunities now they stand to suffer even leaner times there needs to be a cadre of new businesses being developed in the north of england that operate in high value added sectors like technology said robert huggins a professor of economic geography at cardiff university in wales but with brexit and the potential difficulties these businesses are going to be stifled they are not going to be able to develop their potential it s unbelievable if brexit has produced anything it is familiarity with events once deemed unbelievable advertising the european medicines agency the bloc s regulator for pharmaceuticals recently abandoned its london headquarters for new offices in amsterdam a move prompted entirely by brexit investment in the industry is almost sure to follow for more than three decades london has attracted global banks trading operations hedge funds asset managers and sovereign wealth funds from the middle east and asia the city grew into a global center of finance second to none while the industry has employed more than 1 million people in britain brexit has put that status in jeopardy by forcing companies that serve european clients from london to move jobs and trading activity to cities like amsterdam dublin and frankfurt more than 275 companies are in the process of moving or have already shifted business divisions employees and legal entities from britain to the continent according to a recent report from new financial an independent research institution in london banks alone are transferring 800 billion pounds more than 1 trillion while asset management and insurance companies are collectively moving 100 billion pounds about 130 billion some 5 000 jobs have left because of brexit and the trend is expected to expand as trading volumes shift and local regulators demand people on the ground who can be held accountable when trouble inevitably emerges britain s departure from the european market would end the passporting rights that have allowed financial services companies to conduct transactions across the bloc as if it were one sprawling country financiers recognized early that they could not merely wait and hope that the politicians would find a way to protect their industry advertising by the end of 2017 the industry was warning the british government that unless a deal was completed soon many companies would proceed with plans to move parts of their operations to the continent by the middle of last year with no deal in sight those plans became reality given the money and complexities involved in these moves few expect jobs to return regardless of how brexit ends bank of america has spent nearly 400 million to prepare for brexit most of it on creating a hub in dublin london will remain a dominant center of finance but as banking and trading shift marginally toward the continent so will legal and accounting services the mere act of preparing for brexit has forced companies to reassess the merits of concentrating so much business in britain banks that have moved accountants to the english city of birmingham to escape exorbitantly priced london offices may be tempted by greater savings through hiring professionals in poland once you start looking at your business model in europe you can never unsee what you ve seen said william wright founder and managing director of new financial does it really make sense to have 95 of your european staff in the center of some of the most expensive real estate on earth even if the politicians strike a deal for a smooth divorce or shock the world by calling the whole thing off the harm done to britain s aura as a haven for sensible governance is likely to endure the whole brexit process from the referendum itself to the way in which the government has responded since has very significantly damaged the reputation of the u k as a pragmatic and sensible place to do business wright said that s gone it could take a very long time to come back

not reflective of underlying performance judgement is applied in the allocation of the purchase price between intangibles and goodwill and in determining the useful economic lives of the acquired

15 revenue from contracts with customers on the group s financial statements and also discloses the new accounting policies that have been applied from 1 february 2018 where they are different to those applied in prior periods ifrs 9 ifrs 9 has been adopted without restating comparative information the adjustments arising from the impact of ifrs 9 are not reflected in the balance sheet at 31 january 2018 however they are recognised in the opening balance sheet on 1 february 2018 the adoption of ifrs 9 from 1 february 2018 resulted in the following changes for the group notes to the year end results continued for the years ended 31 january 2019 and 31 january 2018 the group s financial assets that are subject to ifrs 9 s expected credit loss model are its trade and other receivables and cash balances the group has revised its impairment methodology as a result the impact of the change in impairment methodology on the group s brought forward retained earnings is immaterial the group has opted to continue to account for its net investment hedges under ias 39 rather than transition to ifrs 9 the group has opted to designate its investment in equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income fvtoci as allowed under ifrs 9 as they are not held for trading an adjustment has been made to opening retained earnings to reflect the adjustment to fair value for these unquoted investments at 1 february 2018 as previously stated at 31 january 2018 000 adjustment required under ifrs 9 000 as restated at 1 february 2018 000 trade investments 1 211 48 1 259 ifrs 15 the group has adopted ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers from 1 february 2018 which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts recognised in the financial statements in accordance with the transition provisions in ifrs 15 the group has adopted ifrs 15 retrospectively and has restated comparatives for the 2018 financial year in summary the following adjustments were made to the reported financial performance year ended 31 january 2018 impact on profit for the year 000 revenue increase due to principal versus agent considerations i 37 111 direct costs increase due to principal versus agent considerations i 37 111 impact on net revenue i under ifrs 15 the group is considered principal for certain third party costs which are billed onto clients where the group previously accounted for these costs as agent an adjustment to increase revenue has therefore been made to reflect this change with a corresponding increase in direct costs as a result there has been no impact to net revenue or profit for the prior periods the group also assessed whether the adoption of ifrs 15 had any impact on the timing of revenue recognition under ias 18 the group recognised revenue based on stage of completion whereas under ifrs 15 the recognition should be when a customer obtains control of the goods or service following assessment of the contracts held by the group it was determined that the impact of aligning the group s revenue recognition with performance obligations to the customer did not have a material impact on the revenue in the prior periods therefore no restatement has been made

in a report titled the misery index 2018 authored by dr steve hanke of the johns hopkins university in baltimore maryland nigerians have been labelled the sixth most miserable people in the world the misery index was introduced in the 1970s by arthur okun an american economist author of the seminal work equality and efficiency the big trade off 1975 the original index considers such factors as unemployment rate and inflation rate it is a formula a methodology as it were consistent with what is known as okun s law but modified subsequently by harvard professor robert barro and professor steve hanke the latter releases a report annually he tells us that my modified misery index is the sum of the unemployment inflation and bank lending rates minus the percentage change in real gdp per capita higher readings on the first three elements are bad and make people miserable these are offset by a good gdp per capita growth which is subtracted from the sum of the bads a higher misery index score reflects a higher level of misery and it s a simple enough metric that a busy president without time for extensive economic briefings can understand at a glance in the 2018 report which is basically a forecast of what to expect in the year 2019 hanke identifies venezuela as the most miserable country in the world followed by zimbabwe argentina iran brazil turkey nigeria south africa bosnia herzegovina egypt and ukraine is nigeria the sixth most miserable country in the world where is syria south sudan somalia steve hanke s report does not necessarily cover all the countries of the world but certain points are clear from his submissions first the misery index makes the point very clear that economic growth is linked to the people s prosperity and happiness countries that suffer from stagflation are likely to have very miserable citizens second lack of economic growth or a poor economy can result in political and social crisis as we have seen in venezuela where inflation rate is said to be above 6 000 and zimbabwe where inflation is allegedly over 97 although this has been disputed in other evaluations which unlike hanke s index accommodate the employment rate in zimbabwe s informal economy third good governance leadership and political stability are important factors for macro economic growth the least miserable countries in the world as seen in the misery index 2018 would also seem to have strong leadership and institutions and a certain measure of stability fourth poverty should be avoided because it could lead to misery fifth the state has a responsibility to prevent the growth of poverty and promote economic growth it is important to break down and outline some of these well known elementary points because i see a tendency in this season to ignore external rankings or politicize them the people s democratic party pdp has already jumped on the back of the misery index to say that the report confirms the party s position that nigeria s economy has virtually collapsed under buhari the hanke index does not say that the nigerian economy has virtually collapsed it says the people are among the ten most miserable people in the world it is an economist s index not a political review nonetheless there are certain basics that should be established indeed unemployment rate in nigeria is about 23 10 per cent q3 2018 an all time high between 2006 and 2018 youth unemployment according to the national bureau of statistics nbs is even higher inflation rate is about 12 food inflation is higher at 13 5 recently the central bank of nigeria reduced monetary policy rate mpr to 13 5 down by 50 basis points from 14 nigeria s gdp growth is 1 8 compared to statistics from other parts of the world these nigerian statistics paint a gloomy picture unemployment rate in india for example is 6 1 canada 5 8 australia 4 9 united kingdom 3 9 germany 3 1 ghana 2 cote d ivoire 2 6 saudi arabia 12 7 etc there is also no doubt that the nigerian economy has gone through major contractions in the last five years the sharp drop in the spot price of oil depleted the country s reserves created a foreign exchange crisis and soon resulted in recession in 2016 nigeria faced the consequences of a negative growth of up to 2 3 in 2017 inflation was as high as 18 in september 2018 the economic intelligence unit of the economist magazine and the hsbc research unit predicted a gloomy economic prospect for nigeria in 2019 and also jumped into the troubled waters of analyzing nigerian politics with predictions about the likely outcome of the 2019 presidential election in nigeria both the ruling party in nigeria the all progressives congress apc and the nigerian government kicked they told the experts to keep their opinions to themselves the eiu hsbc in retrospect got the political analysis wrong pdp lost the 2019 presidential election apc won but the economic projections remain relevant and instructive the steve hanke misery index report may have been influenced by the eiu report rather than dismiss it however the central bank of nigeria cbn and the presidency hanke insists the message is so straightforward even a busy president can follow it should study the report and attend to the messages about economic growth and the careful management of certain indicators to deliver prosperity to the people nigeria s palace economists may quarrel over the statistics and the methodology but not the common sense but is hanke s description of nigeria as the 6thmost miserable country in the world accurate even if the nigerian economy has not virtually collapsed can misery be affirmed strictly on the basis of unemployment rate inflation rate and lending rates does poverty necessarily translate into misery is the correlation absolutely given nigeria ranks low in this 2019 misery index just as it ranks low on the human poverty index and the human development index these are challenges for governance and leadership but does all that mean that nigerians are miserable the word misery connotes unhappiness distress wretchedness hardship suffering affliction anguish sadness sorrow melancholy i think there are gaps in the hanke misery index in terms of the parameters adopted perhaps a more holistc assessment of the connection between economic growth and a people s response as individuals and communities may have shown that economic prosperity and growth do not necessarily guarantee a people s happiness there may well be more misery in all the developed countries of central europe taken together than may be in kenya or cape verde there are perhaps certain anthropological factors a certain kind of neuroscience that accounts for a people s happiness rather than cold macro economic statistics in 2011 nigeria was classified as the happiest place on earth in a gallup poll and its people as the most optimistic this was within the context of widespread underdevelopment and all forms of social sector crisis nigeria s status as a happy country was again confirmed in a world values survey in 2014 it is noteworthy however that in 2018 nigeria was listed as the 91sthappiest country in the world and the 5th happiest country in africa in the world happiness report obv iously so much happened negatively in nigeria between 2014 and 2018 but the sum indication is that as at 2018 nigerians were adjudged happier than they were between 2014 and 2016 how then can we suddenly become the sixth most miserable country in the world a year later the difference is who is looking at what the un 2019 happiness report for example focusses on the human being and community on relationships or the neuro science and the anthropology of happiness rather than economic indicators the world happiness report is more reflective of the nigerian situation in my view than the misery index we may have moved from being the happiest people on earth to the 91stin the world a reflection of the existential crisis that nigeria faces but the word misery does not quite capture the people s true essence my point is as follows the measurement of happiness or its antonym misery is perhaps more subjective and experiential than academic and statistical culture and context should matter nigeria has been described as one of the poorest countries in the world the country faces a problem of low level insurgency in the north east corruption is rife reports of all shades of violence are common place the country s wealth is concentrated in a few hands steady economic growth is a challenge but we the people are not in misery there may have been a slight increase in cases of suicide and depression in the country since 2015 but generally nigerians are a resilient lot the average nigerian is imbued with a fighting spirit if people in other countries go through what nigerians have gone through and are still going through such countries would have imploded but nigeria has not collapsed because the people s fighting spirit is unique in the midst of risks and vulnerability to poverty due to economic mismanagement by nigeria s leaders the average nigerian continues to forge ahead these are people who don t give up easily they believe that tomorrow will be better when they are faced with election rigging voter intimidation outright theft of public resources these are people who are likely to say is it not four years let them come and do what they want to do and go away when people get killed and are abandoned by the roadside you d be surprised that with the corpses lying in open spaces some nigerians can just pull seats together and begin to have a drink a few metres away from a decaying body there is no weekend when there is no celebratory feast in a nigerian community flashy attires expensive cars exotic drinks musicians waxing lyrical and the men and women dancing away with no care in the world i do not know any other country in the world where the parties and celebrations are as elaborate as the parties we throw in nigeria the misery index is talking about high unemployment rates in nigeria this is true but the people are so resilient they manage to get by they have learnt to move beyond their governments nigeria is the biggest market in africa those who cannot get formal jobs find other things to do come to lagos dr hanke some of the young ladies you would see on the streets of lagos and on nigerian instagram are from very poor backgrounds and they have no extra ordinary skills but you are likely to see them driving expensive cars wearing bespoke clothes the type that kim kardashian cannot even afford this is the small girl big god generation that puts a lie to all that talk about misery in nigeria besides thuggery and cultism are considered professions in nigeria and regarded as more profitable and influential than medicine law or engineering thugs and cultists are patronized by political leaders and they are well paid for their efforts particularly during election seasons it is only in nigeria i guess that a security guard earning less than a 100 a month will have three wives and 10 children while his own employer will be struggling to maintain a family of four it is also in nigeria that you will find a civil servant having five wives and two concubines even when he has not been paid a salary for 24 months misery professor steve hanke is an applied economist he may not have visited some of the countries covered by his study but in the case of nigeria he should not rely on textbook statistics unemployment rate lending rate inflation rate gdp per capita may make sense to the economists but those things sound like voodoo to the average nigerian the people live in a zone that is beyond theory the average nigerian is not intimidated by the gap between the very rich and the very poor for him or her there is a religious rather a spiritual side to this thing called poverty or inequality the nigerian is told by the large population of prosperity evangelists in the country muslim christian and animist that he or she can become rich overnight in nigeria you can see a man as poor as a church rat in january and by december he has a mansion in his village attended to by a retinue of hangers on all very happy and he too has become an employer of labour and he is likely to pay salaries more regularly than government nigeria is the ultimate headquarters of trade offs not even arthur m okun could have imagined that the nigerian character and attitude both raise questions about the true nature of work employment economic growth or

a cargo ship at a port in qingdao in china agence france presse geneva world trade shrank by 0 3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018 and is likely to grow by 2 6 per cent this year slower than 3 0 per cent growth in 2018 and below a previous forecast of 3 7 per cent the world trade organization said on tuesday in its annual forecast the wto said trade had been weighed down by new tariffs and retaliatory measures weaker economic growth volatility in financial markets and tighter monetary conditions in developed countries it forecast in september that 2018 growth would be 3 9 per cent down from 4 6 per cent in 2017 wto director general roberto azevedo told a news conference that the lower forecast was no surprise given the trade tensions between the united states and china wto chief economist robert koopman said worse may be to come with an even bigger impact if us president donald trump goes ahead with a plan to impose high tariffs on global imports of cars later this year u s china trade is about 3 per cent of global trade automobile trade globally is about 8 per cent of global trade so you can imagine that the impact of automobile tariffs is going to be bigger than the impact of the u s china trade conflict i think it s pretty clear that any automobile tariff would likely have bigger knock on effects through the global economy than what we see from the u s china conflict the wto did not make a specific prediction about the impact of brexit but koopman said in the worst case it would help push global trade growth down to the bottom end of the wto s forecast range in 2019 1 3 to 4 0 per cent the uk s own analysis suggests that no deal or hard brexit would shave 7 6 per cent off british gdp that would be a big number it would force our numbers down to that lower part of our range koopman said if we end up in the fall with a revision my guess is the likelihood of a revision is that it s downward based on any number of factors from brexit to no resolution in the u s china trade conflict and other trade conflicts going on although the volume of global trade grew only slowly in 2018 the dollar value rose 10 per cent to 19 48 trillion partly because oil prices rose 20 per cent the wto said the value of commercial services trade grew by 8 per cent to 5 80 trillion in 2018 driven by strong import growth in asia goods trade volumes are expected to grow more strongly in developing economies this year with 3 4 per cent growth in exports compared with 2 1 per cent in developed economies meanwhile a rebound in commodities prices and investment is poised to extend in coming months as the sector gets its traditional boost during the final stages of the global economic cycle along with other drivers while some investors worry about a possible recession commodities are due to benefit from an expected us china trade deal tightening oil supply and potential short covering in beaten down us grain futures the 19 commodity thomson reuters core commodity crb index which has rebounded 10 per cent from an 18 month low touched at the end of last year should also get further support from easier monetary policy that has lifted all financial markets analysts and traders said commodities along with other financial markets have been buoyed after the us federal reserve this month confirmed its three year drive to tighten monetary policy was at an end the dovish change from the fed and growing stimulus in top commodities consumer china would extend the current positive economic cycle and support commodity prices jpmorgan said in a note late cycles are typically marked by outperformance of commodities jpmorgan analyst dominic o kane said the rise in commodities so far has been partly fuelled by hopes for an agreement to end a trade war between washington and beijing helping to spur 2 1 billion of flows so far this year into commodity index funds and exchange traded funds data compiled by citi showed commodity assets under management have climbed to 407 billion breaching 400 billion for the first time since october citi said based on data through march 5 although the energy complex has recovered strongly this year positioning in crude oil is not overstretched analysts said reuters

tuesday with reuben abati in a report titled the misery index 2018 authored by dr steve hanke of the johns hopkins university in baltimore maryland nigerians have been labelled the sixth most miserable people in the world the misery index was introduced in the 1970s by arthur okun an american economist author of the seminal work equality and efficiency the big trade off 1975 the original index considers such factors as unemployment rate and inflation rate it is a formula a methodology as it were consistent with what is known as okun s law but modified subsequently by harvard professor robert barro and professor steve hanke the latter releases a report annually he tells us that my modified misery index is the sum of the unemployment inflation and bank lending rates minus the percentage change in real gdp per capita higher readings on the first three elements are bad and make people miserable these are offset by a good gdp per capita growth which is subtracted from the sum of the bads a higher misery index score reflects a higher level of misery and it s a simple enough metric that a busy president without time for extensive economic briefings can understand at a glance in the 2018 report which is basically a forecast of what to expect in the year 2019 hanke identifies venezuela as the most miserable country in the world followed by zimbabwe argentina iran brazil turkey nigeria south africa bosnia herzegovina egypt and ukraine is nigeria the sixth most miserable country in the world where is syria south sudan somalia steve hanke s report does not necessarily cover all the countries of the world but certain points are clear from his submissions first the misery index makes the point very clear that economic growth is linked to the people s prosperity and happiness countries that suffer from stagflation are likely to have very miserable citizens second lack of economic growth or a poor economy can result in political and social crisis as we have seen in venezuela where inflation rate is said to be above 6 000 and zimbabwe where inflation is allegedly over 97 although this has been disputed in other evaluations which unlike hanke s index accommodate the employment rate in zimbabwe s informal economy third good governance leadership and political stability are important factors for macro economic growth the least miserable countries in the world as seen in the misery index 2018 would also seem to have strong leadership and institutions and a certain measure of stability fourth poverty should be avoided because it could lead to misery fifth the state has a responsibility to prevent the growth of poverty and promote economic growth it is important to break down and outline some of these well known elementary points because i see a tendency in this season to ignore external rankings or politicize them the people s democratic party pdp has already jumped on the back of the misery index to say that the report confirms the party s position that nigeria s economy has virtually collapsed under buhari the hanke index does not say that the nigerian economy has virtually collapsed it says the people are among the ten most miserable people in the world it is an economist s index not a political review nonetheless there are certain basics that should be established indeed unemployment rate in nigeria is about 23 10 per cent q3 2018 an all time high between 2006 and 2018 youth unemployment according to the national bureau of statistics nbs is even higher inflation rate is about 12 food inflation is higher at 13 5 recently the central bank of nigeria reduced monetary policy rate mpr to 13 5 down by 50 basis points from 14 nigeria s gdp growth is 1 8 compared to statistics from other parts of the world these nigerian statistics paint a gloomy picture unemployment rate in india for example is 6 1 canada 5 8 australia 4 9 united kingdom 3 9 germany 3 1 ghana 2 cote d ivoire 2 6 saudi arabia 12 7 etc there is also no doubt that the nigerian economy has gone through major contractions in the last five years the sharp drop in the spot price of oil depleted the country s reserves created a foreign exchange crisis and soon resulted in recession in 2016 nigeria faced the consequences of a negative growth of up to 2 3 in 2017 inflation was as high as 18 in september 2018 the economic intelligence unit of the economist magazine and the hsbc research unit predicted a gloomy economic prospect for nigeria in 2019 and also jumped into the troubled waters of analyzing nigerian politics with predictions about the likely outcome of the 2019 presidential election in nigeria both the ruling party in nigeria the all progressives congress apc and the nigerian government kicked they told the experts to keep their opinions to themselves the eiu hsbc in retrospect got the political analysis wrong pdp lost the 2019 presidential election apc won but the economic projections remain relevant and instructive the steve hanke misery index report may have been influenced by the eiu report rather than dismiss it however the central bank of nigeria cbn and the presidency hanke insists the message is so straightforward even a busy president can follow it should study the report and attend to the messages about economic growth and the careful management of certain indicators to deliver prosperity to the people nigeria s palace economists may quarrel over the statistics and the methodology but not the common sense but is hanke s description of nigeria as the 6thmost miserable country in the world accurate even if the nigerian economy has not virtually collapsed can misery be affirmed strictly on the basis of unemployment rate inflation rate and lending rates does poverty necessarily translate into misery is the correlation absolutely given nigeria ranks low in this 2019 misery index just as it ranks low on the human poverty index and the human development index these are challenges for governance and leadership but does all that mean that nigerians are miserable the word misery connotes unhappiness distress wretchedness hardship suffering affliction anguish sadness sorrow melancholy i think there are gaps in the hanke misery index in terms of the parameters adopted perhaps a more holistc assessment of the connection between economic growth and a people s response as individuals and communities may have shown that economic prosperity and growth do not necessarily guarantee a people s happiness there may well be more misery in all the developed countries of central europe taken together than may be in kenya or cape verde there are perhaps certain anthropological factors a certain kind of neuroscience that accounts for a people s happiness rather than cold macro economic statistics in 2011 nigeria was classified as the happiest place on earth in a gallup poll and its people as the most optimistic this was within the context of widespread underdevelopment and all forms of social sector crisis nigeria s status as a happy country was again confirmed in a world values survey in 2014 it is noteworthy however that in 2018 nigeria was listed as the 91sthappiest country in the world and the 5th happiest country in africa in the world happiness report obviously so much happened negatively in nigeria between 2014 and 2018 but the sum indication is that as at 2018 nigerians were adjudged happier than they were between 2014 and 2016 how then can we suddenly become the sixth most miserable country in the world a year later the difference is who is looking at what the un 2019 happiness report for example focusses on the human being and community on relationships or the neuro science and the anthropology of happiness rather than economic indicators the world happiness report is more reflective of the nigerian situation in my view than the misery index we may have moved from being the happiest people on earth to the 91stin the world a reflection of the existential crisis that nigeria faces but the word misery does not quite capture the people s true essence my point is as follows the measurement of happiness or its antonym misery is perhaps more subjective and experiential than academic and statistical culture and context should matter nigeria has been described as one of the poorest countries in the world the country faces a problem of low level insurgency in the north east corruption is rife reports of all shades of violence are common place the country s wealth is concentrated in a few hands steady economic growth is a challenge but we the people are not in misery there may have been a slight increase in cases of suicide and depression in the country since 2015 but generally nigerians are a resilient lot the average nigerian is imbued with a fighting spirit if people in other countries go through what nigerians have gone through and are still going through such countries would have imploded but nigeria has not collapsed because the people s fighting spirit is unique in the midst of risks and vulnerability to poverty due to economic mismanagement by nigeria s leaders the average nigerian continues to forge ahead these are people who don t give up easily they believe that tomorrow will be better when they are faced with election rigging voter intimidation outright theft of public resources these are people who are likely to say is it not four years let them come and do what they want to do and go away when people get killed and are abandoned by the roadside you d be surprised that with the corpses lying in open spaces some nigerians can just pull seats together and begin to have a drink a few metres away from a decaying body there is no weekend when there is no celebratory feast in a nigerian community flashy attires expensive cars exotic drinks musicians waxing lyrical and the men and women dancing away with no care in the world i do not know any other country in the world where the parties and celebrations are as elaborate as the parties we throw in nigeria the misery index is talking about high unemployment rates in nigeria this is true but the people are so resilient they manage to get by they have learnt to move beyond their governments nigeria is the biggest market in africa those who cannot get formal jobs find other things to do come to lagos dr hanke some of the young ladies you would see on the streets of lagos and on nigerian instagram are from very poor backgrounds and they have no extra ordinary skills but you are likely to see them driving expensive cars wearing bespoke clothes the type that kim kardashian cannot even afford this is the small girl big god generation that puts a lie to all that talk about misery in nigeria besides thuggery and cultism are considered professions in nigeria and regarded as more profitable and influential than medicine law or engineering thugs and cultists are patronized by political leaders and they are well paid for their efforts particularly during election seasons it is only in nigeria i guess that a security guard earning less than a 100 a month will have three wives and 10 children while his own employer will be struggling to maintain a family of four it is also in nigeria that you will find a civil servant having five wives and two concubines even when he has not been paid a salary for 24 months misery professor steve hanke is an applied economist he may not have visited some of the countries covered by his study but in the case of nigeria he should not rely on textbook statistics unemployment rate lending rate inflation rate gdp per capita may make sense to the economists but those things sound like voodoo to the average nigerian the people live in a zone that is beyond theory the average nigerian is not intimidated by the gap between the very rich and the very poor for him or her there is a religious rather a spiritual side to this thing called poverty or inequality the nigerian is told by the large population of prosperity evangelists in the country muslim christian and animist that he or she can become rich overnight in nigeria you can see a man as poor as a church rat in january and by december he has a mansion in his village attended to by a retinue of hangers on all very happy and he too has become an employer of labour and he is likely to pay salaries more regularly than government nigeria is the ultimate headquarters of trade offs not even arthur m okun could have imagined that the nigerian character and attitude both raise questions about the true nature of work employment economic growth or the meaning of misery beyond the theories and forecasts the other question is what is the integrity of the applied data

cnn president donald trump has made a habit of lashing out at the federal reserve over interest rate hikes but lately his top economic advisers have joined in too breaking the code of conduct shared by bankers and economists to display solidarity with their boss the latest attack came from national economic council director larry kudlow who said in multiple interviews last week that last year s interest rate hikes were undermining the trump administration s campaign promise of attaining 3 sustained economic growth a claim amplified on trump s own twitter feed had the fed not mistakenly raised interest rates especially since there is very little inflation and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening the 3 0 gdp stock market would have both been much higher world markets would be in a better place donald j trump realdonaldtrump march 29 2019 kudlow called on the world s most influential central bank to cut rates immediately marking the first time a top administration official had publicly called for a cut and specifically argued that the fed should shave off half a percentage point effectively erasing two of the four rate hikes the central bank agreed to last year i am echoing the president s view he s not been bashful about that view kudlow said in an interview on cnbc shortly after axios published similar comments in recent weeks trump s top economic advisers have upped their rhetoric about the supposedly disastrous effects of the fed s interest rate hikes all standard macroeconomic steps given the hot job market and rising demand they ve also raised alarms about the massive costs of the green new deal and other progressive agenda items proposed by democrats which the administration decries as socialism and warns could erode all of the gains of trump s economic policies over the last two years from a historic tax overhaul in 2017 to revising the nation s trade deals kudlow s remarks on friday closely echoed those of stephen moore another former television commentator turned distinguished fellow at the conservative heritage foundation who trump said he plans to nominate to the fed board of governors moore has said the fed was wrong to raise rates in september and december and has since called on the central bank to reverse course by cutting rates by half a percentage point kevin hassett who heads the white house council of economic advisers on tuesday carefully waded into the fed s rate policy setting debate suggesting the trump administration s economic growth forecasts include what we re used to seeing without specifying a rate cut the federal funds rate which influences the cost of mortgages credit cards and other borrowing stands at a range of 2 25 to 2 5 a cut of 50 basis points would leave the rate floating between 1 75 to 2 the fed currently forecasts that rates will hover around 2 4 this year in december moore blasted federal reserve chairman jerome powell and other members of the board after the last rate hike saying they should be thrown out for economic malpractice and going so far as to suggest powell who was appointed by trump should resign from the role i was really angry moore told the new york times in an interview last week about the december rate hike i was furious and trump was furious too i just thought that the december rate increase was inexplicable commodity prices were already falling dramatically i said these things that i do regret saying because i think powell s doing the best job that he can said moore do i regret the rhetoric that i used yes was i right yes trump s decision to choose moore for the job is not the first time trump has favored national television exposure and loyalty in his appointments during his administration he is expected to nominate counterterrorism expert and former fox news contributor morgan ortagus to be the new state department spokeswoman replacing heather nauert a former fox news anchor nauert had been trump s pick to be the us ambassador for the united nations but later withdrew herself from consideration the white house has yet to officially submit moore s name to the senate where he will have to be confirmed already a number of discrepancies including a 75 000 federal tax lien could derail his nomination by the president the white house has so far declined to comment on the issue moore who is not a ph d economist and worked as one of the president s 2016 campaign advisers told bloomberg that he and trump think a lot alike when it comes to economic policy i really believe we can have 3 to 4 percent growth for the next five to six years that echoes claims made by hassett who consistently sounds a sunny note on the economy in his own tv appearances including monday on cnbc we re seeing increased optimism hassett said citing rising wages and strong hiring hassett on tuesday acknowledged at a banking conference in washington that there is a feedback loop between trump and his advisers recounting one of his early days on the job when the president was live tweeting a television interview hassett was doing prompting questions hassett couldn t answer because he hadn t seen the tweets the administration s rosy outlook runs contrary to what most economists and the fed believe given slowing global economic growth and other factors the fed lowered its forecast last month to 2 1 that s a sharp contracts to the trump administration which has predicted the economy will grow at an average of 3 each year over the next decade including 3 2 this year kudlow in his friday remarks was willing to concede that there s a lot of weakness out there globally europe euro zone virtually in a recession china very very very soft as we negotiate on trade in the absence of inflation with some of these global threats our view is at some point i wouldn t mind seeing the fed drop their target rate powell meanwhile has been trying to carefully thread the needle by saying the us economy remains steady arguing he s in no hurry to raise rates amid a number of risks to the global economy in march the fed took its patient approach even further suggesting it would hold off on raising rates indefinitely until it has a better handle on where the economy is going for the rest of the year i think we re in a good place right now powell told reporters at a press conference following last month s two day interest setting meeting in washington we re being patient we re watching we don t see any data pushing us to move rates in any direction
in a report titled the misery index 2018 authored by dr steve hanke of the johns hopkins university in baltimore maryland nigerians have been labelled the sixth most miserable people in the world the misery index was introduced in the 1970s by arthur okun an american economist author of the seminal work equality and efficiency the big trade off 1975 the original index considers such factors as unemployment rate and inflation rate it is a formula a methodology as it were consistent with what is known as okun s law but modified subsequently by harvard professor robert barro and professor steve hanke the latter releases a report annually he tells us that my modified misery index is the sum of the unemployment inflation and bank lending rates minus the percentage change in real gdp per capita higher readings on the first three elements are bad and make people miserable these are offset by a good gdp per capita growth which is subtracted from the sum of the bads a higher misery index score reflects a higher level of misery and it s a simple enough metric that a busy president without time for extensive economic briefings can understand at a glance in the 2018 report which is basically a forecast of what to expect in the year 2019 hanke identifies venezuela as the most miserable country in the world followed by zimbabwe argentina iran brazil turkey nigeria south africa bosnia herzegovina egypt and ukraine is nigeria the sixth most miserable country in the world where is syria south sudan somalia steve hanke s report does not necessarily cover all the countries of the world but certain points are clear from his submissions first the misery index makes the point very clear that economic growth is linked to the people s prosperity and happiness countries that suffer from stagflation are likely to have very miserable citizens second lack of economic growth or a poor economy can result in political and social crisis as we have seen in venezuela where inflation rate is said to be above 6 000 and zimbabwe where inflation is allegedly over 97 although this has been disputed in other evaluations which unlike hanke s index accommodate the employment rate in zimbabwe s informal economy third good governance leadership and political stability are important factors for macro economic growth the least miserable countries in the world as seen in the misery index 2018 would also seem to have strong leadership and institutions and a certain measure of stability fourth poverty should be avoided because it could lead to misery fifth the state has a responsibility to prevent the growth of poverty and promote economic growth advertisement it is important to break down and outline some of these well known elementary points because i see a tendency in this season to ignore external rankings or politicize them the people s democratic party pdp has already jumped on the back of the misery index to say that the report confirms the party s position that nigeria s economy has virtually collapsed under buhari the hanke index does not say that the nigerian economy has virtually collapsed it says the people are among the ten most miserable people in the world it is an economist s index not a political review nonetheless there are certain basics that should be established indeed unemployment rate in nigeria is about 23 10 per cent q3 2018 an all time high between 2006 and 2018 youth unemployment according to the national bureau of statistics nbs is even higher inflation rate is about 12 food inflation is higher at 13 5 recently the central bank of nigeria reduced monetary policy rate mpr to 13 5 down by 50 basis points from 14 nigeria s gdp growth is 1 8 compared to statistics from other parts of the world these nigerian statistics paint a gloomy picture unemployment rate in india for example is 6 1 canada 5 8 australia 4 9 united kingdom 3 9 germany 3 1 ghana 2 cote d ivoire 2 6 saudi arabia 12 7 etc there is also no doubt that the nigerian economy has gone through major contractions in the last five years the sharp drop in the spot price of oil depleted the country s reserves created a foreign exchange crisis and soon resulted in recession in 2016 nigeria faced the consequences of a negative growth of up to 2 3 in 2017 inflation was as high as 18 in september 2018 the economic intelligence unit of the economist magazine and the hsbc research unit predicted a gloomy economic prospect for nigeria in 2019 and also jumped into the troubled waters of analyzing nigerian politics with predictions about the likely outcome of the 2019 presidential election in nigeria both the ruling party in nigeria the all progressives congress apc and the nigerian government kicked they told the experts to keep their opinions to themselves advertisement the eiu hsbc in retrospect got the political analysis wrong pdp lost the 2019 presidential election apc won but the economic projections remain relevant and instructive the steve hanke misery index report may have been influenced by the eiu report rather than dismiss it however the central bank of nigeria cbn and the presidency hanke insists the message is so straightforward even a busy president can follow it should study the report and attend to the messages about economic growth and the careful management of certain indicators to deliver prosperity to the people nigeria s palace economists may quarrel over the statistics and the methodology but not the common sense but is hanke s description of nigeria as the 6th most miserable country in the world accurate even if the nigerian economy has not virtually collapsed can misery be affirmed strictly on the basis of unemployment rate inflation rate and lending rates does poverty necessarily translate into misery is the correlation absolutely given nigeria ranks low in this 2019 misery index just as it ranks low on the human poverty index and the human development index these are challenges for governance and leadership but does all that mean that nigerians are miserable the word misery connotes unhappiness distress wretchedness hardship suffering affliction anguish sadness sorrow melancholy i think there are gaps in the hanke misery index in terms of the parameters adopted perhaps a more holistic assessment of the connection between economic growth and a people s response as individuals and communities may have shown that economic prosperity and growth do not necessarily guarantee a people s happiness there may well be more misery in all the developed countries of central europe taken together than may be in kenya or cape verde there are perhaps certain anthropological factors a certain kind of neuroscience that accounts for a people s happiness rather than cold macro economic statistics in 2011 nigeria was classified as the happiest place on earth in a gallup poll and its people as the most optimistic this was within the context of widespread underdevelopment and all forms of social sector crisis nigeria s status as a happy country was again confirmed in a world values survey in 2014 it is noteworthy however that in 2018 nigeria was listed as the 91st happiest country in the world and the 5th happiest country in africa in the world happiness report obviously so much happened negatively in nigeria between 2014 and 2018 but the sum indication is that as at 2018 nigerians were adjudged happier than they were between 2014 and 2016 advertisement how then can we suddenly become the sixth most miserable country in the world a year later the difference is who is looking at what the un 2019 happiness report for example focuses on the human being and community on relationships or the neuro science and the anthropology of happiness rather than economic indicators the world happiness report is more reflective of the nigerian situation in my view than the misery index we may have moved from being the happiest people on earth to the 91stin the world a reflection of the existential crisis that nigeria faces but the word misery does not quite capture the people s true essence my point is as follows the measurement of happiness or its antonym misery is perhaps more subjective and experiential than academic and statistical culture and context should matter nigeria has been described as one of the poorest countries in the world the country faces a problem of low level insurgency in the north east corruption is rife reports of all shades of violence are common place the country s wealth is concentrated in a few hands steady economic growth is a challenge but we the people are not in misery there may have been a slight increase in cases of suicide and depression in the country since 2015 but generally nigerians are a resilient lot the average nigerian is imbued with a fighting spirit if people in other countries go through what nigerians have gone through and are still going through such countries would have imploded but nigeria has not collapsed because the people s fighting spirit is unique in the midst of risks and vulnerability to poverty due to economic mismanagement by nigeria s leaders the average nigerian continues to forge ahead these are people who don t give up easily they believe that tomorrow will be better when they are faced with election rigging voter intimidation outright theft of public resources these are people who are likely to say is it not four years let them come and do what they want to do and go away when people get killed and are abandoned by the roadside you d be surprised that with the corpses lying in open spaces some nigerians can just pull seats together and begin to have a drink a few metres away from a decaying body there is no weekend when there is no celebratory feast in a nigerian community flashy attires expensive cars exotic drinks musicians waxing lyrical and the men and women dancing away with no care in the world i do not know any other country in the world where the parties and celebrations are as elaborate as the parties we throw in nigeria the misery index is talking about high unemployment rates in nigeria this is true but the people are so resilient they manage to get by they have learnt to move beyond their governments nigeria is the biggest market in africa those who cannot get formal jobs find other things to do advertisement come to lagos dr hanke some of the young ladies you would see on the streets of lagos and on nigerian instagram are from very poor backgrounds and they have no extra ordinary skills but you are likely to see them driving expensive cars wearing bespoke clothes the type that kim kardashian cannot even afford this is the small girl big god generation that puts a lie to all that talk about misery in nigeria besides thuggery and cultism are considered professions in nigeria and regarded as more profitable and influential than medicine law or engineering thugs and cultists are patronized by political leaders and they are well paid for their efforts particularly during election seasons it is only in nigeria i guess that a security guard earning less than a 100 a month will have three wives and 10 children while his own employer will be struggling to maintain a family of four it is also in nigeria that you will find a civil servant having five wives and two concubines even when he has not been paid a salary for 24 months misery professor steve hanke is an applied economist he may not have visited some of the countries covered by his study but in the case of nigeria he should not rely on textbook statistics unemployment rate lending rate inflation rate gdp per capita may make sense to the economists but those things sound like voodoo to the average nigerian advertisement the people live in a zone that is beyond theory the average nigerian is not intimidated by the gap between the very rich and the very poor for him or her there is a religious rather a spiritual side to this thing called poverty or inequality the nigerian is told by the large population of prosperity evangelists in the country muslim christian and animist that he or she can become rich overnight in nigeria you can see a man as poor as a church rat in january and by december he has a mansion in his village attended to by a retinue of hangers on all very happy and he too has become an employer of labour and he is likely to pay salaries more regularly than government nigeria is the ultimate headquarters of trade offs not even arthur m okun could have imagined that the nigerian character and attitude both raise questions about the true nature of work employment economic growth or the meaning of misery beyond the theories and forecasts the other question is what is the integrity of the applied data

the opening plenum of the boao forum for asia annual conference 2019 is held on march 28 xinhua the coastal town of boao in hainan province is blessed with all the necessary elements for a popular tropical resort yet with a name which means abundant fat fish it remained an obscure fishing village until it was inaugurated as the permanent venue of the boao forum for asia bfa annual conference in 2002 from march 26 to 29 it was again host to the yearly gathering with more than 2 000 participants from home and abroad under the theme shared future concerted action common development strong support for multilateralism and globalization is the most important outcome and most encouraging message of this year s annual meeting said li baodong secretary general of the bfa at a press conference concluding the forum the message this conference wishes to convey is unequivocal we are on the same planet in the same boat and with a shared future said bfa chairman ban ki moon at the opening plenum there is no alternative solution to our common challenges such as climate change income inequality and sustainable growth we must work together under the multilateral framework through close coordination cooperation and dialogue and with concerted actions a globalized world the forum was held amid a downturn in international trade and investment and rising protectionism the world economy shows weakening momentum with growing uncertainties and volatility recently major international institutions have lowered their expectations for world economic growth in 2019 on march 28 while addressing the opening plenum premier li keqiang stressed that all parties should work together to uphold the un centered international system and rules based multilateral trading system and advance reform in the global governance system decades of progress in economic globalization has shaped a sophisticated international division of labor and linked up the industrial innovation and value chains of various countries making them ever more interdependent in economic development premier li said in the face of world economic headwinds and other common challenges no country can stay immune or resolve all the problems he called on countries to seek mutually beneficial cooperation and boost world economic development with an open mind an inclusive approach and concerted actions the trajectory of the world economy after the second world war shows that multilateralism is the right way to ensure lasting prosperity and development premier li commented china stands for fair trade and has taken concrete actions to uphold fairness and equity the lack of which would make trade unsustainable he said leaders from other countries and some business elites have also reiterated their support for globalization free trade and multilateralism from their respective perspectives li baodong noted the bfa secretary general said that participants called for developing an open world economy and agreed that countries must adapt to globalization rather than resist it and moreover they should rebuild confidence in multilateralism multilateralism is an important guarantee for globalization said chen deming former minister of commerce noting that china adheres to multilateralism complemented with regional cooperation under the multilateral system differentiated economic and trade treatment for developing countries addresses the imbalances of development in different regions and enables relatively fair competition between emerging countries and developed countries he said liu zhenmin un under secretary general also stated his support for multilateralism in global governance i am very concerned about the threats to globalization and the consequences of the absence of multilateralism on global governance he warned unilateral actions aggravate confrontation between countries said james bacchus director of the center for global economic and environmental opportunity at the university of central florida he is a founding judge and former chairman of the appellate body of the world trade organization wto only by working together can the value of the wto and its 164 members be given full play bacchus said lakhdar brahimi former un and arab league joint special representative for syria and former foreign minister of algeria expressed his frustration with unilateralism if one country any country does not follow the rules it will be bad he said if a country just stands its own ground and imposes its ideas on others this cold war mentality is typical unilateralism he said stating that countries should advocate multilateralism and revitalize international organizations revamping governance the existing global governance system was established after world war ii and has existed for more than 70 years but in recent years the rise of unilateralism protectionism and populism has posed unprecedented challenges to the system while a good number of bfa participants advocate multilateralism they also believe the current global governance system needs an overhaul the world economic system rests on three pillars namely the international monetary fund the world bank and the wto said jin liqun president of the asian infrastructure investment bank he said that the system set up decades ago no longer fits since the balance of economic power has changed over seven decades many things have changed and many developed countries have lost their competitiveness in many sectors this has led to domestic problems in these countries because they refuse to reform on their own and instead look to blame other countries he said on the global level the system needs to be overhauled at a domestic level you have to reform and adapt he added we should sit down and reform the multilateral system in order to adapt to changes in the world s political and economic pattern the global governance system should be moved toward a fairer and more equitable direction in order to provide stronger support to global growth premier li said however he also stressed that reform does not mean starting all over again or serving the interests of a handful of countries premier li reiterated that china supports necessary reforms to the wto but insisted that its basic principles and core values must be adhered to the interests and concerns of all parties must be effectively addressed and the differences in countries development levels must be factored in in particular much attention needs to be given to protecting the rights and interests of developing countries and narrowing the north south gap he said a great challenge for the wto is that it is being marginalized said chong quan president of the china society for world trade organization studies pointing out that the most pressing issue for the wto is to revitalize its dispute settlement mechanism resolving trade disputes is one of the wto s core activities its members have agreed to use the multilateral system of settling disputes instead of taking unilateral action the wto s dispute settlement body decides the outcome of a trade dispute on the recommendation of the dispute panel and for appealed cases on a report from the appellate body the appellate body is made up of seven permanent members with each serving a four year term an appeal must be heard by at least three judges at present due to various reasons such as judges poor health or the expiration of their term the appellate body urgently needs to add new members the selection process for members can only be started with a unanimous agreement by all wto members however due to u s obstruction it has been difficult to start the judge selection process meanwhile understaffing will soon result in a backlog of trade disputes or even the paralysis of the organization currently bacchus said the appellate body has only three members and in december there will only be one judge left leaving the wto dispute solution system bogged down posing an existential crisis he suggested that the number of appellate body staff should be increased from seven to 10 and that they should be full time rather than part time in addition he proposed that some members be allowed to serve a second term the wto decision making body is not efficient enough which is one of the reasons why it is facing problems said zhou xiaochuan vice chairman of the bfa and former governor of the people s bank of china he said that in 2008 when the global financial crisis broke out the leaders of the group of 20 strongly pushed forward the doha development round and hoped to reach an agreement as soon as possible however after so many years the progress of the doha round is still unsatisfactory indicating that the mechanism is not efficient enough and needs reform carlos gutierrez former u s secretary of commerce said he believes that the wto s failure to keep pace with the times is also a cause of many of its problems he said technology has evolved very fast and the wto has not caught up with what has developed or what is coming gutierrez noted that rebuilding confidence in multilateralism is crucial to the success of wto reform we have an administration that does not like multilateralism he said referring to the donald trump administration s withdrawal from a number of international treaties entering multilateral treaties is an expression of sovereignty while the current administration in washington believes the contrary he explained zhou also pointed out that the prerequisite for wto reform is that member states should have a sincere desire if most countries support multilateralism wto reform will be agreed upon and progress will be made he said a shared future through these brainstorming discussions this conference has achieved some very important consensus such as strengthening international cooperation building an open world economy persistently promoting structural reform pursuing high quality development and driving economic development through innovation including in technology process institution and concept li baodong said in his summary of the four day conference while hailing the conference as a feast of ideas he also called on people to act together in the interest of all here in boao let s bring our voices together now showing that we share the same future and will not wait until after the earth wanders as depicted in the sci fi movie the wandering earth he suggested putting aside conflicts and disputes and focusing on common development after an intellectually intense day you may want to enjoy the starry night of this small coastal town li baodong told participants if viewed from the vast universe the earth which is inhabited by over 7 billion people is nothing but a tiny spot making any conflict or dispute happening in this world simply insignificant copyedited by rebeca toledo
the need for diversification risks in the securities markets seem to be increasing daily one way to reduce risk is diversification in 30 yielding morl mort and the mreits a real world application and test of modern portfolio theory the degree of risk reduction provided by diversification was discussed even when a portfolio consists of many securities that have somewhat similar characteristics and have significant amounts of correlation diversification can be beneficial i have attempted to utilize my longer term macroeconomic interest rate outlook to manage a high current yield portfolio given some very significant constraints the most important constraint is to only include securities with current yields above 15 other constraints are the typical retail ira account restrictions which preclude the use of short selling margin borrowing and futures contracts some brokerage firms also impose additional constraints on ira accounts i suspect that there are many individuals particularly those either partially or totally retired who either have somewhat similar constraints or could possibly benefit from adopting them given those constraints the universe of possible investments is very limited other than junk bonds and other securities issued by individual distressed entities in order to meet the 15 constraint my primary investment focus in the quest for 15 current yield has been and is on 2x leveraged high yield etns as described in my 2013 seeking alpha article a depression with benefits the macro case for mreits my macroeconomic rationale for investing in ubs etracs monthly pay 2x leveraged mortgage reit etn morl the only 2x leveraged mreit etn in existence at that time was based on the premise that government policies shifting the tax burden from the rich and onto the middle class results in much more funds being available for investment relative to productive uses for those investable funds that tends to put downward pressure on interest rates morl and later ubs etracs monthly pay 2xleveraged mortgage reit etn series b mrrl and the credit suisse x links monthly pay 2x leveraged mortgage reit etn reml have been the core instruments in my 15 current yield constrained portfolio i have utilized ubs etracs monthly pay 2x leveraged closed end fund etn cefl ubs etracs monthly pay 2xleveraged us small cap high dividend etn series b smhb and ubs etracs 2xleveraged long wells fargo business development company etn bdcl as diversifiers and for hedging possible macroeconomic outcomes these are all 2x leveraged high yield etns they all have interest rate risk since they implicitly borrow at short term libor based interest rates to finance their leverage a significant part of their high dividends results from the carry that is generated when the dividends paid by the securities in the indices upon which the etns are based exceed the implicit borrowing rate while typically called dividends the payments from etns are technically distributions of interest payments on the etn note based on the dividends paid by the underlying securities that comprise the index pursuant to the terms of the indenture additionally 2x leveraged high yield etns especially those based on mreits have extra interest rate exposure due to the fact that many of the component securities in the index utilize leverage as well to a lesser or greater extent all of the 2x leveraged high yield etns have some credit risk thus all of the risks that impact both the fixed income and equity markets impact the 2x leveraged high yield etns as well a useful generalization is that stronger economic activity benefits the stock market relative to the bond markets likewise weaker economic activity benefits the bond market relative to the stock markets there are some exceptions to these generalizations economic weakness can exacerbate credit risks in the high yield junk bond market using cefl to diversify a portfolio based on 2x leveraged mreit based etns such as morl mrrl and reml has been fairly expensive in terms of forgone return from an only mreit based etns portfolio from inception on january 7 2014 through to march 29 2019 cefl has had a total return of 30 79 based on closing prices and assuming reinvestment of dividends that is an average annual of 5 27 over that 5 22 year period over the same january 7 2014 through to march 29 2019 period morl has had a total return of 128 13 that is an average annual of 17 11 over that 5 22 year period mrrl and reml have not been in existence as long as morl or cefl as discussed in considering 20 yielding reml as a substitute for morl i pointed out that the returns on morl have exceeded those of reml and mrrl solely because ubs ag ubs has stopped selling new shares of morl which has caused morl to now trade above its net indicative asset value other than that the returns on morl mrrl and reml have been very close bdcl the oldest of the 2x leveraged high yield etns that i follow has generally been an expensive diversifier as well from the october 17 2012 inception of morl through to march 29 2019 bdcl has had a total return of 51 52 based on closing prices and assuming reinvestment of dividends that is an average annual of 6 65 over that 6 45 year period over the same october 17 2012 through to march 29 2019 period morl has had a total return of 121 05 that is an average annual of 13 09 over that 6 45 year period smhb and the older 2x leveraged high yield etn etracs monthly pay 2xleveraged us small cap high dividend etn smhd are based on the solactive us small cap high dividend index and have also been expensive diversifiers i used smhd before switching to smhb from the february 4 2015 inception of smhb through to march 29 2019 smhd has had a total return of 16 2 based on closing prices and assuming reinvestment of dividends that is an average annual of 3 69 over that 4 15 year period over the same february 4 2015 through to march 29 2019 period morl has had a total return of 79 36 that is an average annual of 15 14 over that 4 15 year period smhb only started trading on november 9 2018 from november 9 2018 through march 29 2019 smhb has had a total return of 10 46 based on closing prices and assuming reinvestment of dividends that is an average annual of a negative 27 47 over that 38 year period over the same november 9 2018 through to march 29 2019 period morl has had a total return of 8 14 that is an average annual of 22 09 over that 38 year period other possible diversifiers for a 15 current yield portfolio i am always looking for new possible diversifiers for my 15 current yield constrained portfolio junk bonds and other securities issued by individual distressed entities usually have extreme idiosyncratic risk if they have current yields above 15 these can provide diversification but usually require constant time consuming monitoring thus i am particularly interested in securities that are themselves comprised of or based on baskets of securities such as the 2x leveraged high yield etns i believe in what george goodman who wrote and appeared on television under the name adam smith said if you want to really learn about something take a financial stake in it as an example he said buy one corn future on the chicago board of trade and you will find yourself up at 4 00 am in the morning looking at weather patterns in iowa unfortunately for me mr goodman said that prior to the internet and the tremendous amount of interesting information and opportunities to do fascinating research it provides also as many people who are retired or semi retired people find out there is not nearly enough available time for those books and other projects you thought could be easily finished after you stop working full time that said i bought a small amount of various securities for the express purpose of learning a lot more about them so that i could research and evaluate their use as possible diversifiers in the 15 current yield constrained portfolio and also write about them however so far i have not had time to do so these small positions include infracap mlp etf amza ubs etracs monthly pay 2xleveraged wells fargo mlp ex

partnerships and limited liability companies taxed as partnerships in the energy infrastructure sector it employs some leverage and writes options to enhance yield from inception on october 2 2014 through to march 29 2019 amza has had a total return of 48 03 based on closing prices and assuming reinvestment of dividends that is an average annual return of 13 56 over that 4 49 year period over

primarily in senior secured loans made to companies whose debt is unrated or rated below investment grade senior loans with an emphasis on current income one concern is that it trades significantly

hypothetical notional portfolio that takes a long position in reference oil shares and sells a succession of notional approximately one month call options on the reference oil shares with a strike price of approximately 106 of the price of the reference oil shares exercisable on the option expiration date the biggest risk would seem to be a collapse in oil prices that does not seem very likely in the near term usoi has only traded since june 6 2017 it has done better than morl since then from the initial closing price on june 6 2017 of 21 63 through to march 29 2019 price when the closing

dividend for the cefl components that will contribute to the april 2019 march dividend conclusions and recommendations i am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio within the 15 yield constraint usoi is probably the candidate that i will be giving most attention to it was brought to my attention by a comment in one of my recent articles comments regarding any high yielding securities are always appreciated including cefl in my portfolio of 2x leveraged high yield etns as a diversifier has been relatively expensive when compared to what my total returns would have been if i had held only morl as compared to a mixture of morl and cefl i have also used bdcl as a diversifier for my morl mrrl and reml holdings that has turned out even worse relative to simply holding only morl stocks and fixed income securities in a sense compete for shares of investors portfolios a decline in the equity market can cause some investors to rebalance their portfolios to shift out of fixed income securities into stocks likewise a decline in the fixed income market can cause some investors to rebalance their portfolio and shift out of stocks into fixed income securities federal reserve tightening can hurt all financial markets simultaneously likewise federal reserve ease can boost all financial markets simultaneously i am still cautiously bullish on cefl as a diversifier for my holdings of 2x leveraged high yield etns that are based on mreits cefl and smhb some of the few instruments in my portfolio that provide a very high yield and some ability to benefit from a rising stock market many of the policy risks that have arisen as a result of the 2016 election are now becoming more pronounced the january 30 2019 statement by federal reserve chair powell that they are not planning any further rate increases but that federal reserve could change that policy based on the data sparked a large stock market rally as with much economic news there are two or more interpretations with regard to the impact on financial markets there was a benefit to securities prices from the belief that interest rates will be lower than had been the consensus view there was also some concern that the federal reserve may think economic activity will not be as robust some data on retail sales has also suggested a slowdown new risks seem to occur with increasing frequency the risk that the border with mexico could be closed and thus jeopardizing 1 7 billion in trade every day was not a risk on my radar last week the uncertainty of possible impacts from possible protectionism federal budget deficits political developments possible overheating in the economy and monetary policy suggests large fat tail risks in both directions in the equity market and fixed income markets this would lead investors who have a significant portion of their portfolios in cefl to consider adding morl mrrl or reml to hedge against the risk of much weaker economic growth this would enable them to maintain the high income that cefl now delivers likewise morl mrrl and reml investors might want to consider adding cefl or bdcl in order to hedge against a high real growth scenario smhb could be utilized by investors who want to only invest in one 2x leveraged etn since it contains both interest rate sensitive components and credit risk sensitive components the yields on all of the high yielding 2x leveraged etns like cefl are still compelling however the uncertainty regarding economic variables means that significant event risks exist in addition to the risks inherent with the etn s use of leverage this is in addition to the leverage employed by many of the components that make up the indices upon which these etns are based i am diversifying the large proportion of morl mrrl and reml in my portfolio with some cefl smhb and bdcl since there is a possibility of much stronger economic growth than i expect at any time there could still be a perception on the part of many market participants that there will be much stronger economic growth this should be considered by shorter term investors if something catastrophic were to occur like a financial crisis severe protectionism or an oil shock it would be expected that the stock market would decline sharply but morl mrrl and reml could do better as investors seek the safety of agency mortgage backed securities and the federal reserve lowers interest rates in view of the uncertainty and risks active traders might consider waiting until the impacts of the iran decertification protectionism federal budget deficits and monetary policy on economic conditions become more clear however a lesson we can learn from the last few years is that waiting for price declines in high yielding instruments like cefl morl mrrl and reml can backfire as the large dividends forgone by waiting exceeds the savings from a lower purchase price since 2012 i have been willing to collect and reinvest the approximately 20 average yield on a monthly compounded basis that 2x leveraged etns pay while the ultimate answers to questions about the outlook for the economy and securities markets are revealed i still am when the yields rise on price declines it has been a buying opportunity my view for the last few years has been that there will likely be more reductions than increases in the federal funds rate during the next five years furthermore the possibility exists that trump s trade policies could precipitate a lehman collapse like event in a scenario like that 2x leveraged etns would be one of the better places to be in trump s trade policies america s brexit risks related to protectionism are discussed in depth as was discussed in bank issues could impact 20 yielding etns recently a french court ordered switzerland s largest bank to pay 4 5 billion euros 5 1 billion in fines and damages for helping wealthy french clients evade tax authorities it is not inconceivable that zealous government authorities could impose such draconian fines and penalties so as to cause the demise of one or more major financial institutions that could impact the world economy in a way similar to the collapse of lehman in 2008 more relevant is that ubs is the sole source of the interest and principal payments made by the etns it sponsors the etns are notes and thus obligations of ubs that does expose the investor to some degree of credit risk however it is very different and of much less magnitude than the type of credit risk one would face by buying a regular senior bond issued by ubs if you were to buy a bond from ubs and something drastic happens causing ubs to be downgraded to say bbb you would suffer an immediate loss since the credit risk of the downgraded bond would be reflected in the market price however the net asset value of ubs redeemable etns such as morl and cefl would not be affected and because shares of the etn can be redeemed at net asset value the market price of the etn would not be impacted either even if the ability to redeem shares did not exist the ubs credit risk with morl and cefl would be normally rather small usb has a relatively high percentage of their revenue from fees for managing assets which is a much more stable revenue base than making loans underwriting or trading securities i still tend to believe that the massive tax policy induced increase in inequality will cause increasing excesses of loanable and investable funds above commercially reasonable ways to utilize those funds this will eventually result in an overinvestment cycle with a recession and that will ultimately be very good for the 2x leveraged etns there have been some policy proposals being put forth by some prominent democrats not considered populists since the 2018 elections that might be of particular concern to investors in morl mrrl and reml as described in my 2013 seeking alpha article a depression with benefits the macro case for mreits my macroeconomic rationale for investing in morl the only 2x leveraged mreit etn in existence at that time was based on the premise that government policies shifting the tax burden from the rich and onto the middle class results in more funds being available for investment relative to productive uses for those investable funds recently some prominent democrats have gone from the vague advocacy of making the very rich pay their fair share to specific proposals to shifting the tax burden back on to the rich senator announced presidential candidate elizabeth warren d mass is proposing an annual wealth tax on americans with more than 50 million in assets the tax would be 2 on the amount in excess of 50 million and 3 on amounts above 1 billion celebrity member of congress alexandria ocasio cortez d ny is calling for a 70 top marginal tax rate on incomes above 10 million whatever one thinks of the advisability of enacting legislation that reverses the massive shift in the tax burden away from the rich and onto the middle class it could have negative implication for the financial markets since shifting the tax burden from the rich and onto the middle class results in there being more funds being available for investment reversing that results in less funds being available for investment the probability of the 2020 election resulting in a change in the tax code that significantly reverses the massive shift in the tax burden away from the rich and onto the middle class is still very probably low as long as the democrats continue to combine such tax proposals with plans to spend the proceeds on various social programs like free college tuition however a plan to raise taxes on those with assets above 50 million and or incomes above 10 million and use all of the proceeds to reduce the taxes on everyone else might have a much higher probability of being enacted it is hard to envision the democrats being politically savvy or ideologically flexible enough to embrace a policy of directly shifting the tax burden away from the middle class and onto the rich the democrats have generally been deluded in their belief that the current level of taxes on the middle class is politically sustainable in hilary clinton s speech announcing her candidacy she said that the middle class pays too much taxes she never mentioned a middle class tax cut again presumably due to pressure from sanders who pushed her to the left which severely hurt her chances in the general election most democrat politicians are not aware that by far the best thing government could do for most middle class households would be to lower their taxes thus in many cases middle class voters have been willing to grasp at any chance they think could lower their tax burden and thus support candidates who promise them a tax cut no matter how odious the candidates might be otherwise taking all of this into consideration i m still a cautious buyer of 2x leveraged etns and have added to them recently it should be kept in mind that economic and policy uncertainty that seems to be diverging rather than converging this means that significant event risks exist in addition to the

the opening plenum of the boao forum for asia annual conference 2019 is held on march 28 xinhua the coastal town of boao in hainan province is blessed with all the necessary elements for a popular tropical resort yet with a name which means abundant fat fish it remained an obscure fishing village until it was inaugurated as the permanent venue of the boao forum for asia bfa annual conference in 2002 from march 26 to 29 it was again host to the yearly gathering with more than 2 000 participants from home and abroad under the theme shared future concerted action common development strong support for multilateralism and globalization is the most important outcome and most encouraging message of this year s annual meeting said li baodong secretary general of the bfa at a press conference concluding the forum the message this conference wishes to convey is unequivocal we are on the same planet in the same boat and with a shared future said bfa chairman ban ki moon at the opening plenum there is no alternative solution to our common challenges such as climate change income inequality and sustainable growth we must work together under the multilateral framework through close coordination cooperation and dialogue and with concerted actions a globalized world the forum was held amid a downturn in international trade and investment and rising protectionism the world economy shows weakening momentum with growing uncertainties and volatility recently major international institutions have lowered their expectations for world economic growth in 2019 on march 28 while addressing the opening plenum premier li keqiang stressed that all parties should work together to uphold the un centered international system and rules based multilateral trading system and advance reform in the global governance system decades of progress in economic globalization has shaped a sophisticated international division of labor and linked up the industrial innovation and value chains of various countries making them ever more interdependent in economic development premier li said in the face of world economic headwinds and other common challenges no country can stay immune or resolve all the problems he called on countries to seek mutually beneficial cooperation and boost world economic development with an open mind an inclusive approach and concerted actions the trajectory of the world economy after the second world war shows that multilateralism is the right way to ensure lasting prosperity and development premier li commented china stands for fair trade and has taken concrete actions to uphold fairness and equity the lack of which would make trade unsustainable he said leaders from other countries and some business elites have also reiterated their support for globalization free trade and multilateralism from their respective perspectives li baodong noted the bfa secretary general said that participants called for developing an open world economy and agreed that countries must adapt to globalization rather than resist it and moreover they should rebuild confidence in multilateralism multilateralism is an important guarantee for globalization said chen deming former minister of commerce noting that china adheres to multilateralism complemented with regional cooperation under the multilateral system differentiated economic and trade treatment for developing countries addresses the imbalances of development in different regions and enables relatively fair competition between emerging countries and developed countries he said liu zhenmin un under secretary general also stated his support for multilateralism in global governance i am very concerned about the threats to globalization and the consequences of the absence of multilateralism on global governance he warned unilateral actions aggravate confrontation between countries said james bacchus director of the center for global economic and environmental opportunity at the university of central florida he is a founding judge and former chairman of the appellate body of the world trade organization wto only by working together can the value of the wto and its 164 members be given full play bacchus said lakhdar brahimi former un and arab league joint special representative for syria and former foreign minister of algeria expressed his frustration with unilateralism if one country any country does not follow the rules it will be bad he said if a country just stands its own ground and imposes its ideas on others this cold war mentality is typical unilateralism he said stating that countries should advocate multilateralism and revitalize international organizations revamping governance the existing global governance system was established after world war ii and has existed for more than 70 years but in recent years the rise of unilateralism protectionism and populism has posed unprecedented challenges to the system while a good number of bfa participants advocate multilateralism they also believe the current global governance system needs an overhaul the world economic system rests on three pillars namely the international monetary fund the world bank and the wto said jin liqun president of the asian infrastructure investment bank he said that the system set up decades ago no longer fits since the balance of economic power has changed over seven decades many things have changed and many developed countries have lost their competitiveness in many sectors this has led to domestic problems in these countries because they refuse to reform on their own and instead look to blame other countries he said on the global level the system needs to be overhauled at a domestic level you have to reform and adapt he added we should sit down and reform the multilateral system in order to adapt to changes in the world s political and economic pattern the global governance system should be moved toward a fairer and more equitable direction in order to provide stronger support to global growth premier li said however he also stressed that reform does not mean starting all over again or serving the interests of a handful of countries premier li reiterated that china supports necessary reforms to the wto but insisted that its basic principles and core values must be adhered to the interests and concerns of all parties must be effectively addressed and the differences in countries development levels must be factored in in particular much attention needs to be given to protecting the rights and interests of developing countries and narrowing the north south gap he said a great challenge for the wto is that it is being marginalized said chong quan president of the china society for world trade organization studies pointing out that the most pressing issue for the wto is to revitalize its dispute settlement mechanism resolving trade disputes is one of the wto s core activities its members have agreed to use the multilateral system of settling disputes instead of taking unilateral action the wto s dispute settlement body decides the outcome of a trade dispute on the recommendation of the dispute panel and for appealed cases on a report from the appellate body the appellate body is made up of seven permanent members with each serving a four year term an appeal must be heard by at least three judges at present due to various reasons such as judges poor health or the expiration of their term the appellate body urgently needs to add new members the selection process for members can only be started with a unanimous agreement by all wto members however due to u s obstruction it has been difficult to start the judge selection process meanwhile understaffing will soon result in a backlog of trade disputes or even the paralysis of the organization currently bacchus said the appellate body has only three members and in december there will only be one judge left leaving the wto dispute solution system bogged down posing an existential crisis he suggested that the number of appellate body staff should be increased from seven to 10 and that they should be full time rather than part time in addition he proposed that some members be allowed to serve a second term the wto decision making body is not efficient enough which is one of the reasons why it is facing problems said zhou xiaochuan vice chairman of the bfa and former governor of the people s bank of china he said that in 2008 when the global financial crisis broke out the leaders of the group of 20 strongly pushed forward the doha development round and hoped to reach an agreement as soon as possible however after so many years the progress of the doha round is still unsatisfactory indicating that the mechanism is not efficient enough and needs reform carlos gutierrez former u s secretary of commerce said he believes that the wto s failure to keep pace with the times is also a cause of many of its problems he said technology has evolved very fast and the wto has not caught up with what has developed or what is coming gutierrez noted that rebuilding confidence in multilateralism is crucial to the success of wto reform we have an administration that does not like multilateralism he said referring to the donald trump administration s withdrawal from a number of international treaties entering multilateral treaties is an expression of sovereignty while the current administration in washington believes the contrary he explained zhou also pointed out that the prerequisite for wto reform is that member states should have a sincere desire if most countries support multilateralism wto reform will be agreed upon and progress will be made he said a shared future through these brainstorming discussions this conference has achieved some very important consensus such as strengthening international cooperation building an open world economy persistently promoting structural reform pursuing high quality development and driving economic development through innovation including in technology process institution and concept li baodong said in his summary of the four day conference while hailing the conference as a feast of ideas he also called on people to act together in the interest of all here in boao let s bring our voices together now showing that we share the same future and will not wait until after the earth wanders as depicted in the sci fi movie the wandering earth he suggested putting aside conflicts and disputes and focusing on common development after an intellectually intense day you may want to enjoy the starry night of this small coastal town li baodong told participants if viewed from the vast universe the earth which is inhabited by over 7 billion people is nothing but a tiny spot making any conflict or dispute happening in this world simply insignificant copyedited by rebeca toledo
world trade shrank by 0 3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018 and is likely to grow by 2 6 per cent this year slower than 3 per cent growth in 2018 and below a previous forecast of 3 7 per cent the world trade organisation said on tuesday in its annual forecast the wto said trade had been weighed down by new tariffs and retaliatory measures weaker economic growth volatility in financial markets and tighter monetary conditions in developed countries according to reuters it forecast in september that 2018 growth would be 3 9 per cent down from 4 6 per cent in 2017 with trade tensions running high no one should be surprised by this outlook trade cannot play its full role in driving growth when we see such high levels of uncertainty said wto director general roberto azevedo of course there are other elements at play but rising trade tensions are the major factor he said i think it s pretty obvious that the tensions between the united states and china play a big role he declined to predict the impact of britain s departure from the european union although the volume of trade grew only slowly in 2018 the dollar value rose 10 per cent to 19 48 trillion partly due to a 20 per cent rise in oil prices the wto said the value of commercial services trade grew by 8 per cent to 5 8tnn in 2018 driven by strong import growth in asia goods trade volumes are expected to grow more strongly in developing economies this year with 3 4 per cent growth in exports compared with 2 1 per cent in developed economies but the forecast is highly uncertain with this year s 2 6 per cent global growth figure just the midpoint of a range from 1 3 to 4 per cent the actual growth rate could be even higher or lower if trade tensions grow further or ease the wto said most risks remain firmly on the downside with upside potential hinging on a relaxation of trade tensions the wto report said wto chief economist robert koopman said worse may be to come with an even bigger impact if us president donald trump goes ahead with a plan to impose high tariffs on global imports of cars later this year us china trade is about 3 per cent of global trade automobile trade globally is about 8 per cent of global trade so you can imagine that the impact of automobile tariffs is going to be bigger than the impact of the us china trade conflict i think it s pretty clear that any automobile tariff would likely have bigger knock on effects through the global economy than what we see from the us china conflict while the wto did not make a specific prediction about the impact of brexit mr koopman said in the worst case it would help push global trade growth down to the bottom end of the wto s forecast range in 2019 1 3 to 4 per cent the uk s own analysis suggests that no deal or hard brexit would shave 7 6 per cent off british gdp that would be a big number it would force our numbers down to that lower part of our range mr koopman said if we end up in the fall with a revision my guess is the likelihood of a revision is that it s downward based on any number of factors from brexit to no resolution in the us china trade conflict and other trade conflicts going on central bankers and other policymakers have long warned of the impact of trade tensions on sentiment the oecd cut its 2019 global forecast last month and said a materialisation of risks related to protectionism could mean even weaker growth the imf which will update its outlook next week downgraded its view in january when it also warned that threats were on the increase the wto report cited various risks to trade growth including new tariffs and retaliatory measures affecting widely traded goods according to bloomberg it said volatility in financial markets and tighter monetary conditions also weighed on global trade growth rates the organisation said the worst case scenario of a global trade war would lead to a reduction in world gdp in 2022 of about 2 per cent and a reduction in global trade of about 17 per cent compared to baseline projections under the wto s worst case scenario international cooperation on tariffs breaks down completely and all countries set tariffs unilaterally

howard marks memo to oaktree clients for the month of april 2019 titled growing the pie memo to oaktree clients from howard marks re growing the pie get the full warren buffett series in pdf get the entire 10 part series on warren buffett in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q4 hedge fund letters conference scoops etc a few weeks ago we were pleased to announce a partnership with brookfield asset management that created an alternative investment manager with one of the broadest slates of strategies and greatest asset totals and what question did i get will there still be memos well here s your answer one thing i m not happy being right about is the tenor of the current debate over our economic system most of my january memo political reality meets economic reality was devoted to fretting over the rise of populism from the left and the resulting anti capitalist sentiment and it has risen further since i mentioned legislation that had been introduced to appropriate some of corporations cash and governance rights for workers as well as a proposal for a higher income tax bracket for top earners since then we ve seen additional suggestions covering a wealth tax higher estate taxes and in new york city a tax on pieds à terre clearly companies and wealthy individuals are being viewed by some as attractive political targets and good sources of incremental revenue one of the main reasons behind populism s ability to stir people is the favorable reception its rhetoric receives they have too much we ve been short changed the system s rigged they got where they are by cheating the rich don t pay their fair share sound bites like these find receptive audiences among people who are unhappy with their lot whereas detecting the error in these statements requires an insight sense of history and understanding of economics that many people lack what s going on in the january memo i set forth my view that in the last 10 20 years the rising economic tide had stopped lifting all boats in addition major social and economic trends contributed to increases in economic inequality these developments i said were largely behind the rise of populism ray dalio and bridgewater actually beat my memo by two days publishing on january 28 an excellent note titled populism weakening economy limited central bank power to ease elections risky markets and risky economies i was particularly drawn to the following passage disparity in wealth especially when accompanied by disparity in values leads to increasing conflict and in the government that manifests itself in the form of populism of the left and populism of the right as a rule populists of the right who are usually capitalists don t know how to divide the pie well while populists of the left who are usually socialists don t know how to grow the pie populism of both the right behind donald trump and the left behind bernie sanders played a big part in the 2016 presidential election season it s the latter that s my subject here in my january memo i argued at length that capitalism can be credited with much of what made the united states what it is today in short to borrow ray s terminology the capitalist system achieved this by creating the biggest pie the largest total gdp in the world and one of the highest per capita gdps and only capitalism is likely to cause the pie to continue to grow the failure of non capitalist systems to produce economic growth and prosperity is well documented obviously however when the pie is divided up under capitalism not everyone gets the same sized piece that s the idea underlying the following line in winston churchill s speech in the house of commons on october 22 1945 the inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings as with so many things churchill said it best under capitalism we re likely to see bigger slices of the pie go for example to those who are smarter more talented and more hardworking but also to those who are luckier or born into wealth the first three of these explanations are generally considered valid the fourth is not and people fight about the last the gains produced by capitalism are inseparable from actually they derive from the opportunity for those who are smarter more talented and more hardworking to end up with bigger slices of the pie on the other hand no one considers it inherently desirable that lucky people do so also and many think the benefits of inheritance should at least be watered down although generally not the benefactors or beneficiaries and what do the populists of the left want for the most part fairer and more equal outcomes they say relatively little about expanding the pie but more about fairness in how it s apportioned that s why churchill went on from the above to add the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries when we look around the world we see countries that have stressed equal sharing of the pie and others that have cared more about expanding the pie the equal sharers include cuba north korea venezuela and the ussr while the expanders in addition to the u s include south korea hong kong and singapore in which group of countries do people generally live better in which group would you rather live today many people apparently fail to understand the role of capitalism in creating the wealth that americans share others may feel the capitalism that got us here may have been fine in its time but isn t needed anymore thus we should shift our attention to more equal distribution instead and a last cohort may consider equal sharing more important than the creation of more prosperity socialism superimposes socio political considerations on an economic system such that equality is elevated relative to self interest and individual motivation capitalism omits that emphasis in this context last month charlie munger called my attention to china s agricultural history following the death of mao zedong in 1976 the following excerpts are from a 1986 paper in the journal of international affairs regarding the then recent agricultural reforms in china this ll be a long slog but i think it s worth studying how china transitioned from the equal sharing of miseries the long term 1957 1978 growth of cereal output just kept up with the expansion of the population over this period china actually was becoming more dependent on imported grain to feed its population by 1978 about 30 million urbanites roughly 40 percent of the population of china s municipalities were dependent on imported cereals the performance of most non grain crops was even less impressive the slow growth of farm output not surprisingly was accompanied by extraordinarily modest growth of peasant income by 1978 an apparent consensus had been reached at the highest levels of the chinese communist party that the painfully slow growth of agricultural output was caused by certain inefficiencies of china s collective production structure the loss of productivity resulting from the promotion of local self sufficiency the curtailment of rural marketing and the disincentive of relatively low prices for farm products beginning in 1978 the central committee endorsed a series of sweeping reforms that addressed each of these problems collectivized agriculture was replaced with a system of household farming in which the land was divided among existing households decisions on cropping patterns and the quantities of fertilizers and other inputs to be used are now made by each household rather than by team and brigade leaders peasants are now encouraged to specialize and produce for the market rather than being forced to be self sufficient comparative advantage cropping has been encouraged by reopening rural markets these reforms have led to an unprecedented pace of growth since 1978 grain output for example had grown from 305 to 407 million metric tons an average annual rate of almost 5 percent well over twice the historic rate of 2 1 percent achieved between 1957 and 1978 the official jettisoning of the policy of local cereals self reliance encapsulated in the maoist slogan take grain as the key link and the reopening of rural markets have stimulated an upsurge of production of non cereal crops the unprecedented growth of agricultural output also has been accompanied by substantial growth in real farm income average per capita farm income in current prices rose from 134 yuan in 1978 to 355 yuan in 1984 the gains derive not only from the growth of farm output but also from the substantial expansion of rural non farm employment and income although decollectivization has provided the incentives for improved productivity growth it has created significant and partially unanticipated adverse consequences over the longer run it is not clear how the local labor intensive maintenance of existing irrigation systems will be sustained the current system appears almost certain to have an adverse effect on the distribution of income in rural areas and may lead ultimately to significant rural unrest another seemingly unanticipated consequence of the demise of the collective system is the impaired delivery of rural social services state budgetary funds for rural health care and primary school education always have been limited most of these programs were financed by collectively accumulated welfare funds a final unanticipated consequence of the reform is its budgetary impact while the higher farm quota prices the state introduced along with decollectivization have contributed significantly to greater incentives and productivity for peasant producers the financial burden to the state of these incentives has mounted far more rapidly than expected the chinese experience described above tells the whole story in eight short years deregulation and decontrol free enterprise and the profit motive increased flexibility and choice the benefits of specialization and the allocation of resources via the free market the results vastly increased production but also greater inequality and reduced government services in other words you can t have it all most people lived much better because of the reforms whereas under the prior system everyone had it the same but most people lived far less well which was fairer capitalism doesn t know about or care about fairness in the sense of equal sharing what it considers fair is the proposition that people who have greater ability or work harder should be able to earn more that potential it says provides incentives for hard work and rewards those who achieve ultimately resulting in a better life for almost everyone the story of china just like that of america shows that it works a case in point we like our pie the way it is one of the biggest stories in the business world over the last two years was amazon s search for a location for another headquarters a total of 238 cities towns and other entities submitted proposals trumpeting their merits as a possible location for hq2 and in many cases offering financial inducements the big news came last november when long island city in queens new york was chosen for amazon s expansion as was northern virginia the parameters in queens included a 2 5 billion investment on amazon s part approximately 25 000 new amazon jobs plus the likelihood of thousands more in construction local infrastructure and support businesses 27 billion of projected incremental state and city tax revenues over the subsequent 25 years and 3 billion returned to amazon over that period in the form of tax credits and subsidies the deal s supporters were elated but opposition soon began to form and on february 14 amazon pulled out the plan fell apart in the face of a backlash over public subsidies resentment of the covert process in which the city and the state negotiated the deal and concern about its neighborhood impact the new york times february 22 labor unions that would want to organize amazon s operation opposed the deal because of amazon s policy of resisting unionization although unsurprisingly the bargain was supported by unions for construction workers and others anticipating expanded work opportunities politics reared its head of course especially when the state senate majority leader nominated michael gianaris who represents long island city to the obscure public authorities control board which had the power to thwart the project according to the new york post gianaris opposed the subsidies and was miffed at not having been consulted by the mayor and governor when the deal was negotiated some say his nomination while never effective was the nail in the deal s coffin finally populist rhetoric injected resentment into the process as per an article in the new yorker magazine of november 17 richard florida the urban studies theorist told that amazon s hq2 competition captures the zeitgeist of early 21st century american late capitalism he added the very idea that a trillion dollar company run by the world s richest man could run an american idol auction on more than two hundred thirty cities across the united states and canada and mexico to extract data on sites and on incentives and pick up a handy three billion dollars of taxpayer money in the process is a sad statement of extreme corporate power in our time alexandria ocasio cortez the representative elect of new york s fourteenth congressional district which spans parts of the bronx and queens criticized the deal on twitter the idea that will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need more investment not less is extremely concerning to residents here she wrote reached by telephone on thursday ocasio cortez called the amazon deal dressed up trickle down economics what we re seeing here is a complete public cost for a private corporate benefit she told me when you give a three billion dollar tax break to the richest company in the world that means that you re giving up our schools you re giving up our infrastructure you re giving up our community development in other words there is an opportunity cost to luring the world s richest man by letting him free ride on the public services that other new yorkers must pay for although the majority of new yorkers supported the deal in polls the combined forces in opposition were sufficient to turn amazon away in a statement the company said for amazon the commitment to build a new headquarters requires positive collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long term that doesn t sound unreasonable but amazon s decision not to go forward was cause for victory celebrations on the left city councilman jimmy von bramer said even when we were faced with the richest man in the world and the richest company in the world we did not buckle amazon doesn t need our 3 billion new york post february 15 and rep ocasio cortez tweeted the following anything is possible today was the day a group of dedicated everyday new yorkers their neighbors defeated amazon s corporate greed its worker exploitation and the power of the richest man in the world in other words the response from the progressive left was that amazon could take those jobs and shove them i don t mean to single out ocasio cortez and i have nothing against her but she is the most prominent spokesperson for the approach that so troubles me and what she says exemplifies that which i want to resist here s what the washington post owned by amazon s jeff bezos said in a february 21 article titled alexandria ocasio cortez is an economic illiterate and that s a danger to america case in point last week ocasio cortez celebrated the tanking of the deal negotiated by her fellow democrats in which amazon promised to build a new headquarters in long island city new york right next to her congressional district amazon s departure cost the city between 25 000 and 40 000 new jobs forget the tech workers whom amazon would have employed gone are all the unionized construction jobs to build the headquarters as well as thousands of jobs created by all the small businesses restaurants bodegas dry cleaners and food carts that were preparing to open or expand to serve amazon employees they are devastated by amazon s withdrawal ocasio cortez was not disturbed at all we were subsidizing those jobs she said frankly if we were willing to give away 3 billion for this deal we could invest those 3 billion in our district ourselves if we wanted to we could hire out more teachers we can fix our subways we can put a lot of people to work for that amount of money if we wanted to she entirely misses the point there was no 3 billion sitting in a city bank account waiting to be spent on either subsidies for amazon or enhanced services for new yorkers the 3 billion going to amazon wouldn t have represented a diversion of resources from other potential uses it consisted entirely of contingent future payments the part that would be kicked back to amazon from the taxes it would pay the balance of which could be used to support infrastructure or services no amazon no 3 billion paid out and no 24 billion of net taxes received by the city and state ocasio cortez either a completely misunderstood the deal she was criticizing or b overlooked the facts in favor of rhetoric calculated to play on resentment and scare up votes which explanation would you consider preferable a lot of readers enjoyed the story in my january memo about the ten men who drank beer in a bar every night with each paying according to his ability it was included as an appendix nancy missed it the first time through i hope you didn t when the grateful bar owner took 20 off their collective tab the ten disagreed over how the reduction should be divided up since most of it appeared likely to go to the richest man who d been paying most of the bill in their anger the other nine men beat up the tenth he didn t come back after that leaving the nine unable to afford their daily beer they sure showed him and likewise new york showed amazon they beat amazon up and it s not coming back if you look back at the politicians statements above you ll see they re all about resentment of amazon s and bezos s wealth and how unwarranted the subsidies were but there was no mention of the lost potential jobs or what s good for new york s economy or more importantly for its people new york had a great chance to expand the pie and the populists of the left found a way to scuttle it another example of channeling resentment toward the rich is the pied à terre tax that s been proposed in new york city the tax was inspired by a money manager s purchase of a 228 million apartment as a second or possibly third home it would impose a levy on houses and apartments worth more than 5 million that aren t primary residences on the grounds that the owners benefit from their homes new york location without paying new york income tax but is it smart absentee owners pay real estate tax even though they use few city services and when they come to town their spending contributes to the economy do they really abuse the city and the new tax would exacerbate the current glut of high end homes by turning away some of the potential purchasers for whom they were built the new york times march 24 says the tax is one small way to make new york city a little fairer it also mentions the political palatability of a tax on wealthy absentee owners but given that the obvious effect will be to depress the market for homes and diminish employment in a broad range of related industries does it make economic sense the rhetoric of the far left plays on resentments and differences and it s easily swallowed but the policies are more likely to equalize the sharing of misery than to expand blessings however unequal about 50 years ago an older friend described for me what he felt made america great when the worker in britain sees the boss drive out of the factory in his rolls royce he says i d like to put a bomb under that car but when the worker in the u s sees the boss drive out of the factory in his cadillac he says someday i ll own a car like that today too few americans feel they might own that cadillac taken to the logical extreme that has the potential to bring the american miracle to an end thus business should do all it can to arrest the trend toward stagnant and unequal incomes not just to be fair or generous but to assure perpetuation of the system that got us here capitalism is the most dependable route to prosperity and it has to be responsible capitalism the solution can t lie in turning away the amazons of the world imposing extra taxes on cadillacs or otherwise shrinking the pie
