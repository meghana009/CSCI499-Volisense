malaysia recently cancelled 22billion of investments financed by china sri lanka has asked the imf for help pakistan is preparing to do the same by alessandro giardiello when china wakes up she will shake the world this famous prediction of napoleon has been confirmed by history particularly in the last 20 years china has become an economic power of primary importance that objectively threatens the world leadership of the united states but now for the first time beijing will no longer be a buffer against world recession as it was after the 1990s and until very recently but one of its triggers now the question is not just how will china enter the impending world recession but above all how will it come out of it trade donald trump s trade war with china is no joke in december it caused a 63 percent fall in us imports from china and at the same time there was a collapse of foreign direct investment towards beijing in november it was 26 3 percent according to data from the ministry of commerce and this continued in the following months although at less devastating levels the value of stocks on the shanghai stock exchange has also fallen by 20 percent in the same period however the most interesting data as observed by il sole 24 ore is that a dramatic fall in private investments and a substantial recovery in the investments of state companies were already underway in conflict with what had previously been decided in other words they had to plug the crisis through state spending and avoid the risk of contagion given that as the world bank writes china is deeply integrated into the global economy suffice it to say that china s investments represent one fifth of global investments and account for 42 percent of the recovery after the crisis in 2010 15 the decline in chinese private investment raises serious concerns on the part of the government over the country s gdp growth prospects china s potential growth is expected to decrease from its previous 10 6 percent in 2010 to 6 percent in 2020 today it is officially at 6 4 percent this may seem positive by european standards but with a 4 percent population growth and internal mobility of tens of millions of chinese who move from the countryside to the cities every year looking for a job this figure is considered to indicate a stagnant economy and moreover is destined to worsen a sea of debt furthermore the chinese economy is beginning to drown in a sea of debt as was the case in all the historically advanced countries of world capitalism in recent years with the difference that beijing has accumulated its debt over a much shorter period of time according to the international monetary fund imf chinese state debt has reached us 6 trillion while the total overall debt which also includes household private and bank debts stands at the astronomical level of us 23 trillion as we will see despite the efforts undertaken by xi jinping to reach an agreement with the us on trade it is unlikely that these will have a lasting positive impact the pressure is bound to increase in the face of numerous declarations that go in the direction of d√©tente between the two countries the facts tell a different story huawei china s largest telecommunications company is preparing a billion dollar lawsuit against the us government certainly the us request for the canadian authorities to put meng wanzhou the financial director as well as the founder s daughter of the chinese giant under house arrest cannot be considered an act of reconciliation towards beijing pressure from the us and the european commission against the italian government is becoming more and more aggressive italy has been accused of acting as a trojan horse favouring the penetration of chinese products into the european market by joining the one belt one road also known as the new silk road initiative during chinese president xi jinping s recent visit to italy on 22 march italy officially signed up to the chinese mega project what we see here is china s new role and the level of the conflict that is maturing on an international scale overproduction china has a desperate need to widen its commercial outlets as it has been overproducing for some time even though the xi jinping government has gone beyond the natural laws of capitalism and has continued to invest impressive amounts as a measure to artificially support the economy this policy of credit expansion which economists call quantitative easing which all the central banks in the world overdid after the 2008 crisis is being used less and less for the simple reason that it no longer has an effect as bloomberg confirmed recently 01 17 2019 the fed the american central bank abandoned it more than a year ago followed by the ecb in january of this year in japan it has had no effect for at least a decade now it is china s turn to find itself in a paradoxical situation as only a part of the gigantic debt that it has accumulated has served to develop new industrial technologies and infrastructures while a substantial part has gone to support the national currency and defunct public enterprises that can no longer survive on their own within the market this is for the simple reason that if the chinese government had acted any differently it would have added to unemployment created by private companies carrying out tens of millions of redundancies in the state owned companies so we see how keynesian policies are no longer having the desired effect even in china in the only country that seemed to still have the financial resources to maintain them beijing continues to have significant foreign exchange reserves 3 2 trillion dollars even if this is down compared to 4 4 trillion a few years ago and certainly has the largest banks in the world although new clouds are gathering on the horizon in addition to the debt bubble the real estate bubble and the protectionist measures of trump china is starting to have problems even with its allies that joined one belt one road in recent years several of these countries have fallen into the classic debt trap and are indebted at levels that are no longer sustainable including among others malaysia pakistan myanmar sri lanka etc malaysia recently cancelled 22billion of investments financed by china sri lanka has asked the imf for help pakistan is preparing to do the same even though mike pompeo us secretary of state has already declared that they will not give pakistan a penny if this money goes to repay debts to china the pressures made by china to bring india into the project resulted first in the conflict in bhutan and more recently in the resumption of the conflict on the kashmir border with the killing of two indian fighters by the pakistani army there is now an increasingly stable alliance between the usa india japan and australia to limit chinese expansion in asia and the world the exhaustion of quantitative easing policies by the us fed and the relative increase in interest rates on the dollar have caused a further shock for china as capital is tending to flee the country already in 2015 the government s attempt to support the currency cost billions on the other hand accepting the devaluation would lead to new heavy internal contradictions increases in interest rates and the cost of imports and external contradictions increased commercial tensions the rising level of tension with the us is revealed by changes in china s foreign policy which in the past had always been prudent which is confirmed in the situation in venezuela where china has openly sided with maduro they need commercial outlets through consolidating economic relations and finding new economic and political partners this will bring them up against the interests of the us and also the european union that is why beyond public declarations commercial tensions are destined to remain and even deepen working class and students towards a chinese 68 as a result of the crisis companies are starting to close in china despite the state s efforts unemployment is growing although this is not accurately recorded by the regime s statistics and trade union disputes are on the increase the thing that worries the regime the most is that these disputes which have been growing since 2008 are also starting to involve students in guangdong the manufacturing centre of china and the world about 50 students joined the workers of jasic international at the end of july and wanted to unionise legally under the acftu the jasic workers initially obtained permission from the acftu to unionise but the latter then rescinded their permission which prompted the workers to enter into struggle the workers as soon as the students and workers gathered in a hotel in huizhou they were arrested by police in riot gear in major chinese universities students have stopped attending the official courses on marxism presented as courses on the theory of economic development since the autumn while self run courses have been organised on the crisis of overproduction and the class struggle the rector of beijing university has threatened to close the student run marxist society charging its members with developing a doctrine that aims to build links with the working class instead of sticking to the orthodoxy of the chinese communist party in nanjing two students were arrested in a demonstration against the non recognition of the marxist society and between november and december 12 students mysteriously disappeared in beijing shanghai guanzhou shenzen and wuhan the government has hired thugs who threatened and beat up the students who organised the search for their missing comrades the university administrators have accused them of conducting criminal activities the main reason why these students scare the regime so much is due to the fact that they come from elite universities they are the children of the new chinese ruling class and senior officials of the ccp bureaucracy these young people are gifted and influential they were taught to consider themselves as neoliberals thinking only of their own careers they were supposed to compete with each other and only think about how to make money and make their way through life then at some point they realised that despite their efforts and sacrifices they could not get the jobs they aspired to and they have ended up rediscovering marx what we are witnessing in china is a phenomenon very similar to what was seen in the french may 68 and in the italian hot autumn where the children of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie turned to the factories in search of unity with the working class the difference compared to back then is not only the size of the phenomenon china has a population of 1 4 billion and the most impressive industrial working class ever seen in history but above all in the fact that the chinese working class has no points of reference on the political and trade union level they are young and much more educated than the first generation of workers that emigrated from the countryside in the early 1990s to work in the cities this second generation not only does not trust the ruling party the ccp and the official unions but tends towards organising independent unions becoming the protagonist of uncontrollable mobilisations with real outbursts of anger against the regime there is no mass communist opposition party in china today such as that of marchais or berlinguer who in the 1960s and 1970s led the mobilisations in france and italy down reasonable and reformist channels who can play that role in today s china a young man who organised one of the student marxist societies was asked what are the causes of this return to marxism among young people in china the answer was the government focuses on confucianism the extended family and nationalism but this no longer works amongst the main causes for at least 20 percent of young chinese people looking at marxism there are basically two the slowing down of the economy and the revolutionary tradition of the country so to answer the questions posed at the beginning of this article we can say that china will enter the coming recession as a country that aspires to the leadership of world capitalism but which will emerge as an epicentre of a new revolutionary process transforming napoleon s hypothesis into the most earth shattering and grandiose of realities
australia s gross domestic product growth will cool from 2 8 per cent last year to 2 1 per cent in 2019 according to the imf report its forecast is 0 7 percentage point lower than the forecast last october for local investors however the early morning focus will likely be on crown resorts on tuesday crown shares closed 19 7 per cent higher at 14 05 after confirming a report by street talk that las vegas giant wynn resorts had made a takeover offer for the local casino company at an implied value of 14 75 per share the proposal involved 50 per cent cash and 50 per cent wynn shares and values crown at 10 billion star entertainment also rose on the news advancing 5 4 per cent to 4 47 it s reasonable to expect crown shares to drop back to earth this morning advertisement following the premature disclosure of preliminary discussions wynn resorts has terminated all discussions with crown resorts concerning any transaction the us company said in a terse one line statement overnight later today rba deputy governor guy debelle speaks and nab says it will be listening closely we think the speech could prove important given the rba tweaked the policy paragraph of its interest rate decision early in april which was the first change in years nab s senior fx strategist for markets rodrigo catril wrote in a morning note using citi s economic data surprise index recent data releases in australia have mostly printed on the better side of expectations and in fact when compared with the generally disappointing us economic data releases the improvement in australia s data releases has been quite impressive and supportive of a stronger aud one could argue then that the better australian data releases of late do not provide a smoking gun for deputy governor debelle to signal an imminent change in policy guidance mr catril said however we know the rba is biding its time in order to better assess how the tension between the strength in the labour market and slowdown in gdp growth resolves its self advertisement if we add to that the ongoing weakness in housing market including its impact on housing construction employment and wealth effect then we think debelle has plenty of ammunition to signal a new round of rba easing could be in the offing our economists believe that consumer spending is likely to remain weak underpinning an outlook of sluggish gdp growth in the low 2s we expect the rba to cuts twice this year pencilling in the first cut in july but see a clear risk that the rba acts quickly given we expect it will downgrade its growth and inflation

the global economy is facing a delicate moment beset with risks as the recovery loses steam amid trade tensions brexit and other factors the international monetary fund warned tuesday the imf s world economic outlook once again downgraded global growth to 3 3 percent for 2019 two tenths lower than the global crisis lender forecast in january and four tenths lower than october and while world growth is expected to pick up in the second half of this year and hit 3 6 percent in 2020 many things will have to go right for that to happen including a resolution of president donald trump s trade battle with china the quarterly report projects a slowdown in growth in 2019 for 70 percent of the world economy imf chief economist gita gopinath said in a statement but stressed that global recession is not in the baseline the euro area is likely to slow sharply particularly in germany where the gdp forecast was cut by a half point and italy which has slowed to a virtual standstill according to the quarterly report and amid the turmoil over its exit from the european union the imf downgraded the outlook for britain this year and next warning of a severe impact if london crashes out with no agreement emerging economic powers china and india continue to show the highest growth rates 6 3 percent and 7 3 percent respectively beijing has rolled out a series of fiscal stimulus measures to counteract the hit from the us trade war as well as the clampdown on the boom in lending but india s growth was downgraded by two tenths of a point and while the recent signs that officials in washington and beijing are engineering a trade deal have calmed some of the nerves in financial markets the solution is by no means certain precarious recovery the report cautions that downside risks to the outlook continue to dominate trade tensions could flare up again and there is risk of a no deal brexit withdrawal or persistent slowing of economic activity this is a delicate moment for the global economy gopinath said this recovery is precarious and predicated on a rebound in emerging market and developing economies including argentina and turkey she urged policymakers to steer clear of potential pitfalls and warned that if any of the major risks materialize then the expected recoveries may be derailed given these risks it is imperative that costly policy mistakes are avoided she said urging cooperation among governments especially in trade conflicts to avoid fueling uncertainty that could contribute to a slowdown the challenge to policymakers is they have little ammunition with which to counteract a slowdown since interest rates are low and most central banks already have stopped raising or started cutting rates while debt levels are high crimping the ability to provide fiscal stimulus gopinath told reporters there is some room to use monetary policy to support economies as long as inflation remains low but critically a durable resolution of trade uncertainty created by the us and china would be very positive for global growth she said in a press briefing also warning against expanding the dispute to more sectors slower trade the broad based slowdown most notably in advanced economies was larger than expected and apparently due to the souring of market sentiment partly due to the trade tensions the imf said trump s aggressive trade policies largely but not exclusively aimed at china left us products open to retaliation in the form of steep tariffs but inflation pressures remained muted despite the new duties which raised the

washington afp advertising read more the global economy is facing a delicate moment beset with risks as the recovery loses steam amid trade tensions brexit and other factors the international monetary fund warned tuesday the imf s world economic outlook once again downgraded global growth to 3 3 percent for 2019 two tenths lower than the global crisis lender forecast in january and four tenths lower than october and while world growth is expected to pick up in the second half of this year and hit 3 6 percent in 2020 many things will have to go right for that to happen including a resolution of president donald trump s trade battle with china the quarterly report projects a slowdown in growth in 2019 for 70 percent of the world economy imf chief economist gita gopinath said in a statement but stressed that global recession is not in the baseline the euro area is likely to slow sharply particularly in germany where the gdp forecast was cut by a half point and italy which has slowed to a virtual standstill according to the quarterly report and amid the turmoil over its exit from the european union the imf downgraded the outlook for britain this year and next warning of a severe impact if london crashes out with no agreement emerging economic powers china and india continue to show the highest growth rates 6 3 percent and 7 3 percent respectively beijing has rolled out a series of fiscal stimulus measures to counteract the hit from the us trade war as well as the clampdown on the boom in lending but india s growth was downgraded by two tenths of a point and while the recent signs that officials in washington and beijing are engineering a trade deal have calmed some of the nerves in financial markets the solution is by no means certain precarious recovery the report cautions that downside risks to the outlook continue to dominate trade tensions could flare up again and there is risk of a no deal brexit withdrawal or persistent slowing of economic activity this is a delicate moment for the global economy gopinath said this recovery is precarious and predicated on a rebound in emerging market and developing economies including argentina and turkey she urged policymakers to steer clear of potential pitfalls and warned that if any of the major risks materialize then the expected recoveries may be derailed given these risks it is imperative that costly policy mistakes are avoided she said urging cooperation among governments especially in trade conflicts to avoid fueling uncertainty that could contribute to a slowdown the challenge to policymakers is they have little ammunition with which to counteract a slowdown since interest rates are low and most central banks already have stopped raising or started cutting rates while debt levels are high crimping the ability to provide fiscal stimulus gopinath told reporters there is some room to use monetary policy to support economies as long as inflation remains low but critically a durable resolution of trade uncertainty created by the us and china would be very positive for global growth she said in a press briefing also warning against expanding the dispute to more sectors slower trade the broad based slowdown most notably in advanced economies was larger than expected and apparently due to the souring of market sentiment partly due to the trade tensions the imf said trump s aggressive trade policies largely but not exclusively aimed at china left us products open to retaliation in the form of steep tariffs but inflation pressures remained muted despite the new duties which raised the costs of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of imports trump also has threatened tariffs on european autos and on tuesday said he was prepared to unleash punitive measures against 11 billion in imports including helicopters aircraft parts and gouda cheese over subsidies to aviation giant airbus global trade growth has slowed sharply from its peak in late 2017 and expectations for future business activity have weakened pointing to slowing momentum ahead the imf said growth in advanced economies next year presents a mixed picture the united states and japan are expected to slow further next year with us gdp adding 1 9 percent and japan s just 0 5 percent half of this year s rate but with temporary factors waning germany s growth is projected to accelerate to 1 4 percent and italy to 0 9 percent spain is the strong performer in the euro area with 2 1 percent growth in 2019 and 1 9 percent in 2020 in the major emerging markets china s expansion will slow to 6 1 percent while india continues to accelerate to 7 5 percent the imf downgraded the outlook for mexico sharply cutting a half point off the estimate to 1 6 percent this year and 1 9 percent in 2020 2019 afp

australia s gross domestic product growth will cool from 2 8 per cent last year to 2 1 per cent in 2019 according to the imf report its forecast is 0 7 percentage point lower than the forecast last october for local investors however the early morning focus will likely be on crown resorts on tuesday crown shares closed 19 7 per cent higher at 14 05 after confirming a report by street talk that

premature disclosure of preliminary discussions wynn resorts has terminated all discussions with crown resorts concerning any transaction the us company said in a terse one line statement overnight later today rba deputy governor guy debelle speaks and nab says it will be listening closely we think the speech could prove important given the rba tweaked the policy paragraph of its interest rate decision early in april which was the first change in years nab s senior fx strategist for markets rodrigo catril wrote in a morning note using citi s economic data surprise index recent data releases in australia have mostly printed on the better side of expectations and in fact when compared with the generally disappointing us economic data releases the improvement in australia s data releases has been quite impressive and supportive of a stronger aud one could argue then that the better australian data releases of late do not provide a smoking gun for deputy governor debelle to signal an imminent change in policy guidance mr catril said however we know the rba is biding its time in order to better assess how the tension between the strength in the labour market and slowdown in gdp growth resolves its self advertisement if we add to that the ongoing weakness in housing market including its impact on housing construction employment and wealth effect then we think debelle has plenty of ammunition to signal a new round of rba easing could be in the offing our economists believe that consumer spending is likely to remain weak underpinning an outlook of sluggish gdp growth in the low 2s we expect the rba to cuts twice this year pencilling in the first cut in july but see a clear risk that the rba acts quickly given we expect it will downgrade its growth and inflation

by neil irwin had a new york times article warning readers of the potential harm if the fed loses its independence the basis for the warning is that donald trump seems prepared to nominate steven moore and herman cain to the fed two individuals with no obvious qualifications for the job other than their loyalty to donald trump while irwin is right to warn about filling the fed with people with no understanding of economics it is wrong to imagine that we have in general been well served by the fed in recent decades or that it is necessarily independent in the way we would want the examples irwin gives are telling irwin comments the united states role as the global reserve currency which results in persistently low interest rates and little fear of capital flight is built in significant part on the credibility the fed has accumulated over decades during the global financial crisis and its aftermath for example the fed could feel comfortable pursuing efforts to stimulate the united states economy without a loss of faith in the dollar and treasury bonds by global investors the dollar actually rose against other currencies even as the economy was in free fall in late 2008 and the fed deployed trillions of dollars in unconventional programs to try to stop the crisis first the dollar is a global reserve currency it is not the only global reserve currency central banks also use euros british pounds japanese yen and even swiss francs as reserve currencies this point is important because we do not seriously risk the dollar not be accepted as a reserve currency it is possible to imagine scenarios where its predominance fades as other currencies become more widely used this would not be in any way catastrophic for the united states on the issue of the dollar rising in the wake of the financial collapse in 2008 this was actually bad news for the u s economy after the plunge in demand from residential construction and consumption following the collapse of the housing bubble net exports was one of the few sources of demand that could potentially boost the u s economy the rise in the dollar severely limited growth in this component the other example given is when nixon pressured then fed chair arthur burns to keep interest rates low to help his re election in 1972 this was supposed to have worsened the subsequent inflation and then severe recessions in the 1970s and early 1980s the economic damage of that era was mostly due to a huge jump in world oil prices at a time when the u s economy was heavily dependent on oil while nixon s interference with the fed may have had some negative effect it is worth noting that the economies of other wealthy countries did not perform notably better than the u s through this decade it would be wrong to imply that the problems of the 1970s were to any important extent due to burns keeping interest rates lower than he might have otherwise at the start of the decade it is also worth noting that the fed has been very close to the financial sector the twelve regional bank presidents who sit on the open market committee that sets monetary policy are largely appointed by the banks in the region when she was fed chair janet yellen attempted to make the appointment process more open this has led to a fed that is far more concerned about keeping down inflation a concern of bankers than the full employment portion of its mandate arguably fed policy has led unemployment to be higher than necessary over much of the last four decades this has prevented millions of workers from having jobs and lowered wages for tens of millions more the people who were hurt most are those who are disadvantaged in the labor market such as african americans hispanics and people with less education insofar as the fed s independence has meant close ties to the financial industry it has not been good news for most people in this country this column originally appeared on dean baker s blog

the global economy is facing a delicate moment beset with risks as the recovery loses steam amid trade tensions brexit and other factors the international monetary fund warned tuesday the imf s world economic outlook once again downgraded global growth to 3 3 percent for 2019 two tenths lower than the global crisis lender forecast in january and four tenths lower than october and while world growth is expected to pick up in the second half of this year and hit 3 6 percent in 2020 many things will have to go right for that to happen including a resolution of president donald trump s trade battle with china the quarterly report projects a slowdown in growth in 2019 for 70 percent of the world economy imf chief economist gita gopinath said in a statement the euro area is likely to slow sharply particularly in germany where the gdp forecast was cut by a half point and italy which has slowed to a virtual standstill according to the quarterly report and amid the turmoil over its exit from the european union the imf downgraded the outlook for britain this year and next emerging economic powers china and india continue to show the highest growth rates 6 3 percent and 7 3 percent respectively beijing has rolled out a series of fiscal stimulus measures to counteract the hit from the us trade war but india s growth was downgraded by two tenths of a point and while the recent signs that officials in washington and beijing are engineering a trade deal have calmed some of the nerves in financial markets the solution is by no means certain the report cautions that downside risks to the outlook continue to dominate trade tensions could flare up again and there is risk of a no deal brexit withdrawal or persistent slowing of economic activity this is a delicate moment for the global economy gopinath said this recovery is precarious and predicated on a rebound in emerging market and developing economies including argentina and turkey while a rebound is possible if policymakers avoid all the potential pitfalls she warned that if however any of the major risks materialize then the expected recoveries in stressed economies export dependent economies and highly indebted economies may be derailed the challenge to policymakers is they have little ammunition with which to counteract a slowdown since interest rates are low and most central banks already have stopped raising or started cutting rates while debt levels are high crimping the ability to provide fiscal stimulus given these risks it is imperative that costly policy mistakes are avoided she said urging cooperation among governments especially in trade conflicts to avoid fueling uncertainty that could contribute to a slowdown the fund said avoiding such policy missteps needs to be the main priority including distorstionary barriers to trade the broad based slowdown most notably in advanced economies was larger than expected and apparently due to the souring of market sentiment partly due to the trade tensions the imf said trump s aggressive trade policies largely but not exclusively aimed at china left us products open to retaliation in the form of steep tariffs but inflation pressures remained muted despite the new duties which raised the costs of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of imports global trade growth has slowed sharply from its peak in late 2017 and expectations for future business activity have weakened pointing to slowing momentum ahead the report said growth in advanced economies next year presents a mixed picture the united states and japan are expected to slow further next year with us gdp adding 1 9 percent and japan s just 0 5 percent half of this year s rate but with temporary factors waning germany s growth is projected to accelerate to 1 4 percent and italy to 0 9 percent spain is the strong performer in the euro area with 2 1 percent growth in 2019 and 1 9 percent in 2020 in the major emerging markets china s expansion will slow to 6 1 percent while india continues to accelerate to 7 5 percent the imf downgraded the outlook for mexico sharply cutting a half point off the estimate to 1 6 percent this year and 1 9 percent in 2020
rttnews the major u s index futures are pointing to a modestly lower opening on tuesday following the mixed performance seen in the previous session traders may look to retreat to safe havens ahead of the release of closely watched reports on inflation in the coming days as well as the start of earnings season financial giants jpmorgan chase jpm and wells fargo wfc are due to report their quarterly results on friday shedding light on what may have been a difficult quarter concerns about the global economic outlook may also weigh on the markets particularly after president donald trump s administration threatened to impose tariffs on european goods in response to european union subsidies to airbus u s trade representative robert lighthizer estimates the harm from the eu subsidies as 11 billion in trade each year with the amount subject to arbitration at the world trade organization this case has been in litigation for 14 years and the time has come for action lighthizer said the administration is preparing to respond immediately when the wto issues its finding on the value of u s countermeasures our ultimate goal is to reach an agreement with the eu to end all wto inconsistent subsidies to large civil aircraft he added when the eu ends these harmful subsidies the additional u s duties imposed in response can be lifted meanwhile a european commission spokesman called the estimated adverse effects of the subsidies greatly exaggerated and pledged to retaliate against any new u s tariffs the trade dispute between trump and the eu comes amid lingering uncertainty about the u s and china reaching a final trade agreement stocks initially moved to the downside but regained ground over the course of the trading session on monday the major averages climbed well off their worst levels of the day with the nasdaq and the s p 500 reaching positive territory late in the session eventually the major averages ended the session mixed while the dow fell

weakness on wall street on the heels of recent strength with the major averages pulling back following the notable upward move seen last week lingering concerns about a slowdown in the pace of global economic growth inspired traders to cash in on the recent gains however selling pressure waned shortly after the open as traders seemed reluctant to make significant moves ahead of the start of earnings season some analysts described the federal reserve s decision to downwardly revise its forecast for interest rates as an effort to keep the stock markets afloat amid an expected contraction in first quarter earnings the major averages subsequently recovered over the course of the session although a steep drop by boeing ba kept the dow in the red boeing tumbled by 4 4 percent after the

to the upside however with the nyse arca gold bugs index climbing by 1 2 percent the strength in the sector came amid an increase by the price of the precious metal an increase by the price of crude oil also contributed to some strength among oil service stocks while tobacco utilities and biotechnology stocks moved lower commodity currency markets crude oil futures are slipping 0 13 to 64 27

this event is presented as part of the 2019 corporate conference haass well good evening it is evening officially welcome to the 2019 corporate conference of the council on foreign relations i m richard haass and i am fortunate enough to be president of this organization and i want to thank you all for coming here tonight and i want to thank you also for being with us so often during the year before i begin i d like to just do one or two things of housekeeping to take a moment to thank the members of our committee on corporate affairs who have joined us for this conference chaired by the committee s chaired by blair effron i want to thank council s chairman david rubenstein who you ll be hearing from in a few minutes i want to acknowledge suzanne helm who s our vice president for all things corporate and her entire team and staff for what they do with and for this organization i want to thank all the companies who are part of our corporate program and it s not just for your financial support though i do appreciate that but also for the perspectives you all bring to our meetings and to other to our other initiatives here it adds to the quality of what it is we do and what it is we think and what it is we say over the next day we ll be discussing everything from the changing nature of the economy global trade geopolitical risk we will also have breakout sessions on virtually every region of the world and all sorts of functional issues and then we d like to think that it s this nexus of policy and business that sets apart the council on foreign relations and the corporate program i d just say that i think doing this while it s always important it is particularly important at this time when you look at the challenges that our societies and our economies are facing when you look at the challenges in the world be it at the regional level or the global level this is actually i think one of the potentially one of the most consequential moments in modern history and not a lot is inevitable and decisions that people take will i believe have all sorts of implications for your businesses but also for your lives as citizens tonight to kick us off we are fortunate and then some to have a conversation between jamie dimon who as you all know is chairman and ceo of jpmorgan chase full disclosure i bank with them laughter unfortunate disclosure it so does not move the needle and david rubenstein who as i said is our chairman and also the cofounder and co executive chairman of the carlyle group our timing could not be better and the reason is not just for what s going on in the world but several hours ago jamie released his annual letter to shareholders i urge you to read it if you haven t already and to me it s the sort of thing we don t see enough of too often the business world is hived off from the world of public policy and politics and it s you know whether you agree with everything he wrote or not let s put that aside for a second what to me is so also just welcoming about it is that someone in a position of responsibility and visibility is weighing in on these matters we simply don t have enough corporate statesmen and my view is we are fortunate tonight to have not just one but two of them leading us off tonight so with that jamie david the stage is yours applause dimon you want this side that says david ok rubenstein ok there you go laughter ok let me just say at the beginning unlike what we often say this is on the record this is not off the record this is on the record so i think there are some press here and let me also say that this event is sponsored and underwritten by bernard l schwartz who is here this is the bernard l schwartz annual lecture on foreign policy and economic growth and bernard as some of you may know i ve said before is a newlywed and his wife denise is here thank you both for coming and thank you for underwriting this event and bernard as many know was a great leader at loral for many many years and retired at the young age of eighty from being ceo and i often ask him whether he wishes he had stayed on until he was he s now ninety three so i have no doubt that he could have done a great job as ceo as ninety three so jamie is somebody that i ve worked with before over the years and greatly admired and i think it s fair to say doesn t need a big introduction let me just say that he s been dimon you tried to hire me once laughter rubenstein twice laughter when jamie left citi i did go to see him and i said you know you should be in the highest calling of mankind private equity laughter and he i couldn t persuade him and then actually another time i went and said you know we re going to take our company public we didn t really have the right person to be the ceo compared to you why don t you leave jpmorgan you know and that you know bank is you know a lot of banks around there but you could run a private equity firm what could be better i failed in both efforts but i greatly admire jamie for a number of reasons that richard mentioned just to give you a little background jamie is from this area from the new york area went to tufts harvard business school and went to work after harvard business school for sandy weill then at american express when sandy left american express he went with him and ultimately they built a company out of commercial credit which was in my hometown of baltimore and they ultimately helped create in effect citicorp jamie left citicorp ultimately became the person who ran bank one in chicago and moved to chicago came back here when bank one was acquired by jpmorgan and then has been running jpmorgan since really 2006 since that time the market capitalization has gone from 143 billion dollars to 343 billion dollars and if you had bought the stock you would know that it s probably up by about 165 percent since jamie has been running it and the bank is without doubt the most successful bank in the world and i think jamie it s fair to say that he s the most admired most respected and most quoted banker in the world so we ll have some no doubt good quotes tonight but let me start with this report that richard referred to and again i highly recommend it because i ve read you know thousands of annual reports and rarely do you see annual reports that go into public policy as much as this one does so why do you spend so much time on public policy in your annual report dimon so welcome thrilled to be here david thanks for those very overly kind words you know i always write long annual reports i always ask myself the most important questions what you want to know as a shareholder employee but obviously i think in the last several years and you all know this one of the most important things has become public policy and you know i have this deep frustration for what s gone wrong in the united states over the last i m going to call it twenty years for a wide variety of reasons so i like to take the time to study the issues to write down what i think and you know give it a different kind of perspective whether it s all exactly right or not and so and it s just from that i think if you said what s the most important thing for jpmorgan now it is a really healthy world and a really healthy united states what s one of the most important things for the world a really healthy and strong united states and you know one of the lines in there says if we don t fix some of these problems our economic moral and military dominance may cease to exist and i and i believe that i m not talking about five years from now i m talking about over the next twenty or thirty years as we tear ourselves apart over things which we really should have fixed rubenstein well jamie it is reported that last year you thought about running for president of the united states and you actually said you would enjoy the job in light of the fact that nobody yet has emerged as somebody that people say this person should be president of the united states who s going to challenge president trump have you ever rethought your position about running for president dimon no i tell people i thought that i should think about it laughter and should i think about it seriously i never did any work or any polling or any of that i did think about it and decided not to not to not to even think any more about it basically and i didn t do any real work if i was going to really think about it i would have spoken to fifty people i would have done my homework you know which i didn t do any of that so it was blown out of proportion partially because i make silly jokes about i d love to be president but you know if you anoint me you know but i m not going to go run laughs and so no i m not i m not going to rethink it i love what i do and i think if i do a really good job here and you know and i m the chairman of the business roundtable i can help influence things to the better too rubenstein let s suppose somebody s elected president of the united states like the current president and the person says to you i d like you to be secretary of state secretary of treasury would you consider going in an appointed job dimon i would never not consider a request like that from a president of the united states rubenstein and the current president dimon and i think you should you know and you know i don t want to leave my job so it s not anything like that but rubenstein but the current president asked you to consider that and you decided at that time not to do it dimon that s correct rubenstein ok laughter dimon and immediately laughter a tweet came out how i was the worst banker ever rubenstein right dimon immediately which i knew was going to happen rubenstein any regrets dimon no rubenstein no ok laughter dimon no but just so you know i look i did speak to people about that quite a few people but i actually thought the president would be better served by having people who had been on the bus with him i really mean that you know people who he knew he had earned some trust with and you know steve mnuchin i think is a very capable guy and he had been on the bus with him for six months i think that s just a different thing than you re one of a new person being thrown into you know into a situation you don t necessarily completely understand so rubenstein let me ask another question related to your tenure at jpmorgan you ve done extremely well the bank has done well no bank is more successful but are you ever worried that the financial gods might wake up and say jamie you ve had so much good luck in the last decade or so or good fortune i should say maybe you should get out at the top and just leave early and just do something else you ever thought about that dimon i only think about that when people mention it to me rubenstein ok dimon you know it is but it is true something can go wrong and all of a sudden you know you regret but i love what i do i love my company i love my country i love the things that i get done here i m not ready to the company s not ready for it won t be up to me but it s up to my board of directors just so you know and so yeah look one thing that you know about like the falling off the pedestal you re going to fall of the pedestal right so i always don t put me on the pedestal just stop that companies make mistakes and ceos make mistakes and bad things happen and so it becomes a sport with a press but in my view is you can have mistakes and i m sure i ll have other mistakes as i go forward but i hope we ll do just as well in the next ten years as we did in the prior ten rubenstein i m going to go through this in a moment i just want to go through one or two highlights of your career so by the way i asked you earlier and i didn t know the answer to this your name jamie you know when you get to be in your sixties jamie is a young boy s name so have you ever thought of going to james and why did you ever not change it during the course of your laughter dimon so you know that song the boy named sue laughter you know when you have the name jamie that does happen quite a bit and you know you got to learn to defend yourself a little bit it s a girl s name so when i was about four or not four or five like fourth grade i tried to change my name to jimmy but my mother would not call me anything but jamie my father wouldn t call me anything but jamie my brothers wouldn t call me anything but jamie my friends wouldn t call me so i tried for about six months and dropped it i never i never thought about it again rubenstein all right so you went to harvard business school and afterwards you had offers from goldman sachs and many other well known firms but you decided to go work for one person sandy weill why did you do that as opposed to going to a very prestigious investment bank dimon so i you know i had i had i had i wanted if you asked me i mean i was going to head toward i was going to go to goldman and when i called up goldman and lehman and said to them you know i ve decided to take this job as the assistant to sandy weill who just sold shearson hamill to american express they were they said that s a really neat job good for you when i called morgan stanley bob greenhill said to me you mean to tell me that you re going to take a job there as opposed to morgan stanley and i was like yeah exactly that s what i m telling you laughter because sandy had i d gotten to know him a little bit my dad was a broker at shearson hamill i d had a summer job there you know he liked the fact that i went to harvard business school and his pitch was this i m not going to pay you the same well he d tried to hire me as an investment banker at shearson so it was shearson hayden stone at the time and i basically played to him no because you just learn so much more and you get paid more at some place like goldman sachs but he said come join me here i don t know what it s going to be but at least you ll see what a big company looks like what i loved about firstly he was very down to earth i mean there are flaws in the man but he s very down to earth and i really wanted to help build something i mean that was my initial thing like i want to build something he had built shearson hamill from the you know shearson hayden stone they a lot of acquisitions kind of from the ground up i loved that kind of story so if figured i can always go back to investment banking let me try this this i won t get offered again rubenstein after you were there for a while he got fired dimon yeah rubenstein and you decided to go with him rather than stay there at the organization did you ever think you were going to build up an organization as big as you ultimately built up dimon no no well first of all sandy originally thought he was going to be offered bank of america or merrill lynch or rubenstein did you try to buy bank of america dimon we tried to do something with bank of america and talk about tilting windmills and so commercial credit was this little crummy consumer finance company which also owned a hotel in scotland and some leasing equipment in ireland israel but it was a platform and he just wanted to get back to work you know it was that was it this is we re going to build this company and you know i jim robinson made me an offer to stay there at american express but again i wanted to try to build something and i didn t know what was going to happen we were out of work for a year and a half so it was for me a little bit more of a hardship but that little company and we were opportunistic deal guys who ran businesses you know so these so that little company bought primerica smith barney shearson salomon travelers property casualty and it went from being worth 800 million to 75 billion dollars we had given out some stocks so it wasn t and then merged with citi and so it was an unbelievable kind of experience just going through that the deals i was i had been the president and chief operator of that for the last since 1990 or 91 or something like that so rubenstein well ultimately when you dimon and then he fired me by the way which he didn t laughter rubenstein let s go when you were at travelers and then you i guess sandy went to john reed who was then the ceo of citicorp and said let s have a merger co ceos and john reed said ok and you were going to be the president under the two of them how did that work out with the two ceos dimon so yeah i haven t talked about citi for a long time i bought a little piece of citi when at the same time when prince al waleed did i bought it for the investment portfolio at travelers which reported to me and sandy always got mad at me he said what s that stock doing what s that stock doing what s that stock doing and bob lipp some of you may know bob lipp said jesus jim why don t you 150 million worth of stock he said why don t you just sell the stock he s torturing you over this how much have you lost on that anyway i said we ve doubled our money but sandy just couldn t stand having the stock fluctuate in price all the time laughter and so we did the deal originally and this is a management lesson originally it was structured i was not going to be the president i was going to run the global corporate investment bank as the ceo someone was going to run global consumers someone was go global asset management someone was going to run something else and risk finance and technology was going to report to me which was completely appropriate since i knew more about those three things that either sandy or john there were complaints by other people in the company which john reed said who cares this is the right organization and then we ended up doing the following ok tri heads running the global corporate investment bank reporting to sandy and john co heads of everything else reporting to sandy and john and the staff functions reported to sandy and john and i had some titular responsibility for financial risk and so i start fighting with them right away saying this is crazy you are going to destroy the company we are going to lose all the good people and john didn t think it would matter that much and sandy you know thought it was going to be ok i said you re going to destroy the company it s just a matter of time and i said you re going to lose a lot of senior people i didn t realize i d be the first one laughter but i told them i was just dead right i mean a bad organization like that with the politics that takes place in mergers and stuff like that and they re kind of response was hey it works for us and my response was it doesn t matter what works for you it matters what works for the clients and the 250 000 people who work here and you know basically it was a huge error and the churning of people after that and it was just a mistake rubenstein so you got a call to go up to a retreat they were having and they got you in there and they said you re fired were you shocked and dimon you know look i had i had 100 people at my apartment you know recruiting ok and they said we were meeting that sunday at 4 00 they said can you come at 1 00 i said no i have this brunch with all these kids and they said you got to come it s very important and so i walked in the room there s two of them and me and i sat down and a lot of people in the company said it doesn t work you got to change it so we knew there might be change coming because it just simply didn t work and they said to me well we ve made some decisions and we want to share them with you and i said yes and they said well we re going to have this person run the global corporate investment bank i said well that s kind of my job but i was shocked who it was they said we re going to have this person do this and we want you to resign which i said ok and they said you know and then chuck prince came in we did the little press release i did the press from home rubenstein what did how did you tell your how did you tell your kids that you d been fired dimon listen it was and by the second that happened i knew exactly the board had been spoken to the press release had been written and you know sandy and i hadn t been getting along for five years i mean it wasn t immediate of course i should have known i mean you know i missed a very stupid thing that i thought eventually it would work out we d be ok i was obviously the logical person to run citi though it hadn t been decided so i got home i told my kids i walked in and my daughters i said girls i have three daughters and i think they were like twelve ten and eight i said girls i have to tell you something i d already told my wife my wife by the way always think i m kidding so i said judy i m going to tell you something and i m really really really not kidding laughter ok i just got fired so i told the girls i resigned but i really got fired laughter and the littlest one says oh daddy do we have to sleep on the streets laughter i said no sweetheart we re completely fine the middle one was always obsessed with college like can i still go to college i said absolutely and i knew i had made a major breakthrough when the oldest one said daddy can i have your cellphone you won t be needing it anymore laughter so that little and then that night literally that night forty or fifty people show up at my apartment bringing pizza and wine like all the executives in the with one caveat don t tell sandy and john because they ll be really pissed off it was like kind of like going your own wake and we re all having fun and we re all telling stories but one guy who s very tall walks in and my daughter answers the door and she looks up and says who are you and he says i m jim bosso sp i work for your dad not anymore you don t laughter rubenstein so i remember you took an office you had an office in the seagram building i came to see you there and i said look private equity is great and you said i m not quite ready to join private equity but you had an offer to go to amazon to be the number two person dimon i didn t have an offer i took all the calls that were made i looked at i thought all these things were going to fail i was offered a bunch of those and i got a call about jeff i thought the world of him we had a great lunch i went to a town hall he says which he never allows people in and we hit it off we ve been friends ever since and i just it appealed to me a little bit to like move remember sleepless in seattle can come out like a couple years earlier and get a houseboat and never put a suit on again and i thought he had a real opportunity to build something unlike some of these other companies it just was a bridge to far for my family me i d spent my whole life in financial services and so i decided i should probably find something in financial services rubenstein the bank one deal came along and you moved to chicago and people there didn t think you were going to stay there very long they kept saying you were moving back to new york dimon well at first they didn t think i really moved i said well my kids go to school here are you really going to move my kids go to school here there s a little cartoon i used always make a joke in chicago that you all when i die and they send my ashes back to new york you re going to say we told you laughter rubenstein all right so ultimately after four years there the bank did well and you did the merger with jpmorgan so when you took over jpmorgan things did ok for a while but then the great financial crisis came and when the financial crisis came were you worried that jpmorgan was not able to withstand it or you never worried that jpmorgan couldn t survive dimon no jpmorgan when it happened first of all we just we had a lot more capital than everybody i m a very conservative person ok we had a lot of liquidity to give you and i forgot how much i mean 100 billion dollars sitting in a literally sitting around like and i started to raise more but to give you a feeling for how conservative i am a lot of these banks at the time particularly the europeans were funding their balance sheet 20 30 percent or more in what i would call unsecured wholesale funding which is the most fickle funding in the world it s commercial paper interbank deposits certain types of cds eurodollars and it s the most fickle because it dries up the second there s a problem i mean and that goes so they had 30 percent we had zero and i mean zero i didn t do it we had a little bit of commercial paper only because clients said i want to sweep into commercial paper accounts and stuff like that we had repo which is secured and all that and so when we were making good money and we were on the ball and there were some scary moments the scariest moment is when the weekend when lehman was going bankrupt i all our executives i called them up everybody went back to work pretty much worked around the clock for six months i mean but driving home i called the board and the conversation was the following that i told them i thought lehman this is sunday night i thought lehman is going to declare bankruptcy either tonight or tomorrow i m not sure i said and it s very possible throughout the rest of this week you re talking about goldman morgan bank of america and i m pretty sure aig s not going to make it because we had already been working on that and they said well what does it mean i said look we you know our we have net zero positions in all those parties but you got to remember we have huge relationships where we track what we call global market counterparties we re hedged on every single little thing now of course they can swing at night and stuff like that so those exposures could go to 1 billion or you could get locked out of contracts but the fact is it was it could be a billion dollars plus or minus for any one of them but that was about it and because of the crisis the money was flowing into jpmorgan so our balances were going up like this people were pulling money out of bank after bank and some of the governments and this is i m going to write a book one day some of the governments make it worse because they started guaranteed deposits what happened ireland did it germany did and the second that happened you guaranteed the default of banks because now all of a sudden they had a guarantee choice as opposed to deposit to the bank and so and it also made the weaker banks weaker the healthier those good banks got it everyone else was like move all your money and so the money started sloshing around the world draining out of certain people and draining into other people rubenstein one of the problems was that bear stearns went under was about to go under and the government of the united states said we want you to do a favor for the american people and save bear stearns so you bought bear stearns and then later the government of the united states sued you for buying bear stearns in effect so what did you think about that dimon not in effect they stole from us afterwards it was i thought it was terrible you know and i we bought bear we bought it for a billion dollars it had been worth twenty billion dollars but you know it was we d put 12 billion of reserves the day we bought it to manage the extralegal risk the closedown cost the severance cost what i all de risking we had just bought 300 billion of assets we knew them we had been through every loan and every bond and every but remember it just doubled up what we already had so of that 300 billion dollars i knew i had to get rid of 150 billion dollars quickly in bad markets right after i told you things are really bad that s when i had to sell and so you know someone was saying me at the point well things are going to get better for you and i said no they re going to get worse because everyone s going to say what the hell happened you know how bad is it and where is it and i did ask i was worried about the sec enforcement actions and i did get a letter which is public from the acting head of the sec saying that they couldn t say we re not going to bring enforcement actions against you but they said and even our lawyers were shocked but i insisted i want this letter but the letter said if we bring an enforcement if we bring enforcement actions we will take into consideration the circumstances in which you bought bear stearns it didn t occur to me to ask the government or the doj to do that so when they started coming after us for all these mortgage losses you know we paid well in excess of 10 billion 80 percent of that related to bear stearns and wamu so when i went to see eric holder thought i was going to come in pound the table i said eric i m here to surrender you re my judge my jury and my hangman i have no court to go to there is no court for an american bank ok i would lose anywhere ok and you guys are threatening something that s life or death for a financial company i am going to surrender i brought one of my directors i wanted them to hear the whole conversation back and forth and he eventually said i said i said and the mortgage stuff 80 percent was bear and wamu let me tell you the circumstances of that before you pass judgement and so he says he gave us a discount i don t know it should have been zero it wasn t right and i would never even take a phone call like that again rubenstein well so if you go to where we are today among the things that people worry about and probably you as well is brexit are you worried about the british economy and the european economy and what is your plan if brexit occurs dimon so we re again we ve always thought jpmorgan had to be ready for a hard brexit and we re ready it s a lot of work it s been a lot of money it s probably a waste of money we had no choice i don t know what s going to happen but we re ready all we i won t go through the legal stuff and the capital and all that stuff we re ready i don t think a lot of companies are ready so i think a hard brexit would be a really bad thing very quickly but think of it the way you should think of it and a soft brexit it should just be it s like a soft brexit is a bad remain and doesn t really mean that much i think over time london will in either case if there s a brexit of either case they will become a minor financial center over time so everyone focuses always on that one day how many people are you moving how much oh it s three hundred people but over time we got sixteen thousand people in london you know of which twelve thousand basically serve european companies look of all research all equity all sales all investment bankers all tech all risk all legal all credit union in one building one beautiful functioning data center and building in london or outside of london and the regulators and politicians will simply demand over time that we move some of that that s all i don t understand why people don t understand that and so but a hard brexit will be a really bad recession in britain it ll be not so great for europe it won t affect america that much so it s not an earth shattering thing it s just a bad idea it s europe by the way has far serious problems far more serious problems that they have to fix if they want to keep the living standards of their people keeping up with the rest of the world around technology innovation and skills and capital and so you know wise people look at it and say brexit does point out that there are severe issues with europe you know not that the people complained about leave are all right but those fears about immigration and brussels you know telling people what they can do and how they can eat you know all those fears there s some legitimate and i hope that they use it to fix europe too so that everybody else wants to stay there rubenstein and on the other side of the globe china we have a trade dispute with china do you think that trade dispute is one that we should have entered into and do you expect it to be resolved in the near future and will it lead to a dimon absolutely we should have entered into it and you know president obama came to the brt a couple of times and at one point he complained that you guys tell me how bad it is with china and when i go there they tell me how great it is none of you are willing to stand up or say anything and i think it s true i think the business community has spent a lot of time like let me just worry about jpmorgan china not you know otherwise the chinese could be punitive you know or something like that there are and now the brt supports not the tariffs but the issues ok about ip being stolen non bilateral investment rights subsidies or benefits given to state owned enterprise beyond what you would consider normal or fair in trade nontariff barriers you get the right to do it but you can t get the goods into the country those are serious issues that japan europe and america we all know are true i think the chinese know it s true so we re glad i think lighthizer and mnuchin have been doing a good job i m told that they ve made a huge amount of progress in detail we don t want a soybean deal you know if they agree to buy 200 billion of goods a year from us for that doesn t fix the problem and europe and we re not coordinated but europe and japan really want us to do this we should have been part of the tpp so i wasn t in favor of the tariffs and the threatening and the stuff like that but absolutely in facing the issue and in fact the business reason aside our view is you have to deal with the serious issues and if you don t we re better off dealing with it now whatever that means for the economy rubenstein no you have your dimon but i think they re going to do one i think both parties want it but i also think it s a bad idea to say they have to they don t have to nor do we have to rubenstein you know you have your pulse on the finger your pulse on the u s economy you see all the data from credit card companies that you own and so forth what do you think the state of the u s economy is do you worry about a recession anytime in the near future dimon not really because if you look at the again so china s going to grow at 6 percent because they can they can macro manage in ways that they can they do because it s a state controlled in their companies they simply can do monetary policy fiscal policy bank policy industrial policy you hire you train you build the road and they will meet their objective of 6 percent growth it s not great growth they re building imbalances into the system which i think will eventually come to haunt them but for the next couple years they re going to hit their targets and then japan s doing you know 1 percent europe s doing 1 percent brazil s turned the corner the united states is chugging along you know and forget the noise and remember all the geopolitical stuff affects markets and sentiment and all that but and obviously you see what it does in the fourth quarter but unemployment s going down wages are going up confidence is high it s not at the highest point it was at almost the highest point of all time business confidence consumer confidence and now it s still in the upper quartile i think it s coming down because of the shutdown and trade and brexit and a bunch of stuff housing s in short supply you don t have the leveraged assets in the system like we had there s nothing like we had before it doesn t mean you can t have a recession so my view is this economy is plugging through and brexit venezuela russia possible fiscal policy tightening possible policy bad policy errors which i talk about in there those are mounting issues that can easily derail and economy but this could be more like just more straws on the camel s back some combination of stuff affects confidence affects ceo spending and so we don t see it now but you you know you got to you got to be prepared we all should be prepared for something bad to happen because bad things tend to happen so it could easily be 2022 this notion it s got to be 2019 or early 20 that s not true rubenstein but do you worry about the debt of the united states government we have 22 trillion of federal debt we re adding 1 3 trillion dollars a year do you worry about this as a fact that could cause a recession dimon what causes a recession is if the government goes into fiscal tightening or monetary tightening where you have huge industrial imbalances or there s market those things cause recessions but i m not worried about it here s why you shouldn t worry about it yet ok it s net debt is 80 percent of gdp you know in japan it s 200 percent and when you owe debt to yourself so we all own the country and we all owe debt to ourselves you re just moving the income around between us ok and so the gdp growing we can still take care of our people and it s not good politics you want higher retirement money and you want higher this and i want higher that and the government gets involved in all those things now our debt is not owed 100 percent to us seven trillion dollars is owed to foreigners but we own over 20 trillion of foreign assets we earn a lot more in america on foreign assets than foreigners earn on american assets so it s not out of bounds out of whack and our economy is worth 100 trillion so it s not that s not a danger point the eighty is going to go like this and i forgot the when but twenty five years out it s going to be at like 130 trillion dollars this whole hockey stick is medical costs all of it all of it and if you were and if we re smart which we are no longer laughter obviously you say let s deal with that before it becomes a problem let s change that trajectory you know because there will be a point where it will cause concern you know they ll start talking about the credit crunch again or you know crowding out of private capital all these various things so let s deal with it but it s not going to cause a recession tomorrow unless someone come in in the congress and they cut spending dramatically and that can rubenstein what is your experience when you go to washington to meet with members of congress and administration do you find that they understand finance as well as you think they should or dimon i look you know that s it s a spectrum you know there are some very good people there and very smart people and you have the other side of the spectrum and you know i look at that as a job i have to go see people and talk to people and try to educate people and be honest with them when they point at things that we did wrong we should have done better stuff like that and so i do find that the conversation the lack of america doing proper thinking about public policy is why we re only growing at 2 percent and that s why i m frustrated and wrote this rubenstein all right and talking about public policy some of the things you re most worried about are for example health care you have a joint venture i guess with jeff bezos and now with warren buffett what is that going to produce dimon yeah so here s what i m really worried about ok and it s hard to tell you exactly i made a and we ve all seen the work i studied lots of different stuff and probably some of you in this room wrote some of it we ve grown at 20 percent of the last ten years sounds ok it should have been 40 percent an average recovery in america after a bad recession would have been 40 percent even with the recession in between by the way that extra 20 percent is almost 4 trillion of gdp ok and then people come up with these theories well it s secular stagnation it s the new normal it s the savings glut i have no idea what they re talking about and so we made i made a list of all the things that are hurting health care immigration litigation regulation not all the things that are hurting public policies which are critical to the health of a country we get to travel around the world we see countries everywhere infrastructure health care education tax policy all those things are critical to a country doing well in all of those categories we ve deteriorated like we re not even in the top twenty in infrastructure we can t build it takes ten years to get a permit to build a bridge in education you know we used to have the best getting kids jobs vocational jobs half the kids in inner cities don t graduate and in litigation our litigation system costs 1 6 percent of gdp the average oecd is 0 6 percent immigration the economists will say it s because we don t have immigration more merit based get daca have a path to citizenship let him build a damn wall let s get immigration reform 0 3 percent to growth mortgage reform 0 2 percent to growth you know we ve crippled mortgages for lower paid people by all these certain regulations and stuff like that inaudible and then there s health care twenty percent almost 20 percent of gdp that s twice everybody the rest of the developed world now if you re in the health care business you would tell me legitimately we have the best and we do we have some of the best meta pharma hospitals surgeons but it s not the best equally deployed ok obesity is 25 percent of the cost is obesity which drives cancer heart disease stroke depression diabetes ok end of life 15 percent of costs and it s mostly half of it s unwanted because of laws you know the rush to hospitals and people getting things they don t really want chronic care is not probably dealt with wellness programs should be i think they should be more coercive because of the obesity hell we should be teaching nutrition education nutrition wellness and exercise in k 12 like what are we doing and i go on and on about it and so i mean warren buffett calls it the tapeworm of american business you know at what point is it going to cripple american business having such an uncompetitive position on a major cost factor for your employees and so yeah so my view and the other thing which is really important you can t pick up what i just said in a lot of models and that s what economists try to do but you can t they don t factor in health care going up like that they don t like health care the longevity that s given us over the last which obviously is the best thing in the world that longevity was you know some people estimate up to 50 percent of gdp growth because you re living longer your skills are longer you re more skilled as you get older and you work hard you know you have the health to work now you know what that s reversed in this country too mortality s getting worse in this country you know labor force participation because of health and opioids and so if you so this stuff cumulative over time in totality is why we have these problems because if you look at the this is exactly what people are worried about their cost of health care their wages aren t going up we don t train our kids properly and if we fix these things you actually fix all the other things and so that s why i took the time to write it because i really do think we re just off base and we re guessing and we know what the answer is rubenstein in terms of writing this this is pretty comprehensive so how long did it actually take to write this laughter dimon i torture i mean i have a i don t know i probably spent five complete weekends and then ten other half days or something like that rubenstein so dimon but the other thing about this which i you know and the warren buffett thing i read his and i also ask myself what do you want to know to my shareholders i ask our employees what do you want what s important what decisions am i trying to make that i have never explained properly you know now i have a section about ai and cyber and privacy stuff like that and it makes me actually work over and over and over so i can explain it in a way that everyone understands it so it helps policy for the company for me to go through the exercise and then even the policy stuff we do affordable housing we ve gotten into the health care venture we do a lot around work skills now we do a lot around the brt is willing to fight on immigration when the time comes so it does help inform me on what we could be doing to help as a nation help our country rubenstein so when you re writing this and somebody wants to edit what jamie dimon has written is that hard to tell jamie dimon he doesn t write the right thing laughter dimon well believe it or not i get help from a lot of people and the love reading it and sometimes i m just throwing out numbers i don t fully understand like i thought it was 8 percent i didn t hear this i heard that somewhere i want to get that in the infrastructure thing or the so but you can imagine lawyers accountants compliance pr government affairs they all read it and they re all scared shitless laughter rubenstein no but you dimon i am not scared i modify certain words and sometimes i put stuff in there just to piss them off right laughter so the read the early drafts i m just railing on something or other you can t say that i said yes i can i know damn well i m going to take it out in the final draft rubenstein so dimon but they have fun and they get better and we do research to answer it sometimes rubenstein and you have a jpmorgan credit card i assume dimon yeah rubenstein have you ever had it denied when you go out laughter has that ever happened dimon yeah i have actually rubenstein really what did you do dimon it happened an embarrassing thing because i was up at harvard business school taking my daughter s she went to harvard business school too her friends out or something like that and they turned me down rubenstein so do you call up somebody and say like do you know who i am or something like that dimon i don t bother doing that i just asked another person to pay say i ll send you some more money laughs i didn t want to go to the phone and have the whole conversation rubenstein but the next day did you call the head of your credit card company laughter dimon no no because remember these credit card authorizations like when you swipe those cards debit card or credit that goes through extensive analytics you know anywhere from fifty to a thousand in a split second to authorize that so if there s anything that s out of whack where you were that day you were in a different city that it s not used to and particularly heightened things if it s something you can sell like a tv or a ring i don t know why it rejected me at a restaurant in boston but it could also be that we have huge fraud things we get from other sources that the card has been compromised and so we turn the card off and so and now you can go onto your phone and turn your card on or off at will so if you give you kid your card for one reason and they forget to give it back to you you can turn it off and so if you re a chase customer and you can also get training you can buy yourself stocks for free now laughter applause rubenstein and you say in here one of your biggest concerns is cybersecurity so you spend an enormous amount of money on making sure that your information is going to be kept private dimon well not just information it s we spend 600 million a year three thousand people you know 24 7 around the world and that doesn t include all the physical and all the other things we do monitoring our own so there s a lot of things not in that that we do we monitor our own people we know what you re doing everywhere all the time much more than people think and we have no choice to protect the company and access systems and then of course there s hygiene you know there are a million that thing i just said about card that s true about anytime you move money like corporate money stock bond you name it and there s tons of tests and tripwires and kill switches and passwords and you know constantly doing things to help that it s a big deal our country is vulnerable folks the electrical grid is vulnerable the banks are very i mean if you asked the people that are the best in the world it s like the defense department nsa and stuff they ll say the banks and defense companies are way up here defense companies are ahead of the banks but you ve got we need to fix this infrastructure now the government knows in fact i m having a meeting next week with a lot of senior people to make sure we re doing it right and that we re now the industry works together we have a group that does it we share everything and even that but we need more legal protection and we need more government cleared people inside our command centers with the authority to give us data right away we are the frontline for some of those things so it s kind of like they have it and by law they can t tell us and so rubenstein ok questions please stand up identify yourself your name your organization ask a question not a statement and ok right here jay q hi great panel jay koh from the lightsmith group i read your letter with great interest and it s great that in the aftermath of natural disasters there s a lot of humanitarian responses from the bank and the call for infrastructure i think is something that s way overdue my question is this these things all seem to implicate the kind of now unfolding impact practically and from an investment standpoint and from an economic standpoint of climate change and so that s one thing that i don t think you know flipping through your letter emerges discretely there i know that you guys are involved in things like the taskforce on climate related financial disclosure but i wanted to see if you might comment on the impact of climate change or how you re thinking about it in the operations of one of the most important financial institutions in the world dimon in one of the sections there i go through what we do for employees ok the minimum wage is like 35 000 dollars medical dental pilates gym wellness programs enormous training veterans programs advancing back leaders we re at 50 percent in black mds in the last two years that s how good we ve gotten at it and using a lot of different stuff and so the reason i say that is because the point about these rapacious companies you know these companies treat people exactly the way that some people say wages we do it medical we do it training we do it promotion we do it across a broad and most big companies do by the way it s just this whole notion is just dead wrong and climate change i had a paragraph at the start so here s my view is that we don t at jpmorgan we have risk committees and green stuff and we re going to be 100 percent green ourselves we re very careful who we do how we do it i didn t pick it up because it s hard to have a policy around that so here s my own view ok is that i believe that this carbon dividend carbon tax which some of you may have seen george shultz and jim baker and like eight secretaries of state former secretary of trade signed onto it bob rubin i don t know is in the room i think it s brilliant and that is the solution and so i personally would support something like that and the company may say we support proper policy to start reducing co2 i do think it s an issue so i wasn t avoiding it i just there s only so much i can write you know so there s one issue i took off and the brt may take up that issue too like i think it s ok for us even if even if we ve got very detailed policy saying we support something like that some of these you know and we need policy that works that policy could actually work and get around the politics of you know you may more than you rubenstein ok other questions right back here speak up identify yourself and simple question q well good evening my name is stephanie ma ph and i am a financial reporter of xinhua news agency as we know that there is there has recently been increasing penetration by global investors into china s bond market and as we know china is also on the whitelist for jpmorgan s emerging market global bond index global diversify so what do you make of the potential of china s bond market and what s your expectation on china s weight in your index in the future thank you dimon so china you know you got to give china fair and balanced assessment because people just china has done a great job going from you know 200 people per person to 10 000 gdp per person and you know they started way behind and stuff like that but if you gave a fair assessment you know just think they don t and this is for the americans they don t have a food war in energy we do they have a really difficult geopolitical situation with all of their neighbors russia india pakistan afghanistan vietnam indonesia koreas it s a tough part of the world they don t have our institutions they don t have our rule of law they ve got excessive corruption they ve got a lot of inefficient state owned enterprises and they know they talk about these things and they and they ve done and they ve been reforming the whole time now they got this trade issue which i think will be resolved if it s not by the way there will be serious repercussions for a whole bunch of different reasons and they ve been opening up their markets very slow you know americans want much faster and they should i actually they re only going to do it in their own self interest but this having that healthy transformational rule of law better markets you know their stock and bond markets are maybe 20 30 percent the size of ours one day they re going to have 40 percent of the fortune 1000 their market should be equal size of ours which is why we don t license do business in shanghai we don t have the full license we can do it in hong kong for a chinese company we can t do it shanghai for a chinese company so they re going on this path i think they re on the right path don t over care about how much is in the index ok they don t have a fully convertible currency a convertible and they can t yet so i m not saying they should a convertible currency is when you can buy and sell the currency and you can buy and sell assets in the currency you can buy their bonds you can buy their stocks you can sell their stocks you can sell their bonds you can t everything that gets done there is by permission of the government they limit how much bonds you can buy they limit how much stocks you they re doing this to protect themselves this is not they re not ready to fully open up so they re not going to enter these indexes in major ways until they re fully convertible i don t think they can be fully convertible for another ten years and but i do think having really transparent financial markets and companies like jpmorgan will make them a healthier country over time which would be good for them rubenstein ok right here please wait get a mic and identify yourself q ok given that mr rubenstein asked a lot of questions about your personal career i have a more personal question and that is how do you balance your time how do you manage your day how do you manage your week and how do you manage your people dimon yeah well you know i m very efficient ok laughter i have flaws i read fast i don t read i don t read everything the same speed i got you know this i read fast and this i some things you got to read slow to i think right so on sundays i read slow i take notes and i really think about what i want to do and what i have to follow up you know but i think people could manage their time i think most people are terrible at it like they re tearing their hair out they re senior people they re busy they don t return their phone calls i return every phone call every email every day i am never rushed i m almost never late i hate it your stomach churns and in my office 40 percent probably 40 percent of my time is white time you know my door is open i walk around i talk to people but i always have but a third of the time is very rigorous you know business reviews around the world business reviews in this biz risk reviews and everyone knows everyone s got an agenda a forward looking agenda it s all scheduled we do a lot of ad hoc stuff so everyone knows that takes place and you know people have if you work for me you have a follow up list i know what s on it you know what s on it and you better bring up everything important to me so i don t i don t have these some executives have this you know their once a week sit down with every person who reports to them for an hour i don t do any of that stuff it s a waste of time ok i know them you know if you work for me i get to know you i would get to know you and once i trust you i m not going to do all that i ll tell you if you need me you call me if i got to tell you something i m going to call you you know and therefore you don t have to worry about me all the time and stuff like that and so i think people could be really better but of course when you have kids and that s where it becomes a real thing my life became binary family and business so i still we still have family dinners when i m home sunday night my parents used to go when they were alive my brother goes my sister in law goes my mother in law goes not every sunday but i d say three out of four and a lot of weekends in the country house all family i don t do east hampton i don t do black tie you know if you ever see me in a black tie you know i just i don t have the time and then i work i like working i read a lot on the weekends and i you know i travel 50 percent of the time but i try to be really rigorous about that stuff rubenstein you met your wife at harvard business school judy and you ve been married how many years dimon thirty six almost thirty six yeah rubenstein all right and you have three daughters dimon three daughters four granddaughters i still diaper right laughter it s just like riding a bike rubenstein and what are your your grandchildren call you what dimon pop pop rubenstein not jamie or nothing dimon no no but one of my daughters used to call me ceo man laughter rubenstein ok question back dimon in the order of you re not my boss ceo man laughter rubenstein right here right here right here q ted pulling jamie you were talking about public policy earlier maybe some thoughts on the state of new york city and maybe you could run for mayor as prep for the white house laughter dimon i wouldn t run for mayor if my life depended on it i don t want to be a senator i don t q ours does dimon what q our lives depend on it dimon you know i think new york has a problem ok and the problem is and it s insidious you know which is somehow that a city thinks it doesn t have to compete now this is the greatest city in the world i mean it is unbelievable but it s got the highest taxes individual the highest taxes corporate probably the highest real estate tax like all that amazon the 3 billion that was basically just reducing taxes for the first ten years i mean that s all it was it was like just a discount on the taxes they re going to pay and stuff like that and you can t survive like that so some of you may have lived in the city in 1974 you know with unemployment at 12 percent i think this is right ten of the fortune 50 companies were headquartered here left jcpenney exxon american airlines and i think it s a bad idea to abuse the things that create so much wealth and stuff like that and to assume the arrogance to assume that s forever now it is a great place and we have four thousand people on the west side you know all technology people asian indian black it s unbelievable from the schools and and so it s still a great place but i think the right way to run anything is to run it knowing that you re going to have competition you should prepare for that so the other thing about budgets you know we lie about pension plans you know we don t i mean if we even told the truth about it you know it would make you sick to your stomach about the commitments that are not funded or even reported and so those commitments made by cities and states are a problem and they re not tomorrow s problem but rubenstein we have one more question right here the lady in the back one last question and then we re out of time dimon hi david thanks and thank you jamie christina from cnn i got to ask what do you think of stephen moore and herman cain for the fed dimon you know i m going to demure i don t i know them from seeing them on tv you know so i ve never sat down and had a long conversation and you know they don t seem like they re the right people to put on the fed i do think jay powell is very bright and i think the fed people i don t agree with everything they ve ever done but i think they re very bright people trying to do the right stuff i don t think they d be pushed around very much by tweets or words and all that and i also think that s a necessarily good idea you know of course every president wants rates lower i mean i get surprised when the press says the president said this oh really the president wants lower rates and that shocks you laughter you know what president would say i want higher rates so look they should put professional people those those i think those jobs all have to go through confirmation let the senators do their homework rubenstein so as you look back on your incredible career any regrets or what are you most pleased with dimon i ve had a i ve had a great life you know all of us make i mean if you if you wanted i could spend hours here talking about my mistakes and you learn from those i mean the biggest the biggest regrets are people mistakes you made that hurt the company that took a long time to correct you should have seen it they hurt people which now i m responsible for i hired bad people and they hurt you and i feel terrible about it or something like that it wasn t this trade or not even that stupid london whale thing or a merger we had some extra difficulties on it was usually around hard people things it s tough to be a ceo the people stuff becomes the toughest stuff and the mistakes were always i didn t speak to the right people enough i didn t do my homework i didn t take the time you were angry like anything done out of anger is a bad idea you know and so those i don t make those every day you do learn as you get older there s certain things you re better off not doing so you know people write sometimes the press writes here jamie s very decisive if you work for me on certain issues we torture the subject over and over and over until we think we have it exactly right that could be a medical policy that could be an underwriting policy that could be whether we re going to enter a new country or we re going to do a 20 billion bridge loan i want to get some things exactly right and we work the angle and you know your error rate drops like this when you get the right people in the room share the information get rid of the politics give yourself the time don t rush to judgement and it s amazing rubenstein jamie thank you for a great conversation thank you for the job you re doing applause dimon thank you rubenstein thank you very much end

by erik norland often we think of grains and oilseeds prices as being at the mercy of the weather and the agricultural sector s specific set of economic forces that include planting growing and harvest cycles and crop inventories indeed these risk factors are important determinants of crop prices but in addition to them macroeconomic factors play a subtle role in agriculture for example during the great inflation of the 1970s crop prices soared as the u s dollar usd plunged crop prices retreated during the 1980s as tight federal reserve monetary policy brought disinflation and the usd rebounded even so the strength or weakness of the u s dollar showed basically zero correlation between 0 1 and 0 1 with day to day movements in crop prices between 1975 and the early 2000s when the correlation both strengthened and became more negative figure 1 figure 1 dollar strength or weakness mattered little until around 2001 the increasingly negative correlation between crop prices and the u s dollar reflects structural changes in global agricultural production and trade that have increased the influence of macroeconomic factors as production of corn and wheat in the black sea region has soared what happens in russia and ukraine is now of paramount importance especially for wheat likewise corn and soy production has increased dramatically in argentina and brazil making what happens to south american currencies central to determining the prices of those two crops the fate of the russian ruble rub and the brazilian real brl are closely linked to the outcomes in key agricultural markets at the same time a greater diversity of crop growing regions might be mitigating the effects of weather events inclement crop weather in the us south america or the black sea could still send crop prices higher but such weather is less likely to occur in all three places at once the brazilian and russian economies are in turn heavily influenced by developments in the world s most rapidly growing major economy china while china s 1 3 billion consumers are the most important food market in the world variations in china s growth rate have little direct influence on the prices of agricultural goods if china grows at say 6 rather than 7 or 8 chinese consumers probably won t buy much less of corn soy and wheat but their demand will grow more slowly for oil and industrial metals like iron ore and copper energy and metals are key exports from many major agriculture exporting nations including australia brazil canada and russia china s demand for raw materials moves the values of their currency via the markets for energy and metals this in turn changes the relative costs of production for farmers in south america the black sea region and elsewhere versus u s farmers who transact entirely in usd the rise of the black sea and south america over the past three decades u s wheat production has fallen from 8 12 of the world total to between 6 8 meanwhile black sea wheat production has risen from 8 12 of global production to around 13 15 figure 2 the post soviet revolution in black sea agricultural productivity has transformed the region to the world s leading wheat exporter selling the equivalent of 7 8 of global production to the rest of the world each year meanwhile u s exports of wheat used to be 4 5 of global production and now are around 3 of world output figure 3 figure 2 the black sea region has replaced the us as the top wheat exporter figure 3 black sea wheat exports dwarf us exports the us remains the dominant corn producer but u s production has declined as a percentage of the world total until 2010 u s corn production ranged from 38 42 of the world total but has since fallen to around 33 34 over the same period south american production rose from 7 10 of world total to around 11 13 while black sea corn production increased from 1 3 of the world total to just below 5 figure 4 the impact on net exports of corn is much more dramatic since the us consumes most of its production it exports only the equivalent of 5 5 of total global production down from 8 during the late 1990s and early 2000s meanwhile south american net exports have risen from just 1 3 of global production to about 5 5 of world output just about the same as the us in the past decade black sea net exports of corn have increased from nothing to around 3 of world total output figure 5 figure 4 us remains dominant in corn but its production has fallen as of global total figure 5 south america has caught up to the us in corn exports and the black sea isn t far behind in the soybean market south america has increased its total production from 32 to 48 of world total while u s production has fallen from 47 of global total to just below 33 since the late 1990s figure 6 u s net exports of soybeans stagnated at around 15 of global production while south american exports now account for around 23 of world output up from around 6 7 20 years ago figure 7 figure 6 brazil and argentina are now the dominant soybean producers figure 7 us soybean exports have stagnated while south america s have quadrupled little wonder then that soybean and corn prices closely track the brlusd exchange rate figure 8 and 9 and that wheat prices move roughly in tandem with the rubusd rate figure 10 u s farmers have always been at the mercy of the usd to some extent but increasingly their prosperity is at the mercy of events in faraway places brazil s fiscal deficits and difficulties in passing pension reform could weaken brl and hurt u s growers of corn and especially soybeans meanwhile russia s exemplary fiscal health might turn out to be good news for u s farmers of wheat and maybe corn as well figure 8 the fate of the brazilian real exerts a strong influence on soybean prices figure 9 corn prices track the brazilian real figure 10 wheat exhibits a strong co movement with the russian ruble both brazil and russia however are at the mercy of china when measuring china s growth rate one could certainly look to the country s official gdp which is a very broad measure that includes china s increasingly diversified services economy a narrower measure called the li keqiang index which measures rail freight volumes electricity consumption and bank loans correlates exceptionally well with corn soy and wheat prices as well as with the prices of other commodities such as copper and oil moreover it also has strong correlations with the currencies of major agricultural exporters such as brl rub but also the australian and canadian dollars figure 11 figure 11 chinese growth influences metals and energy prices emerging market fx and crop prices the us china trade war has been bad news for american farmers depressing the price of soybeans in particular as china curtailed its imports of u s supplies that said the trade war has spurred china to dramatically ease monetary policy by reducing its reserve requirement ratio china has also recently enacted additional tax cuts the easing of china s monetary policy has steepened the country s yield curve and over the past dozen years china s yield curve has been an excellent predictor of accelerations and decelerations in both the li keqiang growth index as well as china s official gdp as such if china s growth does indeed respond to the monetary and fiscal stimulus this could boost not only china s economic growth but also energy and metals prices and through them the currencies of key agricultural exporting nations this could raise production costs in brazil russia and other emerging agriculture exporters and offer some relief to american farmers what is clear is that farmers around the world are the mercy of more than just weather and the u s dollar they are increasingly impacted by public policy decision made in far off places like brasilia moscow and beijing bottom line global crop growing areas are increasingly diversified increased supply diversification reduces the impact of weather crop prices are increasingly sensitive to u s dollar brazilian real russian ruble currency movements change relative production costs china influences ag markets both directly buying decisions and indirectly via its buying of energy metals and emerging market currencies russia s robust fiscal health might be good news for wheat brazil s fiscal problems could weigh on soybeans china s stimulus could boost crop prices via energy metals and emerging market currency effects but only if it overcomes other problems demographics debt and trade disputes editor s note the

lyft stock ipo mania is wall street√¢ s dead canary recently wall street has been myopically focused on the ipo of a ride sharing company called lyft which by the way is hemorrhaging money since investors have become much less concerned about profits and valuations this offering was an incredible 20 times oversubscribed meaning the underwriters received 47 billion of orders for lyft shares but raised 2 3 billion the company generated 2 billion in revenue last year and lost an incredible 911 billion investors rewarded this profligate business model with a market cap of 27 billion this is a great example that wall street has gone nuts the lyft ipo price was 72 per share and shot up to 88 60 on its first day of trading but the following trading day those shares were down 24 from the high indeed this is emblematic of the dead canary in wall street s coal mine wall street s mispricing of this ipo is a perfect illustration of how the yield suppression from central banks has caused another stock market mania the lyft ipo should provide prudent investors with a stark warning it is crucial to ignore the lure of lemmings and groupthink rather they should concentrate on the fundamentals and the data both of which point to a massive equity bubble recent data points prove that the us and the global economy are weak at best and cannot support the stock market at this level the commerce department said recently that retail sales fell 0 2 percent in february over the past year retail sales increased by a slight 2 2 hence after adjusting for inflation growth in retail sales was not evident at all durable goods orders for february fell 1 6 a key measure of business investment known as core capital goods orders fell for the fifth time in the last seven dropping 0 1 you can forget about the capital spending boom and productivity gains hoped for from the tax cut ex autos and gas the number was 0 6 vs 0 3 expectations spiking prices at the pump boosted the headline retail sales number but didn t help most consumers wallets the chicago pmi in march slowed to a reading of 58 7 from 64 7 order backlogs fell into contraction territory while production and new orders fell from the previous month s level remember march data is hugely important because those readings occurred after the government reopened at should show a strong rebound if not the economy is in deep trouble the march ism services sector pmi which fell to 56 1 was the weakest print since august 2017 and down from 59 7 in february the us automotive sector is giving us another warning sign about consumers health fiat chrysler reported a 3 decrease in u s auto sales for the first quarter of 2019 while general motors sales fell 7 in the first quarter as all four of its brands recorded losses toyota motor corp reported a 3 5 fall in u s sales in march and a 5 drop for the first quarter nissan motor co posted a 5 3 drop in sales in march and its first quarter sales were down a significant 11 6 the economic slowdown is even worse in europe factories in the eurozone had their worst month for almost six years in march the eu s ihs markit s march final manufacturing purchasing managers index declined for an eighth month coming in at 47 5 from february s 49 3 china s march pmi improved to 50 8 which is barely in expansion mode however wall street ignored the horrific eu data in favor of the hopes that china can bounce back but the truth is red china is a debt disabled nation with a shrinking labor force and falling productivity china s household debt increased by 716 non financial corporate debt jumped by 400 and total government debt climbed by 416 all since 2008 this was the product of its past stimulus packages it is extremely doubtful that robust and viable growth can be produced from yet another round of government stimulus turning back to the us the data does not indicate the real estate sector will be aiding to the hopes of a second half rebound in the economy february made it 14 straight months of year over year declines in pending home sales the drop in pending sales was down 4 9 from january the takeaway is clear home prices have shot up well above incomes each year since 2012 due to fed s zirp now home prices have become unaffordable for the first time buyer for the most part even though mortgage rates are coming down perhaps that is why we are starting to see the inexorable rise in home prices begin to reverse the median sales price of a new home in february fell 3 6 to 315 300 the home price income ratio now stands at 4 4 it ranged from 3 3 5 from 1969 2001 and hit an all time of 5 1 in 2005 manhattan real estate sales fell for the 6th quarter in a row that is the longest losing streak in the past 30 years interest rates are falling commensurately with decelerating economic growth demand is down for homeownership due to affordability issues and at the same time banks are less incentivized to lend due to shrinking margins on new loans the yield curve inverted recently and that inversion has led to a recession seven out of the last seven times it has occurred the most salient question is whether or not china s massive stimulus efforts combined with the fed s abeyance with rate hikes and promise to end qt come october will be enough to provide for viable global growth with all this there are some small signs of stable data in the us for example the march ism manufacturing index registering 55 3 in from 54 2 in february which was a small increase but that slight blip higher in the ism was offset by the ihs markit manufacturing pmi which fell to 52 4 vs 53 in february which the lowest reading since june 2017 the plain truth is the overwhelming majority of global data still points towards contraction and an anemic debt disabled world there is a contraction in global trade the baltic dry index has crashed tax receipts are falling and according to factset there was the largest cut to q1 s p 500 eps estimates since q1 2016 eps was cut by 7 2 to 37 33 the interesting part is that for all of last year the earnings for the s p 500 was 161 57 the projection for 2019 eps is 168 19 or 4 growth however with q1 projected to post just 37 33 it will take an absolute surge in global gdp and eps to achieve anything close to that 2019 estimate the current run rate 2019 for full year eps on the s p is below 150 therefore the global equity market has priced in the environment that a return to a globally synchronized recovery is indeed already an established fact nearly every economist and market strategist is bullish predicting a favorable outcome to brexit the trade wars the slowdown in global gdp the current recession in parts of europe the zero growth in japan us gdp growth slowing from 4 2 last year to 1 3 in q1 which is projected by the ny fed they see no issues at all with record global debt levels and the 10 trillion worth of negative yielding sovereign bonds there is no fear over the threat from donald trump to close the southern border or trump imposing tariffs on autos from the eu the level of complacency is astonishing only the tech bubble of 1999 can compare with the lunacy that wall street exhibits today therefore the only logical outcome is that disappointment lies ahead for the perma bullsa big drop in the stock market is inevitable that collapse in asset prices will set the fed up for a massive move back to zirp and qe along with fiscal spending that would make even alexandria ocasio cortez blush which will render the economy into a deep battle with stagflation that stagflation will lead to some great opportunities on the long side but will also eventually set us up for a huge plunge in asset prices that will make q4 of 2018 and 2008 look like a

a year ago economic activity was accelerating in almost all regions of the world one year later much has changed the escalation of us china trade tensions needed credit tightening in china macroeconomic stress in argentina and turkey disruptions to the auto sector in germany and financial tightening alongside the normalization of monetary policy in the larger advanced economies have all contributed to a significantly weakened global expansion especially in the second half of 2018 with this weakness expected to persist into the first half of 2019 our new world economic outlook weo projects a slowdown in growth in 2019 for 70 percent of the world economy global growth softened to 3 6 percent in 2018 and is projected to decline further to 3 3 percent in 2019 the downward revision in growth of 0 2 percentage points for 2019 from the january projection is also broad based it reflects negative revisions for several major economies including the euro area latin america the united states the united kingdom canada and australia after the weak start growth is projected to pick up in the second half of 2019 this pickup is supported by significant monetary policy accommodation by major economies made possible by the absence of inflationary pressures despite growing at near potential the us federal reserve the european central bank the bank of japan and the bank of england have all shifted to a more accommodative stance china has ramped up its fiscal and monetary stimulus to counter the negative effect of trade tariffs furthermore the outlook for us china trade tensions has improved as the prospects of a trade agreement take shape these policy responses have helped reverse the tightening of financial conditions to varying degrees across countries emerging markets have experienced some resumption in portfolio flows a decline in sovereign borrowing costs and a strengthening of their currencies relative to the us dollar while the improvement in financial markets has been rapid those in the real economy have been slow to materialize measures of industrial production and investment remain weak for now in many advanced and emerging market economies and global trade has yet to recover with improved prospects for the second half of 2019 global growth in 2020 is projected to return to 3 6 percent this recovery is precarious and predicated on a rebound in emerging market and developing economies where growth is projected to increase from 4 4 percent in 2019 to 4 8 percent in 2020 specifically it relies on an expected rebound in growth in argentina and turkey and some improvement in a set of other stressed developing economies and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty growth in advanced economies will slow slightly in 2020 despite a partial recovery in the euro area as the impact of us fiscal stimulus fades and growth tends toward the modest potential for the group given aging trends and low productivity growth beyond 2020 global growth is expected to stabilize at around 3¬Ω percent bolstered mainly by growth in china and india and their increasing weights in world income growth in emerging market and developing economies will stabilize at 5 percent though with considerable variance as emerging asia continues to grow faster than other regions a similar pattern holds for low income countries with some particularly commodity importers growing rapidly but others falling further behind the advanced world in per capita terms risks to global growth while the global economy continues to grow at a reasonable rate and a global recession is not in the baseline projections there are many downside risks tensions in trade policy could flare up again and play out in other areas such as the auto industry with large disruptions to global supply chains growth in systemic economies such as the euro area and china may surprise on the downside and the risks surrounding brexit remain heightened a deterioration in market sentiment could rapidly tighten financing conditions in an environment of large private and public sector debt in many countries including sovereign bank doom loop risks building more inclusive economies given these risks it is imperative that costly policy mistakes are avoided policymakers need to work cooperatively to help ensure that policy uncertainty doesn t weaken investment fiscal policy will need to manage trade offs between supporting demand protecting social spending and ensuring that public debt remains on a sustainable path with the optimal mix depending on country specific circumstances financial sector policies must address vulnerabilities proactively by deploying macroprudential tools such as counter cyclical capital buffers a task made more urgent by the possibility that interest rates will remain low for longer monetary policy should remain data dependent be well communicated and ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored across all economies the imperative is to take actions that boost potential output improve inclusiveness and strengthen resilience there is a need for greater multilateral cooperation to resolve trade conflicts to address climate change and risks from cybersecurity and to improve the effectiveness of international taxation this is a delicate moment for the global economy if the downside risks do not materialize and the policy support put in place is effective global growth should rebound if however any of the major risks materialize then the expected recoveries in stressed economies export dependent economies and highly indebted economies may be derailed in that case policymakers will need to adjust depending on circumstances this may require synchronized though country specific fiscal stimulus across economies complemented by accommodative monetary policy lastly adequate resources for multilateral institutions remain essential to retain an effective global safety net which would help stabilize the global economy source

yaound√© capital of cameroon external government debt payments in cameroon are 20 of government revenue cameroon is receiving imf bailout loans to help keep making payments public spending per person has fallen 20 in two years external debt payments by developing country governments grew by 85 as a proportion of government revenue between 2010 and 2018 for the countries with the highest payments in two thirds public spending is falling the largest cuts were in egypt cameroon angola and mongolia all of which are on imf loan programmes figures released by the jubilee debt campaign based on imf imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country the most important one 6 57 of the votes is led by belgium the least important group of countries 1 55 of the votes is led by gabon and brings together african countries and world bank world bank wb the world bank was founded as part of the new international monetary system set up at bretton woods in 1944 its capital is provided by member states contributions and loans on the international money markets it financed public and private projects in third world and east european countries it consists of several closely associated institutions among which 1 the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd 189 members in 2017 which provides loans in productive sectors such as farming or energy 2 the international development association ida 159 members in 1997 which provides less advanced countries with long term loans 35 40 years at very low interest 1 3 the international finance corporation ifc which provides both loan and equity finance for business ventures in developing countries as third world debt gets worse the world bank along with the imf tends to adopt a macro economic perspective for instance it enforces adjustment policies that are intended to balance heavily indebted countries payments the world bank advises those countries that have to undergo the imf s therapy on such matters as how to reduce budget deficits round up savings enduce foreign investors to settle within their borders or free prices and exchange rates databases show that developing country debt payments increased by 85 between 2010 and 2018 the new analysis from jubilee debt campaign shows that average government external debt payments across the 124 developing countries for which data is available have increased from 6 6 of government revenue in 2010 to 12 2 of government revenue in 2018 an increase of 85 this is the highest level since 2004 when such payments were 13 8 of government revenue see graph below this rapid increase comes after a lending boom driven by low global interest rates interest rates when a lends money to b b repays the amount lent by a the capital as well as a supplementary sum known as interest so that a has an interest in agreeing to this financial operation the interest is determined by the interest rate which may be high or low to take a very simple example if a borrows 100 million dollars for 10 years at a fixed interest rate of 5 the first year he will repay a tenth of the capital initially borrowed 10 million dollars plus 5 of the capital owed i e 5 million dollars that is a total of 15 million dollars in the second year he will again repay 10 of the capital borrowed but the 5 now only applies to the remaining 90 million dollars still due i e 4 5 million dollars or a total of 14 5 million dollars and so on until the tenth year when he will repay the last 10 million dollars plus 5 of that remaining 10 million dollars i e 0 5 million dollars giving a total of 10 5 million dollars over 10 years the total amount repaid will come to 127 5 million dollars the repayment of the capital is not usually made in equal instalments in the initial years the repayment concerns mainly the interest and the proportion of capital repaid increases over the years in this case if repayments are stopped the capital still due is higher the nominal interest rate is the rate at which the loan is contracted the real interest rate is the nominal rate reduced by the rate of inflation external loans to developing country governments more than doubled from 191 billion per year in 2008 to 424 billion in 2017 the latest year with figures available tim jones head of policy at the jubilee debt campaign said the growing debt crisis needs urgent international attention a vital first step is to require that all loans to governments are publicly disclosed allowing parliaments media and civil society to hold governments to account for new borrowing in addition when crises arise the imf should stop bailing out reckless lenders and require debts to be reduced instead so that the costs of crises are shared between borrower and lender all too often the lenders who helped to cause the crisis are bailed out while all the costs of irresponsible lending are born by people in the borrowing country there is now evidence of falling public spending in countries hit by high debt payments further undermining progress towards the sustainable development goals graph average mean unweighted external debt payments for developing country governments 2000 2018 jubilee debt campaign has also calculated that in the 15 countries with the highest debt payments in ten of them public spending per person fell between 2016 and 2018 across the 15 public spending fell by an average of 4 the largest cuts were in egypt cameroon angola and mongolia all of which are on imf loan programmes in contrast of the 15 countries with the lowest debt payments in just two did public spending per person fall between 2016 and 2018 on average across these 15 public spending increased by 11 the growing debt crisis will be a key discussion at the imf and world bank spring meetings in washington dc from 9 14 april and the g20 g20 the group of twenty g20 or g 20 is a group made up of nineteen countries and the european union whose ministers central bank directors and heads of state meet regularly it was created in 1999 after the series of financial crises in the 1990s its aim is to encourage international consultation on the principle of broadening dialogue in keeping with the growing economic importance of a certain number of countries its members are argentina australia brazil canada china france germany italy india indonesia japan mexico russia saudi arabia south africa south korea turkey usa uk and the european union represented by the presidents of the council and of the european central bank finance ministers meeting 8 9 june in japan the fall in global commodity prices in mid 2014 reduced the income of many governments reliant on commodity exports for earnings this also caused exchange rates to fall against the us dollar which increases the relative size of debt payments as external debts tend to be owed in dollars in recent years rising us interest interest an amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set rates have further increased the interest costs of debt and caused further devaluations of currencies against the dollar further information the full figures for all 124 countries are available here the average figure is a mean unweighted average the median unweighted average has increased by 96 between 2010 and

of us china trade tensions needed credit tightening in china macroeconomic stress in argentina and turkey disruptions to the auto sector in germany and financial tightening alongside the normalization of monetary policy in the larger advanced economies have all contributed to a significantly weakened global expansion especially in the second half of 2018 with this weakness expected to persist into the first half of 2019 our new world economic outlook weo projects a slowdown in growth in 2019 for 70 percent of the world economy global growth softened to 3 6 percent in 2018 and is projected to decline further to 3 3 percent in 2019 the downward revision in growth of 0 2 percentage points for 2019 from the january projection is also broad based it reflects negative revisions for several major economies including the euro area latin america the united states the united kingdom canada and australia after the weak start growth is projected to pick up in the second half of 2019 this pickup is supported by significant monetary policy accommodation by major economies made possible by the absence of inflationary pressures despite growing at near potential the us federal reserve the european central bank the bank of japan and the bank of england have all shifted to a more accommodative stance china has ramped up its fiscal and monetary stimulus to counter the negative effect of trade tariffs furthermore the outlook for us china trade tensions has improved as the prospects of a trade agreement take shape after the weak start growth is projected to pick up in the second half of 2019 these policy responses have helped reverse the tightening of financial conditions to varying degrees across countries emerging markets have experienced some resumption in portfolio flows a decline in sovereign borrowing costs and a strengthening of their currencies relative to the us dollar while the improvement in financial markets has been rapid those in the real economy have been slow to materialize measures of industrial production and investment remain weak for now in many advanced and emerging market economies and global trade has yet to recover with improved prospects for the second half of 2019 global growth in 2020 is projected to return to 3 6 percent this recovery is precarious and predicated on a rebound in emerging market and developing economies where growth is projected to increase from 4 4 percent in 2019 to 4 8 percent in 2020 specifically it relies on an expected rebound in growth in argentina and turkey and some improvement in a set of other stressed developing economies and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty growth in advanced economies will slow slightly in 2020 despite a partial recovery in the euro area as the impact of us fiscal stimulus fades and growth tends toward the modest potential for the group given aging trends and low productivity growth beyond 2020 global growth is expected to stabilize at around 3¬Ω percent bolstered mainly by growth in china and india and their increasing weights in world income growth in emerging market and developing economies will stabilize at 5 percent though with considerable variance as emerging asia continues to grow faster than other regions a similar pattern holds for low income countries with some particularly commodity importers growing rapidly but others falling further behind the advanced world in per capita terms risks to global growth while the global economy continues to grow at a reasonable rate and a global recession is not in the baseline projections there are many downside risks tensions in trade policy could flare up again and play out in other areas such as the auto industry with large disruptions to global supply chains growth in systemic economies such as the euro area and china may surprise on the downside and the risks surrounding brexit remain heightened a deterioration in market sentiment could rapidly tighten financing conditions in an environment of large private and public sector debt in many countries including sovereign bank doom loop risks building more inclusive economies given these risks it is imperative that costly policy mistakes are avoided policymakers need to work cooperatively to help ensure that policy uncertainty doesn t weaken investment fiscal policy will need to manage trade offs between supporting demand protecting social spending and ensuring that public debt remains on a sustainable path with the optimal mix depending on country specific circumstances financial sector policies must address vulnerabilities proactively by deploying macroprudential tools such as counter cyclical capital buffers a task made more urgent by the possibility that interest rates will remain low for longer monetary policy should remain data dependent be well communicated and ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored across all economies the imperative is to take actions that boost potential output improve inclusiveness and strengthen resilience there is a need for greater multilateral cooperation to resolve trade conflicts to address climate change and risks from cybersecurity and to improve the effectiveness of international taxation this is a delicate moment for the global economy if the downside risks do not materialize and the policy support put in place is effective global growth should rebound if however any of the major risks materialize then the expected recoveries in stressed economies export dependent economies and highly indebted economies may be derailed in that case policymakers will need to adjust depending on circumstances this may require synchronized though country specific fiscal stimulus across economies complemented by accommodative monetary policy lastly adequate resources for multilateral institutions remain essential to retain an effective global safety net which would help stabilize the global economy

you are here washington april 9 xinhua the international monetary fund imf on tuesday lowered its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3 3 percent in the newly released world economic outlook weo report down 0 2 percentage point from its estimation in january the imf said the world economy faces downside risks brought by potential uncertainties in the ongoing global trade tensions as well as other country and sector specific factors global growth forecasts the 3 3 percent projection for 2019 is 0 3 percentage point below the 2018 figure followed by an expected return to 3 6 percent in 2020 growth rate projections for advanced economies are 1 8 percent for 2019 and 1 7 percent for 2020 both below the 2 percent plus rates recorded in the previous two years according to the weo report for emerging market and developing economies the imf predicted a growth rate down to 4 4 percent for 2019 0 1 percentage point lower than in 2018 and that expansion will rebound to a rate of 4 8 percent in 2020 leveling the 2017 outcome imf chief economist gita gopinath wrote in a blog post that the projected slowdown in 2019 is broad based it reflects negative revisions for several major economies including the euro area latin america the united states the united kingdom canada and australia gopinath said the loss of growth momentum said gopinath dates back to the second half of 2018 when the world economy was hit by a significantly weakened global expansion the weo report said global growth remained strong at 3 8 percent in the first half of 2018 but dropped to 3 2 percent in the second half gopinath blamed the situation largely on global trade tensions macroeconomic stress in argentina and turkey disruptions to the auto sector in germany and financial tightening alongside normalization of monetary policy in the larger advanced economies with respect to the perceived recovery in 2020 the economist said it is precarious adding that it is based on the assumption that a rebound occurs in emerging market and developing economies gopinath said the uptick is supported by significant monetary policy accommodation by major economies made possible by the absence of inflationary pressures despite growing at near potential she also cited a shift toward a more accommodative stance in central bank policies of the united states the european union eu japan and britain plus china ramping up its fiscal and monetary stimulus as well as a positive outlook for a u s china agreement to resolve their trade disputes these policy responses gopinath said have helped reverse the tightening financial conditions to varying degrees across countries featuring ongoing trends in the emerging markets such as a resumption of portfolio flows a decline in sovereign borrowing costs and a strengthening of their currencies relative to the u s dollar gopinath told a news conference tuesday that monetary policy space varies across different countries and for many advanced economies it remains limited we would expect to see unconventional monetary policy tools being used for instance in the euro area she said adding that inflation pressure staying low is a plus that will make even more accommodative monetary policy possible beyond 2020 the report predicted that global growth will plateau at about 3 6 percent over the medium term region specific projections the weo report expected growth rates in the euro zone to be 1 3 percent in 2019 and 1 5 percent in 2020 both lower than the 2018 and 2017 results eu wide downside risks include a protracted period of elevated bond yields in italy that would weigh on economic activity and worsen debt dynamics the rising possibility of britain leaving the eu without a deal as well as european parliamentary election outcomes that delay or reverse progress on strengthening the euro area architecture according to the report a no deal brexit that severely disrupts supply chains and raises trade costs could potentially have large and long lasting negative impacts on the economic well being of the united kingdom and the european union said the report asked at the press conference to comment on the state of the italian economy gopinath said the european country s growth in the second half of 2018 was particularly weak and that weakness carried over into 2019 high levels of debt as well as sovereign borrowing costs will be reflected in weaker investment and will remain concerns for italy especially given that growth in italy is weak not just in real terms but in nominal terms she said with regard to the united states it projected that the economy will grow by 2 3 percent in 2019 and expand at a lower rate of 1 9 percent in 2020 the report said the market implied path of expected policy rates remains below the u s federal reserve s projections raising the possibility of a market reassessment of the expected policy path if u s economic data remain strong this could result in higher u s interest rates renewed dollar appreciation and tighter financial conditions for emerging market and developing economies with balance sheet vulnerabilities the report said for china the growth rate is forecast to be 6 3 percent in 2019 up 0 1 percentage point from its previous estimation in january the chinese economy is forecast to expand by 6 1 percent in 2020 the post 2020 growth stabilization gopinath said is bolstered mainly by growth in china and india and their increasing weights in world income growth in emerging market and developing economies will stabilize at 5 percent with emerging economies in asia continuing to grow faster than other regions she added to prevent the downside risks from materializing gopinath urged the building of more inclusive economies adding that costly policy mistakes should be avoided policymakers need to work cooperatively to help ensure that policy uncertainty doesn t weaken investment she said across all economies the imperative is to take actions that boost potential output improve inclusiveness and strengthen resilience enditem

april 9 2019 the international monetary fund imf on tuesday lowered its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3 3 percent in the newly released world economic outlook weo report down 0 2 percentage point from its estimation in january xinhua liu jie washington april 9 xinhua the international monetary fund imf on tuesday lowered its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3 3 percent in the newly released world economic outlook weo report down 0 2 percentage point from its estimation in january the imf said the world economy faces downside risks brought by potential uncertainties in the ongoing global trade tensions as well as other country and sector specific factors global growth forecasts the 3 3 percent projection for 2019 is 0 3 percentage point below the 2018 figure followed by an expected return to 3 6 percent in 2020 growth rate projections for advanced economies are 1 8 percent for 2019 and 1 7 percent for 2020 both below the 2 percent plus rates recorded in the previous two years according to the weo report for emerging market and developing economies the imf predicted a growth rate down to 4 4 percent for 2019 0 1 percentage point lower than in 2018 and that expansion will rebound to a rate of 4 8 percent in 2020 leveling the 2017 outcome imf chief economist gita gopinath wrote in a blog post that the projected slowdown in 2019 is broad based it reflects negative revisions for several major economies including the euro area latin america the united states the united kingdom canada and australia gopinath said the loss of growth momentum said gopinath dates back to the second half of 2018 when the world economy was hit by a significantly weakened global expansion the weo report said global growth remained strong at 3 8 percent in the first half of 2018 but dropped to 3 2 percent in the second half gopinath blamed the situation largely on global trade tensions macroeconomic stress in argentina and turkey disruptions to the auto sector in germany and financial tightening alongside normalization of monetary policy in the larger advanced economies with respect to the perceived recovery in 2020 the economist said it is precarious adding that it is based on the assumption that a rebound occurs in emerging market and developing economies gopinath said the uptick is supported by significant monetary policy accommodation by major economies made possible by the absence of inflationary pressures despite growing at near potential she also cited a shift toward a more accommodative stance in central bank policies of the united states the european union eu japan and britain plus china ramping up its fiscal and monetary stimulus as well as a positive outlook for a u s china agreement to resolve their trade disputes these policy responses gopinath said have helped reverse the tightening financial conditions to varying degrees across countries featuring ongoing trends in the emerging markets such as a resumption of portfolio flows a decline in sovereign borrowing costs and a strengthening of their currencies relative to the u s dollar gopinath told a news conference tuesday that monetary policy space varies across different countries and for many advanced economies it remains limited we would expect to see unconventional monetary policy tools being used for instance in the euro area she said adding that inflation pressure staying low is a plus that will make even more accommodative monetary policy possible beyond 2020 the report predicted that global growth will plateau at about 3 6 percent over the medium term region specific projections the weo report expected growth rates in the euro zone to be 1 3 percent in 2019 and 1 5 percent in 2020 both lower than the 2018 and 2017 results eu wide downside risks include a protracted period of elevated bond yields in italy that would weigh on economic activity and worsen debt dynamics the rising possibility of britain leaving the eu without a deal as well as european parliamentary election outcomes that delay or reverse progress on strengthening the euro area architecture according to the report a no deal brexit that severely disrupts supply chains and raises trade costs could potentially have large and long lasting negative impacts on the economic well being of the united kingdom and the european union said the report asked at the press conference to comment on the state of the italian economy gopinath said the european country s growth in the second half of 2018 was particularly weak and that weakness carried over into 2019 high levels of debt as well as sovereign borrowing costs will be reflected in weaker investment and will remain concerns for italy especially given that growth in italy is weak not just in real terms but in nominal terms she said with regard to the united states it projected that the economy will grow by 2 3 percent in 2019 and expand at a lower rate of 1 9 percent in 2020 the report said the market implied path of expected policy rates remains below the u s federal reserve s projections raising the possibility of a market reassessment of the expected policy path if u s economic data remain strong this could result in higher u s interest rates renewed dollar appreciation and tighter financial conditions for emerging market and developing economies with balance sheet vulnerabilities the report said for china the growth rate is forecast to be 6 3 percent in 2019 up 0 1 percentage point from its previous estimation in january the chinese economy is forecast to expand by 6 1 percent in 2020 the post 2020 growth stabilization gopinath said is bolstered mainly by growth in china and india and their increasing weights in world income growth in emerging market and developing economies will stabilize at 5 percent with emerging economies in asia continuing to grow faster than other regions she added to prevent the downside risks from materializing gopinath urged the building of more inclusive economies adding that costly policy mistakes should be avoided policymakers need to work cooperatively to help ensure that policy uncertainty doesn t weaken investment she said across all economies the imperative is to take actions that boost potential output improve inclusiveness and strengthen resilience

the international monetary fund again reduced its global economic growth forecast for 2019 on tuesday citing risks like increasing trade tensions and tighter monetary policy by the federal reserve the fund said it expects the world economy to grow by 3 3 this year that s down from its previous outlook of 3 5 which was also a downgrade the imf added that it expects the economy to expand by 3 6 in 2020 however the imf s report comes as congress struggles to pass the united states mexico canada agreement usmca a trade deal signed by president donald trump and his mexican and canadian counterparts at the time which would replace the existing north atlantic free trade agreement nafta meanwhile the trump administration is trying to hammer out another trade deal with china the balance of risks remains skewed to the downside the imf said failure to resolve differences and a resulting increase in tariff barriers above and beyond what is incorporated into the forecast would lead to higher costs of imported intermediate and capital goods and higher final goods prices for consumers the usmca was signed nov 30 but has not yet received congressional approval and getting it through the legislative body will be tough for the administration the deal has to get through the democrat controlled house and was criticized by republican sen chuck grassley he noted that tariffs on mexican and canadian goods should be waved off once a deal is ratified trump however has not indicated his willingness to do so if the deal between the three countries falls through the ramifications for the u s economy would be massive canada and mexico are two of the three largest u s trade partners and made up 30 of u s global trade in 2018 according to data from the census bureau higher trade policy uncertainty and concerns of escalation and retaliation would reduce business investment disrupt supply chains and slow productivity growth according to the imf the resulting depressed outlook for corporate profitability could dent financial market sentiment and further dampen growth the u s is also trying to strike a deal with china its largest trade partner china alone accounted for nearly 16 of u s global trade last year census data shows but while negotiations between the two countries are still ongoing the outlook seems promising on march 27 reuters reported china had made unprecedented progress on issues like forced technology transfers which have been sticking points during its negotiations with the u s trump also said on thursday we ll know over the next four weeks whether a deal between the world largest economies can be struck the apparent progress in u s china trade negotiations has boosted world stocks this year the ishares msci world exchange traded fund urth is up more than 15 in 2019 the also has rallied more than 15 but failure to strike a deal would hurt the u s economically and would also derail china s efforts to reinvigorate its economy the imf warns china s economy expanded by 6 6 in 2018 which was its slowest pace in nearly 30 years another risk to global economic growth according to the fund is a change in monetary policy by central banks especially the federal reserve the fed reversed its stance on policy earlier this year eliminating all expectations for even a single rate hike for 2019 this follows four rate increases by the u s central bank in 2018 the fed s reversal contributed to the market s hot start to 2019 with the s p 500 notching its biggest first quarter gain since 1998 however the imf said the market implied path of expected policy rates remains below the federal open market committee s projections raising the possibility of a market reassessment of the expected policy path if us economic data remain strong this could result in higher us interest rates renewed dollar appreciation and tighter financial conditions for emerging market and developing economies with balance sheet vulnerabilities other risks highlighted by the imf include a no deal brexit political uncertainty as several countries around the world hold elections and geopolitical tensions in east asia cnbc s jacob pramuk contributed to this report subscribe to cnbc on youtube
the imf s world economic outlook once again downgraded global growth to 3 3 percent for 2019 two tenths lower than the global crisis lender forecast in january and four tenths lower than october and while world growth is expected to pick up in the second half of this year and hit 3 6 percent in 2020 many things will have to go right for that to happen including a resolution of president donald trump s trade battle with china the quarterly report projects a slowdown in growth in 2019 for 70 percent of the world economy imf chief economist gita gopinath said in a statement the euro area is likely to slow sharply particularly in germany where the gdp forecast was cut by a half point and italy which has slowed to a virtual standstill according to the quarterly report and amid the turmoil over its exit from the european union the imf downgraded the outlook for britain this year and next emerging economic powers china and india continue to show the highest growth rates 6 3 percent and 7 3 percent respectively beijing has rolled out a series of fiscal stimulus measures to counteract the hit from the us trade war but india s growth was downgraded by two tenths of a point and while the recent signs that officials in washington and beijing are engineering a trade deal have calmed some of the nerves in financial markets the solution is by no means certain precarious recovery the report cautions that downside risks to the outlook continue to dominate trade tensions could flare up again and there is risk of a no deal brexit withdrawal or persistent slowing of economic activity this is a delicate moment for the global economy gopinath said this recovery is precarious and predicated on a rebound in emerging market and developing economies including argentina and turkey while a rebound is possible if policymakers avoid all the potential pitfalls she warned that if however any of the major risks materialize then the expected recoveries in stressed economies export dependent economies and highly indebted economies may be derailed the challenge to policymakers is they have little ammunition with which to counteract a slowdown since interest rates are low and most central banks already have stopped raising or started cutting rates while debt levels are high crimping the ability to provide fiscal stimulus given these risks it is imperative that costly policy mistakes are avoided she said urging cooperation among governments especially in trade conflicts to avoid fueling uncertainty that could contribute to a slowdown the fund said avoiding such policy missteps needs to be the main priority including distorstionary barriers to trade slower trade the broad based slowdown most notably in advanced economies was larger than expected and apparently due to the souring of market sentiment partly due to the trade tensions the imf said trump s aggressive trade policies largely but not exclusively aimed at china left us products open to retaliation in the form of steep tariffs but inflation pressures remained muted despite the new duties which raised the costs of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of imports global trade growth has slowed sharply from its peak in late 2017 and expectations for future business activity have weakened pointing to slowing momentum ahead the report said growth in advanced economies next year presents a mixed picture the united states and japan are expected to slow further next year with us gdp adding 1 9 percent and japan s just 0 5 percent half of this year s rate but with temporary factors waning germany s growth is projected to accelerate to 1 4 percent and italy to 0 9 percent spain is the strong performer in the euro area with 2 1 percent growth in 2019 and 1 9 percent in 2020 in the major emerging markets china s expansion will slow to 6 1 percent while india continues to accelerate to 7 5 percent the imf downgraded the outlook for mexico sharply cutting a half point off the estimate to 1 6 percent this year and 1 9 percent in 2020

india has done it again the country of over billion people topped in overseas remittances in 2018 as per world bank report india received a whopping 79 billion rs 5 47 lakh crore last year a healthy upswing of 14 per cent from 65 7 billion rs 4 55 lakh crore in 2017 that means inflows increased by more than rs 92 000 crore in last calendar year the overseas remittances reached 62 7 billion rs 4 34 lakh crore in 2016 that shows the inflows were more than 50 billion each year in the last couple of years during which period the country topped the global list further india outpaced china which occupied second place in the list with inflows of 67 billion rs 4 64 lakh crore in 2018 this is the second instance where india has beaten china the world s second largest economy after the us india outsmarted the communist country and emerged as the world s fastest growing major economy it bagged the coveted tag in the last two financial years going by the projections and macroeconomic indicators the country is expected to repeat the feat in next two financial years previously china enjoyed the leadership position in economic growth nevertheless india and indians should thank growing indian diaspora for ever increasing forex inflows better economic growth in the united states and rise in oil prices also pushed up remittances to india oil rich gulf co operation council gcc countries comprising bahrain kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia and the uae account for largest number of indian expatriates who regularly send funds to their families back home therefore any rise in oil prices will have a positive impact on outward remittances from these countries to india the other factor that encouraged indian expatriates to send more funds to their families was rupee depreciation last year the currency lost its value by 509 paise or 9 23 per cent against the us dollar in 2018 it ended last year at rs 69 77 a dollar against the closing level of rs 63 87 in 2017 in addition it also notched up several dubious records on the valuation front it breached rs 70 level vis √† vis dollar the currency also hit a historic low of rs 74 45 against the us currency on october 11 2018 thus becoming one of the asia s worst performing currencies any depreciation in currency spurs indians living abroad to send more funds to their home country as they get more indian rupees for same amount of dollars the rupee s record depreciation last year is also one of the main factors for the steep rise in remittances but there is a downside to the currency depreciation even though it benefits indian diaspora thus spurring foreign inflows imports turn costlier and purchasing power of people living in india comes down as prices of commodities and products are linked to global markets the other key factor is that more and more talented indians go abroad as salaries are very less in the country compared to developed and many developing countries that will have an adverse impact on the country and its economy in long run nonetheless rise in remittances is a healthy sign in short term

u s president donald trump speaks during the republican jewish coalition s annual leadership meeting at the venetian las vegas on april 6 2019 in las vegas nevada the imf warned that trump s trade disputes are hurting the global economy u s president donald trump speaks during the republican jewish coalition s annual leadership meeting at the venetian las vegas on april 6 2019 in las vegas nevada the imf warned that trump s trade disputes are hurting the international monetary fund imf has warned that the ongoing trade tensions between the u s and its trading partners are contributing to a slowdown in the global economy in its latest world economic outlook the imf cut its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3 3 percent that is down from the 3 5 percent predicted in january s edition of the quarterly report which had itself been cut from 3 7 percent but 2020 should see 3 6 percent growth if risks are mitigated one of the major factors in slashing the estimate is the u s china trade dispute kicked off by president donald trump who accuses beijing of ripping america off he says china does not play fair on goods such as steel a heavily subsidized industry in china and also allows intellectual property theft from american firms to run rife the pair have hiked tariffs on each other s products the chinese targeted sectors in agricultural pro trump heartlands that rely on exporting their products to the asian giant talks are ongoing between the two and have shown positive signs in recent weeks such as china s commitment to reducing tariffs on u s auto imports as well as china trump has used tariffs to force others to the negotiating table on trade including canada mexico the european union japan and south korea trump views america s bilateral trade deficits as negative for the domestic economy and a sign that its companies are losing out many economists however say bilateral trade deficits do not matter all that much they are a sign of america s economic power a strong dollar allows businesses to access cheap goods materials and labor overseas which reduces costs and aids profitability the trump administration ditched nafta the trade deal with canada and mexico to negotiate a new deal usmca which was signed by all parties in november to do so he threatened both canada and mexico with tariffs unless they agreed to reopen the trade deal global trade investment and output remain under threat from ongoing trade tensions the imf said in its report the imf noted that the signing of usmca and some recent softening of u s china tensions such as the extended truce on tariff rises are steps in the right direction but it also said negotiations between washington and beijing remain unresolved and congress still has not ratified usmca there is also a proposal under consideration by the trump administration to raise tariffs on all imported cars and car parts failure to resolve differences and a resulting increase in tariff barriers above and beyond what is incorporated into the forecast would lead to higher costs of imported intermediate and capital goods and higher final goods prices for consumers the report said beyond these direct impacts higher trade policy uncertainty and concerns of escalation and retaliation would reduce business investment disrupt supply chains and slow productivity growth the resulting depressed outlook for corporate profitability could dent financial market sentiment and further dampen growth other reasons for slowing global growth include declining growth in china and europe and recent tightening of monetary policy among central banks but the imf warned that countries must urgently move forward on trade or risk causing more damage at the multilateral level the main priority is for countries to resolve trade disagreements cooperatively without raising distortionary barriers that would further destabilize a slowing global economy the imf report said
by joe foster vaneck portfolio manager and strategist gold market sees several course reversals in march after six months of gains in which the gold price rose by 175 per ounce to 1 345 march saw some profit taking gold fell to its monthly low of 1 280 on march 7 amid near term u s dollar strength however the gold market quickly reversed course when the u s department of labor reported non farm payrolls increased by just 20 000 compared to median expectations of 180 000 on the same day the european central bank ecb announced a policy reversal offering cheap loans to banks and keeping interest rates at record lows for longer than planned this caused recessionary fears to re emerge as long term treasury yields fell to 15 month lows the yield curve inverted slightly for the first time since 2007 and gold trended to its monthly high of 1 324 on march 25 as the month ended there was broad weakness among precious metals due to a sharp fall in palladium prices there were also reports of heavy official selling from turkey to prop up the lira ahead of local elections on march 31 gold ended the month at 1 292 30 for a loss of 21 01 per ounce down 1 6 after about two years without reporting any purchases the people s bank of china pboc reported its third consecutive month of gold buying with a february inflow of 9 95 tonnes this suggests the chinese are again consistent buyers which bodes well for central bank demand in 2019 gold stocks more or less matched gold s performance in march with a 0 74 gain in the nyse arca gold miners index gdm and a 2 3 loss for the mvis global junior gold miners index merger mania subsides first quarter merger and acquisition m a activity among the supermajors has nearly reached a conclusion barrick gold 7 of net assets withdrew its hostile offer for newmont mining 6 2 of net assets on march 11 when the companies announced a joint venture jv agreement to unitize their nevada operations their combined nevada operations produce four million ounces per year and barrick as jv operator estimates it will generate about 5 billion in synergies after years of debating such a deal at the urging of shareholders these two rivals hammered out a jv in just two weeks investors then turned their attention to the friendly newmont goldcorp merger announced in january it stood to reason that goldcorp 2 of net assets shareholders were not entitled to the nevada jv synergies which did not exist at the time the deal with newmont was announced again at the urging of investors newmont decided to award a 2 5 special dividend to its shareholders as a partial upfront payment for future nevada synergies the dividend will be distributed if the newmont goldcorp deal is approved by shareholders in april all of this supermajor m a activity has been aimed at creating value for shareholders by combining companies managements and properties with the goal of mining more efficiently and generating higher returns on capital we hope the majors mid tiers and juniors are able to replicate what the supermajors have done according to pollitt co inc just four companies account for 50 of iron ore production while it takes ten companies to account for 50 of copper production contrast this with gold where twenty five companies account for 45 of production mining is risky business and not all of these companies have an a team management risk can be mitigated by joining good managements with good properties thereby enabling companies to optimize operations m a also allows smaller companies to gain the critical mass needed to efficiently access capital markets and strike better deals for materials equipment and services diverging macro signals hint at risks ahead successful investing involves making the right call at the right time a great investment idea can fail if the timing is off we have been warning of the risks of recession for several years as such our fund has been positioned aggressively for a stronger gold market while gold and gold stocks have exhibited positive returns in two of the last three calendar years driven perhaps by any number of the global systemic risks that currently exist we were certainly much too early on the recession call two years ago we shared this chart as a compelling indicator of a coming recession we update it here and now find it even more compelling divergence between sentiment and consumption precedes recessions notice the divergence between the hard consumption data and the soft consumer confidence data ahead of each recession sentiment remains strong before a recession while actual economic indicators are weakening and this time the divergence has become more pronounced we believe this chart combined with other late cycle indicators stock market volatility bond market action and central bank behavior all suggest a recession remains in the forecast and probably may occur sooner than many expect if the economy tumbles into recession we expect financial risks to escalate that drive gold higher u s federal debt is growing fast federal debt totals about 75 of u s gross domestic product gdp and is growing rapidly trillion dollar annual deficits were first seen in the obama administration and now president donald trump s policies will again drive deficits through the trillion dollar mark 4 5 of gdp beginning in 2022 according to the congressional budget office cbo unlike in the obama years we rarely hear politicians complaining about the debt level spending more is easy while cutting budgets seems politically impossible in washington because of this we believe a debt crisis is imminent although the breaking point is difficult to forecast it may come in the next recession or at a time when rates spike as foreign holders of u s treasuries lose confidence in washington if cutting spending is impossible growth is weak and raising revenue by hiking taxes even higher is limited then we see only two options for handling u s debt default or monetization modern monetary theory is not the answer some politicians have begun to prepare the nation for debt monetization so far no adverse consequences of the sovereign debt build up have shown up in the financial system meanwhile easy monetary and fiscal policies have not ignited inflationary pressures in consumer prices as a result a radical form of financial thinking has emerged called modern monetary theory mmt key characteristics of mmt include any country that prints its own currency can do so to pay national debts or finance deficits deficits don t matter as long as interest rates remain below gdp growth the natural rate of interest in a fiat currency world is 0 inflation can be controlled through taxation rate increases and regulation of big business economies should be guided by fiscal policy i e government spending and taxation the central bank would essentially be controlled by the treasury prominent economists and financial leaders have characterized mmt as fallacious garbage and just wrong we agree with these characterizations and suspect that those reading this update intuitively understand why if adopted mmt would likely lead to currency debasement and hyper inflation on a scale seen in weimar germany almost 100 years ago or in modern day venezuela bond prices might collapse with the u s dollar and a financial crisis would probably ensue long before mmt is implemented in its full form unfortunately there are fewer and fewer americans who are familiar with the level of financial risk that we currently face including even those within government held roles at the highest levels furthermore less than half of young adults now have a positive view of capitalism according to a deutsche bank report the percentage of americans who say reducing the budget deficit should be a top priority has shrunk from 71 in 2013 to 48 in 2019 amid this complacency towards debt disdain of capitalism and changing political ideas it is not hard to imagine mmt gaining in popularity and acceptance as the next presidential cycle unfolds americans regardless of political ideology may find the lure of free money irresistible in addition to purportedly taking care of our indebtedness mmt can supposedly help pay for a progressive agenda of healthcare and employment for all abandonment of fossil fuels and free college tuition what might be a more viable option how about an investment in a reasonably valued preexisting asset class with a proven track record as an alternative store of value and negative correlation to the u

as senegal which relies on a mix of agricultural products tourism and services for revenues are more immune from the trade war s impacts weakening commodity prices u s tariffs are one of many factors projected to stem global growth rates 9 applying pressure to global commodity prices commodity exporters recovered slightly from a 2014 16 price plunge but not enough has been done to diversify and mobilize domestic resources leaving them exposed to another downturn 10 oil and industrial metal prices fell following the implementation of u s tariffs on chinese imports in june and their stability is tied in part to tariff negotiations 11 african development bank experts warn that trade tensions could cause a 2 5 percent reduction in gdp for resource intensive exporters and a 1 9 percent reduction for oil exporters by 2021 12 reducing chinese imports u s tariffs combined with several domestic and external pressures are slowing down chinese production and reducing beijing s demand for raw materials from sub saharan africa 13 diminished chinese demand could further reduce annual exports of 75 26 billion from africa 14 south sudan and angola which rely on beijing s thirst for resources for more than a quarter of their exports are especially vulnerable 15 missed commercial opportunities african businesses are poorly positioned to benefit from commercial opportunities surfacing from the trade war manufacturers are diverting operations outside of china to avoid u s tariffs trade tensions also reinforce china s resolve to reduce dependency on and substitute its u s imports however asia and latin america which possess more developed manufacturing sectors than sub saharan africa are poised to clinch most of these deals 16 despite sporadic reports of chinese entities approaching nigerian or ethiopian producers 17 18 south africa is likely the only country with the capacity to gain significant business from the trade war 19 tariffs add heat to beijing s rhetoric in africa as trade tensions escalated between beijing and washington this year china took to the world stage to amass political support against u s tariffs sub saharan africa was no exception not only is the trade war spurring china to deepen its long term investments in africa as it reduces its dependence on the united states but it is also being used by beijing to sow anti u s sentiment among african leaders and publics feeding china s narrative beijing is using the trade war to discredit the u s brand in sub saharan africa chinese ambassadors to nigeria and south africa the region s biggest economies issued public statements condemning the impact of u s tariffs on local economies 20 china s envoy to south africa noted that the rand s value dropped due to u s tariffs but rose when president xi jinping visited the country in july 21 these comments fit into beijing s broader political strategy on the continent which casts itself as africa s ideal development partner often at the expense of the united states the united states has not acknowledged or responded to the negative impacts that its broader economic policies are having on the continent not only is the trade war spurring china to deepen its long term investments in africa as it reduces its dependence on the united states but it is also being used by beijing to sow anti u s sentiment among african leaders and publics prompting an african rebuke during a meeting with xi jinping president sall announced that senegal would work with china to build a more balanced just and inclusive global governance system safeguard multilateralism and oppose protectionism 22 at the 2018 forum on china africa cooperation focac president xi stood alongside 53 african countries and promised to counter protectionism an implied sino african jab at the united states 23 independently the leaders of nigeria south africa ghana and cabo verde and the former president of zambia have also admonished the trade war and warned of its impacts on african markets 24 25 26 27 28 how tariffs impact u s africa relations although sub saharan africa is largely absent from the current discourse on the trade war tariffs nevertheless pose risks indirectly by undercutting the united states position and some of its priorities on the continent trade tensions primarily weaken u s goals of supporting development in sub saharan africa through expanded u s africa trade and investment restoring its political prestige on the continent and challenging china s expanding influence slowing the journey to self reliance the u s agency for international development usaid s journey to self reliance a key pillar of the u s strategy toward africa seeks to shift away from a foreign aid model and toward a new paradigm that develops african economies through increased trade and investment 29 the trade war could counteract u s efforts to boost african self sufficiency in two ways first as explained above tariffs are indirectly harming sub saharan africa s economic growth which slows economic reform efforts and deepens dependency on foreign aid diversification and industrialization initiatives require capital and depressed export orders threaten to decrease revenue generation second u s appetite to invest in african markets is likely to decrease if continued tariff tensions slow growth in both sub saharan africa and the united states simultaneously lowering u s demand for goods and adding risk to african markets 30 damaging u s prestige in africa u s protectionism called out by several african leaders as destructive to their economies risks adding to the perception that the united states is apathetic toward the region since president trump took office african publics and leaders have noted a marked decrease in u s engagement with the continent expressing dismay over the white house s disparaging remarks about african leaders and countries the drop in the number of high level u s diplomatic visits and the relative silence on u s policy objectives toward the continent 31 when viewed in context of suboptimal u s african diplomatic relations african statements that reprimand u s protectionism represent another point of contention between u s and african governments tariffs increase tensions with south africa south africa is the only sub saharan african country the united states directly targeted with tariffs producing some economic anxiety and adding another irritant to perennially difficult u s south african relations south african companies are on a list of major exporters required to pay a 10 percent tariff on aluminum and 15 percent tariff on certain steel exports to the united states 42 the impacts so far have been minimal in part because u s aluminum purchasers have absorbed extra costs and some categories of south africa s steel exports are exempt 43 nevertheless the south african stock market and currency buckled when tariffs were initially announced and investors worry that other major steel and aluminum producers will divert some exports to avoid u s tariffs threatening local south african markets with lower prices 44 trade analysts also say these tariffs disregard the african growth and opportunity act agoa which currently facilitates the flow of 6 700 south african goods to the united states potentially weakening its credibility as a tool to attract foreign investment in the long term 45 as of now u s tariffs have been most harmful to u s south africa relations pretoria officials objected to the tariffs arguing that they disproportionately impacted its workers and were politically motivated the south african department of trade and industry argued that the united states extended exemptions to its allies which together made up 50 percent of steel and aluminum exports to the united states whereas south african exports amounted to less than 2 percent of u s imports of both products 46 while south africa is unlikely to retaliate and risk losing lucrative agoa benefits it has ardently reprimanded the united states on the world stage and strengthened its beijing ties russia china and south africa convened at the brics conference with a newfound commitment to confront unprecedented challenges to multilateralism and to deepen trade 47 if the trump administration indeed sought to make an example of south africa by persuading it to adopt a u s friendly foreign policy with the threat of tariffs then its strategy may have backfired reinforcing chinese rhetoric in africa finally the economic and political impacts of the trade war are working in beijing s favor taking the words of african leaders at face value it would appear that the trump administration s battle to counter chinese influence globally is backfiring in sub saharan africa u s tariffs inadvertently give ammunition to beijing s narrative and undermine u s efforts to stem beijing s political reach on the continent u s protectionism may also sharpen the distinction between china and the united states as trade partners as president guelleh of djibouti once told jeune afrique the chinese offer a long term partnership whereas the americans are only interested in quick easy wins 32 trade tensions primarily weaken u s goals of supporting development in sub saharan africa through expanded u s africa trade and investment restoring its political prestige on the continent and challenging china s expanding influence opportunities to offset the trade war s impact it is not inevitable that the u s china trade war will have harmful consequences for sub saharan africa and u s objectives in the region the extent to which negative economic forecasts will materialize is contingent on chinese and u s policy decisions and the ability for global and domestic markets to counterbalance the trade war s negative effects there are several short and long term steps available to washington to strengthen its u s africa strategy and resolve the contradictions surfacing between its global and regional approaches focus on u s strengths sub saharan african governments understand that partnerships with the united states and china come with distinct strengths and weaknesses the u s government should seek to strengthen its own trade and investment strategy and counter anti u s rhetoric propagated by china rather than respond with a list of beijing s faults this means highlighting its economic comparative advantage from the expertise and capital in the technology and entertainment fields to its world class professional services 33 with the recent announcement of prosper africa u s policymakers have an opportunity to craft and implement a new approach to greater u s private sector engagement in the region the more the u s government develops prosper africa the more effective the united states will be at countering rumors and negative reactions from african chinese and other global stakeholders 34 treat china tariffs as global tariffs the tariffs punish other regions and key partners an implication that is often ignored u s china negotiations postponed a substantial hike on 200 billion worth of chinese products from 10 percent to 25 percent and signal the possibility of a deal to remove tariffs altogether 35 as president trump moves forward with tariff talks his administration should consider their global impacts and how they fit into a broader strategy to counter china globally officials in africa and other nations both developing and developed recognize the threat posed by chinese economic espionage and business coercion but given the distraction of u s protectionism will have less motivation to unite against beijing 36 support african trade initiatives the united states is promoting protectionism at a time when integration is gaining momentum in sub saharan africa 37 the continental free trade agreement cfta a transcontinental effort to boost regional trade and supply chains by lowering tariff and non tariff barriers is key to the region s economic self reliance and represents a formidable opportunity for the united states successful implementation of the cfta would grant u s businesses various points of access to a consumer market of 1 2 billion people 38 the united states should rethink its objective of securing one free trade agreement with a model nation in africa which risks undercutting the cfta the more the u s government develops prosper africa the more effective the united states will be at countering rumors and negative reactions from african chinese and other global stakeholders protect u s african trade deals the recent affirmation of agoa as a key u s africa investment tool is positive but washington can further protect agoa s value by avoiding tariffs that are perceived as violations of its provisions 39 moreover as the trump administration re examines its preferential treatment under the generalized system of preferences gsp program it is possible that african countries deemed more developed such as the republic of the congo and gabon will come under scrutiny 40 if so u s officials and their counterparts should enter into alternate agreements with these countries that ensure reciprocal duty free trade free trade agreements remain an integral tool to increase u s african trade and investment with agoa and the gsp facilitatin 13 8 billion worth

adds comment from u s treasury secretary updates markets by jason lange washington april 9 reuters the global economy is slowing more than expected and a sharp downturn could require world leaders to coordinate stimulus measures the international monetary fund said on tuesday as it cut its forecast for world economic growth this year the global lender s semi annual world economic report pointed to the u s china trade war and a potentially disorderly british exit from the european union as key risks and warned that chances of further cuts to the outlook were high some major economies including china and germany might need to take short term actions the imf said this is a delicate moment for the global economy imf chief economist gita gopinath said in a news conference to discuss the report governments may need to open their pocketbooks at the same time across economies if the slowdown becomes more serious gopinath said adding that loose monetary policy might also be needed the comments provided an eerie warning to the global officials gathering in washington this week for the spring meetings of the imf and world bank the world engaged in coordinated fiscal stimulus to counter the 2008 financial crisis in its third downgrade since october the imf said the global economy will likely grow 3 3 this year the slowest expansion since 2016 the forecast cut 0 2 percentage point from the imf s outlook in january the projected growth rate for next year was unchanged at 3 6 more than two thirds of the expected slowdown in 2019 stems from troubles in rich nations including members of the eu in this context avoiding policy missteps that could harm economic activity should be the main priority the imf said in its report one potential misstep lies in britain s indecision over how to leave the eu despite looming deadlines london has not decided how it will try to shield its economy during the exit process story continues the imf s new forecast assumes an orderly brexit but the fund said a chaotic process could shave more than 0 2 percentage point from global growth in 2019 it said the bank of england should be cautious on its interest rate policy an apparent tip to wait before hiking borrowing costs the eu s economic growth is already slowing substantially though the imf said it still expects the slowdown in europe and some emerging market economies will give way to a re acceleration in growth during the second half of 2019 the outlook for germany one of the main drivers of european growth suffered from weaker demand for its exports softer consumer spending and new emissions standards that have depressed car sales germany may have to quickly turn to fiscal stimulus measures the imf said also calling on the european central bank to keep stimulating the regional economy the imf also cut japan s growth outlook following a string of natural disasters u s downgrade the u s economy while seen outperforming other rich nations economies also got a downgrade on signs that a fiscal stimulus fueled by tax cuts was producing less activity than previously expected u s treasury yields slid on concerns about the global economic outlook which also weighed on u s stocks the dow jones industrial average index fell 0 7 and the s p 500 and the nasdaq composite both closed about 0 6 lower as the growth forecasts and renewed trade worries sparked by new u s tariff threats on european aircraft and food products weighed on sentiment u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin disputed the imf s assessment that u s growth was slowing and told lawmakers he was not concerned about a recent inversion of the treasury yield curve often a harbinger of recession there s no question that growth outside of the united states whether it be europe or china has slowed significantly mnuchin told a u s house financial services committee hearing from everything we see we see for the next few years still strong robust u s growth china s green shoots the imf said it supported the u s federal reserve s decision to pause its rate hiking cycle which the global lender said would support the u s and world economies this year by easing financial conditions the imf raised its forecast for u s growth in 2020 by a tenth of a percentage point to 1 9 the global lender said it was slightly boosting its outlook for chinese growth this year to 6 3 in part because an expected escalation in the u s china trade war had not materialized still america s ongoing tensions with china and other major trading partners continue to cloud the global economy u s tariffs on chinese imports are hitting chinese growth and also weighing on latin america and other parts of the world dependent on chinese demand for commodities the imf cut its 2019 growth forecasts for canada and latin america as well as for the middle east and north african countries china was trying to rebalance its massive economy away from investment and exports when u s president donald trump ordered higher tariffs on chinese imports beginning in 2018 china responded with retaliatory tariffs on u s goods in an ominous sign the imf said beijing might need to unleash fiscal stimulus to avoid a sharp near term growth slowdown that could derail the overarching reform agenda gopinath the imf chief economist said the chinese economy was showing some tentative signs of recovered growth which she described as green shoots reporting by jason lange additional reporting by david lawder editing by andrea ricci paul simao and james dalgleish
neoliberal economic invasion of sl led by u s by prof tissa vitarana courtesy ceylon today bmost people in sri lanka are unhappy sri lanka has dropped from the 116th place to the 130th place in the united nations global happiness index out of 156 countries this year deeply concerned and bewildered by what is going on in our country they keep asking what is happening what is going to happen the ranil wickremesinghe rw administration is breaking down and instead of the promised good governance there is a failure of governance featured by open corruption from the very top waste disregard for the law of the land including the constitution nepotism partisan abuse of state resources and lack of clear and consistent policy decisions leading to a collapse of most utility services the level to which the rw led government has sunk is clear from one example the day light robbery at the central bank which is covered up and not taken up by the financial crimes investigation division fcid set up to take speedy action against financial fraud the fcid has failed to get the evidence even to back up the serious allegations made against the previous regime and is being used mainly to harass and take revenge from rw s political opponents there is a growth of the underworld and an increase in the drug trade with a breakdown of societal values administration and society itself is in a state of virtual chaos the economy too is in deep crisis bordering on bankruptcy prices are soaring incomes are falling personal debt is widespread poverty malnutrition and suicides are on the rise the average economic growth rate has dropped from 7 per cent during the mahinda rajapaksa mr regime to 3 per cent with the rw regime small and medium sized enterprises smes are closing down foreign debt has soared reaching a debt repayment level of us 6 billion for this year and similar levels for the next five years the wrong tax policy where 87 per cent of government income comes from the people 99 per cent and only 13 per cent is from the rich 1 per cent is a major factor causing the adverse foreign trade balance where the cost of imports is double the export earnings the increased demand for us dollars usd has led to more and more foreign borrowing by the rw government and also opened the door for the sale of our assets to multinational corporations mncs which had been banned earlier superficially these appear to be an outcome of mere incompetence and the clash of policies and personalities at the top but they are part of and hide a well thought out and meticulously executed plan that commenced with the foreign plot led by the usa that toppled the mr regime in 2015 and installed a unp slfp unity government really led by rw it is a part of the usa global pattern of regime change to install puppet regimes to implement neoliberal change neoliberalism neoliberalism originated at a meeting of leading capitalist economists held in france in 1947 led by prof milton friedman head of the usa s chicago school of economics among others these ideas were aimed at finding a means of sustainably emerging from the deepening global crisis of capitalism which was affecting the usa and europe worst the basic concept was that state regulation of the economy should be taken over by market forces there should be maximal privatisation of the state sector the development of the individual and private companies maximising their profit should be supported by the state and not impeded in any way any action of the state for the common good that interferes with the advancement of the individual or private company is considered to be against human and fundamental rights in fact these ideas are included in the usa s company law the welfare state must be dismantled and handed to the private sector with globalisation the barriers of the nation state acting in the interest of its people and national economy must be removed to enable the free flow of money goods and services across countries this enables private capital and giant multinational corporations from the usa and europe to freely exploit our resources like in the colonial period without the need to physically occupy our territory what is required is to have a puppet regime in power which will facilitate the implementation of the neoliberal agenda to ensure that this would be done globally the washington consensus was signed in the 1970s between the government of the usa the international monetary fund imf and world bank wb role of usa imf world bank to compel our countries to fall in line with this neoliberal agenda the internal policies should make us fall into a position of increased foreign debt for this our usd outflows should exceed inflows by making sri lanka give up its self sufficiency policy and become import dependent by minimising the tax burden on the rich 24 per cent upper slab they can increase the import of luxuries vehicles and similar items the government is thus forced to take more and more foreign loans and get deeper into debt the imf wb then step in to help with concessionary loans around 6 per cent interest provided we conform with their conditions this includes the complete dismantling of the welfare state and its sale to local and foreign private capital along with this the ban on the sale of land and our national assets to foreigners should be removed the restriction of land holdings to 50 acres must go the door must be opened for the free outflow of profits the unp government has agreed with the imf so that foreign mncs can take over our economy one would expect rw as premier not to allow such a thing to happen but he is also chairman of the asia pacific chapter of conservatives international headed by the republican party of the usa and it this role that he fulfils agreements enable the usa military to make full use of our bases including trincomalee and us troops while here are not bound by sri lankan law but that of the usa the unp has surrendered our independence and sovereignty in addition the proposed labour legislation 12 hour working day saturday half a day with no salary increase will help foreigners to further exploit our workers the draconian counter terrorism act cta will enable the ruling party to establish a police state and stay on in power without elections
the central bank of egypt cbe said its basic interest rates and the inflation forecast have remained consistent with the bank s target downward trend of inflation the cbe explained in its fourth 2018 report on monetary policy issued on monday that its vision includes achieving the target rates of inflation of 9 3 in the fourth quarter of 2020 which was announced in december 2018 after the 13 3 target rate was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018 which was announced in may 2017 the cbe expected the real gdp growth to continue increasing supported by structural reforms even though it was affected by the government measures to control the state s finances it added that an initial surplus of the state s general budget is expected to be 2 of the total gdp in fy 2018 19 compared to an expected surplus of 1 of the gdp in fy 2017 18 and a gdp deficit of 1 8 in fy 2016 17 according to the cbe the general budget deficit is expected to decline to 8 4 and 7 2 of the gdp in fys 2018 19 and 2019 20 respectively compared to 9 8 in fy 2017 18 and 10 9 in fy 2016 17 the overall deficit is expected to continue downwards the cbe noted that brent prices in the future outlook has remained without changes however global petroleum prices remain volatile the cbe expected the cost of the majority of petroleum products to be covered and the automated pricing mechanism to be activated in mid 2019 global prices of food products are also expected to stabilise at the same local consumption rates in 2019 before seeing an increase in 2020 it pointed out that in addition to the developing global prices of basic commodities the development in the economic activity and political and commercial tensions continued to form a risk alongside with the pace of constraining financial situations moreover the volume and timing of the possible measures to control the state s finances and inflation predictions also continued to pose a risk in terms of the local economy the cbe said that liquidity surplus in banks declined in december 2018 for the first time since december 2017 recording an average of egp 717 3bn an equivalent of 13 5 of the total gdp during the retention period ending in december 2018 the cbe also revealed that the rate of yields on new deposits remained relatively stable averaging 12 8 since april 2018 after falling as a result of the cumulative reduction

what caused the financial crisis and great recession a decade later economists still don t have a good answer of course the financial bubble in the housing market was the proximate cause but this begs the question of what inflated the bubble that burst in the first place advertisement this isn t just an academic exercise for the history books it s critical that we never repeat the mistakes that liquidated more than 7 trillion of wealth and sent unemployment rates to their highest levels in three decades the real estate bubble was certainly exacerbated by half witted national housing policies that offered low down payment mortgages with near 100 percent taxpayer guarantees to non credit worthy borrowers the government made it easy for families to buy homes they couldn t afford and when the defaults rolled in the taxpayers picked up the tab but the role of low interest rates and inflationary monetary policy is underappreciated my colleague louis woodhill has crunched the numbers here woodhill finds that from october 2001 to july 2006 the fed inflated and inflated with artificially low interest rates the crb commodity price index which includes everything from aluminum to zinc nearly doubled up 84 percent oil prices more than doubled to almost 75 a barrel these rising prices encouraged americans to invest in inflation hedges like houses the case shiller 20 cities home price index rose in tandem with commodities both peaking in july 2006 then the fed finally noticed the inflation and violently reversed course by raising interest rates pushing the crb index down by 14 percent in just six months this popped the housing bubble for sure but there was no soft landing the fed s shift from inflation to deflation inadvertently crushed the mortgage backed securities markets this made the recession that began in december 2007 inevitable then a second course reversal by the fed in june 2008 created a severe scarcity of dollars that contributed to the collapse of the real economy advertisement recommended if the fed had been watching commodity prices and had held them stable as woodhill and i recommend in a recent wall street journal article these wild gyrations in prices would have been avoided a housing correction might still have happened but the economic carnage would have been limited in a march 27 article in the wall street journal economics columnist greg ip argued that critics of federal reserve chairman jerome powell like woodhill and i are wrong to recommend that the fed keep prices for commodities stable ip asserts that if the fed had been targeting commodity prices in the 2000s this would have made the recession worse by tightening monetary policy in 2008 as the u s slid into its worst recession since the 1930s ip doesn t get it the financial bubble which by the way the wsj editorial page where i worked accurately warned of at the time would have never been allowed to so severely overinflate if the commodity index had been held stable all along the fed would never have gotten itself into a position where it had to finance 1 trillion in bailouts the two decade growth boom from 1983 2000 was characterized by relatively stable commodity prices economists now call this period the great moderation because growth was high and prices flat that is what the fed should be attentive to today other prices e g consumer producer and asset prices should also be closely monitored but stable prices and a stable economy require stable commodities when it comes to inflation commodity prices are the canary in the coal mine because this information is available to policymakers in real time advertisement if the fed targets stable prices on top of the pro growth tax regulatory and energy policies the trump administration has implemented 3 to 4 percent real growth with continued rising wages for workers and low inflation is easily achievable over the next several years at least stephen moore is a senior fellow at the heritage foundation and an economic consultant with freedomworks he is the co author of trumponomics inside the america first plan to revive the american economy

india will retain its record as the world s fastest growing major economy expanding at a rate of 7 3 per cent this fiscal year despite a cut of 0 2 per cent from the projection made in january according to the international monetary fund imf s world economic outlook report released on tuesday this is gita gopinath s first flagship report after she took over this year as the imf s chief economist the outlook report said that india s growth is supported by the continued recovery of investment and robust consumption amid a more expansionary stance of monetary policy and some expected impetus from fiscal policy even though the imf cut the growth projection for this year by 0 2 per cent from the 7 5 per cent made in january it is higher than last year s growth of 7 1 per cent and is projected to increase to 7 5 per cent next year though lower than the earlier 7 7 projection the outlook said the cuts reflect the recent revision to the national account statistics that indicated somewhat softer underlying momentum over the medium term india s growth is expected to stabilise at just under 7 75 per cent based on continued implementation of structural reforms and easing of infrastructure bottlenecks it said the report noted that important steps have been taken to strengthen financial sector balance sheets including through accelerated resolution of nonperforming assets under a simplified bankruptcy framework india however remains a bright spot in a global economy whose growth is expected to be only 3 3 per cent this year down from last year s 3 6 per cent but expected to reach that figure next year the imf growth figures for india are slightly higher than those of the asian development bank adb s outlook report released last wednesday the adb said that india s growth will tick up from 7 per cent last year to 7 2 per cent this year and 7 3 per cent next year fuelled by stronger consumption the recovery in agriculture and stronger domestic demand with reform having strengthened the health of banks and corporations and the domestic firms and products becoming more competitive following the implementation of a value added tax will all help the growth it said according to the imf s outlook report china is on a low growth trajectory as its economy matures it grew by 6 6 per cent last year and is projected to slow down to 6 3 per cent this year and 6 1 next year the united states grew by 2 9 per cent last year and is projected to slow down to 2 3 this year and 1 9 next year the report said fast growing economies like india and china support the aggregate growth for the world in addition to emerging markets and developing economies it noted the report said following a broad based upswing in cyclical growth that lasted nearly two years the global economic expansion decelerated in the second half of 2018 it blamed the slowdown on the trade spat and tariff hikes between the us and china besides a decline in business confidence a tightening of financial conditions and higher policy uncertainty across many economies the imf said that to secure its growth prospects it is essential that india continues to implement structural and financial sector reforms and makes an effort to reduce public debt through continued fiscal consolidation one of the suggestions it made to reduce public debt is to further reduce subsidies which may not be politically palatable other suggestions for india in the outlook include improving the governance of public sector banks reforms to hiring and dismissal regulations to incentivise job creation and absorb the country s large demographic dividend and land reform to facilitate and expedite infrastructure development consumer prices in india increased by 3 5 per cent last year and is projected to increase by 3 9 per cent this year and 4 2 per cent next year it said on the foreign exchange front current account balance has fallen by 2 5 per cent and is projected to go down by 2 5 per cent this year and 2 4 per cent next year arul louis can be reached at arul l ians in and followed on twitter arulouis ians al nir

by jason lange washington reuters the global economy is slowing more than expected and a sharp downturn could require world leaders to coordinate stimulus measures the international monetary fund said on tuesday as it cut its forecast for world economic growth this year the global lender s semi annual world economic report pointed to the u s china trade war and a potentially disorderly british exit from the european union as key risks and warned that chances of further cuts to the outlook were high some major economies including china and germany might need to take short term actions the imf said this is a delicate moment for the global economy imf chief economist gita gopinath said in a news conference to discuss the report governments may need to open their pocketbooks at the same time across economies if the slowdown becomes more serious gopinath said adding that loose monetary policy might also be needed advertisement advertisement the comments provided an eerie warning to the global officials gathering in washington this week for the spring meetings of the imf and world bank the world engaged in coordinated fiscal stimulus to counter the 2008 financial crisis in its third downgrade since october the imf said the global economy will likely grow 3 3 this year the slowest expansion since 2016 the forecast cut 0 2 percentage point from the imf s outlook in january the projected growth rate for next year was unchanged at 3 6 more than two thirds of the expected slowdown in 2019 stems from troubles in rich nations including members of the eu advertisement advertisement in this context avoiding policy missteps that could harm economic activity should be the main priority the imf said in its report one potential misstep lies in britain s indecision over how to leave the eu despite looming deadlines london has not decided how it will try to shield its economy during the exit process the imf s new forecast assumes an orderly brexit but the fund said a chaotic process could shave more than 0 2 percentage point from global growth in 2019 it said the bank of england should be cautious on its interest rate policy an apparent tip to wait before hiking borrowing costs the eu s economic growth is already slowing substantially though the imf said it still expects the slowdown in europe and some emerging market economies will give way to a re acceleration in growth during the second half of 2019 advertisement advertisement the outlook for germany one of the main drivers of european growth suffered from weaker demand for its exports softer consumer spending and new emissions standards that have depressed car sales germany may have to quickly turn to fiscal stimulus measures the imf said also calling on the european central bank to keep stimulating the regional economy the imf also cut japan s growth outlook following a string of natural disasters u s downgrade the u s economy while seen outperforming other rich nations economies also got a downgrade on signs that a fiscal stimulus fuelled by tax cuts was producing less activity than previously expected advertisement advertisement u s treasury yields slid on concerns about the global economic outlook which also weighed on u s stocks the dow jones industrial average index fell 0 7 and the s p 500 and the nasdaq composite both closed about 0 6 lower as the growth forecasts and renewed trade worries sparked by new u s tariff threats on european aircraft and food products weighed on sentiment u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin disputed the imf s assessment that u s growth was slowing and told lawmakers he was not concerned about a recent inversion of the treasury yield curve often a harbinger of recession there s no question that growth outside of the united states whether it be europe or china has slowed significantly mnuchin told a u s house financial services committee hearing from everything we see we see for the next few years still strong robust u s growth china s green shoots advertisement advertisement the imf said it supported the u s federal reserve s decision to pause its rate hiking cycle which the global lender said would support the u s and world economies this year by easing financial conditions the imf raised its forecast for u s growth in 2020 by a tenth of a percentage point to 1 9 the global lender said it was slightly boosting its outlook for chinese growth this year to 6 3 in part because an expected escalation in the u s china trade war had not materialized still america s ongoing tensions with china and other major trading partners continue to cloud the global economy u s tariffs on chinese imports are hitting chinese growth and also weighing on latin america and other parts of the world dependent on chinese demand for commodities advertisement advertisement the imf cut its 2019 growth forecasts for canada and latin america as well as for the middle east and north african countries china was trying to rebalance its massive economy away from investment and exports when u s president donald trump ordered higher tariffs on chinese imports beginning in 2018 china responded with retaliatory tariffs on u s goods in an ominous sign the imf said beijing might need to unleash fiscal stimulus to avoid a sharp near term growth slowdown that could derail the overarching reform agenda gopinath the imf chief

the international monetary fund imf on tuesday warned that global economic growth was slowing more than expected and that a sharp downturn could require world leaders to coordinate stimulus measures the global lender cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2019 and said key risks included a united states china trade war and a potentially disorderly british exit from the european union the imf said it still expects that a sharp slowdown in europe and some emerging market economies will give way to a general re acceleration in the second half of 2019 but chances of further cuts to the outlook are high the fund said in its world economic outlook report already some major economies including china and germany might need to take short term actions the imf said this is a delicate moment for the global economy imf chief economist gita gopinath said in a news conference gopinath said a sharp downturn might require synchronised fiscal stimulus across economies as well as loose monetary policy the imf and world bank are holding their spring meetings in washington this week in its third downgrade since october the imf said the global economy will likely grow 3 3 per cent this year the slowest expansion since 2016 the forecast cut 0 2 percentage point from the imf s outlook in january the projected growth rate for next year was unchanged at 3 6 per cent more than two thirds of the expected slowdown in 2019 owes to trouble in rich nations in this context avoiding policy missteps that could harm economic activity should be the main priority the imf said its report one potential misstep lies in britain s indecision over how to leave the eu despite looming deadlines london has not decided how it will try to shield its economy during the exit process the imf s new forecast assumes an orderly brexit but the fund said a chaotic process could shave more than 0 2 percentage points from global growth in 2019 the imf said the bank of england should be cautious on its interest rate policy an apparent tip to wait before hiking borrowing costs the eu s economic growth is already slowing substantially and the slowdown accounted for much of the reduction in the global growth forecast germany s outlook suffered from weaker demand for its exports softer consumer spending and new emissions standards that have depressed car sales germany may have to quickly turn to fiscal stimulus measures the imf said also calling on the european central bank to keep stimulating the regional economy the imf also cut japan s growth outlook following a string of natural disasters the us economy while seen outperforming other rich nations also got a downgrade on signs that a fiscal stimulus fueled by tax cuts was producing less activity than previously expected us treasury yields slid on concerns about the global economic outlook while the s p 500 index spx and the dow jones industrial index were down more than half a per cent amid worries that a us threat to slap tariffs on hundreds of european goods would be a further economic drag boost from fed pause the imf said it supported the us federal reserve s decision to pause its rate hiking cycle which the global lender said would support the us and world economies this year by easing financial conditions the imf raised its forecast for us growth in 2020 by a tenth of a percentage point to 1 9 per cent the global lender said it was slightly boosting its outlook for chinese growth this year to 6 3 per cent in part because an expected escalation in the us china trade war did not materialise still america s ongoing tensions with china and other major trading partners remain a risk for the global economy us tariffs on chinese imports are hitting chinese growth and also weighing on latin america and other areas dependent on chinese demand for commodities in a world economic outlook chapter released last week the imf said an escalation of the us china trade war would drive manufacturing away from both countries and cause job losses but would do little to change their total trade balances if 25 per cent tariffs were imposed on all trade between the world s two largest economies us gdp would fall by up to 0 6 per cent and china s would fall by up to 1 5 per cent the imf said the imf also cut its 2019 growth forecasts for canada and latin america as well as for the middle east and north african countries china was trying to re balance its massive economy away from investment and exports when us president donald trump ordered higher tariffs on chinese imports beginning in 2018 china responded with retaliatory tariffs on us goods in an ominous sign the imf said beijing might need to unleash fiscal stimulus to avoid a sharp near term growth slowdown that could derail the overarching reform agenda but gopinath the imf chief economist said the chinese economy was already showing some signs of recovered growth which she described as green shoots
india is heading towards national elections asking abki baar kiski sarkar whose government are the people going to get modi or gandhi gri s acting editor in chief analyses the potential outcomes of the elections india s mahatyohar the world s largest democracy is only days away from partaking in what the indian election commission terms desh ka mahatyohar this is the country s great festival its general elections 900 million eligible voters from across 29 states and 7 union territories will decide whether pm narendra modi and his bharatiya janata party bjp return to another 5 years in power or perhaps whether the opposition indian national congress inc which governed the country for decades after independence stages a comeback india follows a westminster style parliamentary model where candidates are elected to the lower house or lok sabha there are 543 seats to be contested with 272 being the majority needed to form a government there will be 1 million polling stations and 7 phases of voting across 5 weeks to undertake this mammoth endeavour results will be declared on may 23rd contenders and contentions this general election can ultimately be termed as pm modi versus rahul gandhi 2 0 the first version saw modi surge to an empathetic win he used a strong stance on corruption and terrorism to ride an anti incumbency wave and come to power in 2014 using him as the face of the party bjp won a majority of 282 lok sabha seats 336 including partners this is an unprecedented margin for over 30 years in indian politics since grand coalition governance had been the norm while pm modi has pursued a development centric agenda his party has also exploited nationalist sentiments among the hindu majority and polarised minorities many former supporters and party members insist that his promises of kickstarting the economy and addressing inequality have failed they are critical of modi s non inclusive decision making style and his claims of success being far removed from the actual ground realities therefore the overwhelming narrative of bjp easily returning to power has recently been challenged a series of events has made the upcoming elections a closer contest than most expected gandhi is a scion of india s most influential political dynasty his father and grandmother were both prime ministers his great grandfather jawaharlal nehru was one of the founding fathers of modern india and also a prime minister he is using modi s failure on the economic front to reinvent his party s relevance and popularity gandhi claims this election will determine whether indian democracy will remain as we know it or not this is because the bjp is subverting the constitution s stress on secularism and attempting to turn it into a hindu state there has been a sharp increase in the violence against minorities and the pm has always been slow in condemning these attacks indian economy reforms and growth having beaten china india remains the fastest growing economy in the world it has grown by 1 trillion under pm modi since 2014 and enjoys a per capita income increase of 35 during the same period flagship government policies such as make in india aggressively courted foreign direct investment 2018 reported 45 billion in fdi almost double the amount from 2014 this saw india jump 65 positions higher in the ease of doing business index the most notable improvement recorded by the world bank this is an acceleration in the trend of opening up the country after decades of inward looking practices these reforms set the tone for the short to medium term about the direction of economic policy india is looking to open more sectors aviation defence retail to fdi and not returning to previous protectionist measures this is particularly significant given the international financial uncertainty exacerbated by america s erratic approach towards china and the european union india offers a huge market with a growing middle class that is open to foreign investment and is an alternative to a slowing chinese economy furthermore there have been structural reforms to strengthen fiscal health taxation revenue has increased given that combined direct and indirect taxes have climbed from 10 14 of gdp in 2013 14 to 12 13 over 18 19 this is a very consequential increase in a 5 year period and indicates the growing presence of the formal economy indian economy problems and constraints the country has seen its share of shocks under modi s tenure most worryingly unemployment data suggests it is the highest in the last 4 decades reaching 6 1 india needs to create 1 million jobs a month to keep at pace with its working class population however over 11 million jobs were lost in 2018 this is a disturbing trend because 84 of these job losses were in rural india as a result the most vulnerable women uneducated wage farm labourers and small traders were inordinately impacted this base formed the core of modi s support and failure of job creation could potentially cost him the election it has also caused rural disenchantment about his ability to bring about lasting economic benefits for the lower and middle classes additionally bjp introduced a sweeping tax change to bring uniformity for businesses across the country while in the long term this is a necessity for fiscal prudence the short term disturbances have been numerous the rollout of this goods and services tax gst is ridden with complications smaller businesses unarguably form the majority of the business ecosystem in india these were worst hit by their lack of infrastructure to cope with the demands of gst as a result this affected the economy enough to slow down growth from 8 2 to 6 6 in 2018 the electorate is more likely to vote based on these current interferences than the overtime benefits of the scheme moreover modi stunned the country by abruptly banning the two highest denomination banknotes in circulation these accounted for 86 of india s cash while the goal was to curb black money and stop illegal funds from hampering the formal economy it wreaked havoc bjp failed to take into account that the informal sector is still the dominant faction in the country a move towards digitalisation cannot singularly be achieved by starving a cash dependent economy in the medium term this error in cash ban has outweighed the public opinion on other efficient policies undertaken by the government the most vulnerable sections of society are worst hit by these moves and are still reeling from the impacts are the farmers happy no in india the role that farmers have to play in elections is all important in 2014 almost 50 of all land owning farmers voted for the bjp based on promises of having their income doubled and loans waived off this was an exceptional achievement because farmer votes are usually divided between regional parties and caste vote banks therefore they rarely consolidate for one national party unfortunately 92 6 million farming households in the country are in vicious debt cycles over 300 000 farmers have committed suicide in the last 20 years these numbers suggest that governments would have taken the peasantry crisis front and centre in their policies yet no sustainable long term solutions exist to ease these economic burdens on them this creates an imminent socio economic and political risk for the country along the lines of inequality and deprivation from the benefits of growth the disappointment at the failure of modi s schemes adds additional risks because people feel cheated a 16 million strong union of farmers has staged 4 mega protests against the bjp government demanding an increase in minimum support prices for crops this turn from support base to opposition is a serious obstacle for the incumbent party s efforts of coming back to power the farmers abandoning the modi wave will most likely be the dominant reason in the bjp not reaching majority alone in 2019 is the indian national congress staging a comeback most likely the prime accusation of pm modi against inc and the gandhi s has been that of corruption in the wake of multi billion dollar scams the electorate voted them out of power in 2014 however leading up to the 2019 contest the grand old party of india seems to be making a comeback its leader rahul gandhi has been asking tough questions about the government s role in allegedly helping private business houses and compromising national security modi s image as an honest politician tackling black money and corruption has taken a hit after this uproar over defence signings with france on the rafale fighter jets the inc managed to win 3 important state elections in 2018 supporters claim this is the beginning of their resurgence this new swing in state elections indicates voters are unhappy with the non materialisation of economic assurances on a grand scale though these states were bjp bastions it is important to note that the inc won 2 states by very slender margins rajasthan and chhattisgarh and its vote share was the same as the bjp s in the 3rd madhya pradesh therefore voters are not entirely convinced about the inc to gather momentum gandhi promised income support of rs 72 000 1040 every year for the poorest 20 families in the country he claimed to have studied the fiscal implications of this policy termed nyay which translates to justice in hindi populist measures before elections is a common theme in india the fiscal im prudence of this announcement is still being assessed abki baar kiski sarkar the official slogan of bjp s 2014 campaign was abki baar modi sarkar modi s government this time but whose government does india get in 2019 speculating on the upcoming results it is highly likely that pm modi will return to power with bjp winning between 200 220 seats his popularity has seen a sharp increase after the recent military showdown with pakistan retaliating against attacks in india by targeting terror camps in pakistan he has set the precedence for taking definitive military action before this india did not have a strategic response to deal with these assaults given its popularity with the public it will be next to impossible for the incoming government to go back to the previous status quo of not responding with surgical strikes bjp s hardline stance on terror has shifted the narrative from jobs farmers and the rafale deal to strong national security however this is not enough it is improbable given the above mentioned points that modi returns with an absolute majority of the bjp unlike last time he will have to concede more to regional parties in order to form a steady coalition and stake claim for government formation the inc is likely to mark a comeback and improve from their dismal showing in 2014 where they mustered only 44 mps the country is poised to have a stronger opposition this will create problems to the certainty of passing legislation something the bjp enjoyed over the past 5 years while the predictability that a majority government brings will be welcomed by the electorate and investors alike it is important to note that a strong opposition is necessary for the strength of any democracy
erdogan pays the price for combative foreign policy dr abdel aziz aluwaisheg supporters of the opposition republican people s party chp celebrate in ankara reuters turkey s local elections held on march 31 delivered unmistakable messages to president recep tayyip erdogan and his justice and development party akp according to press reports the akp lost nine provinces leaving it in control of only 39 out of 81 a 19 percent decrease by contrast the main opposition party gained seven new provinces for a total of 21 a 50 percent increase while kurdish parties also registered significant gains conspicuously the opposition gained control of turkey s largest cities istanbul and ankara in addition to izmir the voters appeared to be calling for a reassessment if not a reset of government policies they made a clear statement on the need to set limits on the power of the country s leaders in particular the polls were an object lesson in the close relationship between politics and economics although by definition local elections are driven by economic issues turkey s economic performance has been greatly influenced negatively by security crackdowns at home and a combative foreign policy the costly ventures of going after kurdish nationalists with no holds barred in syria and elsewhere and uncompromising positions toward the kurds at home have left a clear impression on investors to them they are indicators that unrest may continue on turkey s southern border and in kurdish majority areas within turkey there is considerable uncertainty among investors due to the crackadown on political opposition ever since the failed coup of 2016 including the detention and dismissal of thousands from the civil service the judiciary and security forces the state of press freedom has also scared away outside investors according to the committee to protect journalists turkey continues to jail more journalists than any other country on the planet with at least 68 in prison for their work at the end of last year in addition the government has closed down scores of news outlets and detained writers and peaceful activists accusations of nepotism corruption and shady deals have also affected the business climate reports in the us about sanctions being busted by entities close to turkey s leadership have had negative consequences announcements in turkey that it would not abide by american sanctions against iran have made international businesses nervous lest they become targeted by the us for violating those sanctions diplomatic spats with nato allies such as germany and the netherlands make foreign investors hesitate about expanding their exposure in turkey ankara s growing relations with iran and russia are also causes for concern for those investors especially in light of us fears should turkey go ahead and install advanced russian missiles although by definition local elections are driven by economic issues turkey s economic performance has been greatly influenced negatively by security crackdowns at home and a combative foreign policy abdel aziz aluwaisheg these changes in the business climate have made a clear impact on turkey s economic performance while the decline predated the failed coup in 2016 it has accelerated since gross domestic product gdp the overall measure of economic activity has fallen sharply and the per capita income of average citizens has declined by about 25 percent over the past five years inflation and unemployment are in the double digits last summer the turkish lira lost 40 percent of its value against the us dollar thus increasing the cost of imports and consequently domestic prices although the devalued currency should have benefited exports turkey s trade deficit is widening not shrinking international reserves have also fallen about 25 percent in five years much of this damage to the economy and turkey s regional and international standing is self inflicted picking fights with close allies weakening turkey s military alliance with nato and the us helping iran evade sanctions and turning a blind eye to tehran s malign activities in syria the economic consequences of these apparently impulsive steps have ruffled the international business community which is traditionally hypersensitive to uncertainty and political risk expectations it was almost inevitable with these changes that turkey entered into recession last month experiencing its worst performance since 2008 with an overall gdp decline of 3 percent annualized and turkish industry suffering a fifth straight monthly decline an international monetary fund imf official warned that there is a significant slowdown in the turkish economy and the government needs to respond immediately and accurately to this problem during the week following the local elections the turkish press reported that there were high fluctuations in exchange rates interest rates and on the stock market particularly after the central bank limited the turkish lira supply to overseas markets to thwart another de facto depreciation in the currency in overseas swap markets alarmed by these jitters turkey s treasury and finance minister berat albayrak sought to reassure declaring that the country was going to enter a normalization process following the march 31 municipal elections turkey will probably need that normalization process but it may need outside help although turkey has in the past ruled out intervention by the imf any prospective bailout may not be forthcoming without support from key countries such as the us and germany turkey s allies may want to see a moderation in its foreign policy before making the necessary efforts to help it out of the economic recession it has just plunged into abdel aziz

the 75th anniversary of the bretton woods agreement is a good time to rethink the role the institutions created at the time should play in today s world in the case of the imf there are four central issues to consider the global reserve system the way international liquidity is provided managing the macroeconomic linkages among different economies including the exchange rate system balance of payments crisis prevention and resolution including in the first case rules for capital account management and improving governance of the international monetary system to develop a more inclusive system and appropriate links between the imf and regional and interregional monetary arrangements i e the design of the global financial safety net reforms efforts in all of these areas should take

look at the first of these issues the broader agenda has been discussed by eichengreen 2008 kenen 2001 williamson 2007 2010 among others and in my recent book ocampo 2017 from which this column borrows as we know the original bretton woods monetary system collapsed in the early 1970s when the us unilaterally abandoned the dual gold us dollar hereafter just dollar standard the major developed countries failed to adopt a new stable system of exchange rate parities and imf members were unable to agree on a new international monetary system in the committee of twenty negotiations that took place in 1972 74 williamson 1977 the system that evolved in an ad hoc manner as a non system to use the terminology of the 1970s had a global reserve system essentially based on an inconvertible fiduciary dollar but open in principle to competition from other reserve currencies and the freedom for each country to choose the exchange rate regime they chose as long as they avoided manipulating their exchange rates a term that has never been clearly defined the basic deficiencies of this system have been identified in a sequential way in the global policy debate the first underscored by keynes 1942 43 is the asymmetric adjustment problem the strong pressure that deficit countries face to reduce their payment imbalances versus the weak pressure that surplus countries experience to do so this generates a global recessionary effect during crises the second problem is associated with the use of a national currency as the major international currency this is widely known as the triffin dilemma triffin 1961 1968 the essential problem according to his original formulation is that the provision of international liquidity requires that the country supplying the reserve currency run balance of payments deficits a fact that could eventually erode the confidence in that currency additional implications of the current dependence on the fiduciary dollar is that the stability of the system may be inconsistent with the monetary policy objectives of the major reserve issuing country padoa schioppa 2011 and that the currency at the centre of the system has an unstable value the third flaw is the inequity bias generated by the need of developing countries to self insure against the volatility in external financing through the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves this generates an inequity because reserves are invested in safe industrial countries assets i e they are nothing else than lending to rich countries at low interest rates furthermore it contributes to the generation of global imbalances there are two alternative ways to reform this system the first and in a sense inertial solution is to let the system evolve into what it potentially could be namely a multicurrency arrangement the basic advantage of this route is that it allows reserve holders to diversify the composition of their foreign exchange reserve assets and thus to counteract the instability that characterises all individual currencies however diversification has been limited in practice as the network externalities have continued to favour the use of the dollar as the major international currency largely as a result of the fact that there is no alternative to the market for us treasury securities in terms of liquidity and depth prasad 2014 furthermore aside from diversification a multicurrency arrangement would not address any of the other deficiencies of the system this arrangement can be improved by introducing elements that enhance the capacity of exchange rates to contribute to correcting global imbalances and to provide a reasonable level of stability the best suggestion in this regard would be a system of reference rates among major currencies which was initially suggested by ethier and bloomfield 1975 and later on by williamson 2007 among others this implies that currencies and particularly major currencies would be subject to some form of managed floating around multilaterally agreed parities or bands interventions in foreign exchange markets and other macroeconomic policies would reinforce depreciation if the currency is perceived to be overvalued and appreciation if it is undervalued such an intervention rule would provide an implicit definition of what manipulating the exchange rate means i e encouraging exchange rate movements in the opposite direction to the agreed rate or band the second reform route would be to enhance the role of the only truly global reserve asset that the world has created the special drawing rights sdrs at least partially approaching the aspirations that were included in the reform of the imf articles of agreement in 1969 of making the special drawing right the principle reserve asset in the international monetary system article viii section 7 and article xxii a more active use of this instrument should preferably make sdr allocations in a counter cyclical way camdessus 2000 ocampo 2017 chapter 2 this was the criterion followed in the last and largest issue in history that of 2009 by the equivalent of 250 billion dollars the amounts issued through time should of course be proportional to the global demand for reserves most estimates indicate that average allocations for the equivalent of 200 300 billion a year would be reasonable but even this size of allocation would only marginally increase the share of sdrs in non gold reserves this indicates that sdrs would still largely complement other reserve assets this is why this alternative would be complementary with a multicurrency standard a more active use of sdrs would mitigate several problems in the current system first the seignorage would accrue to all imf members second by issuing sdrs in a counter cyclical way it can contribute to reducing the recessionary bias associated with the asymmetric adjustment problem third sdr allocations could reduce the need for precautionary reserve accumulation by developing countries the most ambitious reform in this area would be to finance all imf lending with sdrs thus making global monetary creation similar to how central banks create domestic money this would involve counter cyclical allocations of sdrs that help fund counter cyclical imf financing this would follow the proposals made by the imf economist jacques polak 1979 of making the imf a fully sdr based institution the simplest alternative would be to treat the sdrs not used by countries as deposits in or lending to the imf that could then be used by the institution to lend to countries in need ocampo 2017 chapters 2 and 7 this would require eliminating the division in the imf between what general resources and the sdr accounts polak 2005 part ii following the discussions of the 1960s there are also ways of including a development link in sdr allocations which would take into account the fact that developing countries have to accumulate reserves as self insurance williamson 2010 has proposed allocating a certain proportion to developing countries around 80 and then assigning the shares in the allocation among individual developing and high income countries according to imf quotas many authors have also suggested that there could also be a broader use of sdrs in international capital markets cooper 2010 eichengreen 2007 but as the imf has recently underscored the market sdrs are less important than the more active use of them as reserve assets imf 2018 for these reasons it may be better again to think of a mixed system in which national or regional currencies continue to play the major role in private transactions and the sdrs continue to perform the functions of reserve asset and medium of exchange in transactions among central banks a mixed system would be politically more acceptable for the issuers of reserve currencies particularly to the us under a system that mixes sdrs with a multicurrency arrangement a substitution account should be created allowing central banks to exchange for sdrs other reserve assets they do not want to hold this alternative was suggested by bergsten 2007 before the 2008 09 global crisis going back to proposals that have been made since the 1970s this instrument could also be seen as a transition mechanism of an ambitious reform effort kenen 2010 the essential issue is how to distribute the potential costs of this mechanism the problem that blocked its adoption three decades ago the use of sdrs to finance imf programmes would also help consolidate the reforms of the credit lines that have been introduced during the recent global crisis particularly the creation of contingency credit lines especially the flexible credit line including the short term liquidity swap recently proposed by the imf imf 2017 it would also eliminate the need for the imf to get financing from its members in the form of arrangements to borrow or bilateral credit lines in fact it would equally eliminate the need to make additional quota increases though quotas would still have to be agreed to determine the size of access to imf facilities as well as voting rights references bergsten f 2007 how to solve the problem of

united nations april 9 india will retain its record as the world s fastest growing major economy expanding at a rate of 7 3 per cent this fiscal year despite a cut of 0 2 per cent from the projection made in january according to the international monetary fund imf s world economic outlook report released on tuesday this is gita gopinath s first flagship report after she took over this year as the imf s chief economist the outlook report said that india s growth is supported by the continued recovery of investment and robust consumption amid a more expansionary stance of monetary policy and some expected impetus from fiscal policy even though the imf cut the growth projection for this year by 0 2 per cent from the 7 5 per cent made in january it is higher than last year s growth of 7 1 per cent and is projected to increase to 7 5 per cent next year though lower than the earlier 7 7 projection the outlook said the cuts reflect the recent revision to the national account statistics that indicated somewhat softer underlying momentum over the medium term india s growth is expected to stabilise at just under 7 75 per cent based on continued implementation of structural reforms and easing of infrastructure bottlenecks it said the report noted that important steps have been taken to strengthen financial sector balance sheets including through accelerated resolution of nonperforming assets under a simplified bankruptcy framework india however remains a bright spot in a global economy whose growth is expected to be only 3 3 per cent this year down from last year s 3 6 per cent but expected to reach that figure next year the imf growth figures for india are slightly higher than those of the asian development bank adb s outlook report released last wednesday the adb said that india s growth will tick up from 7 per cent last year to 7 2 per cent this year and 7 3 per cent next year fuelled by stronger consumption the recovery in agriculture and stronger domestic demand with reform having strengthened the health of banks and corporations and the domestic firms and products becoming more competitive following the implementation of a value added tax will all help the growth it said according to the imf s outlook report china is on a low growth trajectory as its economy matures it grew by 6 6 per cent last year and is projected to slow down to 6 3 per cent this year and 6 1 next year the united states grew by 2 9 per cent last year and is projected to slow down to 2 3 this year and 1 9 next year the report said fast growing economies like india and china support the aggregate growth for the world in addition to emerging markets and developing economies it noted the report said following a broad based upswing in cyclical growth that lasted nearly two years the global economic expansion decelerated in the second half of 2018 it blamed the slowdown on the trade spat and tariff hikes between the us and china besides a decline in business confidence a tightening of financial conditions and higher policy uncertainty across many economies the imf said that to secure its growth prospects it is essential that india continues to implement structural and financial sector reforms and makes an effort to reduce public debt through continued fiscal consolidation one of the suggestions it made to reduce public debt is to further reduce subsidies which may not be politically palatable other suggestions for india in the outlook include improving the governance of public sector banks reforms to hiring and dismissal regulations to incentivise job creation and absorb the country s large demographic dividend and land reform to facilitate and expedite infrastructure development consumer prices in india increased by 3 5 per cent last year and is projected to increase by 3 9 per cent this year and 4 2 per cent next year it said on the foreign exchange front current account balance has fallen by 2 5 per cent and is projected to go down by 2 5 per cent this year and 2 4 per cent next year arul louis can be reached at arul l ians in and followed on twitter arulouis
the international monetary fund imf has also tempered its growth forecast for the philippines this year in the face of a projected drop in world output in its world economic outlook weo report published on tuesday the imf now sees the philippine economy growing by 6 5 this year slower than the 6 6 forecast given in 2018 this mirrors scaled down estimates given by other multilateral organizations earlier this month and falls within the government s lowered 6 7 target the growth pace also compares to 2018 s 6 2 expansion the imf s estimate matches the rate given by the united nations economic and social commission for asia and the pacific un escap and is faster than the downward revised 6 4 forecast given by the world bank and the asian development bank last week it also compares with 6 5 this year and 6 4 next year given last january by the un department of economic and social affairs the un conference on trade and development and the five un regional commissions including un escap in their joint world economic prospects 2019 report the other multilateral bodies cited stronger growth in private consumption amid slower inflation even as they cautioned some easing in government spending given delays in enactment of the p3 757 trillion 2019 budget according to the imf the philippines will remain a growth leader in the region alongside vietnam among the asean 5 growth for the sub region which also includes indonesia malaysia and thailand has been retained at 5 1 this year and 5 2 for 2020 beating the trend as most forecasts were slashed however this will mean that growth will ease from 2018 s 5 2 the philippines will later on emerge as the fastest growing in the group with the imf pencilling in a 6 6 climb in 2020 demand conditions are seen assisted by softer inflation with overall price increases seen softening to 3 8 from last year s 5 2 next year inflation is seen to drop further to 3 3 both well within the central bank s 2 4 target meanwhile the country s current account balance is seen at a narrower deficit from an equivalent of 2 6 to gross domestic product gdp the gap is expected to narrow to 2 2 of gdp this year and then to 1 8 of gdp next year for the rest of the world the imf is seeing a rebound in market sentiment following some easing in the tight financial conditions experienced late 2018 as many central banks raised interest rates then however concerns about a global slowdown persist industrial production figures and surveys of purchasing managers suggest that the slower momentum in global growth during the second half of 2018 is likely to continue in early 2019 the global lender said global growth is seen easing to 3 3 down from the january forecast of 3 5 and slower than the 3 6 climb posted in 2018 however world output is seen to bounce back to 3 6 in 2020 the retreat in part reflects the anticipated negative effects of the tariff increases enacted in 2018 the imf said referring to the unresolved trade tensions between the united states and china coupled with the unwinding of their fiscal stimulus for the euro area growth is seen slowing amid softer household spending and prolonged uncertainty about the united kingdom s exit from the european union growth among advanced economies is seen easing to 1 8 from 2 2 last year while expansion of emerging markets is seen softer at 4 4 from the 4 5 estimate under the latest weo update over the medium term the imf sees global growth hitting a plateau at 3 6 as advanced economies see softer expansion while emerging markets stabilize the medium term growth forecast incorporates continued strong investment growth in emerging market and developing economies accounting for more than one third of their gdp growth rate during the projection horizon the report also read during the imf s annual health check on the philippines in 2018 its team confirmed strong economic performance despite rising inflation and a less favorable external environment melissa luz t lopez
you can now subscribe to our you can now subscribe to our economic times whatsapp channel describing current global economic atmosphere as a delicate moment imf chief economist gita gopinath tuesday said that while the global economy continues to grow at a reasonable rate and a global recession is not in the baseline projections there are many downside risks beyond 2020 global growth is expected to stabilise at around 3 5 per cent bolstered mainly by growth in china and india and their increasing weights in world income she said in a blog post ahead of the annual spring meeting of the international monetary fund and the world bank growth in emerging market and developing economies will stabilize at five per cent though with considerable variance as emerging asia continues to grow faster than other regions a similar pattern holds for low income countries with some particularly commodity importers growing rapidly but others falling further behind the advanced world in per capita terms the indian american economist said while the global economy continues to grow at a reasonable rate and a global recession is not in the baseline projections there are many downside risks gopinath said tensions in trade policy could flare up again and play out in other areas such as the auto industry with large disruptions to global supply chains she cautioned growth in systemic economies such as the euro area and china may surprise on the downside and the risks surrounding brexit remain heightened a deterioration in market sentiment could rapidly tighten financing conditions in an environment of large private and public sector debt in many countries including sovereign bank doom loop risks gopinath warned given these risks she argued it is imperative that costly policy mistakes are avoided policymakers need to work cooperatively to help ensure that policy uncertainty doesn t weaken investment she said fiscal policy will need to manage trade offs between supporting demand protecting social spending and ensuring that public debt remains on a sustainable path with the optimal mix depending on country specific circumstances financial sector policies must address vulnerabilities proactively by deploying macroprudential tools such as counter cyclical capital buffers a task made more urgent by the possibility that interest rates will remain low for longer monetary policy should remain data dependent be well communicated and ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored she said across all economies the imperative is to take actions that boost potential output improve inclusiveness and strengthen resilience the top imf economist said there is a need for greater multilateral cooperation to resolve trade conflicts to address climate change and risks from cybersecurity and to improve the effectiveness of international taxation she said this is a delicate moment for the global economy if the downside risks do not materialize and the policy support put in place is effective global growth should rebound gopinath said if however any of the major risks materialize then the expected recoveries in stressed economies export dependent economies and highly indebted economies may be derailed in that case policymakers will need to adjust she added
besnik pula globalization under and after socialism the evolution of transnational capital in central and eastern europe stanford stanford university press 2018 272 pp 65 00 cloth isbn 978 1 5036 0513 8 reviewed by tobias rupprecht university of exeter published on h diplo april 2019 commissioned by seth offenbach bronx community college the city university of new york cross posted from h diplo a common narrative about eastern europe s globalization starts with the political changes of 1989 first the new political and economic elites shelved communism then they re entered the world economy scholars who studied this transition no longer bothered much with socialism which they often saw as exogenous to the region s post 1989 history socialism was seen in opposition to a market economy and its legacies as roadblocks to overcome while neoliberal globalization was imported from the outside besnik pula political scientist at virginia tech questions this view in his book globalization under and after socialism based on numerous interviews with institutional actors from five east european countries some historical archival documents and a lot of economic data he argues that eastern european states were forced to react with institutional reforms to a stagnating postwar statist model of development some of them integrated their economies into international value chains as early as the 1970s eastern europe s globalization had its roots in reform socialism and the different paths taken under socialism impinged on postsocialist political economies pula engages mostly with political science literature and seems to strike a balance between the functionalism of the varieties of capitalism school and institutional economics while expanding the analysis chronologically to include late socialism as a historian i do not feel competent to judge the book s theoretical merits from the point of view of historiography his argument is certainly convincing if not entirely novel in a recent research review james mark and i have surveyed what has already become a burgeoning field on state socialism in global history after socialist eastern europe was left out of academic debates on pre 1989 globalization socialism has been reintegrated into the history of modern globalization in two different ways as a rather passive victim of a much more competitive global capitalism on the one hand and as an active co producer of globalization on the other while pula does not address the contested question of the interplay of globalization and the collapse of socialist polities and overall focuses more on the industrial sector than the state his account is a felicitous combination of the two strands he demonstrates how some socialist countries started attracting foreign direct investments fdis and encouraged collaboration with emerging transnational corporations tncs creating paths that shaped economic developments in the 1990s presenting quantitative economic data to show how increasing foreign trade within the council for mutual economic assistance comecon from the 1960s had been important for eastern europe s industrialization pula also argues that socialist modernization was initially more successful than is usually acknowledged to this end he contrasts eastern european gdp growth rates with those of latin american countries yet to gauge the importance of comecon integration for the success of industrialization perhaps a more insightful comparison would have been one between different socialist countries comecon focused ones versus those like the german democratic republic yugoslavia or romania which always traded much more with capitalist western europe i was also missing a discussion of gdp figures which are notoriously problematic for eastern europe even if we trust official data in a planned economy they still are no indicators of a successful economy as they only quantify production not what is actually received by the population but pula does not push this argument too far and readily acknowledges that these highly regulated economies soon reached their institutional limits which led to the reorientation in the 1970s the end of extensive growth rising energy costs easy access to credits from petrodollar swamped western banks and western interest in expanding trade to boost their own crisis struck economies made most eastern european states turn to import led growth pula recapitulates a familiar narrative here but occasionally i thought that the role of eastern europe as co creator rather than victim of globalization could have been pointed out more he presents eastern europe and the ussr as borrowers in the eurodollar market suggesting that high external debt contributed to the undermining of these economies true for some eastern european states such as poland and hungary but did not the ussr actually help create that market in the first place moving its foreign assets from the us to europe to protect it from confiscation and then after the oil crisis parking its own raising hard currency oil incomes in london and paris per capita foreign debt in the soviet union remained low until perestroika and by the time of its breakup the ussr was actually an international net creditor yet without hope to see again much of the loans given to its third world allies globalization is defined in the book as the post bretton woods structural changes in the global economy characterized by expansion of world trade an even greater expansion of international finance and the rise of tncs but one could argue that globalization is not only about fdis and tncs it is also about international organizations and the circulation of people and ideas other scholars of eastern europe s globalization are studying socialist states membership in international monetary fund and world bank the global movements of its ever worldlier elites and their ideas especially their economic ideologies and are thus creating narratives that give a more active role to eastern european actors in this process pula goes to some lengths to explain why czechoslovakia where all economic reforms were halted after 1968 and hardly any fdis came into the country still developed along similar patterns as its east european neighbors after 1989 but there is not much of a discussion of people and their ideas which i think go a long way in explaining the similarities among post 1989 developments in prague warsaw budapest or tallinn riga and vilnius which are not discussed in the book many of the new men in charge of economic policies received training by the imf in the 1980s studied at western universities were part of international academic communities and read the same literature some among them the czechoslovak economist vaclav klaus were members of neoliberal think tanks such as the mont p√®lerin society while i agree that 1970s connections led to a legacy of ties with tncs in some socialist countries that mattered in the 1990s i do not think that this devaluates other accounts that focus on economic policies post 1989 and cultural or social ties with the west they clearly mattered too toward the end of the book pula refines his argument and is very careful to avoid any suggestion of a determined development pointing at contingencies throughout over time he shows convincingly in his study of the second wave of economic reform in the late 1990s and early 2000s legacies mattered less and economic policies mattered more across the region states turned to more fdi and export orientation and this now also included the czech republic slovakia and the latecomers romania and bulgaria obviously motivated by the prospect of eu accession pula distinguishes between three different roles that eastern european states assumed in international commodity chains for tncs as assembly platforms intermediate producers or a combination of both and argues that for the former where transnational production remained largely isolated from the broader local economy the attraction of more fdi has not led to an increase in know how and will potentially create problems in their future economic development pula has written a carefully researched and very nuanced study of the international integration of eastern european companies with the convincing argument that development strategies of postsocialist elites had much to do with legacies of socialist economic policies and institutional outcomes of economic restructuring and reorientation pula has clearly established that there were economic roots of globalization in eastern europe before 1989 non social scientist readers might struggle a bit with the theoretical sections of the text and wish for more discussion of those people who actually decided on and lived through these economic reforms it will be for others to complement these aspects of the pre 1989 history of eastern europe s globalization and to

you are here washington april 9 xinhua the international monetary fund imf on tuesday lowered its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3 3 percent in the newly released world economic outlook weo report down 0 2 percentage point from its estimation in january the imf said the world economy faces downside risks brought by potential uncertainties in the ongoing global trade tensions as well as other country and sector specific factors the 3 3 percent projection for 2019 is 0 3 percentage point below the 2018 figure followed by an expected return to 3 6 percent in 2020 growth rate projections for advanced economies are 1 8 percent for 2019 and 1 7 percent for 2020 both below the 2 percent plus rates recorded in the previous two years according to the weo report for emerging market and developing economies the imf predicted a growth rate down to 4 4 percent for 2019 0 1 percentage point lower than in 2018 and that expansion will rebound to a rate of 4 8 percent in 2020 leveling the 2017 outcome imf chief economist gita gopinath wrote in a blog post that the projected slowdown in 2019 is broad based it reflects negative revisions for several major economies including the euro area latin america the united states the united kingdom canada and australia gopinath said the loss of growth momentum said gopinath dates back to the second half of 2018 when the world economy was hit by a significantly weakened global expansion the weo report said global growth remained strong at 3 8 percent in the first half of 2018 but dropped to 3 2 percent in the second half gopinath blamed the situation largely on trade tensions between the united states and its trading partners macroeconomic stress in argentina and turkey disruptions to the auto sector in germany and financial tightening alongside normalization of monetary policy in the larger advanced economies with respect to the perceived recovery in 2020 the economist said it is precarious adding that it is based on the assumption that a rebound occurs in emerging market and developing economies gopinath said the uptick is supported by significant monetary policy accommodation by major economies made possible by the absence of inflationary pressures despite growing at near potential she also cited a shift toward a more accommodative stance in central bank policies of the united states the european union eu japan and britain plus china ramping up its fiscal and monetary stimulus as well as a positive outlook for a u s china agreement to resolve their trade disputes these policy responses gopinath said have helped reverse the tightening financial conditions to varying degrees across countries featuring ongoing trends in the emerging markets such as a resumption of portfolio flows a decline in sovereign borrowing costs and a strengthening of their currencies relative to the u s dollar the weo report expected growth rates in the euro zone to be 1 3 percent in 2019 and 1 5 percent in 2020 both lower than the 2018 and 2017 results eu wide downside risks include a protracted period of elevated yields in italy the rising possibility of britain leaving the eu without a deal as well as european parliamentary election outcomes that delay or reverse progress on strengthening the euro area architecture according to the report a no deal brexit the report said which severely disrupts supply chains and raises trade costs could potentially have large and long lasting negative impacts on the economic well being of britain and the eu with regard to the united states it projected that the economy will grow by 2 3 percent in 2019 and expand at a lower rate of 1 9 percent in 2020 the report said the market implied path of expected policy rates remains below the u s federal reserve s projections raising the possibility of a market reassessment of the expected policy path if u s economic data remain strong this could result in higher u s interest rates renewed dollar appreciation and tighter financial conditions for emerging market and developing economies with balance sheet vulnerabilities the report said for china the growth rates are forecast to be 6 3 percent in 2019 and 6 1 percent in 2020 beyond 2020 the report predicted that global growth will plateau at about 3 6 percent over the medium term gopinath said the post 2020 growth stabilization is bolstered mainly by growth in china and india and their increasing weights in world income growth in emerging market and developing economies will stabilize at 5 percent with emerging economies in asia continuing to grow faster than other regions she added to prevent the downside risks from materializing gopinath urged the building of more inclusive economies adding that costly policy mistakes should be avoided policymakers need to work cooperatively to help ensure that policy uncertainty doesn t weaken investment she said across all economies the imperative is to take actions that boost potential output

daniel brosseau of letkobrosseau global investment management sent me their analysis of arguments for and against investing in canada since the publication of the open letter signed by more than 90 business and union leaders in canada addressing the role of pension funds in the canadian economy a much needed debate has arisen on how canada can reverse its declining prosperity we welcome such an important conversation and kindly thank all the signatories for helping to start it the document presents the arguments that are being made and analyzes their basis some of the analysis is simple fact checking of claims that are being put forth returns failure of dual mandates other analysis discusses commonly accepted precepts and their application linking allocation to size of market government regulatory role finally there are novel concepts that appear not yet well understood role of domestic investment how the pension manager perspective is severely limited compar
the international monetary fund has sharply lowered its growth outlook for the euro zone as powerhouse germany sputters while italy looks set to miss out on growth altogether gross domestic product gdp in the 19 nation single currency area should grow by just 1 3 this year after 1 8 in 2018 the washington based institution said at its last update in january the imf was still confident of 1 6 expansion in the bloc the imf also said that irish economic growth is expected to decline this year and next it expects gdp will grow at 4 1 here this year compared to a predicted 6 8 for 2018 the imf also forecasts that irish economic growth will decline even further next year to 3 4 many of the euro zone s woes have fallen on germany and italy two of its top three economies and which are expected to expand by 0 8 and 0 1 in 2019 the imf slashed both forecasts by 0 5 percentage points compared with january france s outlook was trimmed only slightly to 1 5 as the yellow vest protests that braked output in late 2018 have ebbed spain remains a growth star among large euro zone nations expected to expand by 2 5 this year the imf s weaker forecast for germany was in line with those offered both by the federal government in berlin and the country s top economic think tanks after years of comparatively fast paced growth and fat budget and trade surpluses a supposedly temporary slowdown due to one off factors in late 2018 has drawn out into the new year germany has emerged from a historic drought that brought river freight traffic to a standstill while the vital car industry is getting to grips with new emissions tests that proved a bottleneck for production from september but subdued foreign demand linked to a global slowdown has become a harsh test for export oriented german firms wobbling one of the pillars of the country s economic strength over the past decade nevertheless germany can rely on strong domestic demand with unemployment of just 4 9 its lowest since reunification in 1990 unions have been pushing for higher wages italy is confronted with a very different picture suffering a technical recession or two successive quarters of contraction in late 2018 weak domestic demand is weighing on rome on top of a massive public debt burden amounting to 130 of gdp last autumn the populist coalition government indulged in a brief showdown with brussels over a deficit swelling 2019 budget before agreeing to trim its spending plans against the tricky background monetary policy should continue to remain accommodative in the euro zone aiming to lift inflation off present levels well below target the imf judged the european central bank is unlikely to deviate from the imf line at a meeting tomorrow having pushed back the date of a first possible hike of its historic low interest rates to 2020 at the earliest later this year policymakers plan a new round of low cost loans to banks in a bid to keep credit flowing to the real economy further into the future the imf sees the euro zone economy picking up to 1 5 growth next year with germany adding 1 4 percent and italy 0 9 france should expand by 1 4 and spain by 1 9 but the imf joins the chorus of forecasters drawing a question mark over the impact of britain s departure from the european union its economists see three possible scenarios an orderly withdrawal after a deal with brussels a partly cushioned no deal in which effects like tariffs and blockades for financial firms would bite only gradually or a chaotic no deal upset causing immediate trade and financial havoc more broadly the imf urged leaders to adopt actions that boost potential output growth improve inclusiveness and strengthen resilience especially if global growth slows further while the prescription is aimed at all advanced economies it harks back to the institution s years of admonishments towards berlin whose partners charge germany with complacently piling up surpluses for years rather than laying the foundations for the future
the international monetary fund on tuesday cut its us growth forecast significantly for 2019 but said the united states is still likely to outpace other advanced nations as the world economy slows the global crisis lender also warned of hazards on the horizon especially the continued trade tensions with china and other countries as well as mounting corporate debts and the delicate challenges facing the central bank in coming months in the latest world economic outlook the imf portrayed the united states as an exception to the current slowing trend among rich nations with strong consumer demand robust labor markets and higher industrial output than its rivals the world s largest economy is now expected to expand at a 2 3 percent clip this year down from the 2 5 percent expected in january but still relatively strong according to the report released ahead of this week s spring meetings of the imf and world bank us growth is projected to slow further to 1 9 percent in 2020 slightly higher than forecast in january boosted by the federal reserve s indications it will not raise interest rates for the foreseeable future there has been a pivot with the fed with a pause in the expectation of rate rise in 2019 imf chief economist gita gopinath told reporters that move was welcome as it has offset some of the downside risks that were building up towards the end of 2018 she said however she added if we do have the recovery that we are projecting by 2020 that could change policy stance the stimulus provided by us tax cuts last year is fading while the extended government shutdown also took a bite out of growth in 2019 the imf outlook assumes that the current truce in the us china trade war will persist and lead to a more permanent agreement but if the dispute flares up or spreads to autos that could erode business sentiment and slow growth the report warned as us domestic demand continues to support higher imports and the budget deficit balloons the trade deficit could swell further which could aggravate trade tensions the report said a durable resolution of trade uncertainty created by the us and china would be very positive for global growth gopinath said at a news briefing also warning against expanding the dispute to more sectors rising corporate debt imf chief economist gita gopinath says the us is likely to outpace other advanced nations this year despite slowing growth speaks during a press conference in washington dc on april 9 2019 the global economy is facing a delicate moment beset with risks as the recovery loses steam amid trade tensions brexit and other factors the international monetary fund warned tuesday andrew caballero reynolds afp the imf also warned that corporate debt was increasingly risky with bond investors and others lending to a growing number of low rated issuers or borrowers who offered little protection in the event of a default if us growth were to weaken such financial fragilities could amplify and prolong the slowdown the imf cautioned that would leave companies to choke on burdensome debt payments and suffer credit downgrades forcing them to slash spending as a result however gopinath said that if inflation remains low the central bank could have space to provide more support to the economy if needed the federal reserve which has said it does not expect to raise interest rates again in 2019 could nevertheless feel compelled to do so in the second half of the year as wage growth accelerates and the shortage of workers continues the report said the fed could face a difficult policy challenge raising borrowing costs could erode business activity and growth but delaying a rate hike in the face of inflation pressures could contribute to financial vulnerabilities and a sharper downturn down the road what happens in the us economy typically feeds through to the broader global economy

describing current global economic atmosphere as a delicate moment imf chief economist gita gopinath on april 9 said that while the global economy continues to grow at a reasonable rate and a global recession is not in the baseline projections there are many downside risks beyond 2020 global growth is expected to stabilise at around 3¬Ω per cent bolstered mainly by growth in china and india and their increasing weights in world income she said in a blog post ahead of the annual spring meeting of the international monetary fund and the world bank story continues below advertisement remove ad growth in emerging market and developing economies will stabilize at five per cent though with considerable variance as emerging asia continues to grow faster than other regions a similar pattern holds for low income countries with some particularly commodity importers growing rapidly but others falling further behind the advanced world in per capita terms the indian american economist said while the global economy continues to grow at a reasonable rate and a global recession is not in the baseline projections there are many downside risks gopinath said tensions in trade policy could flare up again and play out in other areas such as the auto industry with large disruptions to global supply chains she cautioned growth in systemic economies such as the euro area and china may surprise on the downside and the risks surrounding brexit remain heightened a deterioration in market sentiment could rapidly tighten financing conditions in an environment of large private and public sector debt in many countries including sovereign bank doom loop risks gopinath warned story continues below advertisement remove ad story continues below advertisement remove ad given these risks she argued it is imperative that costly policy mistakes are avoided policymakers need to work cooperatively to help ensure that policy uncertainty doesn t weaken investment she said fiscal policy will need to manage trade offs between supporting demand protecting social spending and ensuring that public debt remains on a sustainable path with the optimal mix depending on country specific circumstances financial sector policies must address vulnerabilities proactively by deploying macroprudential tools such as counter cyclical capital buffers a task made more urgent by the possibility that interest rates will remain low for longer monetary policy should remain data dependent be well communicated and ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored she said across all economies the imperative is to take actions that boost potential output improve inclusiveness and strengthen resilience the top imf economist said there is a need for greater multilateral cooperation to resolve trade conflicts to address climate change and risks from cybersecurity and to improve the effectiveness of international taxation she said this is a delicate moment for the global economy if the downside risks do not materialize and the policy support put in place is effective global growth should rebound gopinath said if however any of the major risks materialize then the expected recoveries in stressed economies export dependent economies and highly indebted economies may be derailed in that case policymakers will need to adjust she added
