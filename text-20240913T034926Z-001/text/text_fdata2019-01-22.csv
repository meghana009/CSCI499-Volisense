sweden slow riksbank rate hikes in a housing driven deceleration an ageing economic cycle is encountering downside risks due to labour market bottlenecks and volatile financial markets while trade related and other political uncertainties persists but these decelerating forces are not strong enough to trigger a recession subdued inflation will also give central banks room to ease their pace of normalisation seb is again lowering its gdp growth forecasts a bit but the global economy will continue to grow at somewhat above its trend rate in 2019 and 2020 in sweden the growth outlook has dimmed with worrying signals from both the domestic economy and exporters thus weakening the forces that can offset the decline in home construction that is now under way yet expansionary economic policy is providing some support and growth will rebound in 2020 gdp will increase by 1 6 per cent this year well below seb s earlier forecast followed by 1 9 per cent in 2020 low inflation is one reason why sweden s riksbank will be satisfied with one interest rate hike per year bringing its key rate to 0 25 per cent by the end of 2020 the krona will appreciate only slowly to 9 70 per euro at year end 2020 nervous markets will create downside risks in late cyclical phase the real economy and the financial markets are now interacting in a way that is typical in the late phase of an economic cycle investors are especially sensitive to any negative news that boosts the risk of a recession and thereby radically changes the potential for corporate earnings for their part economic analysts must take into account to what extent financial market turmoil will impact the real economy one channel may be that such turmoil signals a decline in profits and lower future investments another link may be that falling asset prices weaken balance sheets and wealth positions in a way that will hamper consumption and capital spending by households and businesses seb s conclusion is that the impact of financial market turmoil on the real economy is still not strong enough to trigger a recession instead more dovish central banks can strengthen risk appetite to some extent as exemplified by the recent rebound in market sentiment after the us federal reserve fed signalled greater sensitivity to market worries unemployment in advanced economies the 36 member countries of the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd has fallen to its lowest since 1980 creating something of a dilemma for monetary policymakers although the rate of wage and salary increases has accelerated in all major economies it remains at historically low levels underlying inflation pressures are still moderate this enables central banks to further slow the pace of an already leisurely rate hiking process underlying economic strengths such as robust household balance sheets and plenty of job openings as well as the need for business investment due to high resource utilisation may again make themselves felt but the challenges from an increasingly stretched resource situation cannot be solved by monetary policy downside risks thus increase the further along in the economic cycle we move and as the uncertainty element of economic forecasts tips more and more to the negative side global growth still above trend fed close to peaking and cautious ecb seb is lowering its global growth forecast by about another tenth of a percentage point to 3 5 per cent in both 2019 and 2020 this is still somewhat above trend and is enough to ensure a continued downturn in unemployment in the united states the economy will slow mainly due to increasing supply side restrictions but rising labour force participation indicates continued room for expansion despite historically low unemployment us economic growth will slow from a high 3 per cent last year to 2 4 per cent in 2019 and 1 7 per cent in 2020 in western europe the problem is instead generally weaker demand but last year s slowdown was partly driven by temporary factors especially in the automotive sector euro zone gdp growth will fall from nearly 2 per cent in 2018 to 1 6 per cent this year and then reach 1 7 per cent in 2020 looser economic policy in china and a continued strong upturn in india will enable emerging market em economies to continue growing at nearly 5 per cent yearly both in 2019 and 2020 uncertainty due to the brexit process united kingdom withdrawal from the european union is having ever increasing negative effects on british growth which will be stuck at around 1 5 per cent despite the weak pound seb s main scenario is still that a no deal brexit will be avoided key interest rate forecasts are being lowered the fed is now expected to be content with one further rate hike in mid 2019 leaving its federal funds rate at 2 75 per cent seb is also lowering its forecasts for western european central banks by 25 to 50 basis points a more dovish key rate outlook will have consequences for long term bond yields ten year us treasuries are not expected to rise above 3 per cent again and because of a cautious european central bank ecb german 10 year government bond yields will not climb past 0 70 per cent the foreign exchange fx market lacks clear trends dollar positive factors such as us economic growth and the fed s actions will help keep the eur usd exchange rate at around 1 15 during the first half of 2019 but after that the dollar will weaken as other central banks begin their normalisation process while risk appetite remains decent norwegian rebound baltic slowdown due to supply side and exports the nordic economies are affected in varying degrees by euro zone deceleration norway is showing resilience to the slowdown in other countries and to lower oil prices capital spending in the petroleum sector will now increase markedly adding to demand in the rest of the norwegian economy together with a housing market rebound and solid private consumption this will help gdp growth in the mainland economy excluding oil gas and shipping accelerate to 2 5 per cent this year with 2 2 per cent growth in 2020 overall gdp growth will surge to nearly 3 per cent in 2019 and 2 5 per cent in 2020 norges bank can thus keep pursuing its plan to hike the key rate twice yearly in 2019 and 2020 finland and denmark will also enjoy some support from domestic strengths such as robust labour markets high capacity utilisation and a positive gdp growth contribution from housing construction the finnish economy has slowed down after its earlier acceleration but growth will still reach about 2 per cent both this year and next temporary effects contributed to weak danish economic growth in 2018 an underlying slowdown will gradually slow gdp growth to 2 0 per cent in 2019 and 1 7 per cent in 2020 after a strong 2018 the fast growing baltic economies will also decelerate somewhat driven by lower export demand and by certain supply side restrictions in estonia and lithuania gdp growth will be nearly 3 per cent in 2019 and around 2 5 per cent in 2020 gdp growth in the latvian economy will reach 3 5 per cent this year and 3 2 per cent next year sweden weaker resilience to declining home construction the growth outlook in sweden has dimmed in recent months with worrying signals from both the domestic economy and exporters thus weakening the forces that can offset the sharp decline in home construction that is now under way the gdp decline in the third quarter of 2018 was partly due to temporary factors such as weak consumption caused by changes in auto taxation but a broad retreat by sentiment indicators suggests a more wide ranging slowdown seb now believes that swedish gdp growth will reach only 1 6 per cent in 2019 compared to its earlier forecast of 2 2 per cent in 2020 growth will recover somewhat to 1 9 per cent as the negative gdp contribution from home construction disappears from the statistics an expansionary fiscal policy continued low interest rates and a weak krona suggest that an even more serious economic slowdown can be avoided because of the large supply of homes especially newly produced units in major cities home prices have not stopped declining after last year s stabilisation prices will fall by another 3 4 per cent this year bringing the total downturn since the peak in 2017 to nearly 10 per cent the labour market will enter a calmer phase and unemployment will level out at around 6 per cent pay increases will remain subdued at around 2 5 per cent in the coming year and will not accelerate until new collective agreements are in place during the spring of 2020 inflation will remain at around current levels this spring due to high electricity prices but will drop below 1 5 per cent in mid 2019 continued decent global economic conditions and cautious key rate hikes by central banks in other countries suggest continued interest rate hikes in sweden but partly because of low inflation the riksbank is easing its monetary policy a bit compared to its december rate path and will limit itself to one rate hike per year at the end of 2020 the repo rate will thus stand at 0 25 per cent this spring the riksbank is expected to announce a continuation of its strategy of early bond reinvestments it will thus continue to own about half of the nominal supply of swedish government bonds because of the slow pace of rate hikes interest rate policy will not be a major positive factor for the krona the krona will appreciate with the eur sek exchange rate reaching 9 95 at the end of 2019 and 9 70 at the end of 2020 swedish economic policy will move sharply in a centre right direction as a result of the new budget cooperation agreement between the social democrats greens centre and liberals this policy represents a clearer reform agenda and will give the government a good chance to push through its budgets but quarrels about broken political promises and internal tensions pose a latent threat fiscal policy will be somewhat more expansionary than earlier expected but sweden s public finances will remain strong in a european perspective key figures international swedish economy figures in

in the latest edition of foreign affairs oriana skylar mastro writes that china s belt and road initiative bri is being financed via loans given to developing countries without the usual western strings attached she s correct insofar as the structure and purpose of chinese development loans are fundamentally different than those provided by wealthy western nations however these strings are identified in her essay as requirements for market reforms and better governance the details of these reforms and the definition of better governance are to be assumed by the reader strings are attached to western aid via the international monetary fund imf but not always for the purpose of improving civil society or progressive economic reforms the belt and road initiative spanning 62 of the world s population and 75 of its economic output has been called the largest investment in human history while the project revolves largely around the financing of large infrastructure programs many in the us and europe as well as some politicians in east asia have characterized the expansive project as a malevolent chinese trojan horse using investment as a ruse to gain political leverage furthermore criticisms are lobbed at china for seemingly throwing poor countries into unsustainable mountains of debt ostensibly for the purpose of bolstering chinese political leverage some of these criticisms are justified but there is little reason for one to assume that allowing the us and the imf to remain the sole proprietor of economic aid is necessarily good for the developing world in march of 2018 then secretary of state rex tillerson claimed that china s predatory loan practices were pushing developing nations to undercut their sovereignty the financial times writes that some countries have also complained about neo colonialism this might be the case but china wasn t the first to be accused of using economic warfare to achieve high levels of political power when indonesia now party to the bri was pressured by the imf to sign a bailout agreement economist joseph stiglitz writes that the nation s president was being forced in effect to turn over economic sovereignty of his country to the imf in return for the aid his country needed much of the money went not to help indonesia but to bail out the colonial power s private sector creditors this is due to the imf prioritizing the payment of debt rather than using aid money to invest in the economy in other words escaping recession by financing growth investing in infrastructure would be one way to do this stiglitz continues as a condition of receiving money the countries experienced a form of western domination as bitter as the old colonialism conditions would be imposed to get loans which typically included fire sale privatizations of the country s assets turning them over to western companies at bargain prices this helps contextualize complaints over chinese seizure of assets due to repayment such as the hambantota port in sri lanka loss of sovereignty via imf loans can come in many forms such as the passage of specific pieces of legislation through a country s parliament in the case of south korea who turned to the imf as a last resort in the midst of the east asian financial crisis was forced to restructure its central bank not only was it allowed more independence it was told to focus exclusively on inflation rather than unemployment stiglitz also a former world bank economist and participant in the south korean bailout project writes south korea s economists knew that the policies being pushed on their country by the imf would be disastrous korean officials reluctantly explained that they had been scared to disagree openly the imf could not only cut off its own funds but could use its bully pulpit to discourage investments from private market funds by telling private sector financial institutions of the doubts the imf had about korea s economy the measures did prove disastrous not only was central banking manipulated by the imf a credit freeze was imposed draining domestic industries of funds from financial institutions song jung tae a journalist at the korean herald wrote at the time more than 90 of construction companies with combined debts of 20 billion to domestic financial institutions are in danger of bankruptcy indonesia was forced to repeal subsidies for food and kerosene which largely benefitted the nation s poor and hungry the result was almost two weeks of rioting and the murder of businessmen and their families when an external entity can force upon a nation the passage of legislation and the sale of public assets there exists a strong case that sovereignty has been compromised entwined with criticisms of sovereignty loss are those of excessive debt colum lynch at foreign policy charges china with imposing unsustainable debt burdens on poor countries world bank economist michele ruta lectured developing countries to balance the need for these development projects with the vulnerabilities created by increased debt levels the west however hasn t taken the lead on debt relief in the case of indonesia and pakistan the latter of which is the largest recipient of bri aid imf loans weren t forgiven even after the governments which had originally taken out the loans were deposed in the case of south korea much of their debt was held by banks the imf pushed south korea to raise its interest rates which pushed more and more banks into positions where loan repayment was impossible south korea s recession deepened and the country experienced a flight of capital which made a bad situation even worse argentina after taking on large quantities of sovereign debt experienced a deep crisis beginning in 2001 much of this debt was taken out by western and american hedge funds who refused to have the debts go unpaid according to stiglitz hedge funds that had bought argentinean bonds after argentina had defaulted paying cents on the dollar and were now trying to collect as if they had been the ones who originally lent to argentina worse they took advantage of a quirk in the law to try to get interest in what they had not been paid at rates far far in excess of the market rate these practices add a sick irony to the fact that the trump administration has already made it clear it will not back any imf rescue that might serve simply to help its recipient pay off debts to beijing finally china has been criticized for the scarcity of details on its lending policies economist ricardo hausmann condemns china s practice of keeping financing terms secret from the society that is ultimately responsible and often from that society s government the imf itself apparently finding a conscience now that it s monopoly on lending is being compromised issued a critical statement on the belt and road initiative stating greater debt transparency enables borrowers and lenders to effectively evaluate the sustainability of public debt and monitor emerging risks again china is not breaking new ground in this regard as a world bank economist stiglitz wrote that citizens of countries receiving aid from the fund were not only barred form discussions of agreements they were not even told what the agreements were indeed the prevailing culture of secrecy was so strong that the imf kept much of the negotiations and some of the agreements secret from world bank members even in joint missions so much for monitoring emerging risks perhaps from now on the fund can begin by setting positive example there is no shortage of legitimate criticism of the belt and road initiative many of the financed projects will be for oil and gas infrastructure this comes at a time when such investment is the last thing the human race needs it should however be noted that china is the world s leader in issuing green bonds and is constructing the world s largest solar farm in pakistan a loss of sovereignty for economic reasons regardless of which actor is precipitating it is always questionable and the use of chinese labor means developing nations are missing out on opportunities to give more work to their own blue collar workforce while the maintenance of a critical eye when reviewing this titanic project is a must the west can t offer comment without a little bit of self reflection first the attachment of those usual western strings have never implied an overall improvement for a receiving nation photo hans johnson
gita gopinath has a knack for asking the kind of questions that not so long ago might have raised eyebrows inside the international monetary fund where she just took over as chief economist what if more emerging markets actively managed their currencies like china does what if an influx of capital risks sapping a nation s productivity not boosting it interrogating the data for answers and using them to poke holes in the conventional playbooks for economic policy was a hallmark of 47 year old gopinath s work at harvard now she ll be expected to recommend practical fixes at a turbulent moment when the free market principles promoted by the fund for decades are under attack especially in borrower countries like greece and argentina the imf still gets portrayed as an enforcer of one size fits all policies based on austerity and the unimpeded flow of goods and money but that s been out of date for a while now fund economists advocated debt relief in greece they ve said capital controls can be useful and cautiously backed redistributive taxes when argentina had to find budget savings they insisted that the poor shouldn t bear too much of the burden don t be dogmatic the shift is likely to continue under gopinath who became the first woman to hold one of the most influential jobs in economics when she took over from maurice obstfeld this month she ll oversee the fund s research including its closely watched growth forecasts at a time when uncertainty is mounting the imf on monday downgraded its global outlook for the second time in three months to show the weakest expansion this year since 2016 more than a decade since the imf and other economists failed to predict the financial crisis gopinath used her debut press conference to highlight mounting risks including the trade war and tightening credit in her new role gopinath plans to use the broadest lens possible in search of solutions part of her job will be to review the fund s loan programs giving her a voice in practical policy making a rethink of globalisation is pressing and it should address the distribution of benefits as well as the impact of new technologies she said in an emailed response to questions in her academic career gopinath has been willing to follow the empirical evidence wherever it leads what gita s thinking has pointed out is let s not be dogmatic said mohamed el erian chief economic adviser at allianz se and a former imf economist with all the uncertainties that the global system is having to navigate it s reassuring that at the imf you have someone like gita she s an authority on one key part of that system currency regimes the fund has tended to back floating exchange rates for reasons laid out by milton friedman allow the currency to fall the theory goes and exports become cheaper relative to imports so the country can sell more goods abroad and boost growth gopinath s research suggests that reality is more complicated and dollar dominance is one reason why for example japan us trade is overwhelmingly priced in greenbacks so a weaker yen doesn t trigger a corresponding jump in japanese exports crawling pegs that undercuts the argument of those like president donald trump who accuse competitors of gaming their currencies to gain an edge it also complicates matters for the imf whose charter requires members to avoid discriminatory currency practices the fund has struggled to develop a consistent policy said james boughton a senior fellow at the centre for international governance innovation in between fixed and floating currencies lies a bewildering range of options from botswana s crawling peg to china s stabilized arrangement gopinath s research interests and expertise could really help said boughton who was the imf s official historian for two decades she s been well grounded in the practical consequences of exchange rate policies without getting bogged down in ideology it s far from an academic matter rising us interest rates hammered emerging market currencies last year argentina whose peso collapsed turned to the imf for a record 56 billion bailout the deal permits the central bank to intervene but only outside a

time he said we have to consider different ways of approaching that issue communist kerfuffle another gopinath research topic is the impact of capital flows she looked at southern europe and found a significant decline in productivity because the money that poured in after the euro s launch wasn t allocated efficiently the imf which once considered capital controls taboo now sees them as potentially useful stabilisers when markets seesaw to gopinath these are technical questions not articles of faith she sees herself as not beholden to any political ideology she was surprised when a

the major u s index futures are pointing to a lower opening on tuesday with stocks likely to give back ground following the rally seen last week concerns about the global are likely to weigh on the markets after the international monetary fund said the global expansion is weakening at a rate that is somewhat faster than expected the imf lowered its forecasts for global economic growth to 3 5 percent in 2019 and 3 6 percent in 2020 0 2 and 0 1 percentage points below last october s projections an escalation of trade tensions and a worsening of financial conditions are key sources of risk to the outlook the imf said the imf also expressed concerns about a bigger than expected slowdown in chinese growth the brexit cliffhanger and the ongoing u s government shutdown in remarks at the world economic forum in davos switzerland on monday imf managing director christine lagarde noted risks to the global economy are increasingly intertwined think of how higher tariffs and rising uncertainty over future trade policy fed into lower asset prices and higher market volatility lagarde said this in turn contributed to tightening financial conditions including for advanced economies which is a major risk factor in a world of high debt burdens does that mean that a global recession is around the corner the answer is no she added but the risk of a sharper decline in global growth has certainly increased extending the upward trend seen over the past several sessions stocks moved sharply higher during the trading day on friday with the continued advance the major averages reached their best closing levels in well over a month the major averages ended the day firmly in positive territory the dow soared 336 25 points or 1 4 percent to 24 706 35 the nasdaq jumped 72 76 points or 1 percent to 7 157 23 and the s p 500 surged up 34 75 points or 1 3 percent to 2 670 71 reflecting the four day winning streak the major averages moved substantially higher for the week the dow spiked by 3 percent while the nasdaq and the s p 500 shot up by 2 7 percent and 2 9 percent respectively the rally on wall street comes as traders continued to express optimism about trade talks between the u s and china adding to the positive sentiment a report from bloomberg news said china has offered to go on a six year buying spree to ramp up imports from the u s an official familiar with the negotiations told bloomberg that china would seek to reduce its trade surplus with the u s by increasing annual goods imports by a combined value of more than 1 trillion the bloomberg report came on the heels of yesterday s wall street journal report indicating the u s is considering lifting tariffs on chinese goods the wall street journal report on thursday said the u s is weighing easing tariffs in an effort to calm and give china an incentive to make deeper concessions people close to internal deliberations told the journal that treasury secretary steven mnuchin proposed the idea of lifting some or all tariffs in a series of strategy meetings the people said the aim of easing the tariffs is to advance trade talks and win china s support for longer term reforms the positive news on trade overshadowed a report from the university of michigan showing a substantial deterioration in u s consumer sentiment in the month of january the preliminary report said the

percent in 2019 and 3 6 percent in 2020 0 2 and 0 1 percentage points below last october s projections an escalation of trade tensions and a worsening of financial conditions are key sources of risk to the outlook the imf said the imf also expressed concerns about a bigger than expected slowdown in chinese growth the brexit cliffhanger and the ongoing u s government shutdown in remarks at the world economic forum in davos switzerland on monday imf managing director christine lagarde noted risks to the global economy are increasingly intertwined think of how higher tariffs and rising uncertainty over future trade policy fed into lower asset prices and higher market volatility lagarde said this in turn contributed to tightening financial conditions including for advanced economies which is a major risk factor in a world of high debt burdens does that mean that a global recession is around the corner the answer is no she added but the risk of a sharper decline in global growth

peter morici federal reserve chairman jerome powell faces the tough challenge of engineering a soft landing for the economy the task is made terribly more complicated by economic conditions abroad and new technologies that have broken traditional relationships among growth employment inflation and interest rates the nearly three percent growth accomplished in 2018 despite chronic skilled labor shortages was no accident of nature trump tax cuts and a february 2018 budget deal that lifted federal appropriations caps boosted consumer and government spending lower corporate taxes permitted businesses to invest in labor saving robots artificial intelligence and workforce training trump administration deregulation slashed private sector compliance costs and together those boosted labor productivity more demand more supply and the economy zoomed ahead at a pace defying naysayers in the left leaning media advertisement in 2019 consumers are getting an additional lift from falling gas prices but the benefits from more government spending and personal tax cuts have largely run their course businesses should continue to invest but conditions in europe and china are troubling brexit the yellow vest riots in france and the emergence of a populist government in italy were nominally caused by unchecked immigration higher taxes on gasoline and reforms that tighten belts for workers and pensioners and a left right coalition agreement to spend more than eu national debt limits permit in reality the onerous regulations imposed by the eu bureaucracy and mercantilist policies in germany and a few other northern european economies that impose perennial trade deficits and austerity elsewhere are pulling the eu apart the rump of it is europe cannot grow and it s america s most important export market china has run the string on credit driven growth and republicans and democrats alike are tired of beijing s protectionism imposing a whopping 365 billion trade imbalance and exporting unemployment and social problems here donald trump s trade war is criticized only because hillary clinton who campaigned on a similar policy did not win the election the fed would have to deal with the uncertainty created by a trade war no matter who occupied the oval office a decade of low interest rates boosted real estate and stock values in the united states and permitted struggling corporations and foreign governments to avoid reforms that would make them competitive and less corrupt now just about anything the fed does has feedback effects on asset prices corporate and foreign government finances and ultimately u s exports and growth finally tools the fed uses to navigate are broken the philips curve which charts the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment is flashing red but the hard economic data say otherwise even with unemployment at 3 9 percent wage increases of 3 2 pose few inflationary pressures with stronger productivity growth to pay for those the yield curve the difference between the short and long term interest rates on treasuries has been flattening historically that has proven a pretty good indicator of a recession in the next year or so theoretically it is supposed to indicate businesses that buy equipment and hire do not believe that prospective sales growth justifies borrowing long term to finance expansion the problem is that since the 2000s u s long rates have been suppressed by foreign investors europeans stuck in a lethargic economy and latin americans and asians fearful that their corrupt governments will ignite inflation to solve their debt problems have been buying up u s real estate and long bonds similarly the dollar has increasingly become the preferred currency for all global trade further increasing the demand for u s bonds those unhinge the relationships between business expectations and interest rates for example the yield curve has been sending warning signals since late 2017 but the economy sped up instead of slowing lacking the philips curve and yield curve as tools mr powell is flying without an altimeter and air speed indicator not being an economist he has not been to pilot school either with all this turbulence in stock prices is understandable and cannot be ignored along with the hostile press coverage president trump gets no matter his spending or trade policy proposals falling stock prices could pull the economy into rather than follow a recession the best thing mr powell can do for now is pull back on the stick and announce he is not planning any more interest rate increases until at least this summer peter morici is an economist and business professor at the university of maryland and a national columnist 2019 the washington times llc
is the world prepared for the next financial crisis the world in 2019 is still reckoning with the legacy of the global financial crisis which is hardly surprising given its scale and lasting impact ten years on from the lehman brothers collapse one question about the financial system keeps coming up are we safer than we were in 2008 the short answer is yes but not safe enough while there has been marked progress more needs to be done including keeping pace with potential new risks from a rapidly evolving financial landscape first the progress banks have bigger and better capital buffers and more liquidity countries have taken steps to address systemic risks posed by institutions seen as too big to fail regulation and supervision have been strengthened many countries have stepped up their focus on monitoring financial stability and many now also conduct regular stress tests to check banks health a substantial portion of trading in over the counter derivatives has shifted to safer central clearing systems for its part the international monetary fund imf has improved its ability to analyze and monitor sources of systemic risk the imf has improved its ability to analyze and monitor sources of systemic risk it has partnered with national authorities to help them identify potential trouble spots such as excessive consumer or corporate debt develop tools to curb risks and strengthen analysis of their financial systems what about areas where progress has been inadequate or where new risks have emerged let s start with debt globally nonfinancial debt ballooned to a record 182 trillion in 2017 224 percent of global gdp an increase of almost 60 percent over 2007 in the united states investor demand for debt issued by highly leveraged companies has led to worryingly loose underwriting standards increasing the risk of default by weaker borrowers in emerging markets public debt is at levels last seen during the 1980s debt crisis and if recent trends continue many low income countries will face unsustainable debt burdens nonbank finance also known as shadow banking because it takes place beyond the perimeter of traditional bank regulation is another source of risk regulators must develop and deploy new tools to address it particularly in those emerging markets where it has expanded rapidly at the same time new challenges have emerged including the danger of cyberattacks on banks and stock exchanges financial innovation and technology hold out the promise of better cheaper and more accessible services but also pose risks for consumers investors and the economy s overall financial stability risks that are not always easy to understand or anticipate and for all the progress to strengthen the financial sector the revamped architecture remains untested if financial conditions were to tighten sharply for example via unexpectedly higher interest rates or a sharp drop in asset prices this could expose areas of vulnerability that have built up during a decade of record low interest rates in the last year we have already seen some investors pull money out of emerging markets in response to a stronger dollar rising u s interest rates and trade tensions imf calculations show that with an abrupt tightening there is a chance albeit a small one that capital outflows from these economies excluding china could reach 100 billion that would broadly match outflows during the financial crisis looking at the economic context there are several sources of risk that could shake investor sentiment global growth while still strong is leveling off support is waning for the open rules based international system that has fueled global prosperity and trade tensions could escalate support is waning for the open rules based international system that has fueled global prosperity uncertainty about fiscal policy in europe is reviving worries about the self reinforcing nexus of government and bank debt that shook the eurozone in the first years of this decade finally central banks must navigate the end of an unprecedented monetary experiment in the united states the federal reserve may need to raise interest rates higher than currently anticipated if tax cuts combined with fiscal stimulus fuel faster than expected inflation so how should policymakers respond first they must complete financial regulatory reforms and just as important resist pressure to roll them back bank capital should be raised even further in places where buffers remain low too big to fail remains a problem as banks grow larger and more complex more progress is needed on procedures for resolving or winding down failing banks especially those that are active across borders regulators should encourage banks with weak business models and high levels of nonperforming loans to clean up their balance sheets second policymakers should rebuild their fiscal and monetary arsenals which were weakened as they contended with the 2008 crisis and its aftermath doing so will require reducing budget deficits and gradually bringing interest rates back to normal levels as economic conditions permit governments should also work together to reduce excessive global imbalances in a way that supports sustainable growth flexible exchange rates can help absorb shocks steps to boost lagging productivity would counter demographic headwinds and raise growth which in turn would support efforts to bolster fiscal and monetary room for maneuver finally as we consider the lessons of the crisis and the path forward we must also recognize and confront more profound longer term risks to financial and social stability climate change is one that threatens all of us low income countries in particular advanced economies must ensure that prosperity is more widely shared by dealing with rising inequality and stagnant wage growth all countries need to educate and train workers for automation and the fast changing workplace of the future many of the measures that might make the world safer than it was before the last crisis depend on international cooperation on matters of trade and finance but also on a number of global public good problems including the environment and refugees the stakes are just as high as they were in 2008 this article originally appeared in the winter 2019 issue of foreign policy magazine

news national by staff reporter zimbabwe will struggle to get financial support from international financial institutions due to its high debt levels the international monetary fund imf has said gerry rice the imf spokesperson said the southern african country need policies that would stabilise the economy i would say that of course zimbabwe is facing major challenges and just in terms of the unrest we encourage all stakeholders to collaborate peacefully in developing and implementing policies that will stabilise the economy and promote sustainable and inclusive growth he said on the overall economic situation debt and the imf there has been no real change in what i have said here recently which is why zimbabwe continues to be in a difficult situation regarding debt with protracted arrears to official creditors including multilateral creditors such as the world bank which severely limits zimbabwe s access to international financial support rice added the southern african country is battling its worst economic crisis in a decade due to a severe shortage of foreign currency resulting in fuel shortages labour unrests temporary company closures and high unemployment rates market analysts say the current fuel crisis is just part of zimbabwe s overarching economic decline under president emmerson mnangagwa who briefly inspired hope after taking over from his mentor longtime ruler robert mugabe with the help of the military in november 2017 zimbabwe s economy which was already struggling when mnangagwa took over has dramatically tanked since he narrowly won disputed elections in july last year inflation rose to 31 percent in november last year the highest since 2009 while foreign currency shortages could force some of the few factories still operating to close soon in terms of the imf zimbabwe has in fact cleared its arrears to us to the fund but our rules preclude lending to a country that is still in or under arrears to other international financial situations so until that particular situation is resolved we would not be moving forward with financial support for zimbabwe i said here the last time that the authority s economic policies we felt were headed in the right direction broadly in terms of addressing the fiscal deficit and monetary policy and so on i won t repeat what i said the last time but that s where we are on zimbabwe rice said zimbabwe abandoned its own currency in 2009 after hyperinflation reached 500 billion percent according to the international monetary fund the united states dollar has dominated daily transactions since then but due to widespread shortages of dollars most people must now use a government issued surrogate currency called bond notes which are supposed to be equal to a us dollar as well as electronic money both are quickly devaluing against the dollar on the black market some businesses such as pharmacies are now only accepting united states dollars in cash in the fuel sector where the government controls prices fuel companies are forced to accept bond notes and electronic money for petrol and diesel at the official exchange rate the government then provides the firms with dollars to import the products but of late the central bank has not been allocating firms adequate funds to import sufficient fuel for the country leading to the shortages
this article is more than 5 years old getty what the heck just happened to the stock market in q4 it is still too early to answer this question with certainty however based on the early evidence it appears that the decline in asset prices in 2018 and the u s market chaos in q4 were closely related to monetary tightening on the part of the federal reserve the s p 500 index generated a total return of 9 0 in december which was the worst december return since 1931 in the midst of the great depression the quarterly return of the s p 500 index was 13 5 representing the worst fourth quarter return since 2008 which was in the midst of the financial crisis outside of cash there was no place to hide for investors in 2018 which was just the opposite of 2017 when nearly every asset class generated a nicely profitable return judging by the december decline in market prices it appears that the wheels may be coming off the bus pekin hardy strauss wealth management behind these asset price declines higher interest rates and recent reductions in the size of the federal reserve s balance sheet are reducing liquidity and increasing a flight to cash given the high level of leverage of consumers corporations and governments the financial system has become addicted to the federal reserve providing excessive liquidity with the reverse now occurring bad things are starting to happen in the financial markets for now it seems unlikely that the united states has entered a recession to be sure the economy is not firing on all cylinders for example the auto and housing sectors are experiencing particular weakness if interest rates keep rising and markets continue to weaken it is likely the united states will go into recession due to the reverse wealth effect in other words as stocks decline in price consumers will feel less wealthy and will be inclined to spend less and save more thereby reducing economic growth importantly the recent decline in the u s stock market follows even greater stock market declines which took place in foreign equity markets earlier in the year so the problem appears to be far more than just a u s problem central banks have been tightening around the world and the u s economy outperformed the economies of many other countries in 2018 with that said president trump s communication and management style does not enhance investor confidence while geopolitical frictions are seemingly increasing every day the primary culprit monetary tightening in the wake of the financial crisis the federal reserve took two important actions to reflate the economy it cut interest rates to zero percent and it provided an enormous amount of additional liquidity by printing money to buy u s securities described by the euphemistic term quantitative easing or qe by the end of 2015 the federal reserve finally decided to begin hiking interest rates at a slow and gradual pace janet yellen chairwoman of the federal reserve at the time believed it was time to prepare for the next recession the thinking of the federal reserve has been that raising rates in anticipation of the next recession would provide the federal reserve with the ability to cut rates when the next recession eventually occurs since then the effective federal funds rate has continued to increase gradually even after jerome powell became chairperson after janet yellen stepped down pekin hardy strauss wealth management quantitative easing was also central to the federal reserve s strategy between 2009 and 2014 the size of the federal reserve s balance sheet increased by quantum leaps to 4 5 trillion by 2014 the federal reserve printed money and used it to purchase u s treasuries and mortgage backed securities during this time qe kept interest rates low and nudged investors who wanted to generate better returns into higher risk investments investors flocked to junk bonds emerging market debt stocks bitcoin real estate and collectibles the federal reserve s asset purchases created financial asset price inflation that exists today across many different asset classes pekin hardy strauss wealth management in 2018 coincident with a peak in world stock prices the federal reserve finally began to unwind qe by reducing the size of its balance sheet by letting maturing bonds in its bond portfolio convert into cash essentially selling down its bond portfolio and withdrawing some of the money it had previously injected into the financial system during the 2009 to 2014 period the reversal of quantitative easing is being called quantitative tightening or qt similar to the logic behind the federal reserve s interest rate increases the rationale behind qt is that reducing the size of the federal reserve s balance sheet now will give the federal reserve more room to increase its balance sheet later when the next recession arrives the problem is that just as qe provided liquidity which juiced financial asset prices qt withdraws liquidity and deflates financial asset prices many years of qe and depressed interest rates created unprecedented increases in debt on the part of consumers corporations and governments as the world became addicted to easy money and low interest rate debt i discussed the problem of excessive debt in a post where i estimated that private and public financial obligations in the united states alone now exceed 100 trillion it no longer takes much of an interest rate rise to have a discernible impact on borrowing costs for those entities that have far too much leverage whether it be a household a company or a government by raising interest rates and simultaneously withdrawing money by selling down its bond portfolio the federal reserve is trying to normalize policy and in doing so reduce the availability of money to which the world economy and world markets have become addicted in 2018 and especially in december investors experienced the withdrawal symptoms investors in high risk corporate debt pulled their money en masse driving down leveraged loan and junk bond prices and increasing interest costs for corporations that have been issuing debt to buy back stock so aggressively over the past decade unfortunately the policy decisions during and after the financial crisis created many of the problems that are so evident today due to the federal reserve s efforts to withdraw liquidity from markets that have become addicted to liquidity a new liquidity crisis could very well be brewing that is probably why markets were so volatile during q4 and that is also why the only asset class that generated a positive return in 2018 was cash without a reversal in monetary policy on the part of central banks more investor pain is probably still to come policy changes after a further correction it would be difficult for anyone to envy the job that jerome powell has before him he really has no good options from which to choose qe was an untested experiment in 2009 rolled out by ben bernanke and continued by janet yellen in hindsight qe clearly worked to keep interest rates low and it also worked to stabilize and then inflate financial asset prices moreover it did keep the economy growing albeit at a lower than normal pace qe did not however create any kind of sustainable economic growth it also resulted in even more debt issuance so that the world economy is currently more leveraged than ever just as qe was a policy experiment undoing qe via qt is also a policy experiment while untested it seems logical to assume that if continued until its planned policy conclusion qt could generate economic results which appear to be the opposite of qe s results such as higher interest rates asset price deflation a credit induced recession and less debt as consumers corporations and governments default on their financial obligations if this logic is correct markets will probably be quite challenged without a reversal in qt and for that very reason i would expect a policy reversal if stocks continue to decline much further after all it is important to remember the following the federal reserve is owned by banks which in turn profit from lending money the federal reserve is not going to want to manage another deflationary financial crisis because its policy decisions blew a hole in banks balance sheets in reaction to asset price volatility the federal reserve is signaling that it is open to slowing its interest rate increases going forward ending and then reversing qt would likely occur soon thereafter the u s current account deficit is large problematic and growing to fund the u s current account deficit the united states must import capital from foreign investors seeking a profit on that capital without continued foreign investment the united states could soon find itself in a balance of payments crisis a u s recession would reduce tax revenues and increase the budget deficit making it even more difficult for the u s government to fund itself other central banks including the bank of japan the people s bank of china and the european central bank could provide additional liquidity even if the federal reserve does not indeed the people s bank of china has already indicated a shift from monetary tightening to monetary easing in recent weeks president trump will be seeking re election he needs a strong economy to have any hope of being re elected and he has shown little hesitation to break traditional conventions if the federal reserve does not act to reverse policy in the face of a continued stock market decline president trump may decide to take actions to re liquify the financial system possibly in the form of a dollar devaluation for the reasons stated above it would be unsurprising to see the federal reserve end qt and begin qe again sometime in 2019 my best guess is that another 15 decline in the s p 500 index from its year end level would result in a significant policy reversal should that occur the dollar would likely respond by weakening in value relative to foreign currencies and commodities that s probably when emerging market stocks finally begin to outperform however until then it probably pays to

the us interest rate hawks surrender they say that there are no atheists in fox holes recently it has also become clear there are no monetary hawks in bear markets for much of the last decade many conservative market analysts have decried our reliance on monetary stimulus to prop up the economy and the stock market but in the final months of 2018 in the face of the worst stock market declines in a decade many of these supposedly pragmatic figures quickly abandoned their convictions as the markets briefly crossed into bear territory monetary hawks joined with the doves and president trump in issuing a full throated call for the fed to cancel their planned rate hikes and balance sheet reductions it appears as if the fed got the message almost overnight the tone from the fed softened considerably causing wall street to sound the all clear during the obama years many of these erstwhile hawks appeared to partially share my belief that big deficits were a big problem and that an economy built on a foundation of zero percent interest rates quantitative easing and deficit spending was not a real economy at all donald trump picked up that message in the 2016 campaign and it rang true to many americans who were justifiably resentful that the bubbles created by these policies primarily benefited the rich but now that there is a republican in the white house and a whiff of fear on wall street those concerns have vanished faster than a cool summer breeze in texas but let s be clear there was nothing normal about the nearly decade long record breaking bull run in the s p 500 that came to a spectacular end this christmas eve during the run the s p more than quadrupled from february 2009 and never retrenched more than the 20 there was also nothing normal in its spectacular ending the worst december since 1931 during the great depression was capped by the biggest christmas eve massacre delaying the santa claus rally until the fed grinch had a change of heart as it turns out all the markets wanted for christmas was a dovish fed and when jerome powell finally started singing the right tune the december massacre quickly gave way to a great opening to 2019 in the equity markets the surge has caused many to think that the worst is behind us but such a conclusion ignores both the size of the bubble that has formed over the past decade and what real bear markets actually look like according to cnbc on average the bear markets since world war ii have lasted 13 months with stocks losing an average of 30 4 percent of their value in each episode krooney cnbc 12 24 18 with the notable exception of the black monday crash in 1987 which took just one day to cross into bear territory these downturns developed over many months and continued after the 20 threshold was crossed the two most recent bear markets of this century not counting the current bear provide stark illustrations of these tendencies after a record surge in the late 1990s investors finally realized in march of 2000 that companies with no profits or revenues were not good bets but even with this vital revelation it took eleven months for the market to fall back from its record high and to cross into a bear territory after that stocks trended downward for an additional 18 months eventually resulting in a 40 3 total decline by late september 2002 all through that bear market alan greenspan s federal reserve pushed back against the declines by slashing interest rates by more than 400 basis points without such dramatic stimulus i believe the losses would have been far worse the stimulus eventually helped ignite a furious rally that pushed stocks up 90 from september 2002 to october 2007 the trade off for truncating a bear market in stocks was creating a housing bubble that resulted in the 2008 financial crisis when it popped just two months before the great recession began in december of 2007 the s p began declining again this time it took 10 months for the index to cross into bear market territory but like the dotcom episode the 20 decline was just the beginning it took another eight months for the selling to finally come to an end with stocks declining a total 56 from the 2007 highs this time the fed responded with an even larger dose of stimulus fed chairman bernanke cut the overnight rate by 500 basis points 100 more than 2002 but when zero percent rates were not enough to turn stocks around the fed reached for a new tool called quantitative easing the policy authorized the fed to buy bonds to inject liquidity directly into the financial markets and essentially push real rates below zero under the program the fed eventually bought more than 4 trillion in bonds the vast majority of which still remain on the fed s balance sheet despite all this the s p still lost more than half its value by march 2009 but the bear market of 2018 began in a much more spectacular fashion than what we saw in 2000 or 2007 we crossed into bear territory in less than two months unfortunately history would suggest that we might have a long way to go before it ends the importance of quantitative easing in the previous stock market bubble becomes clear when you overlay market performance with the chronology of the program the majority of the gains of the 2009 2018 bull market occurred when qe from the fed was active from the time the program was launched until it was finally wound down in october 2014 the s p 500 gained about 195 in fact that was the very purpose of qe to raise asset prices thereby creating a paper wealth effect that would encourage more borrowing and spending and therefore create economic growth and while asset prices rose and the borrowing and spending certainly occurred the growth never maintained the 3 targets that most economists expected without the qe wind in our sails the market stalled from october 2014 until october 2016 the market was up only 3 something else was needed to push stocks up that catalyst arrived in the form of donald trump markets believed that the pro business swamp draining trump would transform the economy the way ronald reagan had in the 1980s after the initial post election euphoria the trump tax cuts arrived to provide a fresh dose of short term fiscal stimulus to offset the withdrawal of monetary stimulus coming from fed rate hikes the business tax cuts boosted corporate bottom lines and funded a new round of share buybacks while stoking business and consumer confidence the rally that began on election day 2016 added another impressive chapter to the bull market pushing the s p up 35 until september 2018 but since government spending actually rose as taxes fell the tax cuts provided no real economic relief a larger government needs to drain even more resources from the private sector to operate so what the government no longer collected in taxes it had to borrow instead not surprisingly deficits have soared under trump a development that appears to have caused no alarm whatsoever among traditional republican deficit hawks however in early 2018 the fed began its long discussed plan to shrink its balance sheet by selling significant quantities of its bonds so that it would have the flexibility to grow its balance sheet again if the markets needed the support this could not have come at a worse time as it meant that the larger deficits created by the tax cuts would have to be funded by private capital markets thereby crowding out less creditworthy borrowers it should have surprised no one that the process of selling bonds called quantitative tightening qt the opposite of qe stimulus would put downward pressure on stocks and as it happens the beginning of the bear market corresponds almost exactly to the october expansion of the quantitative tightening program from 8 billion to 50 billion per month as investors then expected the qt program to continue on automatic pilot the concern spread quickly fortunately for them powell has since pulled the plug on the automatic pilot this was the spark that has ignited our january rally from here there are two possibilities either the fed continues to raise interest rates and follows through with its planned draw down of its balance sheet in which case the country may find itself in a long overdue and deep recession and the market slide continues to who knows where for some thoughts on where market valuations could be in the absence of stimulus see my november 14th 2018 commentary the stock market economy or it capitulates to market and presidential pressure and completely calls off further rate increases and balance sheet draw downs and while the latter dovish scenario may lead to a near term relief rally on wall street as we are seeing now the long term ramifications are not good that is especially true since the rate hikes of the past may already guarantee a recession even if the fed refrains from any more hikes in the future also simply ending qt will not be enough the next recession i believe and the surge in annual budget deficits that already exceeds 1 trillion will not only require a return to qe but on a scale that will exceed qe s 1 2 and 3 combined however if the stock market declines while the fed is still stimulating as i expect it will investors around the world may finally realize that the united states may have become a monetary roach motel where monetary stimulus checks in but it can never check out the economic house of cards that has supported us for a decade will finally be laid bare and investors may recognize that interest rates will never return to normal and that the size of the fed s balance sheet will rise in perpetuity at that point america may officially become the world s largest banana republic but without the bananas that means a crisis may not just be a garden variety financial crisis like the one experienced in 2008 but a far more extensive sovereign debt and currency crisis confidence in the u s dollar could plummet so a return to zirp and qe will not be a stimulus that revives the economy by creating the illusion of growth but an overdose that may kill our currency the developments of the past few weeks which reveal how little support there is for anything resembling fiscal and monetary discipline make this scenario all the more possible in our foxholes everyone will be praying and no one will actually have the courage to stand up and shoot but perhaps the biggest danger facing the american economy is not financial or monetary but political if we are currently entering a recession that proves to be even more severe than the last which i believe we are donald trump and the republican party will take the blame trump may become the trans formative president that voters hoped him to be but in the opposite way that they expected trump may accomplish for the democrats what jimmy carter accomplished for republicans 40 years ago even though carter did not create the horrible economy of the late 1970s he nevertheless bore the blame for a recession that was more than a decade in the making the failure of his policies to turn the economy around paved the way for the conservative republican backlash that elected ronald reagan in 1980 with the exception of the 1964 election republican presidential politics in the post war years had been dominated by centrist rockefeller republicans as a died in the wool barry goldwater conservative reagan s attempt to capture the presidential nomination in 1976 fell far short but by 1980 voters correctly concluded that the economic crisis had resulted from leftist policies that had been implemented by both democrats and rockefeller republicans the backlash permitted a true political shift to the right trump may accomplish the same thing in reverse when voters go to the polls in 2020 i believe the economy will be in shambles at that point the backlash against republicans will be in full swing voters will incorrectly assume that the policies of trump were actually right wing even though his deficit busting big spending approach had nothing to do with true conservatism disgust with trump may allow the unthinkable the election of a president from the far left of the democratic party what s worse this future kamala harris or bernie sanders will be able to rely on a solidly democratic congress to push their agenda through in short order we could get the full democratic socialist recipe much higher taxes much greater regulation on business universal health care student loan amnesty corporate racial and gender quotas renewable energy requirements and significant expansion of entitlement spending the resulting debt and economic restrictions will finally bring the american economy to its knees resulting in an inflationary depression unprecedented in our history but commonplace among other overly indebted nations that have gone down this fatal path we may have one last opportunity to take back the country in 2024 but if despite their abject failure the socialists retain power they may never lose it then our founding fathers experiment in self government and freedom will have finally ended in failure and the light on ronald reagan s city on a hill will shine no more read the original article at euro pacific capital best selling author peter schiff is the ceo and chief global

beijing and moscow have rarely had more reasons to rue the dollar s global dominance yet changing the status quo will be difficult and recent efforts to do so have yielded little the dollar isn t only the primary reserve currency held by other central banks it is also ubiquitous in trade and international capital markets making it crucial to the stability of emerging economies last year a soaring dollar rattled the developing world by making dollar debt more expensive for foreign borrowers to service the dollar s primacy boosts overseas demand for american assets which some economists believe lowers u s borrowing costs it also gives washington the ability to cut countries and organizations off from the world financial system because access ultimately requires links to u s banks that power rankles in tehran beijing moscow brussels and elsewhere yet after a drawn out crisis in the eurozone and a more recent slowdown in china the dollar s international pre eminence looks safer than ever concerns that a u s administration with an america first platform would diminish the dollar s global role haven t been borne out either we have seen a resurgence in the dominance of the dollar in cross border debt and a persistence in its role as a reserve currency says catherine schenk an economic historian at the university of oxford that is a product not just of euro weakness and a slowdown in yuan internationalization she says but also of the dollar s underlying advantages in times of uncertainty like today the liquidity of markets becomes even more important prof schenk says as the pool of dollar bonds issued by non u s governments and companies more than doubled between mid 2008 and last year to 9 564 trillion from 4 299 trillion international bonds in other currencies shrank to 5 672 trillion from 6 129 trillion according to the bank for international settlements international use of the euro once the dollar s clearest challenger has diminished since the eurozone sovereign debt crisis raised the specter of default on debts previously believed safe the euro s share of global reserves shrank to 20 5 in the third quarter of 2018 from 28 in 2009 china meanwhile has spent years trying to boost the international use of its currency including by encouraging offshore yuan trading and by recently introducing yuan oil contracts it has had some successes such as gaining a place in the international monetary fund s basket of reserve currencies but to make the yuan an international force economists and investors have long maintained beijing must permit freer movement of money across its borders instead facing a flood of capital outflows in 2015 16 it clamped down on investment outside of china and it is unlikely to make it easier to move money in and out of china now as growth slows and u s tariffs pinch its manufacturers the data isn t encouraging for beijing the offshore yuan bond market has shriveled in size ftse data shows and the yuan s share of global payments has receded according to figures from the swift banking network currency swap lines which china extended across south america africa europe and asia have largely gone unused beijing s flagship belt and road initiative meanwhile a 1 trillion program to fund infrastructure linking east asia and europe is often compared with the u s marshall plan the postwar aid program that helped rebuild europe but while that plan sated europe s desperate need for dollars for trade belt and road borrowers don t need or want much chinese yuan according to research by citigroup economists belt and road contractors prefer to receive dollars and all major recapitalizations of chinese lenders funding the program have been done in dollars the dollar does face some challenges russia s central bank sold or moved most of its u s treasurys last year official data shows as part of an overt de dollarization policy that includes closer links to china and in the long term the yuan s clout is likely to increase there are still capital controls and questions about the credibility of the institutions so it s far fetched to look at it as a reserve currency says claire dissaux head of global economics and strategy at millennium global investments in london but she says use of the yuan is likely to grow fueled by foreign investment in china s vast bond market the yuan also will eventually gain some reserve currency attributes especially within asia says arvind subramanian a nonresident senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics the yuan is tracked by several regional currencies he notes largely because other export nations in the region don t want to appear less competitive the fact that china has become a big trader helps its case for its currency to become a reserve currency mr subramanian says for the yuan to truly become a global reserve currency as a 2011 book of his predicted would happen by the next decade he says china must stabilize its economy and clean up its financial system source dow jones

the concept of globalization was first enunciated in academic circles as a cooperative business model many economists including theodore levitt claimed years ago that the world was undergoing a mixture of all cultures to become one common global culture the late american economist argued for a standardized marketing plan and said everywhere everything gets more and more like everything else as the world s preference structure is relentlessly homogenized the conceptualization of a global market approach was the first wave of globalization through which several companies developed new strategies and tactics within the competition arena today in its fourth wave driven by industry 4 0 globalization is discussed in almost all subcategories of politics economics culture and so on with the objective of ultimate interconnection in this way the world economic forum s wef ongoing annual meeting in davos has embraced globalization 4 0 as the overarching theme for hundreds of sessions where leaders from business government international organizations civil society academia media and the arts circles meet a key agent in the world turkey and its position in the fourth wave of globalization will also be discussed during various sessions of the forum treasury and finance minister berat albayrak will be at the wef today to address current economic trends particularly from turkey s outlook daily sabah held an in depth interview with the minister in terms of turkey s stance on the recent market volatility industry 4 0 high tech production and emerging markets daily sabah turkey has overcome economic turbulence with some effective measures how do you evaluate the last six months berat albayrak we have had really tough five years starting from mid 2013 we experienced so many challenges both at the global and regional levels such as the start of monetary tightening in advanced economies the civil war in syria and refugee flows to turkey to make matters worse we have also seen instability and changing priorities within the country over the course of the last five years we have seen elections and a constitutional referendum and a series of terrorist attacks naturally security and peace always come before economic objectives that s why economic policymaking was in the back seat of the policymaking agenda but since then the elections were held the terrorist threat has been diminished and a new system of government has been introduced thus economic policy has become the top priority again this is going to bring huge benefits with it and we are seeing the initial positive effects of change from these priorities since august it has been observed that our financial indicators have improved remarkably as of january 21 the turkish lira has appreciated 22 4 percent against the dollar the 10 year government bond yields decreased by 617 bps and the cds risk premium decreased by 256 points according to their peak points in august we have two key issues to address inflation and current account deficit the new economic program nep aims at addressing these through rebalancing fiscal discipline and structural transformation despite a very difficult first half with mounting pressures the measures we have taken have yielded really good results in inflation the current account and the fiscal front we are in the process of rebalancing where growth is going to slow down and then converge into the potential growth level of 5 percent over the next three years while the source of growth is going to rotate from domestic consumption to external demand monetary policy is there to tame inflation and it is doing a great job we as the fiscal authority are helping them without interfering with the independence of the turkish central bank after a significant exchange rate pass through where inflation peaked we managed to limit inflation and beat the nep and the central bank estimates we finished the year with 20 3 percent this year we are going to further reduce inflation down to levels of around 15 percent on the external deficit side we are posting consecutive current account surpluses since august improvement in trade balance and strong tourism revenues helped us on this front in 2018 exports grew by 7 percent while imports contracted by 4 6 percent this translates into a 28 4 percent decline in the trade deficit so 2018 exports stood at 168 billion while imports were at 223 billion the picture becomes starker after august over the august december period exports grew by 7 5 percent while imports declined by 23 percent the ratio of imports covered by exports in this five month period was realized at 90 percent and the trade deficit was at 8 billion as of november 2018 the annualized current account deficit declined by 13 4 billion compared to 2017 and stood at 33 9 billion while the nep target was 4 7 percent of the gdp thanks to strong exports it is going to be better than this and in the upcoming period this trend will continue and net foreign demand will give a strong positive contribution to growth for this year the current account is going to be around 3 percent of the gdp so we are going to achieve the nep target on the current account on the fiscal side we had a really difficult job there especially because the first half of the year was full of fiscal slippages but over the course of six months we delivered significant savings there so basically for 2018 the nep estimates a central government budget deficit of around tl 72 1 billion and the year end central government budget deficit came to tl 72 6 billion on the structural side we have also taken significant strides in a very short span of time we have restructured the turkish development bank and the real estate bank in the upcoming period we continue to take all the necessary steps the public sector transformation office is set up and it is functioning the office is going to lead the structural reform and public sector savings efforts this year ds with the main topic of the world economic forum being globalization 4 0 where do you think turkey stands and how should it move forward b a the world is changing and it is changing very fast london based scholar anthony giddens in one of his renowned books runaway world how globalization is reshaping our lives discusses the advent of a global cosmopolitan society extending his arguments beyond the merely economic giddens shows how our growing interdependence directly affects our daily lives industry 4 0 has pretty similar effects to globalization currently we are only focusing on the economic effects we have not yet thoroughly discussed the social impacts in store for us but you can be 100 percent sure that industry 4 0 and its aftereffects are going to shape and shove economic and social systems it is going to restructure almost every single economic and social activity from health to agriculture and from finance to industrial production while the concept of industry 4 0 is pretty new it is the natural next step of technological evolution we have seen over the last couple of decades digital technologies are expected to have a significant impact on various sectors for example mckinsey the management consulting firm forecasts that the global digital health market will grow to 233 billion by 2020 while the agricultural robotics market is expected to approach 20 billion in the same time frame digital technologies and advanced production technologies also have the potential to significantly increase the efficiency of manufacturing industries and their competitive edge the smart manufacturing technologies currently in place have the potential to increase the efficiency of the manufacturing industry by an average of 3 to 5 percent these technologies can reduce the amount of time machines remain idle by 30 50 percent furthermore advances in robotics technologies can increase labor force productivity by 45 to 55 percent by having robots perform both dangerous and routine tasks we have announced our digital turkey roadmap the document that sketches out our industry 4 0 transformation strategy this document sets our priorities for digital transformation of our manufacturing industry we have developed this document on the basis of public private cooperation as part of this transformation we have established the digital transformation platform in industry the platform brings together all the large nongovernmental organizations ngos with an economic mandate adopting this trend is going to help us address the current account deficit problem permanently while facilitating high value added production in turkey ds what are the contributions of the use of advanced technology in production to the turkish economy our manufacturing industry has one single systematic problem we are exporting low and mid tech while we are importing high tech this naturally translates into persistent external imbalances approximately 30 percent of our manufacturing and 37 percent of our exports consist of medium and high tech products while the eu s medium and high tech products comprise 63 percent of their total exports one of our priorities is to increase our exports of medium and high tech products and achieve the eu average some 10 percent of the difference is in medium tech and 16 percent is in high tech products high tech sectors are those affected by digitalization the most therefore it is absolutely essential that we digitize our industry in order to increase our high tech manufacturing and exports we know that we have to move up the value chain produce more high value added products to this end we are adopting a sector oriented prioritization scheme pharmaceuticals energy petrochemicals machinery and equipment and software are going to be on the forefront of public sector incentives we are restructuring our support for research and development r d spending so far we have provided incentives to r d to further leverage technology and r d we are going to adopt the public private partnership ppp model for technology and r d investments to further foster high tech and innovative production we are going to establish industry and technology zones these zones are going to host vast domestic and foreign investments these measures will help us create more value added and increase our competitiveness in the international markets ds what do you think awaits emerging economies particularly turkey this year it has been 10 years since the global financial crisis this crisis affected all of us homes were lost jobs were shed and businesses were shut down then came the tide of reversal the long but bumpy road of recovery after a series of policy measures whose effects we still feel the pace of growth over the past 10 years was robust but still below the pre crisis average in 2017 we saw really strong and broad based growth last year we also experienced a relatively positive outlook however at the same time we saw stronger downside risks to outlook such as increased protectionism and the risk of a trade war looming on the horizon so what we are seeing is waning risk appetite declining capital flows to the emerging markets and a pickup in inflation in advanced economies with normalization in monetary policies against this backdrop we also saw that global expansion seems to be weakened by the relatively softer performance of germany and china apparently the u s federal reserve the fed the risk of trade war and the unfolding of brexit are going to shape the risk appetite in the short term this year automation cloud computing big data analytics and the internet of things iot are changing the world this change is all encompassing these large scale developments transform production structures alter the fundamentals of how we do business enhance connectivity facilitate interaction fuel innovation and redefine the boundaries of competitive advantage these improvements coupled with the availability of better education and international integration fuel the rise of the emerging market em economies the ems have been the engine of global economic and commercial growth in the last couple of decades thanks to the broad based and strong growth in the ems a significant chunk of global population rose from poverty global prosperity improved and global policy making environment became more inclusive but despite all the developments the ems as a whole are still in the convergence process we have traveled a huge distance but we still have a lot more to go we will see a really different picture in the coming decades with the further rise of the ems ds how can the high potential of turkey boost the global economy with its 2019 goals turkey has huge potential and provides significant opportunities for investors the businesses that invest in turkey can seize the opportunities not only in turkey but also in a wider region investors also have access to the european union as turkey has a customs union with the eu turkey also has historic cultural and linguistic ties with many countries in central asia the middle east the balkans and africa we have a dynamic and young population that supports an innovative vibrant competitive productive base we have very strong physical infrastructures combining all sorts of transportation and energy we are right at the intersection of the north south and the east west energy corridors hosting almost eight oil and gas pipelines we have a huge network of highways and we are further improving our highway system through a series of ppp projects we also have a strong network of air traffic almost all of our cities have active airports and there are regular domestic and international flights from these cities we are also taking significant steps to improve our railway network modern high speed railway lines are active across major cities and we are taking every measure to further improve this network and we have very favorable market conditions suggesting lucrative business opportunities
by peter schiff goldseek com tuesday 22 january 2019 they say that there are no atheists in fox holes recently it has also become clear there are no monetary hawks in bear markets for much of the last decade many conservative market analysts have decried our reliance on monetary stimulus to prop up the economy and the stock market but in the final months of 2018 in the face of the worst stock market declines in a decade many of these supposedly pragmatic figures quickly abandoned their convictions as the markets briefly crossed into bear territory monetary hawks joined with the doves and president trump in issuing a full throated call for the fed to cancel their planned rate hikes and balance sheet reductions it appears as if the fed got the message almost overnight the tone from the fed softened considerably causing wall street to sound the all clear during the obama years many of these erstwhile hawks appeared to partially share my belief that big deficits were a big problem and that an economy built on a foundation of zero percent interest rates quantitative easing and deficit spending was not a real economy at all donald trump picked up that message in the 2016 campaign and it rang true to many americans who were justifiably resentful that the bubbles created by these policies primarily benefited the rich but now that there is a republican in the white house and a whiff of fear on wall street those concerns have vanished faster than a cool summer breeze in texas but let s be clear there was nothing normal about the nearly decade long record breaking bull run in the s p 500 that came to a spectacular end this christmas eve during the run the s p more than quadrupled from february 2009 and never retrenched more than the 20 there was also nothing normal in its spectacular ending the worst december since 1931 during the great depression was capped by the biggest christmas eve massacre delaying the santa claus rally until the fed grinch had a change of heart as it turns out all the markets wanted for christmas was a dovish fed and when jerome powell finally started singing the right tune the december massacre quickly gave way to a great opening to 2019 in the equity markets the surge has caused many to think that the worst is behind us but such a conclusion ignores both the size of the bubble that has formed over the past decade and what real bear markets actually look like according to cnbc on average the bear markets since world war ii have lasted 13 months with stocks losing an average of 30 4 percent of their value in each episode krooney cnbc 12 24 18 with the notable exception of the black monday crash in 1987 which took just one day to cross into bear territory these downturns developed over many months and continued after the 20 threshold was crossed the two most recent bear markets of this century not counting the current bear provide stark illustrations of these tendencies after a record surge in the late 1990s investors finally realized in march of 2000 that companies with no profits or revenues were not good bets but even with this vital revelation it took eleven months for the market to fall back from its record high and to cross into a bear territory after that stocks trended downward for an additional 18 months eventually resulting in a 40 3 total decline by late september 2002 all through that bear market alan greenspan s federal reserve pushed back against the declines by slashing interest rates by more than 400 basis points without such dramatic stimulus i believe the losses would have been far worse the stimulus eventually helped ignite a furious rally that pushed stocks up 90 from september 2002 to october 2007 the trade off for truncating a bear market in stocks was creating a housing bubble that resulted in the 2008 financial crisis when it popped just two months before the great recession began in december of 2007 the s p began declining again this time it took 10 months for the index to cross into bear market territory but like the dotcom episode the 20 decline was just the beginning it took another eight months for the selling to finally come to an end with stocks declining a total 56 from the 2007 highs this time the fed responded with an even larger dose of stimulus fed chairman bernanke cut the overnight rate by 500 basis points 100 more than 2002 but when zero percent rates were not enough to turn stocks around the fed reached for a new tool called quantitative easing the policy authorized the fed to buy bonds to inject liquidity directly into the financial markets and essentially push real rates below zero under the program the fed eventually bought more than 4 trillion in bonds the vast majority of which still remain on the fed s balance sheet despite all this the s p still lost more than half its value by march 2009 but the bear market of 2018 began in a much more spectacular fashion than what we saw in 2000 or 2007 we crossed into bear territory in less than two months unfortunately history would suggest that we might have a long way to go before it ends the importance of quantitative easing in the previous stock market bubble becomes clear when you overlay market performance with the chronology of the program the majority of the gains of the 2009 2018 bull market occurred when qe from the fed was active from the time the program was launched until it was finally wound down in october 2014 the s p 500 gained about 195 in fact that was the very purpose of qe to raise asset prices thereby creating a paper wealth effect that would encourage more borrowing and spending and therefore create economic growth and while asset prices rose and the borrowing and spending certainly occurred the growth never maintained the 3 targets that most economists expected without the qe wind in our sails the market stalled from october 2014 until october 2016 the market was up only 3 something else was needed to push stocks up that catalyst arrived in the form of donald trump markets believed that the pro business swamp draining trump would transform the economy the way ronald reagan had in the 1980s after the initial post election euphoria the trump tax cuts arrived to provide a fresh dose of short term fiscal stimulus to offset the withdrawal of monetary stimulus coming from fed rate hikes the business tax cuts boosted corporate bottom lines and funded a new round of share buybacks while stoking business and consumer confidence the rally that began on election day 2016 added another impressive chapter to the bull market pushing the s p up 35 until september 2018 but since government spending actually rose as taxes fell the tax cuts provided no real economic relief a larger government needs to drain even more resources from the private sector to operate so what the government no longer collected in taxes it had to borrow instead not surprisingly deficits have soared under trump a development that appears to have caused no alarm whatsoever among traditional republican deficit hawks however in early 2018 the fed began its long discussed plan to shrink its balance sheet by selling significant quantities of its bonds so that it would have the flexibility to grow its balance sheet again if the markets needed the support this could not have come at a worse time as it meant that the larger deficits created by the tax cuts would have to be funded by private capital markets thereby crowding out less creditworthy borrowers it should have surprised no one that the process of selling bonds called quantitative tightening qt the opposite of qe stimulus would put downward pressure on stocks and as it happens the beginning of the bear market corresponds almost exactly to the october expansion of the quantitative tightening program from 8 billion to 50 billion per month as investors then expected the qt program to continue on automatic pilot the concern spread quickly fortunately for them powell has since pulled the plug on the automatic pilot this was the spark that has ignited our january rally from here there are two possibilities either the fed continues to raise interest rates and follows through with its planned draw down of its balance sheet in which case the country may find itself in a long overdue and deep recession and the market slide continues to who knows where for some thoughts on where market valuations could be in the absence of stimulus see my november 14th 2018 commentary the stock market economy or it capitulates to market and presidential pressure and completely calls off further rate increases and balance sheet draw downs and while the latter dovish scenario may lead to a near term relief rally on wall street as we are seeing now the long term ramifications are not good that is especially true since the rate hikes of the past may already guarantee a recession even if the fed refrains from any more hikes in the future also simply ending qt will not be enough the next recession i believe and the surge in annual budget deficits that already exceeds 1 trillion will not only require a return to qe but on a scale that will exceed qe s 1 2 and 3 combined however if the stock market declines while the fed is still stimulating as i expect it will investors around the world may finally realize that the united states may have become a monetary roach motel where monetary stimulus checks in but it can never check out the economic house of cards that has supported us for a decade will finally be laid bare and investors may recognize that interest rates will never return to normal and that the size of the fed s balance sheet will rise in perpetuity at that point america may officially become the world s largest banana republic but without the bananas that means a crisis may not just be a garden variety financial crisis like the one experienced in 2008 but a far more extensive sovereign debt and currency crisis confidence in the u s dollar could plummet so a return to zirp and qe will not be a stimulus that revives the economy by creating the illusion of growth but an overdose that may kill our currency the developments of the past few weeks which reveal how little support there is for anything resembling fiscal and monetary discipline make this scenario all the more possible in our foxholes everyone will be praying and no one will actually have the courage to stand up and shoot but perhaps the biggest danger facing the american economy is not financial or monetary but political if we are currently entering a recession that proves to be even more severe than the last which i believe we are donald trump and the republican party will take the blame trump may become the trans formative president that voters hoped him to be but in the opposite way that they expected trump may accomplish for the democrats what jimmy carter accomplished for republicans 40 years ago even though carter did not create the horrible economy of the late 1970s he nevertheless bore the blame for a recession that was more than a decade in the making the failure of his policies to turn the economy around paved the way for the conservative republican backlash that elected ronald reagan in 1980 with the exception of the 1964 election republican presidential politics in the post war years had been dominated by centrist rockefeller republicans as a died in the wool barry goldwater conservative reagan s attempt to capture the presidential nomination in 1976 fell far short but by 1980 voters correctly concluded that the economic crisis had resulted from leftist policies that had been implemented by both democrats and rockefeller republicans the backlash permitted a true political shift to the right trump may accomplish the same thing in reverse when voters go to the polls in 2020 i believe the economy will be in shambles at that point the backlash against republicans will be in full swing voters will incorrectly assume that the policies of trump were actually right wing even though his deficit busting big spending approach had nothing to do with true conservatism disgust with trump may allow the unthinkable the election of a president from the far left of the democratic party what s worse this future kamala harris or bernie sanders will be able to rely on a solidly democratic congress to push their agenda through in short order we could get the full democratic socialist recipe much higher taxes much greater regulation on business universal health care student loan amnesty corporate racial and gender quotas renewable energy requirements and significant expansion of entitlement spending the resulting debt and economic restrictions will finally bring the american economy to its knees resulting in an inflationary depression unprecedented in our history but commonplace among other overly indebted nations that have gone down this fatal path we may have one last opportunity to take back the country in 2024 but if despite their abject failure the socialists retain power they may never lose it then our founding fathers experiment in self government and freedom will have finally ended in failure and the light on ronald reagan s city on a hill will shine no more
last october philip hammond the uk chancellor of the exchequer in the annual federal budget speech to the uk parliament said this austerity is coming to an end but discipline will remain talk about orwellian doublespeak the truth about austerity is that it is a means of social control or as hammond put it discipline hammond s recent comment is completely illogical austerity is economic discipline really it s just a way of making the poor suffer more while continuing to bail out the rich every time they implode the economy it s rare that the titans of finance slip up so well and so egregiously with their language but it happens this being an excellent case study now we know straight from the source just what economic experts being mouthpieces of multinational corporations really want just as much or even more than austerity discipline or another way of putting it they want austerity except we aren t supposed to realize that we live in austerity anymore or at least don t try and resist these people want a normalization of austerity until we just accept that this is the way it is a cursory look at the upcoming uk budget shows more of the same billions to update the nuclear weapon systems continued cuts for many government ministries cuts to scotland when considering inflation rates a cap on total welfare spending with a few crumbs for their universal credit benefits etc all of this is happening while homelessness is rising dramatically up 169 since 2010 so what kind of discipline is mr hammond really talking about a writer for vice one simon childs succinctly summed it up in the end spreadsheet phil went with austerity is coming to an end but discipline will remain so it s not over it s coming to an end at some point but discipline will remain for which you can read austerity so really that s austerity is coming to an end but austerity will remain if that sounds contradictory that s because it is austerity is a decade long ideological project which has seen poor and working class people pay for the financial crash through cutting the supposed largesse of the welfare state the government is trying to loosen spending up a bit while the effects of that project become even more stark as many commentators have pointed out austerity is not based on any rational sense of finance or macroeconomic forces it is an ideological mission a moral argument stemming back to the puritan calvinist and social darwinist worldview if you re poor it s your fault and all one has to do is pull oneself up by your bootstraps societal and systemic forces which consistently lead to high unemployment substandard education lack of social support structures and stagnant wages are never addressed what better way to keep people disciplined than to offload public spending onto the citizenry thus forcing private citizen especially the poor and middle class to pay more for essential services this has predictably led to an explosion in college and personal debt the super ego always judging itself produces a type of mental enslavement and has now engulfed the globe in late stage capitalism we are taught to always blame ourselves because we are not marketable don t keep up with technology aren t innovating or learning life skills to keep up in a gig service economy with rising rates of poverty which also is hollowing out all social forms of purpose and collective belonging the us educational system is complicit in this since this is the first public institution most of us enter a regimented oppressive nightmare of one size fits all deluges of mostly useless information where children are always competing and one upping each other with grades achievements etc as long as we were obedient little drones who raised our hands to ask questions sat when told to repeated the pledge of allegiance every day and in general were with our parent s complicity spoon fed lies omissions and distortions of historical scientific and sociological facts we could one day participate in adult life successfully of course the more obvious sites for adult coercion and brainwashing barely need mention jails churches mental institutions large corporations federal bureaucracies etc the history of public education in our country is a history of indoctrination or something worse of which the horrors are so great they cannot be put into words if one examines the african american or indigenous histories of schooling modern schooling is freaking twelve years of boot camp for the adult world of bio psycho social alienated labor there is no use denying or getting around this fact the psycho somatic beatings endured become embedded in our minds and the trauma is relived and has been passed down generation to generation this has created a militaristic society yet also a pacified and slavish one which submissively bows down before capitalist imperialist colonialist systems of hierarchy we are the docile bodies that foucault spoke of we ve been molded for the purpose of fitting into increasingly mentally damaging forms of labor the stress of daily work in the us has almost completely precluded any serious resistance i cannot stress this enough as bodies synchronizing the finely tuned engine of capital we are poised to destroy ourselves and the majority of species on the planet if we continue down this path once again surprise surprise the language we use has been beaten into us and is a formidable weapon in the arsenal of capital there s a humorous anecdote in this monthly review article by rebecca stoner spotlighting john patrick leary when general motors laid off more than 6 000 workers days after thanksgiving john patrick leary the author of the new book keywords the new language of capitalism tweeted out part of gm ceo mary barra s statement the actions we are taking today continue our transformation to be highly agile resilient and profitable while giving us the flexibility to invest in the future she said leary added a line of commentary to barra s statement language was pronounced dead at the scene as stoner explains when it comes to words like entrepreneur when we talk about entrepreneurs with an uncritical acceptance we implicitly accept view that wealth was created by entrepreneurs via a process of innovation and creative destruction rather than marx s belief that wealth is appropriated to the bourgeois class by exploitation this is why i always think of don miguel ruiz s first agreement be impeccable with your word so phillip hammond was being perfect with his wording really he wants discipline dammit others take a more well mendacious approach to their phraseology when people say that jail will rehabilitate prisoners or that innovation increased productivity and hard work will provide the tools to lead a 21st century economy i am skeptical especially with regard our carceral industrial complex how obviously and openly corrupt and racist the prison system is in our country where length of sentences are absurdly long compared to other nations and rates of jailing are exponentially higher for black and brown peoples with 10 cent an hour wages metered out for a smoke snack foods or a cell phone call while the largest corporations make billions off of what amounts to slave labor which mind you the chinese have been replicating with the uyghur population in xinjiang province i d rather those in power tell us how they really feel in a lecture on nietzsche with a nod to foucault rick roderick put it quite well the idea that we would send someone to prison in order to rehabilitate them now we re getting to be more honest about that we re getting a little more barbaric and for nietzsche that d be better it d be a little more honest we re sending them to prison because we re scared of them and we know if they go there really bad things will happen to them and it will ruin their lives and that will make us happy that s what we should say when we send one to prison that is what it comes down to for today s centers of power kill jail torture or condemn those lower on the totem pole to lives of penury marginalization and unpleasant labor the chthonic chant from trump s base is connected to this impulse lock her up build the wall whoever you can t control so easily ply them with media drugs fame money power this is how the system was designed from the early days of the enlightenment as foucault asks rhetorically in disciple and punish the birth of the prison is it surprising that prisons resemble factories schools barracks hospitals which all resemble prisons architecturally one of the more famous blueprints for constant surveillance interrogations examinations and constant monitoring of the social body came from bentham s design of the panopticon we notice the ones under surveillance or even those who think they re being watched increasingly self censor and self monitor themselves to avoid untoward further investigation or physical violence from state authorities whether inside an institution or outside in the public sphere rather than rehabilitation the modern notion of discipline is to induce punishment and goshdarnit our culture sure does know how to punish those less fortunate on any given year between 10 and 20 million people worldwide die of starvation even as silos of food lie full all over the usa and europe preventable childhood diseases kill perhaps another 10 million kids a year a mobilization of food medicine and competent medical professionals along with a logistics network to access hard to reach rural areas in the global south could solve these crises within a short time frame today we see disciplinarian methods used as a general principle a blunt instrument applied to daily life where conformism homogenization and compliance to authority dictate modern culture in work and the home also people avoid vocalizing their internal critiques of the state authority or the economy for fear of social reprisal becoming an outcast and basic issues of self survival in minority communities under attack from police brutality in an atmosphere of generalized anxiety suspicion and paranoia here we begin to uncover the archaeological or rather genealogical evidence and the ideological underpinnings of centers of power ideologues economists and capitalists do not need to explicitly promote austerity they can just change the name but they do need a certain type of discipline and the contrived system of artificial scarcity which keeps the multitude desperate this destructive economic system which we dub neoliberal stymies thought kills dreams exploits labor and reaches into all facets of political and daily life in such an authoritarian state today just as in ages ago women and children bear the worst forms of abuse and punishment even as they do most of the work either unpaid in the home or in professional employment women still must deal with performing emotional labor for men in the west that have not self analyzed and cannot see how they directly benefit from patriarchal institutions of power that filter down into the workplace community home etc the sociological make up of the middle classes constantly under threat of falling into penury until european and north american capitalist states underwent a significant shift in the late 19th and 20th centuries constant competition the modern factory and striving for status and material affluence shifted the previous belief in a protestant work ethic towards one of social darwinism and from there to a consumer based age of affluence where the might of economic powers to exploit becomes an inherent right where monopolistic corporations use advertising to continually encourage consumptive addictive and childish behavioral patterns coupled with eugenics and the westward spread of us territories under the ideology of manifest destiny the genocidal policies of social darwinism and racist medical practices spread worldwide the professional classes were fascism s most slavish disciples medical doctors joined the nazi party at a higher rate some say 7 times the rate of joining as the average job than any other profession in germany the harsh unrelenting regime of discipline inherent in such bourgeois values creates a new form of human behavior and outlook towards society one which erich fromm called the marketing orientation as he wrote the mature and productive individual derives his feeling of identity from the experience of himself as the agent who is one with his powers this feeling of self can be briefly described as meaning i am what i do in the marketing orientation man encounters his own powers as commodities alienated from him he is not one with them but they are masked from him because what matters is not his self realization in the process of using them but his success in the process of selling them both his powers and what they create become estranged something different from himself something for others to judge and to use thus his feeling of identity becomes as shaky as his self esteem it is constituted by the sum total of roles one can play i am as you desire me it is worth remembering that mainstream economists such as philip hammond or before him fools such as milton friedman or alan greenspan in the us are not basing their budgets or speeches or interest rates or stupid powerpoint presentations for corrupt elites on any rational model any shred of common sense to help working classes or even middle class citizens these people are pr spokespeople for capitalists nothing more they are as the multinational corporations and financial sector desire them we are all sort of becoming who the centers of power want us to be pliable obedient cowed desperate also more hardened isolated commodified and easier to control the social conditioning is so deep here in the us when philip hammond says discipline will remain the capitalist and colonialist policies he and his elite associates pursue have global consequences the effect of his words may be hidden from many western eyes but they are not any different from the direct violence in previous eras of the corrupt town sheriff the racist prison warden the sadistic psychiatrist the violent headmaster of a school the conquistador the slave owner the ss officer this is in fact exactly what modern day discipline is words ideas images stock markets debt ratios and the concepts of the ruling classes become material life threatening issues which undergird our system of artificial scarcity the spreading of this dark cloud of western civilization with all the concomitant issues of technology worship reification and commodification of the human spirit and creativity continues to tell us be disciplined be rational be good citizens even to be human in a specific sense passed down by enlightenment figures it is unsurprising that many decades ago the first theoretical models for the post human age were underway since the beginning of the so called anthropocene era we have seen how the artificial divisions of nature and culture have been exposed even today much postmodern art and critique which opens up new avenues for research by exploring ideas surrounding intersubjectivity depthlessness waning of affect etc still indulges in the fantasy of isolated separate urban centered and rational humans as a given despite the push by liberal democracies to spread a certain type of modern propaganda reminding us of our so called secular materialist cosmopolitan consumer society the urge for spirituality for raising of consciousness still remains strong in contemporary culture via the rapidly expanding interest in yoga meditation mindfulness practices psychedelics another term is entheogens and even paganism in the west yet even many of these basic self exploratory and self coping mechanisms are increasingly and continually mediated through corporations or at least small businesses and hierarchies at the expense of cooperative and communal forms of organization what i think would be beneficial for people to think about is a return to a notion popular in 60s counterculture the idea of a new sensibility or sense abilities as it were readers may know about the ideas of fury generated towards its most vocal theoretical promoters susan sontag herbert marcuse norman o brown i believe it would be worthwhile to revisit those concepts in his speech liberation from the affluent society marcuse said let us give one illustration of the need for such a total rupture was present in some of the great social struggles of our period walter benjamin quotes reports that during the paris commune in all corners of the city there were people shooting at clocks on the towers of churches palaces and so on thereby consciously of half consciously expressing the need that somehow time has to be arrested that at least the prevailing established time continuum has to be arrested and that a new time has to begin he continues this situation presupposes the emergence of new needs qualitatively different and even opposed to the prevailing aggressive and repressive needs the emergence of a new type of human with a vital biological drive for liberation and with a consciousness capable of breaking through the material as well as ideological veil of the affluent society society has invaded even the deepest roots of individual existence even the unconscious of man we must get at the roots of society in the individuals themselves who because of social engineering constantly reproduce the continuum of repression further on he states to give sensitivity and sensibility their own right is i think one of the basic goals of integral socialism they presuppose a total trans valuation of values a new anthropology we may say that today qualitative change liberation involves organic instinctual biological changes at the same time as political and social changes no longer subject to the dictates of capitalist profitability and of efficiency socially necessary labor material production would and could become increasingly scientific it means that the creative imagination would become a productive force applied to the transformation of the social and natural universe quite clearly and perhaps being a tad self conscious he later says and now i throw in a terrible concept it would mean an aesthetic reality society as a work of art indeed marcuse goes on to cite in the western tradition hippies diggers and provos as groups we can think of many more today especially indigenous cultures who offered a new sensibility against efficient and insane reasonableness it is intense social engineering and insane reasonableness which we are loath to stand up against due to our own relative affluence today that affluence is disappearing especially in the developing world as climate change and ecological devastation threatens all in the west the stores may be open and the planes may run on time but late capitalism is running on fumes the veil remains along with elitist media manipulation which distracts and diverts public attention but various anti capitalist forces are arrayed at its edges preparing to draw in the masses discipline has been unmasked for what it really is a one way ticket to an early grave for the poor or a lifetime of spiritual turmoil for the ruling class and the collaborating professional managerial class flunkies and sycophants yet again the violence of words such as productivity efficiency free markets national sovereignty etc all contribute to the intolerable living conditions for large portions of the world s population this is the metaphysics of capital where abstract business concepts have very real and deadly consequences jason read writes in crisis and critique labor power must be made virtual and then productive the foundation of the capitalist relationship is the separation of workers form the means of production and thus the potential of labor power as a potential once this potential is sold enters into the workplace it must be actualized transformed into actual productive acts he goes on to cite pierre macherey student of althusser from this point of view we could say that when the capitalist occupies himself with his workers labor power which he has acquired the right to employ in exchange for a wage treating it as a productive power whose productivity he intends to increase in order to produce relative surplus value he practices metaphysics not in a theoretical but in a practical way he practices this peculiar sort of metaphysics not during his leisure time as a distraction or mental exercise as he would a crossword puzzle but throughout the entire working day dedicated to production by opening up his company to notions such as power capacity and causation he thereby makes them a reality realizing these fictions these products of the mind which he then employs with daunting efficacy in this way with payrolls and charts of organizational tasks at hand he shows better than a philosopher s abstract proofs that the work of metaphysics could not be more material provided that one knows how to put it to good use in introducing it into the factory one could incidentally derive from this a new and caustic definition of metaphysics in this rather specific context it boils down to a mechanism for profit making which is no small matter this means that amongst other inventions that have changed the course of history capitalism has found the means the procedure the trick enabling it to put abstract concepts into practice the hallmark of its genius more bluntly the contributors at the website endnotes put it like this the abstract universal value whose existence is posited by the exchange abstraction acquires a real existence vis à vis particular concrete labours which are subsumed under it the real existence of abstractions which acquire the ability to subsume the concrete world of production under them and posit themselves as the truth of this world is for marx nothing other than a perverted enchanted ontologically inverted reality the absurdity and violence which hegel perceives in a relation of subsumption applies not only to hegel s system itself but also to the actual social relations of capitalist society as one can see it takes a very specific sort of discipline to deploy this type of thought as well as to mouth the pr double plus good newspeak that philip hammond and the gm executive spoke of above as we have seen through history the consequences are not pretty this shackling of the human spirit molds workers in a totalitarian way and becomes the baseline ideology for accessing elite institutions of knowledge and power hence this is why some today speak of total subsumption in this sense production via exploitation of labor power only speaks of half of the problem the flip side is that humans are produced as cogs or put another way the social reproduction of the masses is instilled by the constant reminder under capitalism to be productive market yourself speak appropriately in every varied situation etc thus humans are molded to believe in the need for police tax collection agencies borders and industrial civilization as usual the unwaged labor of care work in the home continues to oppress women around the globe as feminists such as martha gimenez kathi weeks nancy fraser silvia federici and many others have shown words cannot express how far capitalism extends into daily life or the amount of harmful and hateful behavior it has led to humans are valued only insofar as they are productive productive in a myopic framework designed to narrow consciousness reduce potentialities blight the human condition and destroy and degrade wildlife and ecosystems people all over the world are simply being farmed for their labor power their creativity their social media posts to pay taxes the various licenses fees and insurances needed to secure a bare means of existence not only are the elite thriving economically the 1 are estimated to live 10 years longer than the average of the 99 as danny dorling explains in inequality and the 1 the modern calendar and clock also regiment divides and orients our perception around the holy grail of productivity turning human potentialities for creativity for organic agriculture for art for useful crafts for efficient renewable energy systems for basic joy and destroy those possibilities instead we find abstract notions of labor and value which are then actualized and concretized into power paving the way for progress our time system essentially from the very beginning of western civilization in mesopotamia started with set dates for repaying debts which eventually morphed into regularly scheduled time frames for starting wars shackling us all to a five day work week etc our time system is the operating system for empire its software hence the parisians desire to end it solutions lie in listening to indigenous peoples worldwide who have been living sustainably for millennia via processes of trust building of starting truth and reconciliation for past atrocities and modern day dispossession of growing communities based on non profit cooperatives etc tight knit indigenous livelihoods counter the growth of destructive forms of modern discipline an unnatural system of time instrumental reason capitalism racism and patriarchy through power structures distributed horizontally with deliberative bodies and direct democratic practices authentic resistance against our system should therefore question and dispel the lies embedded in what the rulers and functionaries of capital call discipline our interior lives have been colonized our jobs are alienating and exploitative and our social media and data are now harvested for wealth the abstractions of capital must be abandoned perhaps only by returning to the integral the holistic something closer to the earth by finding something elemental by reigniting desire can the vast utopian dreams and potentialities which for many lie dormant lead us to find some sort of joy and sustainable methods of living to transform this mad society
cnbc excerpts cnbc s squawk box broadcasts live from the world economic forum in davos switzerland today tuesday january 22 when today tuesday january 22 2019 where cnbc s squawk box live from the world economic forum in davos switzerland following are unofficial excerpts from cnbc interviews which aired on cnbc s squawk box m f 6am 9am today january 22nd live from the world economic forum in davos switzerland get our activist investing case study get the full activist investing study in pdf q3 hedge fund letters conference scoops etc interviews included valueact ceo jeffrey ubben imf chair christine lagarde salesforce ceo marc benioff bank of america ceo brian moynihan marriott ceo arne sorenson blackstone ceo steve schwarzman canada s minister of international trade diversification james carr atlantic council ceo fred kempe and financial times u s managing editor gillian tett ihs markit vice chair dan yergin ups ceo david abney guggenheim global chief investment officer scott minerd carlyle group co founder and co executive chair david rubenstein bridgewater co cio ray dalio ibm ceo ginni rometty silver lake partners north island co founder glenn hutchins and bp ceo bob dudley links to video of the interviews are included below all references must be sourced to cnbc cnbc s sara eisen with valueact ceo jeffrey ubben jeffrey ubben on financials it seems like at the end of the year because the yield curve would invert one basis point the computers were talking to computers and the active investors kind of ran out of money and they just there was some sort of sell financials at any price so now you have a situation where you ve got companies that are almost utilitarian in nature because there s so much regulation and they re so de risked that actually they re low risk entities and they re pretty fortified against a lot of macro risk jeffrey ubben on corporate governance the idea that the extreme is this accepted principle that corporate governance serves only one purpose which is to maximize shareholder value i think that and specifically that means that the role of corporate governance is not in the interest of the overall firm or in the interest of assisting and achieving a corporate purpose so you get this weird dynamic where profit follows purpose or the idea that purpose you know profit leads eisen right purpose is secondary ubben and to me that s just ass backwards right so in this way i think capital markets and public companies are showing their limitations in terms of how they can play a role in societal good jeffrey ubben on gov policy government is so important and so part of the solution and the trust in government and the trust in companies is gone which is why you see millennials looking for companies to reassert corporate trust but idea that companies have to be more involved in policy only because the good actors are gonna be dragged down by the bad actors if they don t get involved in government policy you know so i think it s in a company s interest to be very proactive on policy cnbc s sara eisen with imf chair christine lagarde christine lagarde on tariff risks we look now at tariff increases that have taken place and that are beginning to have an impact however small we re looking at threats we re looking at an attempt to resolve it but we re not seeing really the end of those negotiations we are also seeing now a market which has i think taken account of that and we ve seen market values change dramatically over the last few months and now you know stabilized again but you have a compounding effect that is resulting in obviously some instability some volatility and we believe particularly from the advanced economies it will have an impact christine lagarde on china we have not revisited the growth forecast for china it s still at 6 2 and we believe that the chinese authorities for the moment are taking the right policy measures in terms of credit tightening on the one hand and in terms of appropriate stimulus on the other one but clearly any worsening in terms of trade threats would reduce confidence would have an impact on that growth which is clearly one of the two key economies in the world at the moment christine lagarde on brexit it s a big uncertainty within europe and certainly for the u k economy itself but it s also an uncertainty because of the role played by london as a financial center and how will that sort of be either rebalanced or kept as is what will be the equivalences granted what will stay in london what will eventually go christine lagarde on no deal brexit it s obviously the worst case scenario and anything short of that would be better but would also hurt the u k economy even the mildest scenario will you know add frictions will add difficulties will make transactions less smooth and transportation less convenient cnbc s sara eisen with salesforce ceo marc benioff marc benioff on economy on one level the economy is rocking you know that we continue to have good growth we re gonna have more good growth this year and but of course you ve got you know the mitigation for that growth against brexit the trade war eisen lots of uncertainty benioff foreign exchange issues rates that s on peoples minds but it doesn t it s not dominant the main thing is people are growing they re investing and they re ready to go forward and it s an exciting davos marc benioff on the crisis of trust we re navigating through a crisis of trust ceos don t help themselves if we have a crisis of trust and they re not helping the homeless or they re not helping people who need them and certainly if they re abusing their product or abusing the data that they re collecting i mean those ceos need to they need to also wake up and they need to realize that they can t do that anymore marc benioff on ai you cannot continue to do these terrible things to the world with your technology and you re gonna see more of that as ai gets further unleashed you re getting this next wave of artificial intelligence so the tech lash could get amplified if ceos don t make change now they need to wake up marc benioff san francisco trainwreck san francisco is kind of a train wreck we have a real inequality problem we have eisen is that because of the tech sector benioff it s because of the tech sector cnbc s squawk box with bank of america ceo brian moynihan brian moynihan on consumer strength we think the consumer is very strong right now spending a lot on experiences there s you know a lot of talk about car sales slowing down or house sales and things like that but there s lots going into experiences dinners and travel and stuff very strong very strong ending the year 4th quarter strong christmas was strong and january so far has been strong relatively brian moynihan on bank earnings we were happy that we were on the top of the heap no question that s obvious but i think the trading business was really the month of december was really kind of strange and it s kind of it s moved back to where it s more normal and things but it was really a strange time the shutdown and everything the confluence of things that didn t go right were high so a lot of people had that kind of surprise at the end of the quarter going into november the businesses were performing basically at par brian moynihan on shifting workforce our view is that we have to let attrition be our friend so what happens is you re seeing a cycling year over year we re down maybe 4 000 5 000 people but you have 2 or 3 thousand more people facing customers and less people as we digitize and improve paper process and get rid of it and that s going to go on forever brian moynihan on the fed the minutes are clear that as they reach the neutral rate they have said we have to be careful now and watch we re data dependent and that is meeting to meeting an analogy a great economist once made to me think of them as climbing one of these mountains hand hold to hand hold there s no path left they ve reached the path and now the question is what they re going to do and that s going to be depending on the data cnbc s squawk box with marriott ceo arne sorenson arne sorenson on china the china story of course is a little bit complicated because we ve got the trade and we ve got a number of very high profile event that have happened but the china story is still a very constructive one in the travel space we re not in a business which is super sensitive from a national security perspective arne sorenson on china trade in china too you ve got risks on their economy because of trade you ve got also a shift towards consumerism which is helpful for us both of those things are sort of working their way through arne sorenson on recession i ve heard some people some folks say maybe we should just get a small recession now and get it over with because then we could stop worrying about the length of the cycle it could well be very mild and not very long arne sorenson on hacking we ve got to get it encrypted and we have to make sure that people have the confidence that the data that we keep is going to be kept only because we need to use it and we need to use it in a way that delivers ease and value to you and that s where we ve got to get and we re working as quickly as we can arne sorenson on experience people love to travel today more than ever and young people particularly would put travel very high on their list of things that they ve got to do when i was growing up it used to be a discretionary luxury now forget it i m going to take my vacation i m going to do that before i buy a car maybe before i get an apartment whatever and that s happening all around the world of course we talk about it in the sense of people want experiences more than they want stuff arne sorenson on instagram it partly is instagram and other social media where the consumption we now share and brag about in a way is the stuff we take pictures of cnbc s squawk box with blackstone ceo steve schwarzman steve schwarzman on china i think that both sides would like to see something happen each for their own reasons and the chinese laid it out a group of things they were prepared to do in argentina and i think they re following up on that i think on the u s side one of the really important things among others is compliance and there s some skepticism or need for clarification that if they agree on something the u s side wants to know if it s going to happen and one way to do that is to have a mechanism where if something isn t happening it can be appealed to the vice premier s office for resolution within 30 or 60 days some mechanism so it s not just people having agreements without the ability to make them happen steve schwarzman on global force each of the countries is a very very important global force number one and two in the world economically china s got the largest population and they each have some type of destiny some of which will be cooperative of course as it is and some of which will be competitive steve schwarzman on trade normalization normalization of trade and that s gonna take some time because the chinese system is so different with state owned companies as well as private companies as well as you know more restrictive access to their country typically than we have of ours and these things work out but they don t happen in a day or two they don t happen in a week or a month or a year steve schwarzman on economy slowing the u s economy is slowing from where it was remember you know two quarters ago it was at 4 2 growth which is unsustainable for a large country like the united states we ll probably grow this year somewhere around 2 5 maybe two and three quarters i don t see you know any recession i don t know where that came from the last two months of the year steve schwarzman on consumer confidence the consumer confidence is down a little bit which i think comes from you know some of the dysfunction but they re still spending a lot of money and we re a 70 consumer economy and so i see the u s sort of rolling along but at a lower rate for growth but also lower joe lower earnings growth steve schwarzman on internet the cohesion of societies in the developed world has definitely gone down one of the contributors i believe is the internet itself and the ability to mobilize small groups of people to basically undercut what societies would typically want to do and we re becoming fractionated and there s no head of state who would tell you things are the same today as they were 10 years ago in terms of the ability to run a democracy cnbc s squawk box with canada s minister of international trade diversification james carr james carr on huawei arrest canada s a country that abides by the rule of law and when you have an extradition treaty with a partner you honor it and that s exactly what happened and there will be due process there was no political interference in that decision our judiciary is independent that s the signal that we re sending to the world and much of the world agrees james carr on usmca i know that the political environment has changed but we also know that it s a good deal for canada the united states and mexico and we can make that argument persuasively as we did throughout the negotiation so i am confident that it will be ratified james carr on h1b visas we re reaching out to the talent pool internationally and we re making it easier for companies to attract talent to canada expedited visas are one way of doing that but the policy difference is that our country believes that there is an international competition for talent and canada invites the world cnbc s squawk box with atlantic council ceo at the fred kempe and financial times u s managing editor gillian tett gillian tett on the trump slump this time last year it was all about the trump bump everyone was pretty optimistic about the economic outlook now it s more about the trump slump or more widely the problems of populism and you re looking at theresa may in fact what people are talking about this week is much as not just who s here but who s not here fred kempe on a long lens if you look at it with a long lens the last 50 years we ve cut global poverty in half joe kernen exactly kempe if you look at it with a long lens we ve got technological advance that s going to help us decarbonize the planet if you look at a long lens you know there s a lot good that s happened a lot because of the system that got set up after world war ii what people are worried about is that s all in danger now gillian tett on the market volatility even if you are optimistic long term like fred or joe who are clearly the sunny people today in the short term there s a lot of uncertainty and that spells volatility for the markets in 2019 and that s something that almost everyone i ve spoken to says is brace yourself for more volatility gillian tett on china china and the chinese data that came out at the start of the week which has left a lot of people saying actually there really is a slowdown happening now well a slowdown in growth becky quick you believe the 6 6 number tett personally no but you know and of course the other thing is u s china trade relations where people were hoping that maybe if you had donald trump here there could have been some talks fred kempe on china competition the biggest change is we ve gone in 2018 from a certain strategic engagement with china to competition and deeper competition and conflict and what people are really talking about behind the scenes here is how that s gonna unfold on the tech front in the war with huawei right now in the war for the commanding heights of artificial intelligence and then and do china and the u s divide up the world and you pick your sides or do they collaborate gillian tett on the splinternet i do not think that most investors have woken up to the implications of a possible future not definite but possible future where you have the splinternet not the internet where essentially you have china taken out of the supply chains for many u s tech companies and i was talking just this morning to a couple of ceos of big u s tech companies who are saying well yes we re having to think about it but if that ever came to pass it would take years and it would be a huge shock fred kempe on markets i think we ll have some sort of trade deal with china and the markets have priced that in what the market hasn t priced in is a generational struggle with china for dominance and particularly tech dominance joe kernen why not that s not new what do you mean it has a price kempe look you can t ignore it but how do you price something like that in i just don t know how you do it cnbc s squawk box with ihs markit vice chair dan yergin dan yergin on permian becky quick you re looking for brent oil to somewhere be in the 60 to 80 range yergin right quick do you have a prognosis for wti too yergin well about 8 or 9 less although that s going to close as you see the bottlenecks in the permian are resolved with the new pipelines that will come on the new ports that are going to come on and that will tighten over the course of the year dan yergin on pipelines i think we re going to see a surge of production particularly in the third quarter and i think overall we expect u s production to be up to 1 5 million barrels a day which is interesting because we also see global demand being up 1 5 barrels a day so that s going to put some pressure on the exporters dan yergin on opec well i think the charm offensive on one hand it s the charm offensive on the other hand they re cutting back they and the russians the new partners are cutting back to try and balance the market and get it stronger so last year the average price for brent was 71 i think at this point it looks like it will be sort of in the high 60s dan yergin on china but all the factors you ve been talking about particularly about china trade all of those things are going to really weigh on the oil price because the oil price is going to play off all of these macro factors dan yergin on trade and oil you see the oil price very much responding to outlooks for the chinese economy outlooks for global trade the trade war if we see a resolution by march of the trade battle between the u s and china i think that s going to be positive for oil and in fact part of the way that gap is going to be filled in that trade balance is with exports of u s oil and gas to china dan yergin on saudi oil well i think what you ve seen is the saudis have done the major part of this recent cut but i think that both sides are going to continue to that relationship is important to them not only for oil but for geopolitical reasons for both sides dan yergin on iran sanctions the question mark that s out there is phase two of sanctions on iran and i think that s a question that is going to hang over the market and this time last time the u s said we want zero exports it turned out well we want 40 exports so the question is how hard and that comes up i think in may cnbc s squawk box with ups ceo david abney david abney on china uncertainty businesses of course like certainty and right now there s not as much certainty as we would like so there are a lot of discussions about that we have a lot of customers talking to us about whether they should optimize their supply chains separately there s also some hope that the recent discussions could lead to some kind of conclusion by the march 1st date so we ll just have to see david abney on shutdown operationally we are fine there are no delays we do get concerned of course about the people going without paychecks and so we d love to see that resolved but we haven t seen it affect spending yet but that could happen the longer this goes on david abney on the postal service we believe that the postal service we need a healthy postal service for the u s we also believe that the prices that they charge for the package delivery should cover their costs david abney on amazon a lot of what amazon is doing is moving supplemental inventory and they do have planes and they are they probably have a second day network that they re utilizing but in order to have a next day network it would take a lot more planes and so we believe we add great value to amazon david abney on global supply chain a lot of our customers that are doing business in china are looking at other areas in asia and so i would believe that probably is a little bit bigger option but there are companies that are of course looking to move back into the u s or probably would do so with automated facilities and a little bit different than maybe when they left cnbc s squawk box with guggenheim global chief investment officer scott minerd scott minerd on collision course the federal reserve is still on a restrictive path we re gonna slowdown but we re tightening and at the same time we re going to have stimulus come from the u s government in 2020 so this collision course between increasing rates and a more restrictive fiscal policy is going to spill over into the general economy scott minerd on slowing growth when you look at where potential output is for the united states and then you layer on you know the inflation rate we re we re just not growing at the same pace we historically have and you know when you have population not growing in the united states anymore you just don t have the same latitude scott minerd on productivity the productivity gains in the economy though they ve picked up recently have been pretty sluggish and i don t think that we re making the big gains in productivity that are gonna spill over into growth scott minerd on corporate debt qe was great because all of a sudden it lowered rates you were enticed to take on a lot of debt now that we re trying to reverse things and we re having quantitative tightening you know incrementally it s harder for companies to manage when they have large debt loads than when they had less debt scott minerd on bailout i think americans need to have more confidence in their willingness the willingness and ability of the government to print money and we ve learned that lesson the great bailout of the financial crisis was just to open the monetary taps and flood the system i think the policymakers learned their lesson i think bernanke waited too long before he cut rates which made things worse and they re going to be quick to go back and engage in qe again if they have to scott minerd on 2020 recession the peak happens typically about 4 to 6 months before the recession starts so i would say that sometime in the latter half of 2020 and from here we probably have some more upside for the time being joe kernen 3 000 on the s p or minerd you could get that high i m thinking maybe about 15 from where we are today cnbc s squawk box with carlyle group co founder and co executive chair david rubenstein david rubenstein on a longer shutdown the members of congress and the people in the administration know that this is hurting the economy the shutdown and they really want to resolve this and i think there s a real resolve to get it resolved very quickly so it could be more than a few days it could be very soon but it s not going to go on for a month or so in my view both sides recognize this is not in the country s interest both sides recognize that something has to be done and there s going to be much political backlash against both sides if something isn t done soon that s the general sense that people in congress have people in the white house have as well david rubenstein on china negotiations the chinese weren t sure that president trump really meant what he said about being tough on trade because he was very polite to xi jinping they now realize in my view that he s very serious about this and they also realize this that if he were to depart tomorrow there is somebody behind him who supports the same views in other words his views are probably the views of 40 or 45 of the american people so they realize that if trump goes away tomorrow they re still going to have to deal with somebody in his place who will have the same views david rubenstein on powell he tried to make it clear as he could that probably the expectation of 2 increases this year should be off the table for the time being there was a general expectation last year that you d have two fed increases two 25 basis point increases probably earlier in the year i think his view was probably you shouldn t assume that s going to happen now that s what his main message was in my view david rubenstein on investing in emerging markets the theory of emerging market investments is that prices are lower the growth rates will be higher and the profits will be higher now it turns out over the last 20 years that emerging market irrs are roughly the same as developed market irrs so there s no premium you re really getting in the emerging markets now that could change and individual deals could be better but generally you re going to get the same rate of return historically david rubenstein on u s political risks i often think the greatest political risk is in a country that you and i are very familiar with this country sometimes the united states has political risks that you can t anticipate now there are greater corruption issues lack of good management issues disclosure issues in the emerging markets and the exit opportunities are fewer but surely we recognize that from time to time the u s government does things that are hard to predict cnbc s squawk box with bridgewater co cio ray dalio ray dalio on recession there s a significant risk of a recession a recession you know is it minus one plus one okay let s not get technical about that too much there s a high likelihood of a significant slowing in 2020 ray dalio on big impact the three big factors are the combination of the wealth gap and the politics as we come to it the where we are in the later cycle and the inability of central banks to ease as much that s the caldron that will define 2019 and 2020 in my opinion ray dalio on capitalism we have to re engineer capitalism in a way that produces productivity and there are ways of doing this there are things like microfinance or there s paying education you know in other words i think you have to do an all in accounting of the costs like if you educate somebody if you can t educate people well and you balance a budget you re not dealing with the total cost ray dalio on economy we re going to have a slowing of the economy not just in the u s but in europe and you re going to have a slower economy in other places and that s going to have an effect that will bring growth down to a certain level in that notion of how monetary policy will be part of that and at the same time politics and the disparity issue are going to merge ray dalio on the fed i think we are now in a situation in which now you take the term structure of rates which is basically that rates will not rise that s what s built into the curve if it rises faster than that i think we re going to have another problem and then so it shouldn t rise and then i think as we re going forward when we take a look at what will the how much will the economy slow and how much will some of the lending that supported the stock buybacks and supported the you know the big growth was corporate lending which was financed because the cost of funds was cheap in relationship to the return on equity and then we ll see how that passes through cnbc s squawk box with ibm ceo ginni rometty ginni rometty on red hat when we did red hat it will be 200 basis points to our revenue growth as we talked about that s right accretive in the second year free cash flow though a billion dollars and so it s really a good move for all of ibm because it s 200 basis points to all of ibm when we talk revenue growth and when you look about where ibm is right now in this reinvention what i would say is now it s up to us to consistently perform ginni rometty on precision regulation every government right now the issue is privacy of consumer data and so every government is itching to regulate and i think the risk we all have is that there s a great overreaction and the casualty is the whole digital economy where really what we have to protect is consumer privacy and that s consent opt out ability to delete and that is what i would call almost like precision medicine precision regulation ginni rometty on trust we re 108 years old and we have always lived by that view that we exist because clients trust us with data so i think every company now has to do that when everyone s looking to benefit from it if you re gonna benefit from it you have to live by those rules ginni rometty on oil metaphor i think it was probably 7 years ago i started using that oil metaphor but it was for a different reason it wasn t about limited not limited i think the real point to that metaphor is value goes to those that actually refine it not to those who just hold it and just like with countries poor countries have oil and so that s what that meant i think the future and again i just left a discussion on this people say well gee if as an example china has no privacy rules and has all this data do they win in ai having a lot of data for the current state of ai is useful but there s more and more ai innovation being done that learns with less data so i don t call this a war one way or the other that s over this idea that our technologies are going to learn with less data that s what we re working on and others are it s gonna make a big difference here ginni rometty on skills crisis i think there s another side to tax reform of why haven t we see as much prolonged sustained again another discussion we just had yes there s been tax reform but we have not paid as much attention to to me the societal issues there s a this trust headwind you just mentioned with data but this skills crisis is a real issue so you may take and have capital but if we don t help bridge these gaps on skills i think this is what you re missing and you know fourth industrial revolution is the topic here every past industrial revolution had a great technology but then it was accompanied by both physical infrastructure and societal infrastructure to spread the benefits evenly that s what we haven t paid attention to cnbc s squawk box with silver lake partners north island co founder glenn hutchins glenn hutchins on market data disparity people are all looking at economic data and concluding reaching one conclusion from it they re looking at the markets and reaching a different conclusion or wondering why the two seem to be different we have to understand the markets are backward the economic data pardon me is backward looking what happened in the 4th quarter right the markets are forecasting the future and so the markets right now are saying something very different for what they expect for the future than what the economic data is showing happened in the most recent past glenn hutchins on global slowdown the main thing the markets are forecasting i think right now is a global slowdown china s slowing down germany s slowing down emerging markets and then interest rate sensitive sectors of the united states not contributing as much to the economic growth as a consequence housing and others as a consequence of interest rates going up glenn hutchins on the fed the fed is not going to tighten and create a recession they just don t want to do that the fed doesn t really care about market levels what they care about is the market as a transmission of policy to the real economy so when the real economy does falter with respect to unemployment or growth and that can come as a result the market transmissions that do that primarily are interest rates affecting borrowing levels or a wealth effect affecting consumption but as long as it s just the markets moving around that s not within their mandate cnbc s squawk box with bp ceo bob dudley bob dudley on oil prices it is tightening up i think a big variable in of course the iran s sanctions whether it be applied or not big overcorrection up went down and i think we re heading back into reasonable balance and by the way we don t see the demand actually falling bob dudley on china we just looked at the figures and project another 1 4 million barrels a day growth in crude but we re not seeing this worrying thought it s all going to start falling bob dudley on saudi our relationships with saudi aramco we work with them on the gas climate initiatives we know saudi arabia well we don t have a lot of investments in there we have found a way over the years but it has not changed our relationship at all bob dudley on advertising we ve come out of a really difficult decade of the company i don t think we had the credibility to talk about things in an exciting way we re doing a lot in the getting ready for the energy transitions that are going to happen a lot of natural gas we are working on renewables of course we have a lot of oil and i think it s time for us to just tell our story a little bit differently let people know we re engaged in this transition that happened and we have a great big core business bob dudley on emissions we do believe that the world needs to reduce emissions we think it s not a race to renewable it s got to be a combination of many things renewables and natural gas is going to be a natural grouping and as long as you re in advantaged oil the world s going to need lots and lots of oil for decades and decades to come
a man walk by an electronic board showing shares prices as buildings are reflected on the glass at a brokerage house in beijing monday jan 21 2019 shares rose in shanghai and hong kong on monday as china reported that its growth fell to a three decade low of 6 6 percent in 2018 read more davos switzerland fears are rising about the state of the world s biggest economies with china posting its worst annual growth in decades and the united states injecting more uncertainty with tariffs and a lengthy government shutdown china reported monday that its economy expanded at 6 6 percent last year a figure that would be good for many countries but represents the slowest growth for china in 28 years meanwhile the international monetary fund downgraded its expectations for the global economy highlighting sharp declines in europe and warning that the risks of a major slowdown have increased the pair of announcements came as top executives and world leaders gathered in this ritzy ski resort town for the annual world economic forum in contrast to a year ago when president donald trump and other world leaders talked about global prosperity this year attendees expressed worry that the united states was undermining its economy and the rest of the world s via a trade war and the longest partial government shutdown in u s history in the united states the shutdown has already cut into growth according to numerous economists even u s consumers who have remained resilient for months have been shaken early this month consumer confidence slumped to the lowest level of trump s presidency according to the university of michigan s consumer sentiment survey advertisement while few see a recession as imminent the high level officials and executives at davos catalogue a growing series of risks including the trade war the potential of britain leaving the european union without a final agreement with the eu rising interest rates high global debt levels and more polarized politics around the world after two years of solid expansion the world economy is growing more slowly than expected and risks are rising said christine lagarde managing director of the international monetary fund does that mean a global recession is around the corner no but the risk of a sharper decline in global growth has certainly increased the scene at davos epitomized the changes in the world economy a year ago trump and other foreign leaders gathered here to try to put their differences aside it came at a time when the major countries were growing in sync with one another and trump received a warm welcome after large u s corporate tax cuts but now trump british prime minister theresa may and other world leaders are sitting out the conference dealing with problems back at home and the hope for expanded global business has been dashed by the trade war and other setbacks i think there is anxiety there are concerns the slowdown could be quite deep said john hagel co chairman of deloitte s center for the edge a research group the more we can show some progress and resolution of some trade disputes that would help the imf is the latest institution to scale back its growth forecasts following downward revisions by the federal reserve and many banks the imf predicts 3 5 percent global growth in 2019 and 3 6 percent in 2020 down from 3 7 percent forecasts for both years in the fall but imf economists warned that they had already downgraded growth in china and the united states in the fall because of the trade war and they only see greater risks of a slide from here it s absolutely crucial for us to turn around the momentum and policy can really help said gita gopinath the new head of research at the imf the downward revisions are modest however we believe the risks to more significant downward corrections are rising the rapidly slowing euro zone especially germany france and italy was the biggest factor in the revised predictions germany is struggling as exports weaken and its auto sector tries to adjust to new regulations france is trying to rebound from tax protests that have dampened sentiment and italy is battling debt problems and sluggish spending i think it s not ruled out that you might see one or two weak quarters in the european economy bordering on a technical recession said axel weber chairman of ubs but he said he was optimistic that it would be a temporary soft spot the imf forecasts that the u s economy will grow at 2 5 percent this year and 1 8 percent next year these predictions are unchanged from what the imf said in october but they represent a noticeable decline from about 3 percent growth last year china is expected to grow at 6 2 percent both years even slower than last year as an economy slows it s easier for it to be knocked off track many economists say when you re growing at 3 percent you need a big shock to hurt the economy said nariman behravesh chief economist at ihs markit when you re down to 1 5 to 2 percent growth all it takes is a little shock in beijing and across china authorities have been pulling out all the stops to try to avoid a hard landing for the economy promoting measures that are both traditional and inventive china s central bank has allowed banks to lend more against their reserves a move that could free up almost 120 billion for loans the central government is cutting tax rates for small businesses and reducing value added taxes in some industries particularly manufacturing it is also pouring more than 125 billion into new rail projects retail sales industrial production and property sales in china all slowed in the final quarter of last year car sales were particularly poor recording the first annual drop in more than two decades and the unemployment rate is climbing but many economists consider official chinese figures too rosy using a range of data to come up with a more reliable figure julian evans pritchard a china analyst at the capital economics consultancy said the growth rate probably slowed to 5 3 percent in the last three months of 2018 a key question is how far beijing will go to mollify trump and end the trade war the economy is a much bigger problem for xi jinping than the trade war said andrew collier managing director of orient capital research a hong kong based consultancy the last thing he wants is a bunch of angry people protesting because they ve lost their jobs slowing economic growth is putting pressure on him to solve as many problems as he can and the trade war will be top of his list he said in the united states there is no end in sight to the government shutdown and trump has not removed any of the tariffs he put in place twelve percent of u s imports have new levies on them and trump has threatened to impose more trump has argued that any short term pain will be worth the long term benefit border security in the case of the government shutdown and more beneficial trade deals in the case of the tariffs others in davos saw it differently if you want to be a superpower in the world and the u s still is you have to engage with people said hans paul burkner chairman of the boston consulting group he warned that everybody will be a bit more careful until the shutdown and trade disputes are resolved surveys released in recent days by global consultancies show more alarm bells in board rooms around the world chief executives ranked a global recession as their no 1 concern for 2019 according to a survey of nearly 800 top business leaders around the world released thursday by the conference board global trade threats came in second a survey of 1 300 chief executives released monday by price waterhouse coopers found that 30 percent of business leaders believe that global growth will decline in the next 12 months a record jump in pessimism to about six times the level who said that last year the most pronounced decline in optimism was in north america where it dropped from 63 percent a year ago to 37 percent now largely because of the fading fiscal stimulus from the tax cuts and the ongoing trade standoff that business executives thought would be short lived but keeps going with the rise of trade tension and protectionism it stands to reason that confidence is waning said bob moritz global chairman of price waterhouse coopers executives want a little bit more certainty and they want stability fifield reported from beijing
meera dhanashri rakesh sharmamoneycontrol contributors as is now tradition a few days before davos a picturesque town in switzerland transforms into a playground for the rich and powerful oxfam released its annual study on the inequality in the world the world it tells us now has 2 208 billionaires more than ever before and these three comma club members are growing richer by 2 5 billion each day story continues below advertisement remove ad the global financial meltdown of 2008 seems all but a distant memory considering the number of billionaires has doubled since that time the poorest half of the world s population on the other hand is seeing its net worth dwindle the 26 richest individuals of the world have a collective wealth of 1 4 trillion the same amount as the total wealth of 3 8 billion of the poorest people in 2017 that number was 43 billionaires in 2016 61 the world inequality report 2018 co authored by famous economist thomas piketty who also wrote the seminal work capital showed that between 1980 and 2016 the poorest 50 percent of humanity captured only 12 cents in every dollar of global economic growth in contrast the top 1 percent captured 27 cents of every dollar in 2018 like in most years the rich got richer much much richer and the poor got poorer matthew spencer oxfam s director of campaigns and policy said the massive fall in the number of people living in extreme poverty is one of the greatest achievements of the past quarter of a century but rising inequality is jeopardising further progress rising inequality that is inadequately addressed by governments across the world rising inequality that is felt disproportionately by the most vulnerable of groups women and children the report noted that about 10 000 people per day die for lack of healthcare and there were 262 million children not in school often because their parents were unable to afford the fees uniforms or textbooks where does the study place india the world s fastest growing economy that women feel the impact of the inequality harshest is perhaps best observed in india the report noted girls are pulled out of school first when the money isn t available to pay fees and women clock up hours of unpaid work looking after sick relatives when healthcare systems fail a very familiar story in india india has one of the world s lowest female labour participation rates data from the world bank showed only 27 percent of women aged 15 or older were classified as working or actively seeking a job a report in 2018 by the mckinsey global institute said india could add 770 billion to its economy by increasing gender equality a closer look at the rise of the wealthy in the world in general and india in specific are among the things we will consider today also on the discussion table the ever expanding chasm between the rich and the poor as early as 2011 jayant sinha son of former finance minister yashwant sinha current minister of state for civil aviation and hbs mckinsey alum and political scientist ashutosh varshney writing for the financial times had compared india s industrial capitalism and the concomitant meteoric rise in the personal wealth of a few to america s gilded age 1865 1900 the gilded age transformed an agrarian us economy into an economic and industrial giant it was also marked by the rise of the billionaire roosevelt termed it an unhealthy condition as james crabtree called it the billionaire raj has replaced the hitherto prevalent license raj in india a discussion on crony capitalism is beyond the scope of our discussion today but what we will dig deeper into are the questions of the growing inequality and the possible solutions ahead this is digging deeper with moneycontrol with me rakesh sharma a balanced overview of the manner in which a country progresses and treats its citizenry may not always agree with the projections made by an incumbent government critics and dissenters may be accused of compulsive contrarianism by those in power but logic and facts need not be coloured by any political ideology they may be considered only on the merit of what is in comparison to what appears to be to give you just one example of what we are trying to say ranjana smetacek former director general of organisation of pharmaceutical producers of india wrote in the times of india s edit page on january 3 2019 that to grow complacent with india s improved ease of doing business ranking would be incorrect because plenty of red tape still ties us up story continues below advertisement remove ad for now let us focus on just one of the many points she talks about she says we should be troubled by our position in the crony capitalism index yes there is such a thing and the widespread perception that success in indian business is predicated upon close and unethical relationships with government officials we should be concerned with our falling rating in the press freedom index which sees our media independence as compromised the oxfam study says that the wealth of billionaires in india rose by a whopping rs 2 200 crore a day in 2018 and that the top one percent of india s wealthiest got richer by 39 percent compared to 3 percent growth in the incomes of the bottom 50 percent oxfam as you know is a confederation of 20 independent charitable organizations focusing on the alleviation of global poverty founded in 1942 it is led by oxfam international it is a major nonprofit group with an extensive collection of operations why is this study making news because aside from showcasing some jaw dropping numbers it establishes disparity factually in the way national wealth is distributed between the already wealthy and the continually economically disadvantaged indians the report said the wealth of top nine billionaires in india is equivalent to the wealth of the bottom 50 percent of the population and 60 percent or the majority of the population own merely 4 8 percent of the national wealth now compare this to the opinion piece by ranjana smetacek who discusses how india has been basking in the knowledge that it has fared well in the world bank s latest ease of doing business eodb report she says for the second year running our country was recognised among the best performing nations when it came to reforms in the business environment this year india moved 23 places up the rankings chart from 100 to 77 previously rated the worst performing brics economy india has now become the median economy among brics and the best in south asia we can t argue with good tidings but neither can we refute that there is a dissonance between soaring economic rankings and the bottomline that a vast segment of indian citizenry is left to cope with improvements in dealing with construction permits and trading across borders are well and good but how do these changes percolate down to benefit daily wage workers farmers small businesses and even if we just focus on the larger picture as ranjana points out india has slipped in the categories of paying taxes despite the implementation of the goods and services tax and resolving insolvency despite the adoption of the insolvency and bankruptcy code she wrote the scope of this eodb index is limited after all and by the world bank s own admission the indicators are not designed to portray the entire macroeconomic scenario of any country or reflect its growth prospects while this report is a recognition of the positive steps india has taken our performance here can only be a function of the parameters laid down by the world bank this result cannot be extrapolated as an overall improvement in eodb on the other important parameters what are the other parameters the quality of life and protection of basic rights for instance that the state must provide to its citizens as ranjana said we should worry about the anxiety that has loomed most recently stemming from air pollution in india s capital city and the resultant health effects on its hapless residents finally there is no denying the real and widespread apprehension that has resulted from the steady rise of populist right wing sentiment across india and which has drawn rebuke from international human rights organisations we must address numerous challenges in order to sustain any meaningful economic growth while also ensuring job creation in this scenario it is important for the government to tread carefully and ensure that rash policy decisions are not taken it is important to look holistically objectively and with a critical eye at every aspect of our economy to assess what else we need to do the link between the upsurge in right wing ideologies around the world and crony capitalism has been discussed by political analysts ad infinitum and we will get to that later but first let us revert to the oxfam report whose wealth is it anyway just to refresh your memory a little bit the oxfam report has stated that india s top 10 percent population holds 77 4 percent of the total national wealth and that the top one percent have cornered 51 53 percent of the national wealth while the remaining 99 percent make do with almost 48 percent we quote the combined revenue and capital expenditure of the centre and all the states for medical public health sanitation and water supply is rs 2 08 166 crore a little more than rs 2 lakh crore which as the report says is less than the individual wealth of a certain well known industrialist according to the oxfam report india had 18 people joining the new billionaires list in 2018 there are now 119 billionaires in india with their combined wealth touching 440 billion or approximately rs 30 lakh crore in comparison to 325 5 billion in 2017 this is the same dissonance that fails to recognise the gap between glowing economic projections and grassroot realities case in point as we mentioned before was the world bank s latest ease of doing business eodb report and the well being and the quality of life available to the average indian oxfam reports that highest quality medical care in india is only available to those who have the money to pay for it yes the country is a top destination for medical tourism but levels of public spending on health are some of the lowest in the world as rahul shrivastava writes in india today the poorest indian states have infant mortality rates higher than those in sub saharan africa he cites the report to suggest that if india s richest one percent pay just 0 5 percent extra tax on their wealth the money raised would be enough to increase government spending on health by a staggering 50 percent we quote in the recent five state assembly elections the bharatiya janata party bjp lost three critical states madhya pradesh rajasthan and chhattisgarh as the opposition congress promised farm loan waivers the oxfam report gives an idea of why the congress s promise made great politico economic sense it says that the poorest 10 percent that is 13 6 crore indians have been living under the burden of debt since 2004 the world inequality report 2018 shows that between 1980 and 2016 the poorest 50 percent of humanity managed to capture only 12 paise of every rupee earned while the top one percent captured 27 paise of every rupee even if we don t read a political context in the ongoing conversation about the distribution of wealth in india it would make sense to acknowledge the disparity and to also understand the reasons why india is not alone in the rise of the rich and the slide of the poor in 2018 as oxfam reports fortunes of billionaires globally rose by 2 5 billion a day as compared to the poorest half of the world s population who saw their wealth decline by 11 percent and as the india today piece says oxfam s report underlines that increasing inequality is undermining the fight against poverty damaging economies and fuelling public anger across the globe to give you a palpable sense of equivalence take jeff bezos the founder of amazon whose fortune increased to 112 billion one percent of his fortune is equal to the whole health budget for 115 million people of ethiopia oxfam india ceo amitabh behar said the survey reveals how governments are exacerbating inequality by underfunding public services such as healthcare and education on the one hand while under taxing corporations and the wealthy and failing to clamp down on tax dodging on the other and that is the crux of the matter whose welfare do governments serve when they ignore replenishing funds for public services while according tax benefits and ease of doing their businesses to the top one percent we repeat lest we forget the statistics we started the podcast with top billionaires in the country got richer by 39 percent compared to a mere 3 percent rise in wealth for the bottom half of the population one percent of the richest population in india earned rs 2 200 crore every day and yes we need to remind ourselves also that just 26 people now own the same wealth as 3 8 billion people who make up the poorest half of humanity repeating these numbers is essential not because anyone grudges people possessing extraordinary wealth but everyone does wonder with great wealth should your responsibility to society increase as well issues like these are taking the global centre stage now with freshman congresswoman alexandra ocasio cortez proposing taxing the wealthy as high as 70 percent to fund a climate change plan she s pushing called the green new deal inequality has a female face oxfam international s executive director winnie byanyima has called the increasing wealth gap in india morally outrageous she said if this obscene inequality between the top 1 percent and the rest of india continues then it will lead to a complete collapse of the social and democratic structure of this country the study also reveals another aspect of this disparity and has stated that women and girls are affected majorly by rising economic inequality oxfam states categorically that inequality has a female face the paid work that indian women do bring them fewer earnings due to the existing wage gap and therefore households that rely primarily on female earners tend to be poorer oxfam said referring to the country s gender pay gap at 34 percent moreover since 2006 india has slipped 10 notches on the wef s global gender gap index to 108th rank in 2018 far below the global average and is lagging behind china and bangladesh in india the unpaid work done by women looking after their homes and children is worth 3 1 percent of the country s gdp globally this amounts to a staggering 10 trillion a year which is 43 times the annual turnover of the world s biggest company apple pti in india the billionaires list contains just nine women as winnie stated the size of one s bank account should not dictate how many years your children spend in school or how long you live yet this is the reality in too many countries across the globe while corporations and the super rich enjoy low tax bills millions of girls are denied a decent education and women are dying for lack of maternity care national herald also observed that various intersections of caste class religion age and sexual orientation have further implications on women inequality as a process national herald cited oxfam to further state that though india has many laws that deal with violence against women their implementation remains a challenge due to a deeply patriarchal society issues like lack of formal mechanisms for dealing with sexual harassment in the informal sector and restrictions on women that prevent them from taking paid work further disadvantages them economically the study also found that cutting taxes on wealth predominantly benefits men who own 50 percent more wealth than women globally and control over 86 percent of corporations as national herald says conversely when public services are neglected poor women and girls suffer most oxfam points out that girls are pulled out of school first when the money is not available to pay fees and women clock up hours of unpaid work looking after sick relatives when healthcare systems fail who pays for the inequality another notable takeaway from the oxfam report is that wealthy individuals and corporations the world over are paying lower rates of tax than they have in decades and that there s the rampant level of tax dodging by the super rich and corporations according to oxfam getting the world s richest 1 percent to pay a mere 0 5 percent extra tax on their wealth could raise more money than it would cost to educate all 262 million children that are out of school and provide life saving healthcare as has been mentioned before by multiple news portals to 3 3 million people children from poor indian families are three times more likely to die before their first birthday than those born to affluent ones the super rich are hiding at least 7 6 trillion from the tax authorities avoiding an estimated 200 billion in tax revenues and that multinational companies exploit loopholes in tax codes to avoid taxes which costs developing countries an additional estimated 100 billion of lost corporate income tax the sitting american president for example has boasted that by avoiding paying income tax he was being smart and that even if he had paid taxes they would be squandered business today also makes an important point and we quote the orthodox economic view that imposing more taxes on the rich will harm everybody by stunting economic growth is now being challenged by several bodies according to oxfam the failure to tax rich people and corporations more fairly is a missed opportunity to reduce inequality public services and social protection play a very powerful role in reducing both inequality and poverty the study cites evidence from more than 150 countries rich and poor alike spanning over three decades proving that investment in health education and social protection reduces the gap between rich and poor that s where funds raised through effective and fairer taxation can make a big difference oxfam brings forth also the environmental ramifications of lopsided economic development by showing that the average carbon footprint of the richest one percent globally could be as much as 175 times higher than that of the bottom 10 percent the report says to get us to a situation where everyone on earth is living on more than 5 a day with current levels of inequality would require the global economy to be 175 times bigger than it is today which would destroy our planet the only way we can beat poverty while saving our planet is to tackle inequality what is the way forward distribution of wealth is primarily the distribution of privilege and must flow freely between the state and all its citizens we have of course come a long way from the political gridlocking of licence raj but to expend the well being of citizenry in order to appease what some analysts have called as the baron raj or billionaire raj may not be aligned with the constitutional dream of equality for all indians economic progress without political social bureaucratic reforms benefits only a small percentage the balance of power must be maintained between public sector enterprises and unfettered entrepreneurial growth for a nation to grow sustainably the right to affordable education healthcare a clean environment is fundamental to the well being of a nation and we should not have needed oxfam to remind us that trickledown economics does not really result in an organic osmosis of benefits to a deprived populace on 17 january 2019 an article in the wire published an excerpt from the book india s porous state blurred boundaries and the evolving business state relationship in india by christophe jaffrelot atul kohli and kanta murali the piece pointed out how the increasing intimacy between state and industrialists has significantly increased overtime excerpt thangam therarasu a former education minister in tamil nadu spoke of a shift in how businessmen approach politics before liberalization india had ministers who were close to industrialists but thereafter industrialists began entering politics mostly though the rajya sabha while many businessmen entered the parliament through the rajya sabha in the early days after liberalization in 1991 for example anil ambani and vijay mallya the lok sabha also has recently seen a marked increase in business representation in 1991 14 2 percent of lok sabha mps belonged to business or trader professions by 2014 the number had increased to 26 2 percent the rajya sabha has also seen a similar increase some prominent rajya sabha members have been rahul bajaj vijay mallya anil ambani rajkumar dhoot and m a m ramaswamy janata dal s compare this to the representation of the farming community for instance in parliament and as the piece points out increasing overlaps with businessmen going into politics mallya is just one example and politicians going into business almost always leads to scams across party lines add to that the upsurge of right wing nationalism across the world even in countries like hungary turkey brazil austria etc and we have government heads that advocate wealth creation at any cost over its equitable distribution and we are left with a world sharply and tragically divided between the haves and the have nots to say nothing of the impact on the environment vijay prashad an indian historian journalist commentator and prabir purkayastha the founding member of the delhi science forum as well as the founder of an online video news network newsclick recently discussed the features of the new right and linked its rise across the globe to the failure of the socialism project in eastern europe and the soviet union coming unstuck and the failure of post colonial moderate governments to fulfil and address the promise of economic growth for all the answer as the two analysts pointed out is not in identity politics and in unchecked crony capitalism but in course correction but for that to happen all political parties need to look beyond the gains of winning the next election and to configure if a few decades from now india and its citizens will be growing together or will there be even a bigger socio economic chasm to deal with in a speech to the bombay chamber of commerce in 2008 dr raghuram rajan posed the question is there a threat of oligarchy in india is india going to be controlled by a small group of people with extraordinarily large influence we may already be there a decade later rajan in an interview with james crabtree the man who chronicled the rise of the billionaire raj answered the question to what may be the way forward if one was a dictator you would work on improving public services to break the nexus between business and politicians and reduce the level of corruption and you would also work directly on trying to reduce the concentration of economic power by increasing competition we spoke about america s gilded age earlier what followed the gilded age that age of unbridled wealth creation by a select few was the progressive era during which anti corruption campaigns aimed to clean up politics and the middle classes started to exert control over government india now finds herself at a crossroads she could either choose to emulate america of the progressive era or take a hard right to become a saffronised version of oligarchic russia as the world s fastest growing economy and the world s largest democracy the choices that we as a country make are crucial to the world s future

when today tuesday january 22 2019 where cnbc s squawk box live from the world economic forum in davos switzerland following are unofficial excerpts from cnbc interviews which aired on cnbc s squawk box m f 6am 9am today january 22nd live from the world economic forum in davos switzerland interviews included valueact ceo jeffrey ubben imf chair christine lagarde salesforce ceo marc benioff bank of america ceo brian moynihan marriott ceo arne sorenson blackstone ceo steve schwarzman canada s minister of international trade diversification james carr atlantic council ceo fred kempe and financial times u s managing editor gillian tett ihs markit vice chair dan yergin ups ceo david abney guggenheim global chief investment officer scott minerd carlyle group co founder and co executive chair david rubenstein bridgewater co cio ray dalio ibm ceo ginni rometty silver lake partners north island co founder glenn hutchins and bp ceo bob dudley links to video of the interviews are included below all references must be sourced to cnbc cnbc s sara eisen with valueact ceo jeffrey ubben video jeffrey ubben on financials it seems like at the end of the year because the yield curve would invert one basis point the computers were talking to computers and the active investors kind of ran out of money and they just there was some sort of sell financials at any price so now you have a situation where you ve got companies that are almost utilitarian in nature because there s so much regulation and they re so de risked that actually they re low risk entities and they re pretty fortified against a lot of macro risk jeffrey ubben on corporate governance the idea that the extreme is this accepted principle that corporate governance serves only one purpose which is to maximize shareholder value i think that and specifically that means that the role of corporate governance is not in the interest of the overall firm or in the interest of assisting and achieving a corporate purpose so you get this weird dynamic where profit follows purpose or the idea that purpose you know profit leads eisen right purpose is secondary ubben and to me that s just ass backwards right so in this way i think capital markets and public companies are showing their limitations in terms of how they can play a role in societal good jeffrey ubben on gov policy government is so important and so part of the solution and the trust in government and the trust in companies is gone which is why you see millennials looking for companies to reassert corporate trust but idea that companies have to be more involved in policy only because the good actors are gonna be dragged down by the bad actors if they don t get involved in government policy you know so i think it s in a company s interest to be very proactive on policy cnbc s sara eisen with imf chair christine lagarde video christine lagarde on tariff risks we look now at tariff increases that have taken place and that are beginning to have an impact however small we re looking at threats we re looking at an attempt to resolve it but we re not seeing really the end of those negotiations we are also seeing now a market which has i think taken account of that and we ve seen market values change dramatically over the last few months and now you know stabilized again but you have a compounding effect that is resulting in obviously some instability some volatility and we believe particularly from the advanced economies it will have an impact christine lagarde on china we have not revisited the growth forecast for china it s still at 6 2 and we believe that the chinese authorities for the moment are taking the right policy measures in terms of credit tightening on the one hand and in terms of appropriate stimulus on the other one but clearly any worsening in terms of trade threats would reduce confidence would have an impact on that growth which is clearly one of the two key economies in the world at the moment christine lagarde on brexit it s a big uncertainty within europe and certainly for the u k economy itself but it s also an uncertainty because of the role played by london as a financial center and how will that sort of be either rebalanced or kept as is what will be the equivalences granted what will stay in london what will eventually go christine lagarde on no deal brexit it s obviously the worst case scenario and anything short of that would be better but would also hurt the u k economy even the mildest scenario will you know add frictions will add difficulties will make transactions less smooth and transportation less convenient cnbc s sara eisen with salesforce ceo marc benioff video marc benioff on economy on one level the economy is rocking you know that we continue to have good growth we re gonna have more good growth this year and but of course you ve got you know the mitigation for that growth against brexit the trade war eisen lots of uncertainty benioff foreign exchange issues rates that s on peoples minds but it doesn t it s not dominant the main thing is people are growing they re investing and they re ready to go forward and it s an exciting davos marc benioff on the crisis of trust we re navigating through a crisis of trust ceos don t help themselves if we have a crisis of trust and they re not helping the homeless or they re not helping people who need them and certainly if they re abusing their product or abusing the data that they re collecting i mean those ceos need to they need to also wake up and they need to realize that they can t do that anymore marc benioff on ai you cannot continue to do these terrible things to the world with your technology and you re gonna see more of that as ai gets further unleashed you re getting this next wave of artificial intelligence so the tech lash could get amplified if ceos don t make change now they need to wake up marc benioff san francisco trainwreck san francisco is kind of a train wreck we have a real inequality problem we have eisen is that because of the tech sector benioff it s because of the tech sector cnbc s squawk box with bank of america ceo brian moynihan video brian moynihan on consumer strength we think the consumer is very strong right now spending a lot on experiences there s you know a lot of talk about car sales slowing down or house sales and things like that but there s lots going into experiences dinners and travel and stuff very strong very strong ending the year 4th quarter strong christmas was strong and january so far has been strong relatively brian moynihan on bank earnings we were happy that we were on the top of the heap no question that s obvious but i think the trading business was really the month of december was really kind of strange and it s kind of it s moved back to where it s more normal and things but it was really a strange time the shutdown and everything the confluence of things that didn t go right were high so a lot of people had that kind of surprise at the end of the quarter going into november the businesses were performing basically at par brian moynihan on shifting workforce our view is that we have to let attrition be our friend so what happens is you re seeing a cycling year over year we re down maybe 4 000 5 000 people but you have 2 or 3 thousand more people facing customers and less people as we digitize and improve paper process and get rid of it and that s going to go on forever brian moynihan on the fed the minutes are clear that as they reach the neutral rate they have said we have to be careful now and watch we re data dependent and that is meeting to meeting an analogy a great economist once made to me think of them as climbing one of these mountains hand hold to hand hold there s no path left they ve reached the path and now the question is what they re going to do and that s going to be depending on the data cnbc s squawk box with marriott ceo arne sorenson video arne sorenson on china the china story of course is a little bit complicated because we ve got the trade and we ve got a number of very high profile event that have happened but the china story is still a very constructive one in the travel space we re not in a business which is super sensitive from a national security perspective arne sorenson on china trade in china too you ve got risks on their economy because of trade you ve got also a shift towards consumerism which is helpful for us both of those things are sort of working their way through arne sorenson on recession i ve heard some people some folks say maybe we should just get a small recession now and get it over with because then we could stop worrying about the length of the cycle it could well be very mild and not very long arne sorenson on hacking we ve got to get it encrypted and we have to make sure that people have the confidence that the data that we keep is going to be kept only because we need to use it and we need to use it in a way that delivers ease and value to you and that s where we ve got to get and we re working as quickly as we can arne sorenson on experience people love to travel today more than ever and young people particularly would put travel very high on their list of things that they ve got to do when i was growing up it used to be a discretionary luxury now forget it i m going to take my vacation i m going to do that before i buy a car maybe before i get an apartment whatever and that s happening all around the world of course we talk about it in the sense of people want experiences more than they want stuff arne sorenson on instagram it partly is instagram and other social media where the consumption we now share and brag about in a way is the stuff we take pictures of cnbc s squawk box with blackstone ceo steve schwarzman video steve schwarzman on china i think that both sides would like to see something happen each for their own reasons and the chinese laid it out a group of things they were prepared to do in argentina and i think they re following up on that i think on the u s side one of the really important things among others is compliance and there s some skepticism or need for clarification that if they agree on something the u s side wants to know if it s going to happen and one way to do that is to have a mechanism where if something isn t happening it can be appealed to the vice premier s office for resolution within 30 or 60 days some mechanism so it s not just people having agreements without the ability to make them happen steve schwarzman on global force each of the countries is a very very important global force number one and two in the world economically china s got the largest population and they each have some type of destiny some of which will be cooperative of course as it is and some of which will be competitive steve schwarzman on trade normalization normalization of trade and that s gonna take some time because the chinese system is so different with state owned companies as well as private companies as well as you know more restrictive access to their country typically than we have of ours and these things work out but they don t happen in a day or two they don t happen in a week or a month or a year steve schwarzman on economy slowing the u s economy is slowing from where it was remember you know two quarters ago it was at 4 2 growth which is unsustainable for a large country like the united states we ll probably grow this year somewhere around 2 5 maybe two and three quarters i don t see you know any recession i don t know where that came from the last two months of the year steve schwarzman on consumer confidence the consumer confidence is down a little bit which i think comes from you know some of the dysfunction but they re still spending a lot of money and we re a 70 consumer economy and so i see the u s sort of rolling along but at a lower rate for growth but also lower joe lower earnings growth steve schwarzman on internet the cohesion of societies in the developed world has definitely gone down one of the contributors i believe is the internet itself and the ability to mobilize small groups of people to basically undercut what societies would typically want to do and we re becoming fractionated and there s no head of state who would tell you things are the same today as they were 10 years ago in terms of the ability to run a democracy cnbc s squawk box with canada s minister of international trade diversification james carr video james carr on huawei arrest canada s a country that abides by the rule of law and when you have an extradition treaty with a partner you honor it and that s exactly what happened and there will be due process there was no political interference in that decision our judiciary is independent that s the signal that we re sending to the world and much of the world agrees james carr on usmca i know that the political environment has changed but we also know that it s a good deal for canada the united states and mexico and we can make that argument persuasively as we did throughout the negotiation so i am confident that it will be ratified james carr on h1b visas we re reaching out to the talent pool internationally and we re making it easier for companies to attract talent to canada expedited visas are one way of doing that but the policy difference is that our country believes that there is an international competition for talent and canada invites the world cnbc s squawk box with atlantic council ceo at the fred kempe and financial times u s managing editor gillian tett video gillian tett on the trump slump this time last year it was all about the trump bump everyone was pretty optimistic about the economic outlook now it s more about the trump slump or more widely the problems of populism and you re looking at theresa may in fact what people are talking about this week is much as not just who s here but who s not here fred kempe on a long lens if you look at it with a long lens the last 50 years we ve cut global poverty in half joe kernen exactly kempe if you look at it with a long lens we ve got technological advance that s going to help us decarbonize the planet if you look at a long lens you know there s a lot good that s happened a lot because of the system that got set up after world war ii what people are worried about is that s all in danger now gillian tett on the market volatility even if you are optimistic long term like fred or joe who are clearly the sunny people today in the short term there s a lot of uncertainty and that spells volatility for the markets in 2019 and that s something that almost everyone i ve spoken to says is brace yourself for more volatility gillian tett on china china and the chinese data that came out at the start of the week which has left a lot of people saying actually there really is a slowdown happening now well a slowdown in growth becky quick you believe the 6 6 number tett personally no but you know and of course the other thing is u s china trade relations where people were hoping that maybe if you had donald trump here there could have been some talks fred kempe on china competition the biggest change is we ve gone in 2018 from a certain strategic engagement with china to competition and deeper competition and conflict and what people are really talking about behind the scenes here is how that s gonna unfold on the tech front in the war with huawei right now in the war for the commanding heights of artificial intelligence and then and do china and the u s divide up the world and you pick your sides or do they collaborate gillian tett on the splinternet i do not think that most investors have woken up to the implications of a possible future not definite but possible future where you have the splinternet not the internet where essentially you have china taken out of the supply chains for many u s tech companies and i was talking just this morning to a couple of ceos of big u s tech companies who are saying well yes we re having to think about it but if that ever came to pass it would take years and it would be a huge shock fred kempe on markets i think we ll have some sort of trade deal with china and the markets have priced that in what the market hasn t priced in is a generational struggle with china for dominance and particularly tech dominance joe kernen why not that s not new what do you mean it has a price kempe look you can t ignore it but how do you price something like that in i just don t know how you do it cnbc s squawk box with ihs markit vice chair dan yergin video dan yergin on permian becky quick you re looking for brent oil to somewhere be in the 60 to 80 range yergin right quick do you have a prognosis for wti too yergin well about 8 or 9 less although that s going to close as you see the bottlenecks in the permian are resolved with the new pipelines that will come on the new ports that are going to come on and that will tighten over the course of the year dan yergin on pipelines i think we re going to see a surge of production particularly in the third quarter and i think overall we expect u s production to be up to 1 5 million barrels a day which is interesting because we also see global demand being up 1 5 barrels a day so that s going to put some pressure on the exporters dan yergin on opec well i think the charm offensive on one hand it s the charm offensive on the other hand they re cutting back they and the russians the new partners are cutting back to try and balance the market and get it stronger so last year the average price for brent was 71 i think at this point it looks like it will be sort of in the high 60s dan yergin on china but all the factors you ve been talking about particularly about china trade all of those things are going to really weigh on the oil price because the oil price is going to play off all of these macro factors dan yergin on trade and oil you see the oil price very much responding to outlooks for the chinese economy outlooks for global trade the trade war if we see a resolution by march of the trade battle between the u s and china i think that s going to be positive for oil and in fact part of the way that gap is going to be filled in that trade balance is with exports of u s oil and gas to china dan yergin on saudi oil well i think what you ve seen is the saudis have done the major part of this recent cut but i think that both sides are going to continue to that relationship is important to them not only for oil but for geopolitical reasons for both sides dan yergin on iran sanctions the question mark that s out there is phase two of sanctions on iran and i think that s a question that is going to hang over the market and this time last time the u s said we want zero exports it turned out well we want 40 exports so the question is how hard and that comes up i think in may cnbc s squawk box with ups ceo david abney video david abney on china uncertainty businesses of course like certainty and right now there s not as much certainty as we would like so there are a lot of discussions about that we have a lot of customers talking to us about whether they should optimize their supply chains separately there s also some hope that the recent discussions could lead to some kind of conclusion by the march 1st date so we ll just have to see david abney on shutdown operationally we are fine there are no delays we do get concerned of course about the people going without paychecks and so we d love to see that resolved but we haven t seen it affect spending yet but that could happen the longer this goes on david abney on the postal service we believe that the postal service we need a healthy postal service for the u s we also believe that the prices that they charge for the package delivery should cover their costs david abney on amazon a lot of what amazon is doing is moving supplemental inventory and they do have planes and they are they probably have a second day network that they re utilizing but in order to have a next day network it would take a lot more planes and so we believe we add great value to amazon david abney on global supply chain a lot of our customers that are doing business in china are looking at other areas in asia and so i would believe that probably is a little bit bigger option but there are companies that are of course looking to move back into the u s or probably would do so with automated facilities and a little bit different than maybe when they left cnbc s squawk box with guggenheim global chief investment officer scott minerd video scott minerd on collision course the federal reserve is still on a restrictive path we re gonna slowdown but we re tightening and at the same time we re going to have stimulus come from the u s government in 2020 so this collision course between increasing rates and a more restrictive fiscal policy is going to spill over into the general economy scott minerd on slowing growth when you look at where potential output is for the united states and then you layer on you know the inflation rate we re we re just not growing at the same pace we historically have and you know when you have population not growing in the united states anymore you just don t have the same latitude scott minerd on productivity the productivity gains in the economy though they ve picked up recently have been pretty sluggish and i don t think that we re making the big gains in productivity that are gonna spill over into growth scott minerd on corporate debt qe was great because all of a sudden it lowered rates you were enticed to take on a lot of debt now that we re trying to reverse things and we re having quantitative tightening you know incrementally it s harder for companies to manage when they have large debt loads than when they had less debt scott minerd on bailout i think americans need to have more confidence in their willingness the willingness and ability of the government to print money and we ve learned that lesson the great bailout of the financial crisis was just to open the monetary taps and flood the system i think the policymakers learned their lesson i think bernanke waited too long before he cut rates which made things worse and they re going to be quick to go back and engage in qe again if they have to scott minerd on 2020 recession the peak happens typically about 4 to 6 months before the recession starts so i would say that sometime in the latter half of 2020 and from here we probably have some more upside for the time being joe kernen 3 000 on the s p or minerd you could get that high i m thinking maybe about 15 from where we are today cnbc s squawk box with carlyle group co founder and co executive chair david rubenstein video david rubenstein on a longer shutdown the members of congress and the people in the administration know that this is hurting the economy the shutdown and they really want to resolve this and i think there s a real resolve to get it resolved very quickly so it could be more than a few days it could be very soon but it s not going to go on for a month or so in my view both sides recognize this is not in the country s interest both sides recognize that something has to be done and there s going to be much political backlash against both sides if something isn t done soon that s the general sense that people in congress have people in the white house have as well david rubenstein on china negotiations the chinese weren t sure that president trump really meant what he said about being tough on trade because he was very polite to xi jinping they now realize in my view that he s very serious about this and they also realize this that if he were to depart tomorrow there is somebody behind him who supports the same views in other words his views are probably the views of 40 or 45 of the american people so they realize that if trump goes away tomorrow they re still going to have to deal with somebody in his place who will have the same views david rubenstein on powell he tried to make it clear as he could that probably the expectation of 2 increases this year should be off the table for the time being there was a general expectation last year that you d have two fed increases two 25 basis point increases probably earlier in the year i think his view was probably you shouldn t assume that s going to happen now that s what his main message was in my view david rubenstein on investing in emerging markets the theory of emerging market investments is that prices are lower the growth rates will be higher and the profits will be higher now it turns out over the last 20 years that emerging market irrs are roughly the same as developed market irrs so there s no premium you re really getting in the emerging markets now that could change and individual deals could be better but generally you re going to get the same rate of return historically david rubenstein on u s political risks i often think the greatest political risk is in a country that you and i are very familiar with this country sometimes the united states has political risks that you can t anticipate now there are greater corruption issues lack of good management issues disclosure issues in the emerging markets and the exit opportunities are fewer but surely we recognize that from time to time the u s government does things that are hard to predict cnbc s squawk box with bridgewater co cio ray dalio video ray dalio on recession there s a significant risk of a recession a recession you know is it minus one plus one okay let s not get technical about that too much there s a high likelihood of a significant slowing in 2020 ray dalio on big impact the three big factors are the combination of the wealth gap and the politics as we come to it the where we are in the later cycle and the inability of central banks to ease as much that s the caldron that will define 2019 and 2020 in my opinion ray dalio on capitalism we have to re engineer capitalism in a way that produces productivity and there are ways of doing this there are things like microfinance or there s paying education you know in other words i think you have to do an all in accounting of the costs like if you educate somebody if you can t educate people well and you balance a budget you re not dealing with the total cost ray dalio on economy we re going to have a slowing of the economy not just in the u s but in europe and you re going to have a slower economy in other places and that s going to have an effect that will bring growth down to a certain level in that notion of how monetary policy will be part of that and at the same time politics and the disparity issue are going to merge ray dalio on the fed i think we are now in a situation in which now you take the term structure of rates which is basically that rates will not rise that s what s built into the curve if it rises faster than that i think we re going to have another problem and then so it shouldn t rise and then i think as we re going forward when we take a look at what will the how much will the economy slow and how much will some of the lending that supported the stock buybacks and supported the you know the big growth was corporate lending which was financed because the cost of funds was cheap in relationship to the return on equity and then we ll see how that passes through cnbc s squawk box with ibm ceo ginni rometty video ginni rometty on red hat when we did red hat it will be 200 basis points to our revenue growth as we talked about that s right accretive in the second year free cash flow though a billion dollars and so it s really a good move for all of ibm because it s 200 basis points to all of ibm when we talk revenue growth and when you look about where ibm is right now in this reinvention what i would say is now it s up to us to consistently perform ginni rometty on precision regulation every government right now the issue is privacy of consumer data and so every government is itching to regulate and i think the risk we all have is that there s a great overreaction and the casualty is the whole digital economy where really what we have to protect is consumer privacy and that s consent opt out ability to delete and that is what i would call almost like precision medicine precision regulation ginni rometty on trust we re 108 years old and we have always lived by that view that we exist because clients trust us with data so i think every company now has to do that when everyone s looking to benefit from it if you re gonna benefit from it you have to live by those rules ginni rometty on oil metaphor i think it was probably 7 years ago i started using that oil metaphor but it was for a different reason it wasn t about limited not limited i think the real point to that metaphor is value goes to those that actually refine it not to those who just hold it and just like with countries poor countries have oil and so that s what that meant i think the future and again i just left a discussion on this people say well gee if as an example china has no privacy rules and has all this data do they win in ai having a lot of data for the current state of ai is useful but there s more and more ai innovation being done that learns with less data so i don t call this a war one way or the other that s over this idea that our technologies are going to learn with less data that s what we re working on and others are it s gonna make a big difference here ginni rometty on skills crisis i think there s another side to tax reform of why haven t we see as much prolonged sustained again another discussion we just had yes there s been tax reform but we have not paid as much attention to to me the societal issues there s a this trust headwind you just mentioned with data but this skills crisis is a real issue so you may take and have capital but if we don t help bridge these gaps on skills i think this is what you re missing and you know fourth industrial revolution is the topic here every past industrial revolution had a great technology but then it was accompanied by both physical infrastructure and societal infrastructure to spread the benefits evenly that s what we haven t paid attention to cnbc s squawk box with silver lake partners north island co founder glenn hutchins video glenn hutchins on market data disparity people are all looking at economic data and concluding reaching one conclusion from it they re looking at the markets and reaching a different conclusion or wondering why the two seem to be different we have to understand the markets are backward the economic data pardon me is backward looking what happened in the 4th quarter right the markets are forecasting the future and so the markets right now are saying something very different for what they expect for the future than what the economic data is showing happened in the most recent past glenn hutchins on global slowdown the main thing the markets are forecasting i think right now is a global slowdown china s slowing down germany s slowing down emerging markets and then interest rate sensitive sectors of the united states not contributing as much to the economic growth as a consequence housing and others as a consequence of interest rates going up glenn hutchins on the fed the fed is not going to tighten and create a recession they just don t want to do that the fed doesn t really care about market levels what they care about is the market as a transmission of policy to the real economy so when the real economy does falter with respect to unemployment or growth and that can come as a result the market transmissions that do that primarily are interest rates affecting borrowing levels or a wealth effect affecting consumption but as long as it s just the markets moving around that s not within their mandate cnbc s squawk box with bp ceo bob dudley video bob dudley on oil prices it is tightening up i think a big variable in of course the iran s sanctions whether it be applied or not big overcorrection up went down and i think we re heading back into reasonable balance and by the way we don t see the demand actually falling bob dudley on china we just looked at the figures and project another 1 4 million barrels a day growth in crude but we re not seeing this worrying thought it s all going to start falling bob dudley on saudi our relationships with saudi aramco we work with them on the gas climate initiatives we know saudi arabia well we don t have a lot of investments in there we have found a way over the years but it has not changed our relationship at all bob dudley on advertising we ve come out of a really difficult decade of the company i don t think we had the credibility to talk about things in an exciting way we re doing a lot in the getting ready for the energy transitions that are going to happen a lot of natural gas we are working on renewables of course we have a lot of oil and i think it s time for us to just tell our story a little bit differently let people know we re engaged in this transition that happened and we have a great big core business bob dudley on emissions we do believe that the world needs to reduce emissions we think it s not a race to renewable it s got to be a combination of many things renewables and natural gas is going to be a natural grouping and as long as you re in advantaged oil the world s going to need lots and lots of oil for decades and decades to come for more information contact jennifer dauble cnbc t 201 735 4721 m 201 615 2787 e

the global economy grew at a steady 3 1 per cent last year and similar levels of growth are expected in 2019 but these headline figures mask growth that is uneven and often failing to reach where it is most needed the un s chief economist warned on monday we still have relatively strong growth but we do see rising risks on the horizon and an increasing likelihood that some of these risks might actually materialize said elliott harris united nations chief economist in comments coinciding with the launch of the world economic situation and prospects 2019 wesp report among these looming dangers accelerating trade tensions are already having an impact on global trade and employment mr harris told un news in addition rising national debt is also crippling many countries ability to provide basic services but this and other risks such as those from climate change and waning support for international cooperation could be avoided or minimized if countries worked together to do so the un s top economist insisted with mounting pressures in the areas of international trade international development finance and tackling climate change the report underscores that strengthening global cooperation is central to advancing sustainable development yet these threats come at a time when international cooperation and governance are more important than ever many of the challenges laid out in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development are global by nature and require collective and cooperative action waning support for multilateralism also raises questions around the capacity for collaborative policy action in the event of a widespread global shock un report spotlights uneven progress according to the wesp report published by the un department of economic and social affairs more than half the world s economies saw growth accelerate in 2017 and 2018 developed economies grew at 2 2 per cent in both years while unemployment rates dropped among developing economies east asia and south asia saw the strongest gains in 2018 at 5 8 per cent and 5 6 per cent respectively while commodity exporting countries continued their gradual recovery this improvement was particularly true for fuel rich emerging nations despite high debt levels caused by a fall in commodity prices in 2014 15 although the overall picture among developing economies is largely positive many are nonetheless experiencing uneven progress the un report cautioned amid falling individual per capita wealth in several nations further declines or weak per capita growth are anticipated in 2019 in central southern and west africa western asia and latin america and the caribbean homes to nearly a quarter of the global population living in extreme poverty it noted and even where growth is strong it is often driven by core industrial and urban regions the wesp 2019 report continued such that rural areas are being left behind to overcome this and for poverty to be eradicated by 2030 the un report suggests that there will need to be both double digit growth in africa along with steep reductions in unequal pay levels us china trade tensions on the issue of trade tensions it noted that these had led to a fall in global trade levels in 2018 from 5 3 per cent in 2017 to 3 8 per cent and as a result of the united states china uncertainty the expectation is that trade volumes in 2019 will be lower still mr harris suggested government subsidies have to some extent softened the impact of the tariff hikes in the us and china whose growth is expected to decrease from 6 6 per cent in 2018 to 6 3 per cent this year but the risk is that developing economies may suffer the fallout too unless the dispute is settled if the trade dispute becomes more widespread we will likely to see disruptions of global value change mr harris explained bear in mind that the participation of global trade has been one of the ways that developing countries have participated in the rising global prosperity and have accelerated their own developments so anything that disrupts that of course will have a negative impact on their abilities to increase their levels of prosperity and to develop sustainably this cautionary assessment is telling because the us in 2018 contributed more to global trade than japan or the european union according to un economists at unctad the un conference on trade and development which contributed to the wesp 2019 report rising interest rates in the us or a strengthening of the dollar could also make matters worse for fragile emerging economies the wesp report noted adding that many low income countries have already seen a substantial rise in interest repayments on their debt these include lebanon and sri lanka where over 40 per cent of government revenue is spent servicing its debt as well as pakistan and jamaica where around a quarter of their budget is used to pay interest on national debt representing a major constraint on public services slow steady growth in eu but brexit looms on the european union s prospects the wesp report estimates growth of two per cent for the next two years with much stronger performances potentially from states who became members since 2004 the pack is led by poland which saw its economy grow by five per cent in 2018 the bloc s biggest economy germany is set to see more moderate growth however at 1 8 per cent amid potential disruption to the domestic car industry from new technologies new competitors and significant legal and financial consequences from past sales practices related to the diesel technology france is also set to see lower than average growth 1 8 per cent linked to its weaker export outlook while the uk 1 4 per cent is projected to pay for trade uncertainty linked to its plans to exit the eu or brexit with companies moving assets or diverting investment from the uk to the eu wesp 2019 notes the brexit fallout may also be felt outside the eu the un report warns with a possible 10 15 per cent decline in funding available to eu accession countries commonwealth states central europe slso see modest growth in most commonwealth of independent states cis which includes russia most saw accelerating growth and slowing inflation last year amid supportive commodity prices despite this overall growth is forecast to slow modestly this year to two per cent and 2 5 per cent in 2020 wesp 2019 suggests amid concerns that strong expansion in smaller economies may be unsustainable while lower public spending is expected in others focusing on russia the un report notes that lifting the value added tax vat rate may encourage inflation and curb household spending while ongoing sanctions could deter investment from abroad other large commodity exporting countries such as brazil and nigeria should see a moderate pickup in growth in 2019 2020 albeit from a low base noting robust growth in central asia s tajikistan thanks to increased aluminium and gold exports wesp 2019 also suggests a much more positive future for the whole region once china s belt and road initiative becomes operational frequently hailed as a 21st century version of the ancient silk road trade route the region should benefit from upgrades to countries railway road and energy infrastructure improved connections with china and europe and better market access the report explains elsewhere south eastern europe saw faster growth in 2018 and its overall gross domestic product gdp is expected to expand by 3 7 per cent in 2019 and 2020 serbia the region s largest economy benefited from double digit growth in investment amid strong performances in farming and construction while albania also saw solid economic performance wesp 2019 noted before cautioning that longer term improvements risk being constrained unless there are improvements in industrial infrastructure and dependence on foreign financing

source understanding zim s past shaping the future the herald january 22 2019 andrew maimba correspondent the challenges bedevilling zimbabwe are a product of the past 1999 2017 and the current political leadership including the opposition must work towards liberating zimbabweans so that they are not prisoners of that past the following events and not operation restore legacy and the 2018 harmonised elections results got zimbabwe to where it is today understanding the past in the zanu pf manifesto for the 1995 general elections zanu pf amplified the provisions for benefits of war veterans in august 1997 the government announced a new compensation and pension plan for about 60 000 war veterans which saw each ex combatant get a gratuity of 50 000 about us 4 500 then and monthly pension of roughly us 174 however all this money which the treasury had not budgeted for in that year led to the infamous black friday of november 14 1997 which saw the zimbabwean dollar tumbling against the united states dollar when government finally honoured its pledge the total package paid to the war veterans amounted to approximately 3 percent of the 1997 gdp and it was not included in the 1997 budget the payments resulted in a 55 percent budget deficit in december 1998 zimbabwe s standing line of credit with the world bank was suspended this marked the beginning of the economic woes for zimbabwe as the zimbabwean dollar lost 75 percent of its value against the us dollar on august 19 1998 a meeting of sadc leaders was held in harare where angola namibia and zimbabwe committed to assist laurent kabila s government in line with an oau resolution the zimbabwe defence forces would launch sadc operation sovereign legitimacy between 1998 and 2002 during that war the us government was supporting the rebels which were sadc allies enemies and as the rebels were defeated the us influenced western donors including the international monetary fund and the world bank to review aid programmes to harare denying the government a previously guaranteed aid package valued at us 600 million this put further a strain on the zimbabwean economy further the zanu pf election manifesto for the general elections of 1995 undertook to press forward with the land reform programme where the party directed government to resettle indigenous people on 3 4 million hectares that it had acquired from white commercial farmers the costly mistake ever to be made by the white farmers was the widely publicised event were just after the formation of the mdc in 1999 zbctv showed a video of morgan tsvangirai gleefully clapping hands as white farmers jostled to sign cheque donations to the newly formed party in brief the negative results of the land reform include the imposition of sanctions under the guise of human rights violations and lack of compensation to white farmers but are really a tool for teaching other african states a strong lesson that no land must be taken from beneficiaries of colonialism without compensation because of the land reform zimbabwe became isolated from the international community as the pressure on the zimbabwean dollar persisted forex reserves dropped to critical levels gideon gono the then reserve bank of zimbabwe governor began to engage in quasi fiscal activities and introduced import controls and banned foreign currency accounts fcas the banning of the fcas led to a situation where the rbz began to retain all export proceeds creating an opportunity for corruption in the control and allocation of the scarce forex reserves as the economy was struggling former president mugabe became fixated on consolidating his power factionalism began eating into the party elected members of district and provincial structures were being expelled to facilitate the takeover of party leadership by former first lady grace mugabe those who raised concerns over mugabe s leadership were persecuted the corruption created an oligarchy which has built large houses and drives expensive cars and are frequently out of the country to spend money the neglect of government business affected service delivery all of this put together has cost the country further in stolen resources opportunities and time wasted zimbabwe is largely a spiritual country with most practising christianity blended with african religion during the second chimurenga the freedom fighters would consult traditional leaders and would be guided there is a belief that there are certain rituals that need to be done to thank the ancestors and to correct certain wrongs emanating from the pre and post chimurenga period the failure by government to address the spiritual issues said to be outstanding has often been cited as the reason why the once peaceful nation is turning against itself there is no doubt an economic warfare that has been waged by certain western countries together with the us government against zimbabwe is on zimbabwe is endowed with resources that are not available in the west and in the us and the policies of zanu pf which are pro zimbabwean people have made these resources difficult to access by the west hence they prefer a western inclined regime in the form of the mdc this is why it is not difficult to find a relationship between the mdc as a party as well as its leaders and sanctions for example zdera the country is under trade economic financial undeclared sanctions as well as arrears triggered penalties balance of payments lines of credit and also foreign direct investment have been prohibited or minimised and the effects are not targeted as claimed by opposition elements but are felt across vulnerable groups and the entire economy hence their maintenance for as long as zanu pf is the governing party this argument can be supported by the fact that when morgan tsvangirai was prime minister he called for the lifting of sanctions while he was in australia in july 2012 where he stated i think there is justification for the international community to remove the sanctions because i think they ve outlived their usefulness soon after losing the presidential election in 2013 he started advocating for their imposition again indicating that the sanctions are meant to turn the people against the government in order for a pro western opposition to be in power shaping the future the fundamentals required to get zimbabwe back on its feet regardless of who is president or which is the ruling party are i opening up of democratic space ii upholding of the rule of law iii fighting corruption iv re engagement with the international community in an effort to attract investors fdi and reopening lines of credit v enhancing agricultural and industrial production for domestic consumption and export vi reducing the deficit between imports and exports vii reducing government expenditure viii enhancing productivity within the public service ix abandoning electoral results disputes and unwarranted mass action since taking control of the levers of state president mnangagwa has worked towards getting zimbabwe back on its feet the nelson chamisa led mdc alliance cannot afford to let him succeed if they are to remain a political option for zimbabwe this is the reason why they have formulated the jecha policy to sabotage the president s efforts and the more they allow the president to work the quicker zimbabweans will realise that he president mnangagwa is working towards improving the lives of the people this is why from december 2018 mdc alliance leaders such as nelson chamisa tendai biti chalton hwende patson dzamara doug coltart and happymore chidziva have taken to social media threatening to make the country ungovernable in 2019 mdc lost the local authorities national assembly senatorial and presidential elections and they have to wait for 2023 to have another shot they need to give president mnangagwa a chance to sort out a situation created over 21 years the challenges we are facing cannot be sorted out in a year no matter who is the president
a woman walks in shanghai s lujiazui financial district this month chinese policymakers are struggling to turn around the rapidly weakening economy with growth at its lowest since the global financial crisis a decade ago just about every indicator of economic health in china is down on top of apple s slumping sales here car sales have plunged for the first time in 20 years property sales housing construction foreign investment december imports and exports have all slowed and the job market has gotten a lot tougher chinese policymakers are struggling to turn around the rapidly weakening economy the world s second largest with growth in 2018 at its lowest rate for 28 years and the government showing its alarm has been censoring bad news about the economy for months a raft of bad financial data in recent weeks suggests the turnaround efforts so far have not worked raising alarm about how bad things might get especially if the trade war with the united states drags on china s economic woes along with a worrying decline in european manufacturing have sparked fears of a global slowdown this month the world bank released an outlook report titled darkening skies in which it cut its global growth forecast for 2019 to 2 9 from 3 and cited the u s china trade war as a big concern advertisement the conflict didn t cause the slowdown but it did make things worse a double whammy as one economist put it the trade war with the united states has increased anxieties and the sense of uncertainty about china s place in the global economy and its ability to successfully implement economic reforms and escape the middle income trap said scott kennedy an expert on china s economy at the washington based center for strategic and international studies the uncertainty has further led consumers to limit their spending on high priced items and save more for necessities like healthcare education and housing he said that s a drain on the world economy because global manufacturers of cars cellphones and luxury goods have relied on china for a big chunk of their sales in recent years in cyclical terms china s enjoying a chinese style recession kennedy said the official growth numbers are still around 6 or so but all of the measures that one would typically look at to see economic activity whether you re talking about manufacturing or consumer activity all are flat or down chinese economic statistics are widely mistrusted making it difficult to determine just how bad things are last month a former chief economist at the agricultural bank of china gave a speech citing an internal report by a major institution analyzing chinese growth that applied two measures one found growth was 1 67 the other that it was negative xiang songzuo of renmin university did not name the institution video of his speech was immediately censored advertisement as china s economy gets the chills some california firms catch a cold experts say china s troubles stem from government efforts from mid 2017 to control the shadow banking sector with its risky poorly regulated lenders and to clean up a mountain of debt much of it accrued by local government the debt binge came with china s massive stimulus after the global financial crisis the resulting tightening of credit led to the economic slowdown analysts say the depth of the slowdown appeared to take beijing by surprise kennedy said chinese stock indexes in shanghai and shenzhen lost almost a quarter of their value in 2018 the nation is aiming to convert to a high tech high wage economy to do that it is relying on its made in china 2025 campaign with government support for state owned enterprises to drive advances in robotics artificial intelligence aerospace it green energy and other fields but critics say the enterprises and banks owned by the state are wasteful and inefficient the chinese government has launched a major stimulus to try to revive the confidence of consumers and private companies including tax cuts successive cuts to the ratio of funds banks must maintain demands that banks lend more to private companies 135 billion for railways and airports and steps to speed up other infrastructure one province is even considering adding half a day to weekends to allow people more shopping time advertisement the moves announced so far would inject more than 600 billion into the economy according to kennedy but will it be enough in order for china to counter negative consumer and investor sentiment it needs growth now said alicia garcia herrero chief economist for the asia pacific region at french investment bank natixis commuters ride a bus in beijing s central business district this month andy wong associated press she said the stimulus measures taken last year had been blunted by the slowing effect of the drive to get local government debt under control and the clampdown on shadow banking another factor was the government s massive anti corruption drive which left some state officials wary about major investments garcia herrero said so the public part of the infrastructure driven investment driven stimulus has not proven as effective as it might have she said yu yongding economic analyst with the chinese academy of social sciences said a slowdown was inevitable after decades of growth but argued that the nation s financial stability would be at risk if the government didn t boost the economy in an article published this month by the independent economic and financial news agency caixin yu urged the government to take stronger measures even if it meant weakening the currency or increasing the budget deficit advertisement he said the slowdown came amid foreign and domestic doubts about china s ability to undertake economic reform some even anticipate a financial crisis caused by a bursting housing bubble or large scale debt defaults by local governments and corporations the trade war with the united states only deepens such worries kennedy said the measures rolled out so far paled in comparison with the massive stimulus china launched after the global financial crisis and he predicted more steps to boost the economy in coming months they certainly have room to do a lot more if they need to he said adding that it would take time for efforts to translate into economic activity chinese officials have promised a goldilocks approach not too much not too little but just the right amount of stimulus to try to get chinese consumers to buy big ticket items and put the economy on track without adding too much to debt xiang the economist said china had built an economy based on credit and speculation and he called for an end to the country s obsession with maintaining high levels of growth he said local government debt fueled by past stimulus packages was a major problem with uncertainty as to how high the real figure was and how much would ever be paid back kennedy said china s ability to avoid a debt crisis depended on whether the government was willing to embrace further liberal market reforms advertisement private companies are already pretty efficient users of capital but state owned enterprises are not and chinese state owned banks are very wasteful he said arguing that china must make structural changes to the economy china still has a lot of low hanging fruit to make this economy more efficient but that requires politically difficult choices by the leadership that they haven t wanted to adopt so far it s going to require them to make some structural changes in the economy actually the type of things the united states and others have been calling on china to do if they don t if they continue down the path which they are still on then eventually they will run into problems

by this article is brought to you in association with the united nations the global economy grew at a steady 3 1 per cent last year and similar levels of growth are expected in 2019 but these headline figures mask growth that is uneven and often failing to reach where it is most needed the un s chief economist warned on monday we still have relatively strong growth but we do see rising risks on the horizon and an increasing likelihood that some of these risks might actually materialize said elliott harris united nations chief economist in comments coinciding with the launch of the world economic situation and prospects 2019 wesp report among these looming dangers accelerating trade tensions are already having an impact on global trade and employment mr harris told un news in addition rising national debt is also crippling many countries ability to provide basic services but this and other risks such as those from climate change and waning support for international cooperation could be avoided or minimized if countries worked together to do so the un s top economist insisted with mounting pressures in the areas of international trade international development finance and tackling climate change the report underscores that strengthening global cooperation is central to advancing sustainable development yet these threats come at a time when international cooperation and governance are more important than ever many of the challenges laid out in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development are global by nature and require collective and cooperative action waning support for multilateralism also raises questions around the capacity for collaborative policy action in the event of a widespread global shock un report spotlights uneven progress according to the wesp report published by the un department of economic and social affairs more than half the world s economies saw growth accelerate in 2017 and 2018 developed economies grew at 2 2 per cent in both years while unemployment rates dropped among developing economies east asia and south asia saw the strongest gains in 2018 at 5 8 per cent and 5 6 per cent respectively while commodity exporting countries continued their gradual recovery this improvement was particularly true for fuel rich emerging nations despite high debt levels caused by a fall in commodity prices in 2014 15 although the overall picture among developing economies is largely positive many are nonetheless experiencing uneven progress the un report cautioned amid falling individual per capita wealth in several nations further declines or weak per capita growth are anticipated in 2019 in central southern and west africa western asia and latin america and the caribbean homes to nearly a quarter of the global population living in extreme poverty it noted and even where growth is strong it is often driven by core industrial and urban regions the wesp 2019 report continued such that rural areas are being left behind to overcome this and for poverty to be eradicated by 2030 the un report suggests that there will need to be both double digit growth in africa along with steep reductions in unequal pay levels us china trade tensions on the issue of trade tensions it noted that these had led to a fall in global trade levels in 2018 from 5 3 per cent in 2017 to 3 8 per cent and as a result of the united states china uncertainty the expectation is that trade volumes in 2019 will be lower still mr harris suggested government subsidies have to some extent softened the impact of the tariff hikes in the us and china whose growth is expected to decrease from 6 6 per cent in 2018 to 6 3 per cent this year but the risk is that developing economies may suffer the fallout too unless the dispute is settled if the trade dispute becomes more widespread we will likely to see disruptions of global value change mr harris explained bear in mind that the participation of global trade has been one of the ways that developing countries have participated in the rising global prosperity and have accelerated their own developments so anything that disrupts that of course will have a negative impact on their abilities to increase their levels of prosperity and to develop sustainably this cautionary assessment is telling because the us in 2018 contributed more to global trade than japan or the european union according to un economists at unctad the un conference on trade and development which contributed to the wesp 2019 report rising interest rates in the us or a strengthening of the dollar could also make matters worse for fragile emerging economies the wesp report noted adding that many low income countries have already seen a substantial rise in interest repayments on their debt these include lebanon and sri lanka where over 40 per cent of government revenue is spent servicing its debt as well as pakistan and jamaica where around a quarter of their budget is used to pay interest on national debt representing a major constraint on public services slow steady growth in eu but brexit looms on the european union s prospects the wesp report estimates growth of two per cent for the next two years with much stronger performances potentially from states who became members since 2004 the pack is led by poland which saw its economy grow by five per cent in 2018 the bloc s biggest economy germany is set to see more moderate growth however at 1 8 per cent amid potential disruption to the domestic car industry from new technologies new competitors and significant legal and financial consequences from past sales practices related to the diesel technology france is also set to see lower than average growth 1 8 per cent linked to its weaker export outlook while the uk 1 4 per cent is projected to pay for trade uncertainty linked to its plans to exit the eu or brexit with companies moving assets or diverting investment from the uk to the eu wesp 2019 notes the brexit fallout may also be felt outside the eu the un report warns with a possible 10 15 per cent decline in funding available to eu accession countries commonwealth states central europe slso see modest growth in most commonwealth of independent states cis which includes russia most saw accelerating growth and slowing inflation last year amid supportive commodity prices despite this overall growth is forecast to slow modestly this year to two per cent and 2 5 per cent in 2020 wesp 2019 suggests amid concerns that strong expansion in smaller economies may be unsustainable while lower public spending is expected in others focusing on russia the un report notes that lifting the value added tax vat rate may encourage inflation and curb household spending while ongoing sanctions could deter investment from abroad other large commodity exporting countries such as brazil and nigeria should see a moderate pickup in growth in 2019 2020 albeit from a low base noting robust growth in central asia s tajikistan thanks to increased aluminium and gold exports wesp 2019 also suggests a much more positive future for the whole region once china s belt and road initiative becomes operational frequently hailed as a 21st century version of the ancient silk road trade route the region should benefit from upgrades to countries railway road and energy infrastructure improved connections with china and europe and better market access the report explains elsewhere south eastern europe saw faster growth in 2018 and its overall gross domestic product gdp is expected to expand by 3 7 per cent in 2019 and 2020 serbia the region s largest economy benefited from double digit growth in investment amid strong performances in farming and construction while albania also saw solid economic performance wesp 2019 noted before cautioning that longer term improvements risk being constrained unless there are improvements in industrial infrastructure and dependence on foreign financing

from the outlook on the overall u s economy to the impacts of tariffs and tax reform on farmers and ranchers the american farm bureau federation s four economists shared their insights on a variety of topics during a workshop at the american farm bureau federation s 100th annual convention beef pork and poultry afbf economist michael nepveux detailed the strong outlook for animal protein consumption because most u s pork beef and poultry is consumed within the country the farmers who raise those animals are typically far less affected by the trade turmoil while exports certainly serve as a vital market we still rely very heavily on domestic consumption he said still there is quite a bit of growth in export markets with beef and pork in particular the domestic market is somewhat of a mature market so as we keep expanding production we need somewhere to put the protein and that s usually overseas the pork sector s efforts to expand its production and its reach into foreign markets over the last decade has pushed up their exports to almost 25 percent of their production though all three meat sectors will continue to grow nepveux said the pace will likely moderate especially for beef we ve got a lot of beef but we were saved this year by higher than expected domestic demand as well as exports many of the largest foreign destinations for u s beef like japan are not problematic markets beef exports to canada did slip a little bit but the free trade agreement with south korea provides additional opportunities ultimately u s beef exports for 2018 were a record 3 1 billion pounds pork production since 2015 has been steadily increasing to the point that hog inventory in december 2018 was the highest ever reported pork took a harder hit than beef in the trade war with china that coupled with record production pushed prices down making pork more appealing to other foreign customers yes people were buying more but at a discounted price nepveux said on the dairy front record milk production coupled with decreasing consumption in the u s will likely result in u s dairy farmers exporting more milk than the u s is consuming as class i fluid milk within the next decade ramped up poultry production has resulted in more product in cold storage and lower prices which will likely lead to the industry rebalancing in the near future though exports may have slipped a little in china mexico and hong kong other buyers like vietnam taiwan and angola have stepped up to take advantage of the lower prices crop consumption and outlook economic analyst megan nelson s update on 2018 19 crop consumption pace and outlook for acreage this year showed trade troubles with china are driving some u s agriculture exports down significantly at 629 million bushels soybean exports are down 49 percent or 609 million bushels compared to this time last year according to usda s jan 7 federal grain inspection service report the main driver for this is decrease is the 98 percent drop in soybean exports to china representing 708 million bushels nelson explained in addition china s revisions to its grain balance sheet extending back to 2007 08 led to a major shift in the world supply and demand estimates adding a cumulative 10 5 billion bushels to its corn production from 2007 08 to 2017 18 this addition resulted in global corn stockpiles increasing 106 percent from 5 8 billion bushels to 12 2 billion bushels for 2018 19 and 8 2 billion bushels for chinese stocks alone many people nelson said are wondering which crop soybean farmers will move to considering their dire market situation higher corn prices have many analysts predicting corn production will increase between from about 90 million bushels to 92 million bushels which is about a 2 percent increase similarly higher wheat prices will also likely result in boost to wheat acreage highlighting some commodity specific events nelson said 2018 brought on a slew of catastrophic weather conditions throughout the cotton belt leading to 3 6 million acres abandoned that s about 26 percent of total u s planted cotton acres trade labor and taxes afbf economist veronica nigh discussed trade labor and tax policy on the labor front nigh addressed the sharp uptick in certified h 2a positions in some states and for some positions the increase is hardly surprising but we re seeing increases in all states and for a variety of positions she said in 2018 h 2a numbers rose 21 percent from the previous year and in 2019 we could see an 18 percent jump from the previous year that means we ll certify almost 300 000 positions which is a lot of positions considering we were at less than 100 000 just seven years ago nigh said just as the number of certified h 2a positions is growing so is the minimum wage rates for h 2a workers known as the adverse effect wage rate the rate for 2019 12 96 is a 6 percent increase from 2018 but as nigh pointed out farmers and ranchers profits are hardly growing as steadily while beans have been in the trade related headlines exports of sorghum pork apples cherries seafood whiskey ginseng and some processed foods are also suffering together with soybeans the u s exports of these commodities to the retaliating countries represent 30 percent or more of their total exports the recently implemented tax cut and jobs act gives a boost to farmers and ranchers by reducing individual tax rates providing unlimited bonus depreciation and doubling the estate tax exemption had these provisions been in place in 2016 the average effective tax rate for a farm would have been reduced by 3 3 percent according to a study by the agriculture department s economic research service the legislation s 20 percent business income deduction will be especially helpful nigh noted had the deduction been available in 2016 over 46 percent of farmers would have been able to use the it and the total amount of this deduction from taxable income would have been 9 6 billion she said again citing ers u s farm economy dr john newton chief economist said the strong overall u s economy boasting 36 consecutive quarters of positive gross domestic product growth is pushing unemployment rates to a nearly 50 year low despite this stellar performance consumers are starting to get shaky concern over interest rates and the trade war is starting to show itself in a decline in consumer and ceo confidence in the u s economy newton said interest rates have gone up nine times since the recession started and some were initially thinking the federal reserve could bump them up as many as four more times this year president trump s pressure on the federal reserve chairman could hold those increases to no more than two at 66 3 billion net farm income in 2018 was the third lowest in the last 20 years when adjusted for inflation though farmers appear to be pulling in more money they re spending a lot more to raise their animals and grow their crops cash receipts have gone up but so have production expenses including servicing debt newton said another factor in cash receipts are government payments which at 13 6 billion were up 18 percent from the previous year the university of missouri is projecting net farm income will again decrease this year but two key factors disaster payments and trade mitigation assistance remain unknown as does crop size farm debt is a record 410 billion ballooning by 105 billion over the last decade with a lot of that coming from real estate if you look at how much of our debt is represented by the annual income in agriculture this year it s at 97 percent that s a 32 year high another year of low prices combined with higher interest rates and higher costs of servicing those loans really make you wonder how long we can continue to be in this situation across agriculture similarly the u s debt to asset ratio is on the rise although it s nowhere near what it was in the 1980s thanks to the high value of agricultural assets clocking in a 3 04 trillion today u s agriculture s assets were valued at 775 billion
davos switzerland fears are rising about the state of the world s biggest economies with china posting its worst annual growth in decades and the united states injecting more uncertainty with tariffs and a lengthy government shutdown china reported monday that its economy expanded by 6 6 percent last year a figure that would be good for many countries but represents the slowest growth for china in 28 years meanwhile the international monetary fund downgraded its expectations for the global economy highlighting sharp declines in europe and warning that the risks of a major slowdown have increased the pair of announcements came as top executives and world leaders gathered in this ritzy ski resort town for the annual world economic forum in contrast to a year ago when president trump and other world leaders talked about global prosperity this year attendees expressed worry that the united states was undermining its own economy and the rest of the world s via a trade war and the longest partial government shutdown in u s history advertisement in the united states the shutdown has already cut into growth according to numerous economists even u s consumers who have remained resilient for months have been shaken early this month consumer confidence slumped to the lowest level of trump s presidency according to the university of michigan s consumer sentiment survey while few see a recession as imminent the high level officials and executives at davos catalogue a growing number of risks including the trade war the potential of britain leaving the european union without a final agreement with the e u rising interest rates high global debt levels and more polarized politics around the world after two years of solid expansion the world economy is growing more slowly than expected and risks are rising said christine lagarde managing director of the international monetary fund does that mean a global recession is around the corner no but the risk of a sharper decline in global growth has certainly increased advertisement the scene at davos epitomized the changes in the world economy a year ago trump and other foreign leaders gathered here to try to put their differences aside it came at a time when the major countries were growing in sync with one another and trump received a warm welcome after large u s corporate tax cuts but now trump british prime minister theresa may and other world leaders are sitting out the conference dealing with problems back at home and the hope for expanded global business has been dashed by the trade war and other setbacks i think there is anxiety there are concerns the slowdown could be quite deep said john hagel co chairman of deloitte s center for the edge a research group the more we can show some progress and resolution of some trade disputes that would help advertisement the imf is the latest institution to scale back its growth forecasts following downward revisions by the federal reserve and many banks the imf predicts 3 5 percent global growth in 2019 and 3 6 percent in 2020 down from 3 7 percent forecasts for both years in the fall but imf economists warned that they had already downgraded growth in china and the united states in the autumn because of the trade war and that they only see greater risks of a slide from here it s absolutely crucial for us to turn around the momentum and policy can really help said gita gopinath the new head of research at the imf the downward revisions are modest however we believe the risks to more significant downward corrections are rising the rapidly slowing euro zone especially germany france and italy was the biggest factor in the revised predictions germany is struggling as exports weaken and its auto sector tries to adjust to new regulations france is trying to rebound from street protests over a climate tax that have dampened sentiment and italy is battling debt problems and sluggish spending advertisement i think it s not ruled out that you might see one or two weak quarters in the european economy bordering on a technical recession said axel weber chairman of ubs but he said he was optimistic that it would be a temporary soft spot the imf forecasts that the u s economy will grow at 2 5 percent this year and 1 8 percent next year these predictions are unchanged from what the imf said in october but they represent a noticeable decline from about 3 percent growth last year china is expected to grow at 6 2 percent both years even slower than last year as an economy slows it s easier for it to be knocked off track many economists say when you re growing at 3 percent you need a big shock to hurt the economy said nariman behravesh chief economist at ihs markit when you re down to 1 5 to 2 percent growth all it takes is a little shock advertisement in beijing and across china authorities have been pulling out all the stops to try to avoid a hard landing for the economy promoting measures that are both traditional and inventive china s central bank has allowed banks to lend more against their reserves a move that could free up almost 120 billion for loans the central government is cutting tax rates

and property sales in china all slowed in the final quarter of last year car sales were particularly poor recording the first annual drop in more than two decades and the unemployment rate is climbing but many economists consider official chinese figures too rosy advertisement using a range of data to come up with a more reliable figure julian evans pritchard a china analyst at the capital economics consultancy said that the growth rate probably slowed to 5 3 percent in the last three months of the year a key question is how far beijing will go to mollify trump and end the trade war the economy is a much bigger problem for xi jinping than the trade war the last thing he wants is a bunch of angry people protesting because they ve lost their jobs said andrew collier managing director of orient capital research a hong kong based consultancy slowing economic growth is putting pressure on him to solve as many problems as he can and the trade war will be top of his list he said in the united states there is no end in sight to the government shutdown and trump has not removed any of the tariffs he put in place twelve percent of u s imports still have new levies on them and trump has threatened to impose more advertisement trump has argued that any short term pain will be worth the long term benefit border security in the case of the government shutdown and more beneficial trade deals in the case of the tariffs china posts slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to u s trade tensions and new policies makes so much sense for china to finally do a real deal and stop playing

monday by pwc found that 30 percent of business leaders believe that global growth will decline in the next 12 months a record jump in pessimism to about six times the number who said that last year the most pronounced decline in optimism was in north america where it dropped from 63 percent a year ago to 37 percent now largely because of the fading fiscal stimulus from the tax cuts and the ongoing trade standoff that business executives thought would be short lived but keeps going with the rise of trade tension and protectionism it stands to reason that confidence is waning said bob moritz global chairman of pwc executives want a little bit more certainty and they want stability

rosemont ill jan 22 2019 globe newswire wintrust financial corporation wintrust or the company nasdaq wtfc announced record net income of 343 2 million or 5 86 per diluted common share for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to net income of 257 7 million or 4 40 per diluted common share for the same period of 2017 the company recorded net income of 79 7 million or 1 35 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to net income of 91 9 million or 1 57 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2018 and 68 8 million or 1 17 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2017 highlights of the fourth quarter of 2018 total period end loans increased by 697 million from the prior quarter the increase included 119 million of loans acquired in relation to the previously announced acquisition of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities of american enterprise bank aeb completed in early december total deposits increased by 1 2 billion from the prior quarter this increase included 151 million of deposits assumed in relation to aeb as well as additional incremental deposits generated subsequent to the previously announced acquisition of elektra holding company llc elektra the parent company of chicago deferred exchange company llc cdec offset by a reduction in brokered funds period end total loans outstanding ended the year 657 million higher than total average loans outstanding during the fourth quarter of 2018 providing positive momentum for net interest income in the first quarter of 2019 net interest margin increased by two basis points from the prior quarter which combined with 580 million of average earning asset growth created an increase in net interest income of 6 5 million from the prior quarter market volatility and recent acquisitions resulted in the following items negatively impacting fourth quarter 2018 pre tax earnings an 8 5 million negative fair value adjustment recognized on mortgage servicing rights related to changes in valuation assumptions and pay offs contributed to mortgage banking revenue decreasing by 17 8 million compared to the third quarter of 2018 production revenue decreased due to lower origination volumes and lower revenue margins recognized unrealized losses on equity securities of 2 6 million recognized a 1 1 million foreign currency remeasurement loss primarily related to weakness in canadian currency incurred 1 6 million of acquisition related expenses non performing assets decreased by 17 5 million now representing 0 44 of total assets non performing loans decreased by 14 0 million while other real estate owned decreased 3 5 million compared to the end of the third quarter of 2018 opened one new branch in the brighton park neighborhood of chicago illinois increasing our total branches to 167 locations see supplemental financial measures ratios on pages 10 11 for more information on non gaap measures edward j wehmer president and chief executive officer commented wintrust reported record net income of 343 2 million for the year ended december 31 2018 the eighth consecutive year of record net income net income was 79 7 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 down from the third quarter of 2018 primarily due to market related adjustments resulting from quickly declining interest rates and lower equity markets late in the year these market related adjustments and acquisition related expenses incurred in the fourth quarter negatively impacted our net overhead ratio by 18 basis points during the fourth quarter total assets and deposits grew by over 1 billion while we leveraged acquisitions to enhance our deposit mix a substantial amount of the balance sheet growth occurred near the end of the quarter which positions us well for the first quarter of 2019 additionally we improved our net interest margin by two basis points and have seen deposit costs stabilizing the improvement in our funding mix should allow for further net interest margin expansion in the first quarter of 2019 mr wehmer continued we experienced strong loan growth in our commercial commercial real estate and premium finance receivables portfolios during the fourth quarter increasing our total loans outstanding by 697 million our loan pipelines remain consistently strong and reflect opportunities to continue to grow loan balances during 2019 deposit growth outpaced loan growth during the fourth quarter lowering our loan to deposit ratio to 91 3 at year end organic deposit growth in the fourth quarter occurred across all deposit categories except time certificates of deposit the previously mentioned cdec acquisition allowed the company to bring 1 1 billion of low cost funding into our banks the new deposit source was utilized to optimize the balance sheet by reducing outstanding wholesale funding positions including 696 million of wholesale wealth management deposits 75 million of maturing brokered cds and 200 million of short term federal home loan bank advances we believe that we can continue to grow the cdec deposit base which will further drive down the company s loan to deposit ratio to our desired operating range and enable us to expand our investment portfolio if opportunities and market conditions that meet our standards arise commenting on credit quality mr wehmer noted during the fourth quarter of 2018 the company continued its practice of addressing and resolving non performing credits in a timely fashion total non performing assets declined 17 5 million during the fourth quarter dropping to 0 44 of total assets both non performing loans and other real estate owned declined during the quarter additionally near term 60 to 89 day delinquent loans declined to 34 2 million or only 0 1 of total loans in the fourth quarter of 2018 the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans ended the year at 135 net charge offs for the fourth quarter were 12 basis points of total average loan balances with full year net charge offs at a historically low level of nine basis points of total average loan balances we believe that the company s reserves remain appropriate the company begins 2019 with credit quality in a very strong position but will continue to be diligent in its review of credit mr wehmer further commented our mortgage banking and wealth management businesses were both impacted by volatile markets in the fourth quarter mortgage banking revenue decreased 17 8 million the mortgage origination environment in the fourth quarter was challenging as normal seasonality was further pressured by declining demand leading to lower origination volumes and production margins origination volumes decreased to 927 8 million down from 1 2 billion in the third quarter home purchase activity continues to make up the bulk of our originations accounting for 71 of origination volumes in the fourth quarter for much of the fourth quarter mortgage rates increased however during the closing weeks of 2018 a sudden shift downward in rates contributed to the negative fair value adjustment on our mortgage servicing rights portfolio of 8 5 million related to changes in valuation assumptions and pay offs we continue to focus on efficiencies in our delivery channels and our operating costs in our mortgage banking area our wealth management businesses experienced headwinds in the fourth quarter due to declining equity prices despite these headwinds wealth management revenue was essentially flat to the third quarter of 2018 turning to the future mr wehmer stated as 2019 begins we expect our growth engines to continue their momentum we expect continued organic growth in all areas of our businesses total period end loans outstanding exceeded fourth quarter total average loans by 657 million providing momentum for net interest income into the first quarter of 2019 net interest margin is expected to improve in first quarter of 2019 fueled by the cdec acquisition and stabilizing retail deposit costs we will continue to take a steady and measured approach to achieving our main objectives of growing franchise value increasing profitability leveraging our expense infrastructure and continuing to increase shareholder value evaluating strategic acquisitions and organic branch growth will also be a part of our overall growth strategy with the continued goal of becoming chicago s bank and wisconsin s bank we believe our opportunities for both internal growth and external growth remain consistently strong the graphs below

gaap in the united states and prevailing practices in the banking industry however certain non gaap performance measures and ratios are used by management to evaluate and measure the company s performance these include taxable equivalent net interest income including its individual components taxable equivalent net interest margin including its individual components the taxable equivalent efficiency ratio tangible common equity ratio tangible common book value per share and return on average tangible common equity management believes that these measures and ratios provide users of the company s financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and of the company s operating efficiency other financial holding companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios differently management reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis in this non gaap presentation net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax exempt interest income on an equivalent before tax basis using tax rates effective as of the end of the period this measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax exempt sources net interest income on a fte basis is also used in the calculation of the company s efficiency ratio the efficiency ratio which is calculated by dividing non interest expense by total taxable equivalent net revenue less securities gains or losses measures how much it costs to produce one dollar of revenue securities gains or losses are excluded from this calculation to better match revenue from daily operations to operational expenses management considers the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share as useful measurements of the company s equity the company references the return on average tangible common equity as a measurement of profitability the following table presents a reconciliation of certain non gaap performance measures and ratios used by the company to evaluate and measure the

million increase from rising rates interest rate sensitivity as an ongoing part of its financial strategy the company attempts to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income management measures its exposure to changes in interest rates by modeling many different interest rate scenarios the following interest rate scenarios display the percentage change in net interest income over a one year time horizon assuming increases of 100 and 200 basis points and a decrease of 100 basis points the static shock scenario results incorporate actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for balance sheet instruments following an instantaneous parallel change in market rates based upon a static i e no growth or constant balance sheet conversely the ramp scenario results incorporate management s projections of future volume and pricing of each of the product lines following a gradual parallel change in market rates over twelve months actual results may differ from these simulated results due to timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies the interest rate sensitivity for both the static shock and ramp scenario at december 31 2018 september 30 2018 and december 31 2017 is as follows static shock scenario 200 basis points 100 basis points 100 basis points december

compared to the third quarter of 2018 resulted primarily from lower origination volumes lower revenue margins and a 8 5 million negative fair value adjustment recognized on mortgage servicing rights related to changes in valuation assumptions and pay offs mortgage loans originated or purchased for sale totaled 927 8 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to 1 2 billion in the third

2017 the net losses recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018 on investment securities are primarily due to 2 6 million of unrealized losses on equity securities held by the company including a large cap value mutual fund the increase in operating lease income in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2018 is primarily related to growth in business from the company s leasing divisions during the period the company has typically written call options with terms of less than three months against certain u s treasury and agency securities held in its portfolio for liquidity and other purposes management has entered into these transactions with the goal of economically hedging security positions and enhancing its overall return on its investment portfolio by using fees generated from these options to compensate for net interest margin compression these option transactions are designed to mitigate overall interest rate risk and do not qualify as hedges pursuant to accounting guidance there were no outstanding call option contracts at december 31 2018 september 30 2018 or december 31 2017 the decrease in boli income was primarily the result of higher income in the third quarter of 2018 due to death benefits received during that period on certain insurance policies and lower market returns during the fourth quarter of 2018 on certain investments supporting deferred compensation plan benefits the decrease in miscellaneous non interest income in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to the third quarter of 2018 is primarily due to negative adjustments from foreign currency remeasurement and losses from investments in partnerships non interest expense the following table presents non interest expense by category for the periods presented three

are as follows salaries and employee benefits expense decreased in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2018 primarily as a result of lower commissions related to mortgage loan originations higher salary deferrals related to loan origination costs and a reduction in costs related to deferred compensation plans impacted by market returns of related boli investments the increase in operating lease equipment depreciation in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2018 is primarily related to growth in business from the company s leasing divisions during the period the decrease in advertising and marketing expenses during the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2018 is primarily related to lower expenses for community advertisements and sponsorships marketing costs are incurred to promote the company s brand commercial banking capabilities the company s various products to attract loans and deposits and to announce new branch openings as well as the expansion of the company s non bank businesses the level of marketing expenditures depends on the timing of sponsorship programs and type of marketing programs utilized which are determined based on the market area targeted audience competition and various other factors income taxes the company recorded income tax expense of 28 0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 30 9 million in the third quarter of 2018 and 27 0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the effective tax rates were 26 01 in the fourth quarter of 2018 25 13 in the third

33 93 effective tax rate for the same period of 2017 the lower effective tax rate for the 2018 year to date period as compared to the same period of 2017 was primarily due to the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate effective in 2018 as a result of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act on december 22 2017 during the fourth quarter of 2017 the company recorded a provisional tax benefit of 7 6 million related to the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act and during the third quarter of 2018 the company finalized the provisional amounts and recorded an additional net tax benefit of 1 2 million the effective tax rates were also impacted by excess tax benefits related to share based compensation these excess tax benefits were 160 000 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 370 000 in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 1 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 excess tax benefits were 3 9 million and 6 2 million for the years ended 2018 and 2017 respectively excess tax benefits are expected to be higher in the first quarter when the majority of the company s share based awards vest and will fluctuate throughout the year based on the company s stock price and

as china s economy cooled in the fourth quarter under pressure from faltering domestic demand and bruising us tariffs its 2018 growth was dragged to the lowest in nearly three decades signs of weakness in china which has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years are fuelling anxiety about risks to the world economy and are weighing on profits for firms ranging from apple to big carmakers but there is an unexpected potential beneficiary of the slowdown a red hot economy business friendly policies and a communist party led by free traders that s the elevator pitch vietnamese prime minister nguyen xuan phuc is delivering to global investors amid the us china trade war we are ready to grab the opportunity mr phuc said in an interview with bloomberg tv s haslinda amin a few days before departing this week to the world economic forum in davos switzerland vietnam is quietly positioning itself as a safe haven for manufacturers wary of getting caught in the crossfire of the tariff war between the us and china with a raft of free trade agreements relatively cheap labour and close proximity to china mr phuc has a good story to tell global executives he ll meet in davos we are trying to increase exports in both quantity and quality of our products especially in which we have advantages such as seafood commodities footwear and electronics mr phuc said we aim to become an export economy that can grow fast and provide more jobs with higher income for our people ___________ read more ___________ nonetheless the south east asian nation is yet to see a flood of companies moving in from china he said and the economy has some serious challenges to overcome inadequate infrastructure and lack of skilled workers make it difficult to attract manufacturing beyond assembly line work such as garment stitching global economic conditions are also worsening the us china trade war and more subdued world growth is weighing on export demand a threat to an economy like vietnam where trade accounts for about twice the nation s gross domestic product more than any country in asia apart from singapore about a quarter of vietnam s total trade is with china vietnam s economy seems to be sheltered for now growth quickened to 7 1 per cent in 2018 among the fastest in the world mr phuc said he is confident growth will reach the higher end of the government s forecast range of 6 6 per cent to 6 8 per cent this year he also vowed to keep the vietnamese dong stable in 2019 we see growth momentum in different areas and have good foundations to achieve our goals mr phuc said vietnam which has completed about 16 free trade agreements began tethering itself to global trade after introducing market oriented doi moi reforms in the 1980s exports surged to a record 244 billion last year with us customers accounting for about 48bn of that more than double compared with five years ago several large manufacturers already operate in vietnam the biggest of which is samsung electronics which accounted for about a fifth of the country s exports last year mr phuc concerned about anti trade sentiments from the trump administration is vowing the country will step up imports from the us from boeing aircraft to products from oil companies the challenges this year will include global trade tensions climate change and insufficient infrastructure he said as a developing economy he added we have to keep growing to bring more jobs to our people and eliminate poverty we have to grow at more than 6 per cent annually to boost per capita income and to escape the middle income trap still mr phuc has a good story to sell to global investors vietnam was ranked no 1 among seven emerging asian countries as manufacturing destinations by natixis which looked at demographics wages and electricity costs rankings in doing business and logistics and manufacturing as a share of total foreign direct investment _________ read more _________ the government has been doing a lot to help foreign investors to grow businesses long term in vietnam mr phuc said meanwhile the outlook is much less rosy in china growth will remain under pressure said louis kuijs of oxford economics in a report key risks are the ongoing trade tension with the us and that credit growth does not recover exports held up through most of 2018 despite us president donald trump s tariff hikes on chinese imports in a fight over beijing s technology ambitions but they contracted in december as the penalties began to depress us demand economic growth in 2018 was the lowest since 1990 s 3 9 percent in the aftermath of the violent crackdown on pro democracy protests centred on beijing s tiananmen square growth in investment retail spending and factory activity all declined the national bureau of statistics reported the impact of us tariffs was limited but china faces pressure from growing global support for import controls volatile financial markets and declining investment spending said the bureau commissioner ning jizhe downward pressure on the economy is increasing said mr ning at a news conference still he added later the chinese economy s resilience and ability to resist shocks and the long term trend of stability will not change the slowdown is adding to pressure on president xi jinping s government to settle its costly dispute with washington the two sides have imposed tariff hikes of up to 25 per cent on tens of billions of dollars of each other s goods in the fight over us complaints beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology washington is pressing china to roll back plans for state led industry development that its trading partners say violate its market opening obligations that dispute has rattled chinese consumers that beijing is counting on to drive growth some are cutting spending which might worsen the downturn in a possible sign of progress beijing announced friday its top trade envoy vice premier liu he will visit washington for talks january 30 to 31 business groups and economists said a decision by mr liu and his american counterpart robert lighthizer to get directly involved would suggest earlier talks by lower level officials made progress mr trump said on saturday that trade relations with china were going very well and a deal could very well happen forecasters expect chinese growth to bottom out this year as beijing s stimulus efforts gain traction according to the associated press however they have pushed back the time frame for that due to weakening exports government led spending on public works construction is shaping up to be the engine for 2019 iris pang of ing said in a report however non infrastructure business activities will be dismal this year and debt will grow a meeting of leaders of the ruling communist party in december promised tax cuts better access to bank lending for entrepreneurs and other steps to help the private sector that generates china s new jobs and wealth chinese leaders warned earlier any recovery would be l shaped that means companies and investors shouldn t expect growth to rebound to the previous decade s double digit levels meanwhile mr trump cancelled the us delegation s trip to the global economic summit in davos citing the government shutdown which is now the longest on record
in the two weeks it s taken me to collect my thoughts on u s senator elizabeth warren s first swing through iowa three four more democrats launched presidential campaigns former housing and urban development secretary julian castro senator kirsten gillibrand senator kamala harris and representative tulsi gabbard more than a dozen people will seek the democratic nomination in 2020 and eight of them will have visited iowa this month alone tracking such a large field presents challenges bleeding heartland has already profiled some candidates and their pitches including u s representative john delaney and entrepreneur andrew yang i have posts in progress about most of the others my intention is to write at least one in depth piece about every serious contender for the benefit of caucus goers who want to research all options with such a strong field i expect the majority of iowa democrats to be late deciders this cycle myself included i ve transcribed below extensive portions of warren s stump speech and q a in des moines and ankeny and also enclosed audio clips for those who would rather listen than read first a few of my takeaways warren has a coherent case for her candidacy the prospective democratic candidates agree on most policy issues so they all must be able to explain why they are running and what unique perspective they would bring to the table warren s organizing principle is simple washington is corrupt and we need major structural changes to fix the problem her speech in des moines connected her personal history and family narrative to this theme answering audience questions she explained why piecemeal approaches to ban specific abuses of power are not effective there are a lot of different ways that big banks can cheat people and repeatedly brought the conversation back to the same theme whatever issues bring you here today warren told the crowd in ankeny relate to the central problem of corruption in washington that s why the government doesn t enact policies the vast majority of americans support she could appeal to disparate factions of the democratic base unlike most of of the potential contenders warren didn t visit iowa last year technically the senator is still in the exploratory committee phase but given the staff she has hired here and how she interacted with audiences she is clearly serious about competing in the 2020 democratic caucuses in such a fractured field no one is likely to run away with the caucuses but warren has potential to build a broad coalition lots of acquaintances who caucused for senator bernie sanders are open to supporting warren and some are already leaning her way her pitch echoes themes sanders highlighted during the last campaign the system is rigged against working people i also saw and spoke with many women and men who had caucused for hillary clinton at the warren events the crowds in des moines and ankeny included a mix of older and younger activists many commentators noted warren s unusual itinerary taking her to conservative areas candidates typically go first to eastern iowa metros where most of the state s democrats live in ankeny one reporter asked warren why she started in western iowa council bluffs sioux city and storm lake she replied well gotta start somewhere and this is a great part of the state and it gave me a real opportunity not only to be in cities but also in small towns and rural areas i think we ve got to reach out and talk to everybody storm lake times editor art cullen wrote in a commentary for the washington post if democrats are going to build a grass roots movement they have to go where the people are all the people not just some warren told me saturday i grew up in oklahoma your main drag looks like mine in wetumka the core values we shared are the core values that americans believe in they want their kids to have a fighting chance to build a future here warren gave people a sense of a personal connection even at large events iowans love being able to see presidential candidates up close in living rooms and coffee shops it can be hard for those who draw big crowds to give people that kind of experience hundreds came out for each of warren s stops in des moines warren promised the audience of around 500 people and the overflow crowd that if they stuck around she would take pictures with every person who wanted one presidential candidates routinely pose for selfies with caucus goers senator cory booker s staff even sent many iowans autographed copies of those pictures after his trip here in october but it can get chaotic when masses of people are trying to get close enough for a photo i was skeptical when i saw well over a hundred people standing in line i figured after ten or fifteen minutes staff would say they were so sorry but the senator needed to leave this was at the end of a long day when warren was battling a cold wrong about 50 minutes after the senator wrapped up her stump speech the last few people waiting were getting their pictures taken with her then the senator spent about another fifteen or twenty minutes in a back area autographing books and photographs staff had collected earlier in the evening the democrats i spoke with were excited to show off their memorabilia she isn t afraid of unscripted moments warren took questions from the public at every venue and even from the overflow crowd who couldn t get into the packed building in des moines she took at least a few questions from the media after most of her iowa stops as well that s risky because it is easy to make news with an awkward comment about an unexpected topic distracting from the intended message of the day in fact the first person called on in sioux city brought up warren s controversial decision to release results from a dna test proving she had some native american ancestry the des moines register published her full response the second half of warren s des moines event consisted of q a for about 25 minutes followed by the last portion of her speech the questioners were not pre screened rather numbered tickets were drawn out of a bucket to determine who would get a turn warren explained that they use this system to give everyone an equal chance to be heard not just the people who rush to the microphone first the following day in ankeny they did random drawings again she is funny republican operatives and dark money groups have tried to depict warren as an elitist harvard professor she came across as nothing like that caricature it s not just a matter of having a speechwriter insert a few clever lines into her script at several points during the q a she had the audience laughing for instance responding to a question about the separation of church and state warren assured listeners look i was a great sunday school teacher all i can say is no one was injured it was a very low bar all in all warren had a successful rollout in iowa while few caucus goers are ready to commit to any candidate at this stage i haven t spoken to anyone who ruled out warren after seeing her in person any comments related to the iowa caucus campaign are welcome in this thread audio of senator elizabeth warren s speech in des moines on january 5 2019 my transcript so the bad news is i ve caught a cold the good news is nevertheless i persist i want to start just by saying these are dangerous times for our country and the direction we go will in part be set right here in iowa i am grateful to all of you who take this seriously who are in this fight all the way and who are going to help us make a better country so thank you warren said she d tell the crowd a little about herself take some questions and then take pictures she grew up in oklahoma my daddy sold stuff he sold carpeting he sold paint he sold housewares her three older brothers all served in the military and carry their veterans cards today proudly i was what used to be known as the late in life baby my mama always called me the surprise i was about 30 before it hit me what that meant so for a long time it was just my mama and my daddy and me and when i was in middle school daddy had a heart attack and my mama and i thought that he was going to die he didn t but he was in the hospital for a while and then he came home and he couldn t work and so the bills piled up we lost our family station wagon and at night my mama would tuck me into bed and i d hear them talk and learned words like mortgage and foreclosure heavy words for a kid one day i walked into my folks bedroom and laid out on the bed was the dress now some of you know the dress it s the one that only comes out for weddings funerals and graduations and my mother had it laid out and she was pacing pacing back and forth she was in her stocking feet and she was crying and she was saying we will not lose this house we will not lose this house we will not lose this house she was 50 years old she had never worked outside the home and she was terrified and so finally she pulled that dress on she put on her high heels blew her nose and she walked to the sears and got a minimum wage job and that minimum wage job saved our house and it saved our family and if you want to know who i am there it is that s the story written on my heart and for a long time i thought that story was a story just about my mother a story about how she dug deep and when she had to she dug deeper and then i started to understand years later it s the story of millions of families across this country people who do what needs to be done to take care of those they love and then years after that i came to understand it s also a story about government because when i was a kid a minimum wage job would support a family of three yeah it would cover a mortgage it would cover utilities and it would still get basic food on the table today a minimum wage job in america full time will not keep a mama and a baby out of poverty that is wrong warren mentioned that she wanted to be a schoolteacher but her family couldn t afford college she got a scholarship then dropped out to get married smart she joked later she got her degree at a commuter college that cost 50 per semester she had children went to a state law school and ended up working as a professor yeah that was pretty amazing but the one thing i can tell you about all of my growing up professional life it that it is centered around one fundamental question what s happening to working families in this country why is it getting harder and harder for young people to be able to build some security why is the path getting rockier and particularly rockier for people of color why is that happening so let me just lay it out a little bit it s washington and think about it with the story i started out with back when i was a little girl the folks in washington i checked this they thought about the minimum wage in terms of what does it take a family of three to survive and that s where they thought the minimum wage should be set because it should be an opportunity a gateway a chance to get in today the folks in washington who are in charge think the way to set a minimum wage is to maximize the profits of a multinational corporation they work for the rich and the powerful not for the rest of us and it s not just there it s throughout the system washington works great for giant drug companies not for people who are trying to fill a prescription washington works great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere but not for people who are worried that this planet is going to burn up washington works great for giant financial institutions but not for people whose social security numbers get stolen this is one step after another washington works for the rich and the powerful and leaves everyone else behind this is corruption it is corruption and it is eating away at our democracy and the very fiber of our lives wages for the average family have hardly budged for an entire generation warren noted but the cost of housing education child care and health care have all gone up families are getting squeezed because washington s working for the rich let me give you another one home ownership number one way in america for middle class families to build wealth it s generation after generation it s how it works today in america african american home ownership rates are the same as they were when housing discrimination was legal think about that yeah and student loans like i said i got a four year diploma at a cost that i could pay for on a part time waitressing job today young people in this country are getting crushed by a trillion and a half dollars in student loan debt we have got to turn this around understand the impact of this corruption whatever issue brought you here tonight i guarantee it intersects through a washington that s working for the rich and the powerful look guns gun safety it goes through washington we can t do basic things that most of us agree on why because we ve got the nra calling the shots in washington climate an existential threat to all of us but the oil companies the coal companies keep calling the shots in washington we have to fight back we could talk about a lot of these pieces but i want to put on the table an idea and that is we need change but not just one statute here or one law over there that s not going to get the job done we need big structural change we ve got to go big on this so let me give you some ideas and some examples and then we ll get to some questions warren said we need to change the rules in washington it s about money in politics it s about the influence of money i have the biggest anti corruption proposal since watergate block the revolving door between wall street and washington everyone who runs for federal office must post their tax returns online the u s supreme court s citizens united decision changed the rules in washington on money in politics and we need to change them next structural change for the economy we ve got a problem where the big corporations the billionaires they re calling the shots we need to strengthen our unions and we need to attack head on the rising costs that are crippling middle class families health care is a basic human right a chance to get an education without getting crushed by student loan debt child care how about we join the rest of the developed economies and help pay for child care and strengthen social security and protect our pensions in addition to changing the rules in washington and for the economy we need to change the rules in our politics which means we need to protect democracy i want to see a constitutional amendment so that every american citizen has a right to vote and that vote will be counted we ve got to get money out of politics overturn citizens united warren said she never thought in a million years that she would run for office but here s the deal my daddy ended up as a janitor and i got a chance to become a public school teacher a college professor and a united states senator because america invested in an opportunity for me i am determined that we will be a country that invests in opportunity for every one of our children next warren turned to how we make change she s in iowa trying to build grassroots because i don t believe that democracy should be for sale to billionaires and corporations she doesn t take money from corporate pacs shoot i don t take pac money of any kind or from federal lobbyists this is about rebuilding what we do together this is about rebuilding our democracy person by person by person across iowa and across our country she wrapped up the stump speech with a call to action so i m going to do this grassroots i hope everybody in here will sign up will be part of this elizabethwarren dot com go there volunteer be part of this get a sign bumper sticker offer to make a few hone calls pitch in five bucks but make an investment in democracy because this is our chance this is our chance we together can dream big and fight hard and that s how we ll make change warren took questions for about 25 minutes after speaking then delivered the last few minutes of her speech here s the audio from that portion of the event the first question was about the separation of church state warren joked that criticized the supreme court s hobby lobby decision which held that a corporation doesn t have to provide a full range of health care options for women because of the company s supposed religious views how do you debate someone who isn t interested in civility or facts did you have someone specific in mind here s how i see this we have a chance now over the next year and three quarters to get out there and talk about something we haven t talked about nearly enough and that is what we re fighting for she thinks people will come together around that warren s three brothers still live in oklahoma only one of them is a democrat but she loves them all and she talks to them all we ve got to stay focused on what matters to us and what matters to us is that everybody gets a fighting chance to build something what matters to us is that people get a chance to education without getting crushed by student loan debt what matters to us is that people get access to health care that they can afford and it s real and it s there in rural hospitals in communities all across this country when we talk about corruption everyone gets it democrats republicans and independents they know our government is broken working for those who have already made it big but not for their families next question democrats need to run as the party of the people how can we talk about not just building up the middle class but also the working class who are trying to become middle class the central part is talking about opportunity warren said this isn t focus grouped this has been the fight of my lifetime to make sure the chances i got are there for other people she sees that young people people of color immigrants lgbtq people native american community we re fighting for a level playing field and we ve got to call corruption out next questioner drove three hours from kansas to see warren her question was about housing warren explained that new housing construction in the u s has moved to the high end but there hasn t been much new housing built for middle class or the poor the consequence is that housing is deteriorating and the the price is going up she has a plan to build 3 2 million new housing units producing about a million and a half jobs and bringing down rents by about 10 percent according to a moody s estimate but that s not all buying a home has been a way for families to build wealth for generations warren said it s worked that way for generations for white families but not for people of color redlining was official government policy until the mid 1960s blocking african americans from the benefits of home ownership that has had a lasting impact on african american neighborhoods her housing bill would take a step toward rectifying the wrongs of the past it would also require the federal government to fully fund our housing obligations on native american reservations now let s talk about democracy for a minute warren acknowledged her housing plan would be expensive how are you going to pay for it we could cover 3 2 million new housing units just by going back to the estate tax rates that were in effect during president george w bush s administration her bill would help seniors people with disabilities rural areas the 10 000 richest families in america would pay for it people in washington tell her you can never do that because 10 000 rich families have so much more power in washington than millions of americans so what i say to them you just wait until 2020 next question is about democracy at a party level how can we have a more fair transparent primary process i m not going to relitigate 2016 warren said but as democrats we have a chance to strengthen democracy during our 2020 contest all the democrats should link arms and say our primary is not for sale to billionaires they should renounce support from super pacs and billionaires should not be able to self finance it ought to be about building a movement person by person by person this is how we will build democracy this is how we restore confidence in the democratic party we are the party of the people but we ve got to walk the walk staff said the next question would be the last it was about offshoring and how we get corporations to keep their operations in the u s warren noted that the republican tax bill approved in late 2017 gave away a trillion and a half dollars to corporations much of it to multi national corporations we just gave away money to companies where 40 percent of the shareholders aren t even in the united states we did it because washington is corrupt because money talks this is why we need to talk about systemic change structural change we ve got to start with an anti corruption bill as for the tax code warren prepared the audience for a really shocking principle everyone should pay their fair share she also said that until the early 1980s corporate behavior often felt a responsibility to shareholders employees customers and their communities it used to be the case that as corporations got richer everybody participated that the workers got richer too everybody got a bigger slice of pie since the late 1980s corporate behavior has been focused only on shareholder wealth she has a proposal for accountable capitalism which would require large corporations to have a charter that would make them respond not just to their shareholders but others employees should be able to elect say 40 percent of the corporate board last question was about the national debt and federal budget we need to make our dollars our budgets work for our people she agrees that the national debt is a drag on young people it s obscene that we went to war seventeen years ago and put it on a credit card gave away a trillion and a half dollars to the wealthy the way to fix it is to rewrite the tax laws and make investments in the economy education infrastructure would she roll back the tax cut for the billionaires and the big corporations you bet warren closed by thanking the crowd and giving them a reason to be optimistic this is about dreaming big and it s about fighting hard it s about making structural change not a nibble here and a piece there and a lot of people say that s just too hard you just can t do that it is just too hard so let me just say to all of you people told me after the financial crash we could never get a consumer agency that crash was caused one lousy mortgage at a time one giant bank that cheated one family another family another family targeted communities of color targeted young people targeted seniors and crushed them but people said to me the banks have all the money and they will prevail they spent more than a million dollars a day for more than a year lobbying against financial reforms and particularly that consumer agency but here s the deal we had nothing on our side we didn t have money we didn t have big groups on our side but we got organized we fought back and the consumer financial protection bureau is the law today warren also recalled many people telling her in 2011 and 2012 that massachusetts would not elect a woman to the u s senate we got organized we fought back i am now the senior senator representing the commonwealth one more example wells fargo bank cheated millions of customers and decided to deal with it by firing a bunch of people who make 15 an hour people told her she d never be able to get personal accountability from executives of a big company but they got in the fight and pushed back and now the wells fargo ceo is gone it s hard but damn a lot of things are hard if they weren t hard somebody else would have already done it but we are americans and we have a history of coming together to fight the hard fights the abolitionists they didn t say this is too hard the suffragettes they didn t say this is too hard america s labor movement they didn t say this is too hard america s civil rights movement yes these folks were told it s too hard give up before you start but they organized they persisted and they changed america i am here tonight because i believe i believe in what we can do i believe that this right now is our moment our moment to dream big to fight hard and to take back this country warren s january 6 event in ankeny was a panel discussion featuring democratic women who ran for office in 2018 state senator elect claire celsi representatives elect karin derry jennifer konfrst heather matson and kristin sunde secretary of state candidate deidre dejear and state senate candidate amber gustafson i ve transcribed some of her remarks introducing herself to the crowd warren apologized for her croaky voice i am probably the most unlikely senator you will find and certainly unlikely to do something here in iowa i grew up in a paycheck to paycheck family in oklahoma she shared how she was the baby of the family her three brothers joined the military she got a scholarship for college but dropped out after falling in love my life was pretty bumpy but she eventually got her degree at a commuter college and decided to go to law school despite having young children i never thought that i was going to end up in elected office as a college professor all of her life circled around one central issue what s happening to america s working class why are we getting richer as a country but having most of the benefits go to the top rather than to most people when the big crash happened in 2008 she got a call from u s senate majority leader harry reid inviting her to washington to help craft the bank bailout she got into the fight to get a consumer protection agency through congress and president barack obama asked her to help set it up she joked do you remember pre approved credit cards remember those i am i think america s first pre rejected nominee republicans said they would never allow her to be confirmed so she went back to massachusetts planning to go back to teaching some encouraged her to run for the senate against scott brown who at the time had a 65 percent approval rating others warned her that massachusetts would never elect a woman to the senate brown had defeated a woman in the special election to replace senator ted kennedy and many people felt we already tried that warren said she didn t know what campaigning for office would be like before she ran the most astonishing part was how many women just came off the benches out of the woodwork to help her win she went from 35 points behind to beating the incumbent by 7 points moderator jodie butler asked the panelists what surprised them the most about the 2018 election warren responded it was the women i knew it was there but i didn t know how big it was it was the women who came off the sidelines and ran which is dang tough but let s face it no one would have won if it hadn t been for all the other women who had never been involved in politics or never at that level and who said i am part of this i will make my voice heard in washington i will make my voice heard at the statehouse i will make my voice heard at the county level it was i believe it was a transformative moment in america warren dated the movement to the women s march the world s largest ever protest rally that occurred in hundreds of communities the day after president donald trump s inauguration in january 2017 it was democracy reinventing itself she threw some shade at pundits who were so smart and questioned whether the women who turned out for the march would stay involved they did and they brought their friends relatives and neighbors to be heard this is an extraordinary moment in american history it is a moment when our country faces great danger but it is also a moment when democracy itself is rebuilding is strengthening and is becoming the kind of representative government we need in the 21st century questioners were also drawn at random in ankeny one of them was about climate change warren said america has always played a leadership role but the problem is now we re leading in the wrong direction we need to rejoin the paris climate accord but that s just the first step we need major changes in federal and state laws and all of us need to change our behavior so we need people who understand government should not be working for giant oil companies and coal companies but think government should be working for you if we do that we can save this earth next question was about the state of discourse in the country trump is setting a bad example and the voter was concerned about how we talk to one another how do we confront the people who are going low warren returned to a point she had mentioned at other stops only one of her brothers is a democrat but she loves them all and talks to them all it s important to think about what government is it should reflect our values she tries to talk to her brothers about core beliefs like kids should get an education we should have a level playing field the country shouldn t just work for giant companies this is a whole lot less about punching every day and a whole lot more about building every day about getting out and talking about what we believe that we can do together i think this is a moment in america when we can think big when we can fight hard and when we can make real change in this country and that s the story we need to get out there and tell another questioner asked what can be done to support people with low incomes or fixed incomes warren returned to the 2008 financial crisis there are a lot of different ways that big banks can cheat people believe me because i ve seen a lot of them there are a whole bunch of those when the crash came in 2008 just remember what caused it it happened one lousy mortgage at a time one tricky mortgage one mortgage somebody signed off on and didn t realize the payments would double 24 months later and that they would lose their home an entire financial services industry these big banks would make billions of dollars off the backs of just hard working folks around this country so when the time came to think about what are we going to do about the laws everybody had a thing they wanted to change how interest rates are calculated on mortgages what kind of disclosures you give the paperwork on credit cards payday loans a lot of different pieces the problem is you pass those laws it s hard to get those laws passed takes a lot of energy but you pass them and then they re like fenceposts on the prairie the financial services industry just runs around them you know like payday loans we ll call them mayday loands so how do you get real change you get real change through structural change and for me that was the consumer financial protection bureau you give it a permanent home you put a cop on the beat and when the financial services industry figures out another way to cheat people you ve got somebody there to be able to respond it s about structural change in this economy and i think it s structural change that we need to think about as we roll into 2020 whatever issues bring you here today whether it s the environment whether it s guns whether it s the problems of student loans of middle class families protecting our pensions lots of different places there are two things to pay attention to the first one is we are not a deeply divided country on most of that on most core economic issues we pretty much believe two thirds three quarters of us want to see kids get some relief from student loan debt want to see social security readjusted so it s secure forever into the future and pays a little better for people who depend on it want to see affordable health care and health care where you can t cut people out with pre existing conditions want to see prescription drugs that people can actually afford these are things we all not all but a huge proportion of us agree on but there s a second part to it you have to ask yourself why didn t it happen why hasn t it we live in a democracy there are a whole lot more people trying to fill a prescription than there are ceos of big drug companies so why are the big drug companies getting their way in washington why has there not been any change in the laws and the answer is corruption pure and simple we have a government that works for those at the top we have a government that works for those who can afford an army of lobbyists an army of lawyers an army of bought and paid for experts and we don t have a government that s working for the people and we have a chance to change that as we roll into 2020 it s why i am so deeply optimistic when i come into a room like this for a long long time the other side had had plenty of money to spend but there s a whole lot more of us than there are of them and when we push back i m sitting with women who ran and lost and picked themselves up and ran again we are americans we have gotten in these fights and won before top image elizabeth warren speaking in storm lake iowa on january 5 photo posted on the twitter feed for the senator s campaign
global economy to see steady growth of three per cent global economy to see steady growth of three per cent in 2019 despite risks says un 21 january 2019 the global economy grew at a steady 3 1 per cent last year and similar levels of growth are expected in 2019 but these headline figures mask growth that is uneven and often failing to reach where it is most needed the un s chief economist warned on monday we still have relatively strong growth but we do see rising risks on the horizon and an increasing likelihood that some of these risks might actually materialize said elliott harris united nations chief economist in comments coinciding with the launch of the world economic situation and prospects 2019 wesp report among these looming dangers accelerating trade tensions are already having an impact on global trade and employment mr harris told un news in addition rising national debt is also crippling many countries ability to provide basic services but this and other risks such as those from climate change and waning support for international cooperation could be avoided or minimized if countries worked together to do so the un s top economist insisted with mounting pressures in the areas of international trade international development finance and tackling climate change the report underscores that strengthening global cooperation is central to advancing sustainable development advertisement scroll to continue reading yet these threats come at a time when international cooperation and governance are more important than ever many of the challenges laid out in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development are global by nature and require collective and cooperative action waning support for multilateralism also raises questions around the capacity for collaborative policy action in the event of a widespread global shock un report spotlights uneven progress according to the wesp report published by the un department of economic and social affairs more than half the world s economies saw growth accelerate in 2017 and 2018 developed economies grew at 2 2 per cent in both years while unemployment rates dropped among developing economies east asia and south asia saw the strongest gains in 2018 at 5 8 per cent and 5 6 per cent respectively while commodity exporting countries continued their gradual recovery this improvement was particularly true for fuel rich emerging nations despite high debt levels caused by a fall in commodity prices in 2014 15 although the overall picture among developing economies is largely positive many are nonetheless experiencing uneven progress the un report cautioned amid falling individual per capita wealth in several nations further declines or weak per capita growth are anticipated in 2019 in central southern and west africa western asia and latin america and the caribbean homes to nearly a quarter of the global population living in extreme poverty it noted and even where growth is strong it is often driven by core industrial and urban regions the wesp 2019 report continued such that rural areas are being left behind to overcome this and for poverty to be eradicated by 2030 the un report suggests that there will need to be both double digit growth in africa along with steep reductions in unequal pay levels us china trade tensions on the issue of trade tensions it noted that these had led to a fall in global trade levels in 2018 from 5 3 per cent in 2017 to 3 8 per cent and as a result of the united states china uncertainty the expectation is that trade volumes in 2019 will be lower still mr harris suggested government subsidies have to some extent softened the impact of the tariff hikes in the us and china whose growth is expected to decrease from 6 6 per cent in 2018 to 6 3 per cent this year but the risk is that developing economies may suffer the fallout too unless the dispute is settled if the trade dispute becomes more widespread we will likely to see disruptions of global value change mr harris explained bear in mind that the participation of global trade has been one of the ways that developing countries have participated in the rising global prosperity and have accelerated their own developments so anything that disrupts that of course will have a negative impact on their abilities to increase their levels of prosperity and to develop sustainably this cautionary assessment is telling because the us in 2018 contributed more to global trade than japan or the european union according to un economists at unctad the un conference on trade and development which contributed to the wesp 2019 report rising interest rates in the us or a strengthening of the dollar could also make matters worse for fragile emerging economies the wesp report noted adding that many low income countries have already seen a substantial rise in interest repayments on their debt these include lebanon and sri lanka where over 40 per cent of government revenue is spent servicing its debt as well as pakistan and jamaica where around a quarter of their budget is used to pay interest on national debt representing a major constraint on public services slow steady growth in eu but brexit looms on the european union s prospects the wesp report estimates growth of two per cent for the next two years with much stronger performances potentially from states who became members since 2004 the pack is led by poland which saw its economy grow by five per cent in 2018 the bloc s biggest economy germany is set to see more moderate growth however at 1 8 per cent amid potential disruption to the domestic car industry from new technologies new competitors and significant legal and financial consequences from past sales practices related to the diesel technology france is also set to see lower than average growth 1 8 per cent linked to its weaker export outlook while the uk 1 4 per cent is projected to pay for trade uncertainty linked to its plans to exit the eu or brexit with companies moving assets or diverting investment from the uk to the eu wesp 2019 notes the brexit fallout may also be felt outside the eu the un report warns with a possible 10 15 per cent decline in funding available to eu accession countries commonwealth states central europe slso see modest growth in most commonwealth of independent states cis which includes russia most saw accelerating growth and slowing inflation last year amid supportive commodity prices despite this overall growth is forecast to slow modestly this year to two per cent and 2 5 per cent in 2020 wesp 2019 suggests amid concerns that strong expansion in smaller economies may be unsustainable while lower public spending is expected in others focusing on russia the un report notes that lifting the value added tax vat rate may encourage inflation and curb household spending while ongoing sanctions could deter investment from abroad other large commodity exporting countries such as brazil and nigeria should see a moderate pickup in growth in 2019 2020 albeit from a low base noting robust growth in central asia s tajikistan thanks to increased aluminium and gold exports wesp 2019 also suggests a much more positive future for the whole region once china s belt and road initiative becomes operational frequently hailed as a 21st century version of the ancient silk road trade route the region should benefit from upgrades to countries railway road and energy infrastructure improved connections with china and europe and better market access the report explains elsewhere south eastern europe saw faster growth in 2018 and its overall gross domestic product gdp is expected to expand by 3 7 per cent in 2019 and 2020 serbia the region s largest economy benefited from double digit growth in investment amid strong performances in farming and construction while albania also saw solid economic performance wesp 2019 noted before cautioning that longer term improvements risk being constrained unless there are improvements in industrial infrastructure and dependence on foreign financing ends scoop media

led consumers to limit their spending on high priced items and save more for necessities like healthcare education and housing he said that s a drain on the world economy because global manufacturers of cars cellphones and luxury goods have relied on china for a big chunk of their sales in recent years in cyclical terms china s enjoying a chinese style recession kennedy said the official growth numbers are still around 6 or so but all of the measures that one would typically look at to see economic activity whether you re talking about manufacturing or consumer activity all are flat or down chinese economic statistics are widely mistrusted making it difficult to determine just how bad things are last month a former chief economist at the agricultural bank of china gave a speech citing an internal report by a major institution analyzing chinese growth that applied two measures one found growth was 1 67 the other that it was negative xiang songzuo of renmin university did not name the institution video of his speech was immediately censored as china s economy gets the chills some california firms catch a cold experts say china s troubles stem from government efforts from mid 2017 to control the shadow banking sector with its risky poorly regulated lenders and to clean up a mountain of debt much of it accrued by local government the debt binge came with china s massive stimulus after the global financial crisis the resulting tightening of credit led to the economic slowdown analysts say the depth of the slowdown appeared to take beijing by surprise kennedy said chinese stock indexes in shanghai and shenzhen lost almost a quarter of their value in 2018 the nation is aiming to convert to a high tech high wage economy to do that it is relying on its made in china 2025 campaign with government support for state owned enterprises to drive advances in robotics artificial intelligence aerospace it green energy and other fields but critics say the enterprises and banks owned by the state are wasteful and inefficient the chinese government has launched a major stimulus to try to revive the confidence of consumers and private companies including tax cuts successive cuts to the ratio of funds banks must maintain demands that banks lend more to private companies 135 billion for railways and airports and steps to speed up other infrastructure one province is even considering adding half a day to weekends to allow people more shopping time the moves announced so far would inject more than 600 billion into the economy according to kennedy but will it be enough in order for china to counter negative consumer and investor sentiment it needs growth now said alicia garcia herrero chief economist for the asia pacific region at french investment bank natixis commuters ride a bus in beijing s central business district this month andy wong associated press she said the stimulus measures taken last year had been blunted by the slowing effect of the drive to get local government debt under control and the clampdown on shadow banking another factor was the government s massive anti corruption drive which left some state officials wary about major investments garcia herrero said so the public part of the infrastructure driven investment driven stimulus has not proven as effective as it might have she said yu yongding economic analyst with the chinese academy of social sciences said a slowdown was inevitable after decades of growth but argued that the nation s financial stability would be at risk if the government didn t boost the economy in an article published this month by the independent economic and financial news agency caixin yu urged the government to take stronger measures even if it meant weakening the currency or increasing the budget deficit he said the slowdown came amid foreign and domestic doubts about china s ability to undertake economic reform some even anticipate a financial crisis caused by a bursting housing bubble or large scale debt defaults by local governments and corporations the trade war with the united states only deepens such worries kennedy said the measures rolled out so far paled in comparison with the massive stimulus china launched after the global financial crisis and he predicted more steps to boost the economy in coming months they certainly have room to do a lot more if they need to he said adding that it would take time for efforts to translate into economic activity chinese officials have promised a goldilocks approach not too much not too little but just the right amount of stimulus to try to get chinese consumers to buy big ticket items and put the economy on track without adding too much to debt xiang the economist said china had built an economy based on credit and speculation and he called for an end to the country s obsession with maintaining high levels of growth he said local government debt fueled by past stimulus packages was a major problem with uncertainty as to how high the real figure was and how much would ever be paid back kennedy said china s ability to avoid a debt crisis depended on whether the government was willing to embrace further liberal market reforms private companies are already pretty efficient users of capital but state owned enterprises are not and chinese state owned banks are very wasteful he said arguing that china must make structural changes to the economy china still has a lot of low hanging fruit to make this economy more efficient but that requires politically difficult choices by the leadership that they haven t wanted to adopt so far it s going to require them to make some structural changes in the economy actually the type of things the united states and others have been calling on china to do if they don t if they continue down the path which they are still on then eventually they will run into problems kennedy said referring to the nation s debt there s only so far down the road you can kick this can the can is getting bigger and they re running out of road robyn dixon latimes com twitter robyndixon_lat

zimbabwe should dump its discredited bond notes and real time gross settlement rtgs system and re introduce the united states dollar as a way of solving the country s fragile currency situation and reduce inflation economist steve hanke has said the southern african country introduced the surrogate currency which government pegged at 1 1 with the united states dollar in november 2016 as an export incentive to ease an acute cash crisis however the bond notes guaranteed by the afreximbank have lost value to the greenback and are trading at 1 4 5 on the parallel market this has seen official inflation peaking at 42 percent in december 2018 after prices of basic goods and services skyrocketed in october last year when government introduced a two percent tax hanke who rose to fame when he correctly predicted zimbabwe s hyperinflationary period in 2008 said there was need for the government to instil confidence in the economy by extinguishing the controversial currency the government must announce that it will not rob the holders of bond notes and rtgss they were issued at par to the united states dollar and they will be redeemed at par by the issuer the zimbabwean government the redemption at par will take place over a five year period during this period the government will redeem the bond notes and rtgss by accepting them as payment for taxes or any other obligations he said the john hopkins university lecturer indicated that if credible the redemption policy announcement will cause the value of the bond notes and rtgss to climb towards par creating much needed liquidity as well as solvency in zimbabwe s financial system zimbabwe s monetary death spiral will come to an abrupt stop to run down the stock of new zim dollars to 2016 levels 1 billion per year should be redeemed over five years then the patient will be deemed to be in remission and a clean bill of monetary health can be issued he said zimbabwe abandoned its own currency in 2009 after hyperinflation reached 500 billion percent according to the international monetary fund the united states dollar has dominated daily transactions since then but due to widespread shortages of dollars most people must now use a government issued surrogate currency called bond notes which are supposed to be equal to a united states dollar as well as electronic money both are quickly devaluing against the dollar on the black market some businesses such as pharmacies are now only accepting united states dollars in cash in the fuel sector where the government controls prices fuel companies are forced to accept bond notes and electronic money for petrol and diesel at the official exchange rate the government then provides the firms with dollars to import the products but the government has not allocated firms adequate funds to import sufficient fuel for the country leading to the shortages dailynews

the back of the u s dollar says in god we trust however for an increasing number of investors in 2019 the motto increasingly is in gold we trust as the precious metal could turn into a new bull market this year a renewed interest in gold is being driven by a confluence of factors that include the current political stand off in washington and the longest government shutdown in u s history combined with a late stage economic cycle rising global debt levels and an escalating u s china trade war bullion prices are emerging from an 8 year bear market gold prices peaked at an all time high of 1 921 an ounce when the u s federal reserve was concluding its bond buying program known as quantitive easing or qe2 in september 2011 and by the end of 2015 the metal had declined to a low of 1 046 at around the same time as the janet yellen led fed increased its key interest rate the federal funds rate for the first time in seven years conventional wisdom says that gold is the anti dollar that is whenever the greenback is strong gold is weak and vice versa gold prices react inversely to u s dollar real yields but gold is not about inflation on its own and it s not about interest rates on its own but it s about the relationship between the two gold prices had been range bound for the last 3 years but now signs are emerging that it may have reached a bottom and ready to climb again the fed is raising u s interest rates and scaling back asset purchases to normalize the central bank s balance sheet while at the same time wage pressure and a tight labor market could lead to rising inflation expectations today investors are increasingly viewing gold as safe money at a time when current fed chairman jerome powell publicly opined that he is very concerned about u s debt levels and the trump administration has started a trade war with one of its largest creditors namely china the only winner in a trade war might be inflation gold is an economic constant it will never become worthless nor will it decline due to inflation over time like a fiat currency gold carries no risk of default nor can it go bankrupt so when stocks fall gold tends to hold its ground or go up it s great portfolio insurance clouds that are gathering on the global economy may be parting for gold concerns over global economic growth are rising as stock markets gyrate and u s china trade tensions persist calling into question the fed s path on u s interest rates many economists are trimming the number of u s rate hikes expected for the year 2019 from three down to two as recessionary concerns build the u s yield curve has flattened and equities remain under pressure gold may find support and move into a new multi year bull market as investors become more defensive in their portfolios and asset allocations j p john pierpont morgan opined that gold is money everything else is credit and central banks understand that very well private banks and commercial bank economists might not understand this finer nuance well enough especially during the qe reflation of asset prices period between 2011 and the end of 2017 by the end of 2017 global qe quantitative easing was running at a 2 12 trillion annual run rate according to bloomberg data think about this amount of money as the equivalent of bailing out aig every single month and then some but by october 2018 the european central bank had been tapering its qe program the asset purchases were down to 15 billion euros per month and by the end of this year s first quarter the ecb is expected to stop expanding the size of its balance sheet and globally we will for the first time once again go net negative on liquidity bloomberg data shows that over 95 of asset classes worldwide had negative returns for 2018 as liquidity and markets moved from qe to qt quantitative tightening gold had underperformed during the qe years but might outperform during the qt regime

a surprising rally for china s yuan over the turn of the year has been cut short by widespread expectations that beijing will ramp up policy easing in coming months to avert a sharper economic slowdown the yuan has retreated to the weaker side of 6 8 per dollar this week but is still up nearly 3 percent since early december on hopes that washington and beijing may be inching toward a trade deal gains in a currency that was one of asia s weakest in 2018 were also fuelled by expectations that beijing does not want to see the currency drop too much in case it becomes a sticking point in negotiations with the trump administration but analysts say mere optimism over trade talks cannot take it any higher unless it s driven by a dramatic decline in the dollar caution over trade and the extent of further chinese easing are likely to cap the yuan s gains trade negotiators are facing an early march deadline and washington has threatened to sharply hike tariffs on chinese goods if there are no substantial signs of compromise from beijing if we look back the three factors driving renminbi depreciation including dollar appreciation the trade war and interest rate differentials last year only dollar appreciation has turned said tommy xie an economist at ocbc bank in singapore uncertainties over trade china s slowdown and policy easing would cause the yuan s yield differences with the dollar to narrow and place it under pressure he said stefan hofer chief investment strategist at the hong kong branch of private bank lgt expects the yuan to weaken to 6 9 in three months and then recover to 6 7 in 12 months hofer said china s central bank should prioritise restoring investor confidence in its capital markets in particular its equity markets which plunged last year currency stability is key to that he says analysts at morgan stanley said last week that they had turned bullish on the yuan both because the people s bank of china pboc would refrain from intervening during trade talks and as companies convert more dollars into yuan ahead of lunar new year payments the currency fell more than 5 percent in 2018 and at one point had looked set break through a decade low of 7 per dollar andy seaman chief investment officer at stratton street in london is long the yuan even though his fund mainly buys chinese dollar bonds rather than the domestic ones he says the yuan s fundamentals do not justify its weakness and it was weak only because of the dollar s broad strength authorities are also likely to want to keep the yuan stable ahead of china s debut in global bond indexes a phased inclusion of yuan denominated government debt in the bloomberg barclays global aggregate index is scheduled for april gravity defying even yuan bulls concede its recent gains have been gravity defying with some china watchers saying the economy may be in the midst of a significant slowdown data on monday showed fourth quarter economic growth cooled to 6 4 percent on year the weakest since the global financial crisis that dragged full year 2018 growth to 6 6 percent the weakest in 28 years growth is set to cool further this year with some analysts predicting it could drop below 6 percent this spring before support measures start to stabilise activity around mid year stuart ritson portfolio manager for emerging market debt at aviva investors noted the yuan had rallied despite obvious risks including a decline in the current account surplus i m just not too sure as a policy tool given the sensitivity during the trade talks that it s possible to really allow the currency to weaken too much headwinds most analysts polled by reuters at the beginning of this year believe the yuan will weaken below 7 within six months analysts say the yuan s strength gives the pboc room to cut interest rates and pump cash into markets a change from last year when capital outflow risks were a key concern as yields fell and the yuan was weakening despite losing its yield advantage over dollar rates outflows were moderate in 2018 with only a modest drop in fx reserves but falling local yields could drag on the yuan later this year while the fed has now hinted future rate rises may be slower u s yields are still rising chinese three month yields are now 11 basis points below u s yields a sharp turn from being 250 points higher early in 2018 even though there is no basis for yuan depreciation there is no basis for a unilateral appreciation either said stephen chiu fx and rates strategist at china construction bank asia in hong kong china might be willing to let the yuan fall if that depreciation was justified by fundamentals such as unexpected weakness in the economy chiu said but china s key priority this year was to stabilise market expectations and encouraging any yuan depreciation would be viewed as comprehensive monetary easing he said source reuters editing by vidya ranganathan kim coghill

file photo shows a person walking near the entrance to a toys r us store in wayne n j regulators and experts worry that leveraged corporate borrowing could mushroom hurt economy and potentially trigger a downturn ap photo julio cortez file read more washington indebted borrowers increasingly take out high interest adjustable rate loans that are packaged into securities and sold to investors eager for a better rate of return everything s fine while the economy is growing but when it slows those borrowers could default causing problems to cascade through the financial system if this all sounds like the subprime housing market in the boom years before the 2008 financial crisis you re right and that s what increasingly has regulators lawmakers ratings agencies and some market watchers worried this time however the borrowers in this credit bubble aren t homeowners taking out mortgages they re hundreds of u s companies with weaker credit ratings many of them well known like uber and burger king taking out so called leveraged loans advertisement those loosely regulated loans often are used to fund corporate deal making but those deals known as leveraged buyouts can go bad because of the large debt load as happened with the demise last year of toys r us combined there is about 1 15 trillion in outstanding u s leveraged loans a record that is double the level five years ago and those loans increasingly are being made with less protection for lenders and investors any fair minded look at the leveraged loan market should cause significant alarm by anybody concerned about financial stability and the inevitable upcoming economic downturn said dennis kelleher president of better markets a group that advocates stricter financial regulation you put all these pieces together it s a witches brew the risks aren t nearly as widespread as they were during the housing bubble when the percentage of all mortgages that were subprime jumped to about 20 percent leveraged loans while growing rapidly account for less than 5 percent of the more than 42 trillion u s fixed income debt market which also includes corporate and municipal bonds still the federal reserve the office of the comptroller of the currency the bank of england the international monetary fund and the bank for international settlements a consortium of 60 central banks all have raised concerns recently about the growth of the leveraged loan market and the potential risks to the financial system in an economic slowdown former federal reserve chair janet yellen went public this fall with her worries about what she called a huge deterioration in the standards for those loans which make it easier for indebted companies to take on more debt if we have a downturn in the economy there are a lot of firms that will go bankrupt i think because of this debt she told the financial times it would probably worsen a downturn and sen elizabeth warren d mass is pressing u s regulators for answers about oversight of the market i am concerned that the large leveraged lending market exhibits many of the characteristics of the pre 2008 subprime mortgage market she wrote in a november letter to key regulatory agencies even jamie dimon chief executive of jpmorgan chase co who last week dismissed concerns that the leveraged loan market represented a potential systemic risk warned that there could be problems for some lenders outside the conventional banking system someone s going to get hurt there dimon said on a tuesday earnings call referring to leveraged loan losses if a recession hits toys r us loaded up on leveraged loan debt when it was purchased in a leveraged buyout in 2005 by private equity firms bain capital and kkr co and real estate investment trust vornado realty trust the debt burden led the toy retailer to file for bankruptcy protection in 2017 after it was unable to refinance the debt burger king used a 6 75 billion leveraged loan to help fund its 2014 purchase of tim horton s the canadian coffee and doughnut chain and uber last year raised 1 5 billion in its second leveraged loan issuance following a 1 15 billion one in 2017 according to the wall street journal leveraged loans in and of themselves aren t bad they are simply a credit instrument employed with companies that already have a lot of debt and such firms are fairly common about two thirds of u s companies have enough debt that independent credit raters have them categorized as a higher risk to repay than companies with investment grade ratings which makes them off limits to many institutional investors because those companies with non investment grade ratings are highly leveraged the chances are greater that they won t pay back a loan for that reason the interest rate needs to be higher to offset that risk the higher interest rate makes the loans desirable to investors seeking a greater return on their money the fed s benchmark federal funds rate is now at a range between 2 25 percent and 2 5 percent the yield on 10 year treasury bills is about 2 8 percent but yields on leveraged loans can be higher than 10 percent if an investor buys into the riskiest and most speculative segment of the market safer leveraged loans can still pay several points higher than a treasury bill in those ways leveraged loans are similar to the junk bonds that became popular in the 1980s and fueled corporate deals but there s an important difference junk bonds those rated below investment grade by ratings companies are securities that are traded under the oversight of the securities and exchange commission leveraged loans are basically private transactions between lenders and borrowers so they are not regulated by the sec however bank regulators do keep tabs on the underwriting standards and outstanding loan totals of banks to make sure if loans go sour they won t have to step in and rescue the institutions which is what happened during the financial crisis and they are starting to raise flags in its semiannual risk report issued last month the office of the comptroller of the currency which regulates national banks said it remains attentive to the heightened risks in the corporate bond and loan markets and in particular the leveraged lending market and in its financial stability report in november the fed said that although default rates for leveraged loans remained low credit standards for new leveraged loans appear to have deteriorated over the past six months the share of newly issued large loans to companies with high ratios of debt to adjusted earnings has increased in recent quarters and now exceeds previous peak levels observed in 2007 and 2014 when underwriting quality was notably poor the fed report said kelleher said the decline in lending standards was troubling you have the leveraged loan market growing at a very rapid clip at the same time the standards are dropping he said the leveraged loan market is flashing red warning lights all over the place those are warren s concerns as well she said in her november letter that federal regulators appointed by president donald trump appear to have backed off guidance issued in 2013 by regulators urging banks to use tougher underwriting standards for leveraged loans federal reserve chairman jerome h powell has expressed less concern saying in september that the direct risk to banks from leveraged loans is limited because of restrictions on their lending now in place that market has evolved really significantly since before the crisis he said but it s also true that excessive risk taking in the leveraged lending markets does have channels for affecting the real economy if there s overheating and that kind of thing in those markets so we monitor that carefully however there is a concern that with regulated banks offering fewer such loans there is less oversight of the leveraged lending market in general the share of leveraged loans offered by large banks has declined from about 80 percent in 2010 to about 54 percent this year while the share of those loans offered by small banks and nonbanks has increased to about 46 percent this year among the lenders outside the banking system making leveraged loans are private equity firms hedge funds and insurance companies lenders package these loans into securities called collateralized loan obligations that are sold to investors freeing them to make more loans what s more these loans increasingly are being offered with fewer restrictions on repayment making them more attractive than junk bonds as a source of corporate financing bloomberg reported this fall that total outstanding leveraged loans had overtaken junk bonds to cement their status as the go to financing source for speculative grade companies because the loan market got so attractive we ended up seeing a lot more companies going to the loan market said christina padgett head of leveraged finance research at ratings firm moody s investors service companies can borrow a bunch of money relatively affordably do what they want to do with relatively little constraints and still service their debt further fueling the growth in leveraged loans were the near zero interest rates put in place by federal reserve officials during and after the great recession to try to spur economic growth the effect of those low rates rippled through the financial system they lowered the cost of borrowing to make it more attractive to companies seeking to make acquisitions or refinance their debt even if they had to take out a leveraged loan the low rates set by the fed also made owning a piece of a leveraged loan a more attractive investment that paid a higher return than other debt instruments it also came with the promise of adjusting up when the fed began lifting its own benchmark rate investors are desperate for yield we ve seen this show before so they re not demanding a lot in terms of investor protections said sheila bair who headed the federal deposit insurance corp during the financial crisis you lower interest rates on safe assets these are the incentives you get concerns also have been raised about a ruling last year by a three judge panel of the u s court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit that removed a regulatory restriction on collateralized loan obligations the 2010 dodd frank financial reforms sought to reduce the sale of risky investments by requiring firms that package loans into securities to retain a 5 percent stake in the investment the loan syndications and trading assn a leveraged lending industry group filed suit arguing the requirement could limit funding after losing in a lower court the group won a ruling from the appeals court panel in february the loan syndications and trading association has downplayed the risks in the market the group notes that leveraged loans make up a small percentage of the u s fixed income debt market and the overall default rates on leveraged loans are low just 1 6 percent late last year and forecast by fitch ratings to fall to 1 5 percent at the end of this year but with u s economic growth slowing the dynamics could change every time the economy slows down you see a pickup in defaults bair said fed monetary policy makers estimated in december that they would enact two more small hikes in their key interest rate this year although powell said recently that they would be patient and flexible as they monitor the economy higher rates would put more pressure on the leveraged loan market but a sharp economic downturn could lead the fed to lower rates which would ease the pressure when you re this late in the business cycle you have pretty much already lent to every creditworthy borrower kelleher said the real question is how much lending do you want to give to marginal non creditworthy borrowers

latin american political history adjustment impoverishment popular resistance repression and social polarisation argentina is suffering from severe economic stagnation due to the astonishing devaluation of the peso by more than 50 since the start of the year triggered by president macri s opening up to the world with a deliberate devaluation of the peso towards the dollar policy which benefited the export sectors and elites key supporters of the cambiemos government to try and stop this downward trend the imf agreed in june to the delivery of a 50 billion dollar loan for the rescue of the argentinian economy in return argentina is committed to meeting the deficit reduction targets agreed to with the imf most notably decreasing the deficit to 0 from 4 of the gdp for 2019 the opposition and a huge part of the population have pushed back against this deal which they view as becoming a lackey of the imf cambiemos macri s party achieved power with a strong neoliberal agenda which reached it maximum expression on october 25th with the 2019 budget plan of increasing taxation and cutting government spending to contain the deficit and regain trust of international markets this decision reaffirmed the policies of social cuts that had already been implemented in 2018 as an imf requirement given the unpopularity of the measure the budget debate was tense after a 17 hour debate in a congress of 256 members 108 of whom are cambiemos the budget passed with 138 ayes 103 nays 8 abstentions and 7 non attendances after the debate in congress the much more divided senate only 25 out of 72 members are from cambiemos approved the plan on 15 november 2018 with 45 ayes and 24 nays social unrest and decrease of popularity it is clear that argentina is living difficult times and has difficult times ahead the 2018 budget foresaw an inflation of 15 7 and today s most optimistic calculations speak of 32 the peso should stabilize around 19 1 to the dollar but it has already broken the 40 peso barrier and gdp will not rise 3 2 as the government said last december but it will fall 1 at best macri s promises and optimism have been shattered along the way leaving him in a tough spot unable to uphold his word and forced to apply unpopular measures awaking the previously appeased population and transforming them into an irritated multitude no country in latin america is as difficult as argentina to implement unpopular reforms the polls show that the majority of the population believes that the situation is now worse than in 2015 and the president s popularity has plummeted over 35 with the 2019 elections around the corner on top of that macri s administration keeps receiving harsh criticism from important figures of argentinian politics jorge taiana former chancellor stated in a document presented on the 19th of november to the senate by the group mundo sur that the government has followed a policy for three years that in practice only served to please financial capital and multilateral credit agencies these allegations do not come on their own to many macri misinterpreted the world scenario weakened the international position of argentina indebted the country let the imf return to be the centre of its foreign policy boycotted all the political and economic agreements of regional integration such as mercosur unasur celac or parlasur and abandoned the national and regional claim on the falkland islands something that argentinians will neither forget nor forgive the g 20 was a great opportunity to clear all the smoke and present a strong and committed government which could address both the situation in the country and host a major international event however it has turned out to be a deeper failure the g 20 ended without a deal and it only exacerbated the differences between superpowers important matters such as the sovereignty of the falkland islands were not discussed macri s overtures of cooperation with mercosur and the eu were dismissed and in the words of respected jounrnalist alfredo zaiat it was ultimately a great theatre that macri used to ask for more oxygen from lagarde and trump his hope is that the imf dollars extend the grace period and allow him to be competitive in 2019 persistent risk macri s administration faces the new year with a difficult situation which might cost him his re election in october 2019 the damaged economy does not seem to be recovering anytime soon even after the harsh adjustments that his government applied and the massive parade for the g 20 summit this compels macri s administration to reach agreements with the peronist opposition a scenario that would damage further the president s re election aspirations in the midst of many skeptical questions from national press over the consequences of the g 20 summit for the economy of the country miguel braun secretary of economic policy argued that argentina has a short term need to get out of the financial turmoil we are starting to come out but we still cannot claim victory we have to remain very focused on complying with the program we have set for reducing the fiscal deficit and stabilizing the exchange rate and prices however argentina remains a risky country in which to invest this shows one thing even though the economic situation is not favourable for investors the main concern that buyers of argentine bonds have today is not economical but political many investors are still sceptical as the cambiemos administration is unlikely to remain in power for long and therefore the country risk remains high the g 20 was a crucial test for macri to show his ability to promote a united idea for all argentinians but it seems that the last breaths of hope for macri s 2018 will not be enough to change the mind of a bruised and tired country
the global economy will continue to grow at a steady pace of around 3 in 2019 and 2020 amid signs that global growth has peaked however a worrisome combination of development challenges could further undermine growth according to the united nations world economic situation and prospects 2019 which was launched on 21 january while global economic indicators remain largely favourable they do not tell the whole story united nations secretary general antónio guterres said he said the world economic situation and prospects 2019 raises concerns over the sustainability of global economic growth in the face of rising financial social and environmental challenges uneven growth global growth is expected to remain steady at 3 in 2019 and 2020 after an expansion of 3 1 in 2018 world economic situation and prospects growth in the united states is projected to decelerate to 2 5 in 2019 and 2 in 2020 as the impulse from fiscal stimulus in 2018 wanes steady growth of 2 0 is projected for the european union although risks are tilted to the downside including a potential fallout from brexit growth in china is expected to moderate from 6 6 in 2018 to 6 3 in 2019 with policy support partly offsetting the negative impact of trade tensions several large commodity exporting countries such as brazil nigeria and the russian federation are projected to see a moderate pickup in growth in 2019 2020 albeit from a low base however economic growth is uneven and is often failing to reach where it is most needed per capita incomes will stagnate or grow only marginally in 2019 in several parts of africa western asia and latin america and the caribbean even where per capita growth is strong economic activity is often driven by core industrial and urban regions leaving peripheral and rural areas behind eradicating poverty by 2030 will require both double digit growth in africa and steep reductions in income inequality further clouding the prospects are a confluence of risks with the potential to severely disrupt economic activity and inflict significant damage on longer term development prospects these risks include waning support for multilateral approaches the escalation of trade policy disputes financial instabilities linked to elevated levels of debt and rising climate risks as the world experiences an increasing number of extreme weather events the contemporaneous appearance of several important risks endangers efforts to achieve the 2030 agenda for sustainable development the universally adopted plan containing 17 specific goals to promote prosperity and social well being while protecting the environment alongside various short term risks there is an increasing urgency to deal with much more fundamental problems what we have hitherto viewed as long term challenges such as climate change have become immediate short term risks elliott harris un chief economist and assistant secretary general for economic development said strong global cooperation the report underscores that strengthening global cooperation is central to advancing sustainable development the multilateral approach to global policymaking is facing significant challenges including a trend toward greater unilateral actions pressures have materialized in the areas of international trade international development finance and tackling climate change these threats come at a time when international cooperation and governance are more important than ever many of the challenges laid out in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development are global by nature and require collective and cooperative action waning support for multilateralism also raises questions around the capacity for collaborative policy action in the event of a widespread global shock trade tensions amid the rise in global trade tensions global trade growth moderated over the course of 2018 from growth of 5 3 in 2017 to 3 8 while tensions have materially impacted some specific sectors stimulus measures and direct subsidies have so far offset much of the direct economic impacts on china and the united states but a prolonged escalation of trade tensions could severely disrupt the global economy directly impacted sectors have already witnessed rising input prices and delayed investment decisions these impacts can be expected to spread through global value chains particularly in east asia slower growth in china and the united states could also reduce the demand for commodities affecting commodity exporters from africa and latin america tight financial conditions as global financial conditions tighten an unexpectedly rapid rise in interest rates or a significant strengthening of the us dollar could exacerbate emerging market fragilities leading to a heightened risk of debt distress this risk can be further aggravated by global trade tensions monetary policy adjustment in developed economies commodity price shocks or domestic political or economic disruptions many low income countries have already experienced a substantial rise in interest burdens countries with a substantial amount of dollar denominated debt high current account or fiscal deficits large external financing needs and limited policy buffers are particularly vulnerable to financial stress climate risks a fundamental shift in the way the world powers economic growth is imperative economic decision making must fully integrate the negative climate risks associated with emissions this can be achieved through tools such as carbon pricing measures energy efficiency regulations such as minimum performance standards and building codes and reduction of socially inefficient fossil fuel subsidy regimes governments can also promote policies to stimulate new energy saving technologies such as research and development subsidies in countries that remain highly reliant on fossil fuel production economic diversification is vital source unctad

change is in the air in latin america in the last 12 months brazil cuba and mexico elected new leaders meanwhile argentina is preparing for fresh elections and venezuela faces continued upheaval in the face of nicolas maduro s re election in brazil far right president jair bolsonaro has promised economic liberalization safer days and a cleaner regime compared to the violent crimes and widespread corruption that plagued previous governments in mexico andres manuel lopez obrador its first leftist president in seven decades faces challenges in containing migrants headed from countries to its south to the u s while adjusting to a new economic order after nafta was renegotiated last october in cuba miguel diaz canel is the country s first president in 50 years to be a non castro but he is finding his efforts at economic liberalization undermined by the trump administration s hostility and the resulting disenchantment among investors it hopes to attract in argentina president mauricio macri is struggling to cope with the legacy of his predecessor s populist policies and a sluggish economy in an election year the outlier in the region is president nicolas maduro of venezuela who was sworn in last week for a second term even though his re election is branded illegitimate and the once rich country is in economic turmoil how will these leaders and their countries fare in 2019 william burke white law professor at the university of pennsylvania and benjamin gedan a senior adviser to the latin american program at the woodrow wilson international center for scholars shared their perspectives on the challenges facing latin america in a series titled 2019 a look ahead on the knowledge at wharton radio show on sirius xm listen to the podcast at the top of this page can maduro revive venezuela in venezuela nicolas maduro began the year with his second six year term after what was clearly a rigged election without meaningful opposition or competition but he doesn t seem to have a platform or a program said burke white who is inaugural director of penn s perry world house venezuela has been in a state of economic and political collapse now for several years and it s unclear whether there s anything that can pull the country out of it but certainly a second term for maduro seems unlikely to do so a country with the world s largest oil reserves venezuela was once the richest country in latin america but rampant corruption and mismanagement of its energy sector has brought its citizens to privations such as hunger poverty and riots over shortages of medicine and food the international monetary fund for instance has predicted a mind boggling inflation rate of 10 million percent for the year ahead venezuela has been in a state of economic and political collapse now for several years and it s unclear whether there s anything that can pull the country out of it william burke white the scale of the economic mismanagement is extraordinary said gedan who is also an adjunct professor at johns hopkins university and a former south america director of the national security council at the white house we focus a lot understandably on the humanitarian crisis in the degradation of venezuela s democracy but the economic management has been stunningly bad for a very long time hyperinflation unfortunately is not a new phenomenon for venezuela maduro s clinging to power through what many see as a rigged election has brought widespread condemnation including from venezuela s neighbors in the so called lima group that includes brazil argentina and columbia although mexico s leadership seemed to side with maduro he has steadily eroded all the checks and balances that had existed in what had been a robust democracy in one of the wealthiest countries in south america said gedan he has perpetuated himself in power using every tool in the book in terms of repressing dissent jailing his political opposition disbanding political parties and stealing an election with those tactics maduro seems to have ensured his regime s survival i don t think he needs to do much more at this point to solidify his dictatorship from a political standpoint said gedan however from an economic standpoint his regime is quite fragile burke white agreed with gedan and noted that the economic chaos and riots have done little to undermine maduro s regime it s going to take something more dramatic than anything we ve seen today to push him out of power he said but if he wants to bring his country back into the global economy he s going to have enormous work ahead of him the trump administration has declared maduro s regime as illegitimate but now faces a crucial test in whether it will support venezuelan opposition leader juan guaido who is growing in popularity according to a cnn report venezuela s opposition parties are expected to hold mass protests on wednesday the anniversary of a coup that overthrew dictator marcos pérez jiménez in 1958 according to a report in the hill in a post tuesday on twitter u s vice president mike pence declared america s unwavering support for the protests and wrote we stand with you and we will stay with you until democracy is restored and you reclaim your birthright of libertad according to burke white the biggest challenge for venezuela is that it can t sell as much of its energy overseas as it would like to and it can t effectively exploit that energy at the same time the maduro regime gets some cushion from its resource base of oil reserves he noted gedan added that the country has seen a steady decrease in oil production which has been devastating to its capabilities to import basic goods causing scarcities of food and medicine large numbers of venezuelans have in recent years fled the country to other parts of latin america causing a migrant crisis for others gedan estimated that some 3 million venezuelans have left their country and about half of them are in neighboring colombia which happens to be grappling with its own internal challenges following a fragile peace agreement after a 50 year civil conflict venezuelan migrants have also found refuge in brazil argentina uruguay ecuador peru and even some small caribbean islands off the venezuelan coast it s extraordinarily difficult for a lot of these countries to continue sustaining the refugee and migrant services that they re trying to provide although latin americans have been welcoming of these venezuelan migrants uphill battle for brazil s economy in brazil the year began with jair bolsonaro assuming the office of president after he won elections last october many have likened him to trump especially for his comments about women disrespect for the 2015 paris climate agreement and his views on gun rights the first few weeks of bolsonaro s government remind me of the first few weeks after donald trump was inaugurated in many ways said burke white has taken some bold steps on issues that are particularly salient to his political base burke white continued that includes things like withdrawing from the migration accord beginning a process to liberalize gun ownership which he promotes in brazil and closing the labor ministry ahead of his promised labor reforms he has also controversially ended protections for the lgbt community and indigenous landholders gedan noted that there is understandable concern about his approach to treating vulnerable communities to human rights issues and to the protection of democratic norms brazil has done what no major country in latin america has ever done which is target current political authorities and economic elites of the highest strata benjamin gedan at the same time bolsonaro is also starting a broader reform process said burke white the question is will he be successful at that there s an expectation that maybe he ll be able to crack through some of that corruption and some of the reform of the red tape that s needed in brazil gedan agreed there is a lot of optimism and enthusiasm among investors in the u s and elsewhere he said the one caveat is that it will be extraordinarily difficult for him to pull off the scale of reforms that he is now promising gedan noted that much is expected from bolsonaro s pick to head the ministries of finance and industry paulo guedes a former student of economist milton friedman at the university of chicago but guedes faces big challenges he s promising broad privatizations and market liberalization in a country where the business elite will oppose it and many powerful entities within the political system as well will not be on board gedan said so it s not guaranteed he ll be able to get even close to what he s pledged brazil s other big problem is violent crime it saw nearly 64 000 murders in 2017 or six times more than that in the u s according to a new york times report bolsonaro may have relatively more success on that front said gedan he has great maneuverability but i m much less optimistic that he will achieve anything productive even as he has advocated a strong fisted approach to deal with that problem but big obstacles exist there as well bolsonaro has to manage with a police force that s not perfectly trained and funded and his encouragement to the police to take on criminals not through investigations but rather through very aggressive paramilitary type raids on dangerous and marginal communities may not result in much success he said such tactics may attract political support at least initially in a country that desperately wants to be free of high levels of violent crime he noted on the sunny side gedan hailed brazil as an anti corruption success story referring to the so called car wash probes that resulted in unearthing of corruption scandals at public sector companies like petrobras and the impeachment of former president dilma rousseff a couple of years ago brazil has done what no major country in latin america has ever done which is target current political authorities and economic elites of the highest strata he said brazil could carry on with that and is on a good path to stronger democratic institutions and establishing the rule of law argentina pays for populism brazil s neighbor to its south argentina is facing its own economic woes with a shrinking economy burke white noted that argentine president mauricio macri is battling a stalled economy rising inflation and a weakening currency peso macri s predecessor cristina fernandez de kirchner could put up a strong fight with populist programs in the elections coming up in october november 2019 he noted macri s austerity efforts over his first term have failed to yield any fruit chinese money is absolutely irresistible to latin american governments benjamin gedan gedan agreed that macri s progress report while in office an inflation rate of around 50 and an economic recession this year will not help him to run for office again at the same time he noted that macri inherited many of those problems external factors too are to blame many of his base will understand that the wreckage he inherited from the last populist experiment would not logically lead voters to elect a populist once again trade and migrants loom large for mexico in mexico new president andres manuel lopez obrador has many fires to fight including immigration from countries further south said burke white according to gedan it is not clear if lopez obrador will have the support of the u s in containing the problem of migrants on the one hand is seeking to avoid any confrontations with president trump and he has been willing to play ball on keeping some of the central american migrants in mexico while their asylum applications are processed north of the border gedan said on the other hand he is pushing for addressing the root causes of this migration and he has said that he would like to invest tens of millions of dollars or billions of dollars in northern central america in honduras guatemala el salvador to try to address the factors that are pushing these migrants through mexico and toward the u s the problem there is the u s occasionally supports that policy but then episodically threatens to pull that foreign assistance as well so it s unclear he will have the resources or a consistent partner in that effort on the economic front lopez obrador has to ensure that the renegotiated nafta the u s mexico canada agreement protects mexico s interest especially in areas such as the automobile industry more broadly figuring out how to keep the mexican economy moving forward and strong making sure that that there is economic growth and that it looks more populist and leftist in nature to placate the base that elected him said burke white chinese investors head for cuba in cuba expectations from new president diaz canel are modest at least in the short term said gedan the hostility cuba faces from the u s is a dampener and that could prove a drag in its economic liberalization he added the u s withdrawal from the region has encouraged china to consider every opportunity to invest there burke white noted adding that chinese investments are visible also in other countries like venezuela chinese money is absolutely irresistible to latin american governments said gedan there s a huge infrastructure gap in the region and they just cannot say no to beijing corruption in latin american countries has also made it easier for chinese investors to enter the region said gedan as corruption related risks make it difficult for the region s public private partnerships in the infrastructure sector to find conventional investors it s the chinese money that they turn to he added
kathy gibson is with pwc in johannesburg ceos are less optimistic about global economic growth for 2019 in fact 29 of world business leaders believe that global economic growth will decline in the next 12 months approximately six times the level of 5 last year a record jump in pessimism this is one of the key findings of pwc s 22nd annual global survey of 1 300 plus ceos launched at the world economic forum annual meeting taking place in davos and is in vivid contrast to last year s record jump 29 to 57 in optimism about global economic growth prospects south african ceo s views echo that of their global counterparts with 35 7 in 2017 believing that global economic growth will decline over the next 12 months only 30 of ceos in south africa global 42 believe that global economic growth will improve moderately during the course of the year overall ceos views on global economic growth are more polarised this year but trending downward the most pronounced shift was among ceos in north america where optimism dropped from 63 in 2018 to 37 likely due to fading of fiscal stimulus and emerging trade tensions the middle east also saw a big drop from 52 to 28 due to increased regional economic uncertainty dion shango ceo of pwc southern africa points out that a number of factors are playing into this sentiment economic slowdown in china trade conflict and protectionism rising nationalism and populism eurozone discord and the fourth industrial revolution for south africa stagnant gdp growth high unemployment rising populism political and policy uncertainty and the upcoming general elections are all driving caution lullu krugel chief economist at pwc africa says that business demonstrated a high level of positivity this time last year but both the world bank and the international monetary fund imf warned that some risks were attendant on that confidence that is exactly what played out she says although there were expectations for the next three years to be really positive those expectations have been dampened shango adds the prevailing sentiment this year is one of caution in the face of increasing uncertainty ceos all around the world are less optimistic than they were a year ago about the strength of the global economy and their organisations ability to grow revenues in both the short and medium term in south africa economic and policy uncertainty among other issues have cast doubt upon business leaders prospects for future growth the unease about global economic growth is lowering ceos confidence about their own companies outlook in the short term thirty five percent of global ceos said they are very confident in their own organisations growth prospects over the next 12 months down from 42 last year in south africa only 18 compared to 22 in 2018 of ceos are very confident about their own company s prospects for revenue growth over the next 12 months in addition 30 of local business leaders global 36 are very confident about their business s prospects for growth over the next three years why are south african ceos more optimistic shango asks perhaps the new dawn is driving optimism or perhaps there is a feeling that things can t get much worse however even those ceos who are confident about revenue growth prospects are reining in their expectations and confidence levels are down below levels last seen in 2009 after the global financial crisis growth prospects correlate directly to expected headcount growth and the survey shows this holding true in 2019 as only 40 of south african ceos expect to increase their headcount over the next 12 months the us retains its lead as the top market for growth over the next 12 months however many ceos are also turning to other markets reflected in the dramatic drop in the share of votes in favour of the us from 46 in 2018 to just 27 in 2019 china narrowed the gap but also saw its popularity fall from 33 in 2018 to 24 in 2019 as a result of the ongoing trade conflict with the us china s ceos have diversified their markets for growth with only 17 selecting the us down from 59 in 2018 the other three countries rounding out the top five for growth include germany at 13 down from 20 india at 8 down from 9 and the uk at 8 down from 15 south african ceos named the us 25 followed by china the uk and kenya 20 as the most important countries for their organisations overall growth prospects over the next 12 months shango adds as ceos plan the future of their organisations this year chief executives clearly feel the impact while most still believe in globalisation they appear to be less interested in expansion plans outside their home markets instead organisations are narrowing their focus of staying local in the search for revenue growth as indicators predict an imminent global economic slowdown ceos have turned their focus to navigating the surge in populism in the markets where they operate trade conflicts policy uncertainty and protectionism have replaced terrorism climate change and an increasing tax burden in the top ten lists of threats to growth south african ceos concerns around a broad range of business societal and economic threats continue to increase ceos are extremely concerned about social instability south africa 68 global 18 uncertain economic growth south africa 68 global 24 populism south africa 55 global 28 exchange rate volatility south africa 49 global 26 and trade conflict between the us and china south africa 100 global 88 when it comes to business threats 33 of south african ceos compared to 34 globally said they were extremely concerned about the availability of key skills 38 compared to 30 globally cited cyber threats and 38 compared to 28 stated the speed of technological change as concerns shango points out that while global ceos are more concerned about policy uncertainty cyberthreats and geopolitical uncertainty south african ceos worry more about issues like uncertain economic growth political instability and unemployment activities that ceos are planning to drive revenue growth show that organisations are becoming more inward looking shango points out organic growth operational efficiencies and new products will be the main focus areas followed by new strategic alliances or joint ventures new markets new mergers and acquisitions collaboration with entrepreneurs or start ups and sale of the business this year s survey took a deep dive into data and analytics and artificial intelligence ai two key areas on leaders radars to get ceos insights on the challenges and opportunities technological advances and demographic shifts were cited as the main global trends that have transformed business as have the shift in global economic power resource scarcity and climate change and urbanisation south africa s ceos answered similarly to global respondents when it comes to using data the survey found that ceos around the world still can t access the data they need this year s survey revisited questions about data adequacy first asked in 2009 it was found that ceos continue to face issues with their own data capabilities resulting in a significant information gap that remains ten years on despite billions of dollars of investments made in it infrastructure over this time period ceos report still not receiving comprehensive data needed to make key decisions about the long term success and durability of their business leaders expectations have risen as technology advances but ceos are keenly aware that their analysis capabilities have not kept pace with the volume of data which has expanded exponentially over the past decade when asked why they do not receive comprehensive data ceos point to the lack of analytical talent global 54 south africa 50 followed by data siloing global 51 south africa 63 and poor data reliability global 50 south africa 41 the skills gap is still a pain point impeding innovation and promoting higher people costs however ceos agree that there is no quick fix forty six percent globally compared to 38 of south african ceos see significant retraining and upskilling as the answer with 17 south africa 20 also citing establishing a strong pipeline directly from education as an option ai has become a major technological focus globally with 85 of ceos globally south africa 90 agreeing that it will dramatically change their business over the next five years nearly two thirds globally view it as something that will have a larger impact than the internet revolution and more believe it will be good for society clearly when you can t find the people to do the work it may be time to turn to the machines to do the work shango points out despite the bullish view on ai 23 of ceos globally south africa 28 have no current plan to pursue ai in addition 33 globally south africa 32 5 have taken a very limited approach with just 35 planning ai initiatives in the next three years when it comes to the impact ai will have on jobs 55 of south africa s ceos believe that ai will displace more jobs than it creates it is interesting to note that ceos in western europe and north america are less doubtful with 38 and 41 respectively believing ai will displace more jobs than it creates shango comments to help unlock internal growth potential in their organisations ceos are paying close attention to emerging digital technologies such as ai almost 15 7 trillion in global gdp gains is expected from ai by 2030 according to pwc estimates most ceos believe governments should play a critical and integral role in developing policies around ai although shango doubts that their will come to fruition soon
article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com the end of last year saw a sudden rise in volatility on financial markets share prices in particular fell sharply almost everywhere suggesting that markets were gripped by feelings of greater uncertainty and by increasing worries about a coming recession in the world economy these fears seem however overblown yes there are signs of slowdown in the eurozone in the united states and in china as well as in south and east asia but the underlying trends in real variables as opposed to the froth of financial variables point to a gradual and contained deceleration rather than to an impending crisis the u s continues to grow steadily and so does china a u s slowdown in 2019 20 has been long predicted as fiscal policy stimuli fade away and higher interest rates begin to bite if anything the latter danger seems to have diminished since the federal reserve system appears to be opting for a much more gradual and moderate tightening of monetary policy than previously expected similarly a modest chinese slowdown over the next two years has also been forecast for some time in line with a longer run deceleration in the country s growth tempo here too the slowdown may be less pronounced than had earlier been feared thanks to the recent adoption of some fiscal and monetary reflationary measures the two countries are of course embroiled in a trade war and the present truce may be only temporary both economies will suffer from the mutual protectionism that has already been announced let alone from any further escalation but estimates of the likely negative effects remain contained in europe the outlook is most uncertain for the united kingdom given that there is still no assurance that a compromise deal will be found once brexit takes place at the end of march 2019 the forecasts shown below are based on the assumption that an agreement will be reached but should a so called hard brexit or absence of agreement materialize the outlook for the british economy could worsen significantly simulations by oxford economics suggest for instance that rather than growing by nearly 2 percent on average between 2018 and 2021 the uk s gdp would expand by only 1 percent per annum over the period despite a further significant fall in the value of the pound and renewed cuts in interest rates by the bank of england elsewhere the news is less downbeat eastern europe is still expanding rapidly growth rates of the order of 3 to 4 percent are expected this year and next not only in poland the leader of the pack but also in hungary slovakia and bulgaria even turkey which is in the throes of recession at present following sharp currency depreciation virulent inflation and sky high interest rates in 2018 is expected to return to positive growth by the beginning of 2020 the eurozone went through a rough patch during the summer autumn of last year the euro strengthened vis à vis the dollar export growth to the rest of the world slowed down quite sharply the german car sector suffered from a massive increase in unsold stocks italy seemed set on a clash with the european commission because of its new government s electoral promises of fiscal expansion france entered a period of turmoil and the european central bank ecb announced an exit from its quantitative easing program indicating therefore an impending tightening in monetary policy the gloom was compounded by the gdp data for the third quarter of the year which showed quarter on quarter declines in both germany and italy for the first time since 2014 some of these fears have however dissipated italy and the eu have reached an uneasy compromise helped in no small measure by the expansionary moves made by the french government in response to the gilets jaunes uprising turning to the much heralded tightening of monetary policy this looks like being very mild with the ecb s short term interest rate expected to remain negative through 2019 rising to barely ½ a percent by end 2021 as for the setbacks of late 2018 some of these may well have been temporary order inflows for german industry for instance have recovered somewhat in recent months while french demand may benefit from macron s latest concessions should the surprising weakness in oil prices continue european firms and households would also benefit from a further favorable effect on their purchasing power gdp growth expectations at some 1½ percent per annum remain modest of course if set against recent trends they are in line however with the area s potential output growth germany and spain as well as austria finland and the netherlands look healthy france as mentioned above should benefit from a small fiscal boost but the outlook for macron s reform program now looks more uncertain should the government make further concessions and retreat from its earlier intentions the country s medium term outlook would undoubtedly suffer italy as in the past remains the weakest link the new government s policies have increased uncertainty business confidence in particular has declined sharply the public debt gdp ratio may well increase further given that growth prospects are put at less than 1 percent per annum over the next three years and this in turn could weaken the position of the banking sector the only redeeming feature has been the recent decline in the spread between italian and german long term interest rates hopefully this decline will prove long lasting but any turbulence on financial markets even if due to non italian events could well test it the eurozone has been in place for 20 years but still remains fragile and this fragility would sharply increase should trump decide to penalize european car exports something he has often threatened to do germany would be particularly vulnerable to such a move and a hard brexit would add to the country s troubles given the importance of the uk market for its automotive sector while a trade war with the united states would not necessarily result in recession it would almost certainly dent growth significantly and risks to the outlook would also increase should populist parties make large gains at the forthcoming european elections neither of these outcomes is a foregone conclusion but they both point to negative downsides gdp growth rates

economic forum globalization 4 0 shaping a global architecture in the age of the fourth industrial revolution 2 the u s shutdown slowdown is here last year at davos u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin sent the dollar plunging by saying a weak currency was good for the united states this year though with a government in shutdown president donald trump has canceled mnuchin s switzerland trip trump is also economizing in other ways including buying mcdonalds burgers for white house visitors but anxiety is growing over how much the shutdown could hit u s growth and to what extent it will filter through to already stuttering world growth so far damage looks limited jobless claims have continued to fall and the philly fed business outlook survey was above forecast but the longer it continues the worse it gets not only are 800 000 government workers going without pay a delay to tax refunds for other citizens will hit companies that rely on consumer spending the government has until early march before the debt ceiling kicks in it could then also miss some social security payments but the democrat controlled house shows no sign of agreeing trump s demands for 5 7 billion to fund a border wall and a house vote to fund the government through feb 28 was postponed to the coming week mnuchin meanwhile has declined to testify to the house about how the shutdown may affect the upcoming tax filing season 3 signs of china growth weakness mount data out on monday showed china s economy slowed in the fourth quarter under pressure from faltering domestic demand and bruising u s tariffs growth for 2018 fell to its lowest in nearly three decades putting pressure on beijing to roll out more stimulus to avert a worse slowdown growing signs of weakness in china which has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years are fueling anxiety about risks to the world economy and weighing on profits for companies ranging from apple to big carmakers other data just released shows investment and retail sales continued to languish while the jobless rate edged higher beijing has offered a series of fiscal and monetary support measures unlike in 2015 or during prior slowdowns the government has been careful to avoid simply throwing state money at the problem as the chinese proverb goes mountains cannot turn only rivers can be it household spending sops tax cuts infrastructure projects funded by local governments or money market operations china seems determined not to turn its back on a commitment to deleveraging and market reform that makes it difficult to say when the economy will rebound 4 there s a eurozone slowdown to worry about too ecb bond buying is officially over but with economic data and inflation both continuing to underwhelm the central bank has little time to relax policymakers have acknowledged the eurozone slowdown could last longer than anticipated but will be hoping nonetheless that upcoming data might bring some relief in particular they will monitor the snapshot of business activity in the bloc in the shape of flash pmis for january they are out on thursday hours before the ecb meeting and reuters polls indicate some stabilization is likely after recent dire readings powerhouse germany which barely skirted recession in the latter part of 2018 releases its zew sentiment survey on tuesday ecb president draghi is as yet unlikely to change his assessment of the balance of risks facing the economy but that may be just a question of time after all china s economic slowdown and the u s government shutdown are weighing on global growth and the eurozone still needs to weather the fallout from brexit 5 does brexit happen or not another week closer to the date britain leaves the european union or are we given how crushingly prime minister theresa may s proposed brexit agreement was defeated by lawmakers there is little chance her plan b to be presented in coming days will get away with just minor amendments so markets now reckon the march 29th deadline will be extended to give parliament more time to negotiate the manner of exit or even to organize a second referendum the optimism has driven sterling to two month highs against the dollar with 4 percent plus gains from jan 3 lows options markets too imply further pound strength over the three month period that encompasses the deadline of course market glee might be misplaced if may fails to forge consensus within her party and with opposition leader jeremy corbyn and if parliament fails to agree an extension britain will crash out of the eu without a deal corbyn wants a pledge from may to block a no deal brexit before joining cross party talks but may describes this as impossible her plan b will be disclosed on monday and voted on

alexandria ocasio cortez during a widely criticized viral interview with pbs public broadcasting station photo screenshot if nothing else alexandria ocasio cortez gives me a lot to write about and to laugh about i recently pontificated about her crazy idea to impose a top tax rate of 70 percent which would reverse the very successful experiment we had in the 1980s and presumably have a reverse effect on revenue as well today let s look at the spending side of the fiscal equation aoc as she is known wants a dramatic increase in the burden of federal spending for her so called green new deal let s examine the implications we ll start with a supporter thomas friedman of the new york times has a giant carbon footprint compared to the average person but that naturally doesn t stop him from endorsing policies that would put aoc s onerous burdens on the less fortunate barack obama picked up the theme and made a green new deal part of his 2008 platform but the idea just never took off so i m excited that the new democratic congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez and others have put forward their own takes on a green new deal the goal is a detailed national industrial economic mobilization plan to rapidly transition the country away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy such as a solar wind and electric cars the green new deal that ocasio cortez has laid out aspires to power the u s economy with 100 percent renewable energy within 12 years and calls for a job guarantee program to assure a living wage job to every person who wants one basic income programs and universal health care financed at least in part by higher taxes on the wealthy it is time for the green movement to think big and make big demands a portion of every dollar raised by a carbon tax in a green new deal would be invested in two new community colleges and high speed broadband in rural areas of every state thomas friedman the new york times now let s look at the implications of such policies but before looking at fiscal and economic considerations let s briefly detour to ideology jonah goldberg of national review has some fun examining the philosophical forerunners of ocasio cortez s plan the green new deal is a triumph of recycling not of plastic bags or soda cans but of ideas specifically franklin d roosevelt s new deal and the impulses behind it to her credit ocasio cortez d n y is fairly honest about her ideological recycling the new deal itself was largely about war mobilization without war roosevelt campaigned for president promising to adapt woodrow wilson s wartime industrial policies to fight the great depression nearly the entire structure of the new deal was copied from wilson s war socialism the national recovery administration was modeled on the war industries board the reconstruction finance corporation was an update of wilson s war finance corporation breaking discipline was a punishable offense which is why a tailor jacob maged was sentenced to 30 days in jail for charging too little to press a suit american liberalism has been recycling the same basic idea the country needs to be unified and organized as if we are at war the attraction stems from what john dewey called the social possibilities of war the ability to reorganize and unify society according to the schemes of planners and experts jonah goldberg national review gee another new deal what could possibly go wrong now let s contemplate the practical implications we ll start with warren henry s article in the federalist the darling of democratic socialism proposed eliminating carbon emissions within 12 years the frequently asked questions section accompanying her draft resolution claims it could be funded in the same ways that we paid for the 2008 bank bailout and extended quantitative easing programs the same ways we paid for world war ii and many other wars the federal reserve can extend credit to power these projects and investments new public banks can be created as in wwii to extend credit and a combination of various taxation tools including taxes on carbon and other emissions and progressive wealth taxes can be employed ocasio cortez now falls back on the comforting myth that everything is affordable by soaking the rich with higher income taxes ocasio cortez half concedes her plan is a fantasy for an idea of how detached ocasio cortez is from reality consider that we get only 17 percent of our energy from renewables even if the golden geese of capitalism were to continue laying eggs in ocasio cortez s command and control economy there will not be enough to make her statist omelet even if ocasio cortez s fever dream were technologically feasible the burden of funding it would land on the middle class as well as the uber wealthy this is not the first time ocasio cortez has tried to pass off a fairy tale as a white paper she recently claimed the 32 trillion cost of a medicare for all plan could be funded by curbing fraud at the pentagon not even politifact could make that math work given that our nation has not spent 32 trillion on defense since its founding warren henry federalist in an article for fee jarrett stepman looks at the economics of aoc s plan it shouldn t be a surprise that the avowed democratic socialist went with the predictable tax the rich formula in order to pay for a massive government program to combat climate change such a scheme would mean that her constituents in new york city would pay a max income tax rate of 82 6 percent perhaps new yorkers deserve what they voted for but does the country the tax hikes on the rich would be one of the least radical parts of the agenda moving the economy away from fossil fuels to 100 percent renewable energy will come at a cost of about 5 2 trillion over 20 years this deal would instead rely on the ruthless bludgeoning of private industry and citizens through the levers of the state the plan calls for direct government intervention to be its prime driver the green new deal doesn t just include environmentalist proposals among the liberal wish list items included the green new deal contains a proposal for universal health care and a basic minimum income program to make up for all the jobs lost this will all come with an immense cost how do green new deal proponents propose to pay for this extreme growth in government by massively hiking taxes and then borrowing and ultimately printing money then it would use public banks run by unaccountable bureaucrats to carry the whole thing out an american version of a soviet style five year plan focused on command and control economic solutions that have proven to fail the world over the agony of a collapsing venezuela is a stark example of how badly this can end jarrett stepman fee milton ezrati s column in the city journal further debunks aoc s numbers specific goals include among other things expanding renewable energy sources until they provide 100 percent of the nation s power upgrading every residence and industrial building in the u s for energy efficiency eliminating greenhouse gas emissions for industry and agriculture funding massive investments ocasio cortez adds a long list of social objectives providing training and education for the energy transition including job guarantees at a living wage for everyone who wants one mitigating racial regional and gender based inequalities developing universal health care and income support programs there were some 136 million housing units in the united states upgrading each unit to high standards of energy efficiency would cost conservatively at least 10 000 per home adding up to a total cost of 1 3 trillion doing the same for industrial structures would easily exceed that amount the single payer health care part would cost another 3 trillion or more annually stabilizing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would add another 1 trillion to 2 trillion to the price tag and all these still only account for three items on aoc s list she would rely on debt printing money and government willingness to take an equity stake in some of the enterprises involved milton ezrati city journal the bottom line is ocasio cortez wants to dramatically expand the size and scope of government some of her ideas would involve big increases in red tape especially for the green parts of the green new deal thus underscoring why it is rather naive for anyone to think the left would accept less regulation in exchange for a carbon tax but since i m a fiscal policy person i m naturally concerned about what her grandiose plan would mean for the tax and spending burden brian riedl of the manhattan institute has used public sources to estimate the price tag here s the new spending that aoc and her fellow travelers want to impose on the economy and below we have a menu of potential tax increases there are two things to realize first even if every single one of the tax increases is adopted it doesn t come close to paying for aoc s wish list for new spending second the big revenue sources payroll taxes vat income tax are largely taxes on lower income and middle class taxpayers in other words politicians talk big about screwing the rich but the rest of us will be picking up the tab by the way i can t resist commenting on this second table i realize brian is merely following the tradition of budget scorekeepers at the jct and cbo but new revenues should not be categorized as savings i would go with grabbings or takings instead

call are subject to that safe harbor statement and at the end of the call we will take questions from the research analyst community and now i ll turn the call over to john john c asbury president chief executive officer thank you bill and thanks to all for joining us today union closed out our transformative 2018 year with a strong fourth quarter to start we did what we said we would do we hit every one of our top tier financial targets that we ve laid out at the beginning of the year operating return on tangible common equity was 17 18 for the quarter operating roa was 1 36 for the quarter and the operating efficiency ratio was 53 5 for the quarter advertisement advertisement as we ve been saying the fourth quarter s results provide a better view of the underlying strength and earnings potential of this uniquely valuable franchise we continue to expect further improvements to these top tier financial metrics this year and next as communicated in our investor day presentation with the addition of access we have further stepped up our financial targets as follows roa between 1 4 and 1 6 rotce between 16 and 18 and an efficiency ratio at 50 or better as was the case in 2018 with xenith we expect the first three quarters of 2019 to be noisy as we get through integration and systems conversion in may we will start to demonstrate the improved results of the company post access acquisition in q4 19 since we have a slightly different timeline for our wealth integration which will not have its systems conversion complete until early 2020 we ll not fully realize the higher levels of financial performance for that business unit until early 2020 we are pleased to have achieved higher than expected loan growth at 13 annualized for the quarter which lifts our full year loan growth back up to our original upper single digit inaudible our loan growth was a result of both increased production and lower pay downs during the quarter pipelines remain strong and we expect the full year 2019 loan growth to be in the high single digit range of 7 to 9 consistent with our 2018 full year growth this includes growth from access national bank s baseline beginning when the merger closes on february 1 for the year if you review our 2018 priorities you ll see that we either accomplished or made significant progress on every one of them i mentioned already that we hit the top tier financial metrics on a quarterly basis a significant achievement we diversified our loan portfolio and revenue streams we re especially encouraged by the results we re seeing with our commercial banking emphasis and we continue to enhance our treasury management products and delivery we added two registered investment advisors in 2018 which is helping to diversify and grow fee income the pieces of the diversification strategy are coming together and we expect to make further progress there in 2019 advertisement advertisement our average loan to deposit ratio was 96 which is relatively in line with our long term loan to deposit ratio goal of 95 while deposit growth did not match loan growth during the quarter due to seasonally high loan growth we believe pacing deposits to loans is achievable for the full year 2019 but not necessarily in every quarter we improved the efficiency of the company a task that never ends efficiency is more than just the efficiency ratio or simplifying tasks and improving processes too we continued to build our brand and defined our value proposition to make banking easier and finally we successfully integrated xenith if you look at all that we accomplished including the successful integration and conversion of xenith the second quarter strategic actions to rationalize our business lines and our announced acquisition of access national bank substantially completing the virginia franchise these are great proof points of our team s ability to execute a tightly focused acceleration strategy if we demonstrated one thing and one thing only it would be our ability to make change happen within this company we want to use this ability to strengthen the union moat around our franchise and keep the company nimble adaptable and responsive to our environment i m very proud of the union team how well it has embraced the changes we have undertaken and how rapidly our company is evolving and as we ve demonstrated all year long we were able to do all of this while improving our quarterly financial results culminating and hitting our top tier financial metrics during q4 changing a company to build sustainable long term shareholder value while improving near term operating results is not a common occurrence and it s one that we re proud of achieving this past year this is a journey without end and we ll continue to demonstrate discipline focus and intensity in executing against our 2019 strategic priorities and building out our franchise as i introduced during our first ever investor day in november we ve established a new set of priorities for 2019 the first three are unchanged from last year they are one diversify the loan portfolio and revenue streams two grow core funding and three manage the higher levels of performance new to 2019 are four strengthen our digital capabilities five make banking easier and six integrate access national corporation the webcast for the investor day is still available if you want to catch our presentations and hear the details you can find that on our investor website advertisement advertisement i would like to comment on a topic that we covered in the investor day and that s our branding issue there are a number of inefficiencies with operating multiple brands across multiple states and we intend to work toward one distinctive and unified brand across the banking franchise we have previously announced we will adopt access s wealth management brand of middleburg for our combined wealth management group post merger the union bank trust brand is more challenging it s not usable in all of our markets yet it goes back a 100 years it s who we are we want to honor its heritage retain its brand equity but ensure it s distinctive enough to work on all of our markets we do have a plan in place to accomplish this and we intend to share that plan with you in the near term but not today i will now detail some key topics from the quarter and year while trying not to duplicate too much of rob s upcoming commentary loan growth was broad based with commercial and industrial loans having the largest linked quarter percentage gain at 56 annualized that c i would become our largest loan growth category is something we ve been predicting for some time and it s a good proof point that we are executing the strategy we ve been talking about since my arrival c i line utilization during the quarter was stable while commitments grew point to point deposits grew 5 5 annualized for the quarter while average deposit growth was 6 1 as with the third quarter point to point growth in deposits is lower than the average due to late quarter declines and demand deposits resulting from normal fluctuations among commercial customers this quarterly deposit growth rate is close to our expected loan growth rate for 2019 so the delta is not that large and we have numerous deposit growth initiatives under way that we believe are capable of pacing deposit growth to loan growth as a reminder as we build out our commercial banking book expect some unevenness when comparing period ending balances given the normal fluctuations that occur among business clients our loan pipelines have reloaded and while weighted to the earlier stages of the lending process the pipelines are as full now as they were going into the fourth quarter keep in mind this is only for the union side and we remain very optimistic about the potential we have with the access national bank franchise and their very attractive markets we will continue to opportunistically build out the commercial banking effort after hiring 25 c i bankers in 2018 and as our growth in the c i and owner occupied real estate loan types evidence we are building momentum however we still do not expect the new bankers full loan production impact to be felt before mid 2019 advertisement advertisement for those not familiar with the virginia banking history i ll say again most small to mid sized businesses in the commonwealth once banked with virginia based banks just like union until they were all lost to interstate banking consolidation over the course of the 90s we believe no one is as well positioned as union to recreate that market dynamic and we are now able to go toe to toe with the largest of our competitors in the space credit quality remains strong the economy in our footprint is steady and we re not seeing any systemic changes to our credit environment while we did have a modest uptick in charge offs for the quarter from a low base in q3 they involved a variety of different credits and skewed toward consumer for the full year 2018 charge offs totaled a very benign 12 basis points down from 15 basis points in 2017 charge offs will be lumpy quarter to quarter and we currently expect full year 2019 to look about like 2017 and 18 from a credit quality perspective with charge offs incrementally increasing from the 2018 low base barring some change in the macroeconomic environment i ll also point out that quarter over quarter rise and 30 day past dues at year end were part of a seasonal trend that we sometimes see around the year end while higher than prior periods we track these credits individually and as at last week the level has normalized with more than half of those 30 to 59 day past dues at year end now current we do not see past dues as a factor at this time later stage past dues in non performing assets were stable quarter over quarter as you ve heard me say each quarter since my arrival i believe problem asset levels at union and across the industry remain below the long term trend line but at this time we still do not see any early indications of a downturn in union s portfolio level credit quality eventually it will come we just can t yet tell you exactly when except that from this vantage point we don t see it happening in 2019 turning to access we announced last tuesday that all necessary approvals have been received and we expect to close on february 1 our integration teams are working well together and are finalizing preparations for a smooth legal day one and systems conversion is slated for mid may having just completed the xenith integration this is a process we know well we remain enthusiastic about the potential of our expanded presence in this tremendous growth market advertisement advertisement in summary union achieved a great deal in 2018 hitting our financial targets and making significant progress against our six strategic priorities we have now raised the bar with higher financial goals and refreshed priorities for 2019 we re excited to have the access teams join union in another week or so and look forward to coming together to form what is irrefutably virginia s regional bank i remain highly confident in what the future holds for union and the potential we have to deliver long term sustainable performance for our customers communities teammates and shareholders i ll close with a familiar message union is a uniquely valuable franchise dense and compact in great markets with a story unlike any other in our region we have assembled the right scale the right markets and the right team to deliver high performance and a franchise that can no longer be replicated in virginia with the access national bank partnership the strong hand we re holding grows stronger still and we intend to play it i ll now turn the call over to rob to cover the financial results for the quarter robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer advertisement advertisement well thank you john and good morning everyone thanks for joining us today i d now like to take a few minutes to provide you with some details of union s financial results for the fourth quarter which illustrates the earnings potential of this franchise please note that for the most part my commentary will focus on union s fourth quarter financial results on a non gaap operating basis which excludes 2 2 million in after tax merger related costs but does include losses from discontinued operations of 192 000 related to union s exit from the mortgage origination business for clarity i will specify which metrics are on a reported versus operating basis in the fourth quarter reported net income was 44 1 million and earnings per share was 0 67 reported return on assets improved 1 29 reported return on tangible common equity increased to 16 4 and reported efficiency ratio declined to 56 2 on a non gaap operating basis which as noted excludes 2 2 million in after tax merger related costs consolidated net earnings for the fourth quarter were 46 2 million or 0 70 per share we achieved our targeted top tier financial metrics for the quarter as the company s non gaap operating return on assets was 1 36 versus the fourth quarter goal of 1 3 non gaap operating return on tangible common equity was 17 2 exceeding the top end of our targeted range of 15 to 17 and the non gaap operating efficiency ratio came in at 53 5 in line with the lower than 55 target we set as john noted in his comments we expect further improvements to these top tier financial metrics this year and next with the addition of access and as a result we have raised our financial targets the new targets are return on assets between 1 4 and 1 6 that s up from 1 3 to 1 5 return on tangible common equity between 16 and 18 again up from 15 to 17 and an efficiency ratio at 50 or below which is down from the 55 or lower previous target we expect to achieve these new targets in 2020 once we have fully integrated access and realized the strategic financial benefits of the combination now turning to the major components of the income statement tax equivalent net interest income was 111 4 million which was up 3 4 million from the third quarter due to loan growth during the quarter the third quarter s tax equivalent net interest margin was 3 7 a decline of 6 basis points from the prior quarter net accretion of purchase accounting adjustments for loans time deposits and long term debt added 13 basis points to the net interest margin in the fourth quarter which was in line with the third quarter s 13 basis point impact the decline in the tax equivalent net interest margin was principally due to a 15 basis point increase in the cost of funds partially offset by a 9 basis point increase in the yield on earning assets advertisement advertisement the quarterly net increase in earning asset yields to 4 74 was primarily driven by higher loan portfolio yields which improved by 12 basis points to 5 8 during the quarter due to the impact of increased short term interest rates on variable rate loan yields the higher loan yields translated to an increase of approximately 10 basis points on the net interest margin for the quarter the quarterly 15 basis point increase in the cost of funds to 104 basis points was driven by higher deposit costs which increased 11 basis points from the third quarter to 76 basis points during the current quarter as well as the impact of a higher cost funding mix as average wholesale borrowing balances increased more than average deposits during the fourth quarter which increased the cost to fund the strong loan growth realized during the quarter the increase to the higher deposit cost lowered the net interest margin or impacted net interest margin by a negative 10 basis points and the average the mix of higher cost funding mix cost 6 basis points on the margin so basically loan yields increasing and deposit costs increasing offset each other on the margin and the entire decline in the margin for the quarter was due to the increase to the higher cost funding mix during the quarter to fund strong loan growth during the quarter the provision for loan losses for the fourth quarter was 4 8 million or 20 basis points on an annualized basis an increase of 1 7 million compared to the previous quarter the increase in the provision from the third quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by loan growth and higher levels of net charge offs in the current quarter for the fourth quarter of 2018 net charge offs were 5 million or 21 basis points on an annualized basis compared to 3 2 million or 30 basis points for the prior quarter and 2 7 million or 15 basis points for the same quarter last year for the year ended december 31 2018 net charge offs were 11 1 million or 12 basis points compared to 10 1 million or 15 basis points for the year ended 2017 non interest income increased 3 6 million to 23 5 million for the quarter from 19 9 million in the prior quarter excluding the 933 000 adjustment to reduce the shore premier gain recorded in third quarter of 2018 non interest income increased 2 7 million or 12 8 for the fourth quarter when compared to the prior quarter the increase in non interest income was primarily driven by life insurance proceeds of approximately 976 000 related to a xenith acquired loan that had been fully charged off prior to union s acquisition of xenith in addition an increase in customer related fee income of 222 000 due to higher overdraft fees and fiduciary and asset management fees increased during the quarter and an increase in interest rate swap fees of 814 000 during the quarter due to an increase in transaction volumes operating non interest expenses decreased 2 7 million or 3 6 to 72 2 million when compared to the third quarter of 2018 the decrease in operating non interest expense included a decline in marketing and advertising expenses due to timing and digital marketing expenses salaries and benefits of 698 000 primarily due to decreases in incentive plan and benefit costs professional services declined 692 000 primarily due to a decrease in consulting fees additionally operating non interest expense declined due to lower amortization of intangibles of 536 000 and a decline in branch closure cost of approximately 475 000 compared to the third quarter partially offsetting these declines was an increase in oreo and credit related expenses of 574 000 due to losses on sales of property as compared to gains recorded in the prior quarter the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 16 5 compared to 15 9 in the third quarter the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in non deductible merger expenses related to the pending access merger now turning to the balance sheet period end total assets stood at 13 8 billion at december 31 an increase of 394 million from september 30 primarily result of loan growth and increases in the investment securities portfolio during the quarter at quarter end loans held for investment were 9 7 billion an increase of 304 6 million or 12 9 on an annualized basis from september 30 on a pro forma basis as if the xenith acquisition occurred on december 31 of 2017 and also adjusted for the mid year sale of shore premier in the greensky portfolio loans held for investment increased 670 million or 7 3 in 2018 in line with our full year guidance looking forward as john noted we expect our 2019 loan growth to be relatively in line with the full year 2018 loan growth rate at december 31 total deposits stood at 10 billion an increase of 136 3 million or 5 5 on an annualized basis from september 30 while average deposits increased to 148 5 million or 6 1 annualized from the prior quarter on a pro forma basis as if the xenith acquisition occurred on december 31 2017 deposits increased 431 million or 4 5 in 2018 turning to credit quality non performing assets declined by 1 2 million to 33 7 million during the quarter or 35 basis points as a percentage of total loans and that s comprised of 27 million in non accruing loans and 6 7 million in foreclosed property balances the allowance for loan losses were relatively unchanged from september 30 at 41 million the allowance as a percentage of the total loan portfolio declined 2 basis points to 42 basis points at quarter end so to summarize our fourth quarter results demonstrate the significant earnings capacity we envisioned as a result of the union and xenith combination now that we have hit our top tier financial performance target ranges we will look to improve our performance in 2019 and hit the higher target levels we set once the strategic and financial benefits of the access combination are fully realized in 2020 as always we remain focused on leveraging the union franchise to generate sustainable profitable growth and remain committed to achieving top tier financial performance and building long term value for our shareholders with that let me turn it back over to bill cimino to open it up for questions bill cimino vice president and director of investor relations thanks rob and laura we are ready for our first caller please questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question is from catherine mealor of kbw robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer good morning catherine catherine mealor kbw analyst thanks good morning i wanted to start with the margin and see rob if you could give us your updated thoughts on your outlook for the margin and if anything has and how that looks with or without fed increases this year thanks robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer yes going forward catherine we re modeling that we won t have any fed increases during the year and the curve will remain very flat similar to where we sit today so we don t expect much improvement in the interest rate curve going forward that said as we look at core net interest margin from where we are at the end of this quarter we expect that we ll be flat to maybe down 2 basis points to 3 basis points for the year of 2019 that s on a union only basis when you bring in access it s pretty much the same story basically flat to where union ended up the year with some potential compression in the 2 basis points to 3 basis points range now on a headline nim basis union only would be down about 7 basis points because of lower accretion but with the acquisition of xenith and the impact of their accretion we re basically back to where we reported ourselves at this quarter so fairly flat on a headline line basis due to the accretion impact of access with some potential small compression bias going forward john c asbury president chief executive officer and catherine i want to reiterate something rob said earlier the increase in yield on the loan portfolio matched the increase in deposit rate paid over the quarter 13 annualized loan growth is a very strong number for us that s a seasonal high we will not be seeing that we do not expect to see that next year so we think that we have more of an opportunity to better match loan growth and deposit growth so we re not as reliant on wholesale funding which is obviously less expensive catherine mealor kbw analyst got it that make sense and then do you have the dollar amount of fair value accretion you re expecting for access national yet robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer well of course we re going to close the deal in another week or two february 1 so we ll have a final number once we get there but our current modeling and what we filed with the proxy prospectus was about 8 million to 9 million of accretion income for 2019 now remember that s nine months of accretion income as well so when you re looking at access and the impact for 2019 we won t get any income related to that until starting of february catherine mealor kbw analyst got it okay that s really helpful and then maybe one last one for me you noted in the press release you have had higher past due loans this quarter can you give us any color on that i know you also mentioned that some of those became current after year end but just any kind of commentary about what trends you re seeing there thanks john c asbury president chief executive officer yes well we were referencing 30 to 59 day past dues if you look at greater than 59 day past dues it was stable even actually down slightly we do sometimes see this phenomena we dig into this pretty hard we look at it credit by credit it s not uncommon for us to see a rise in 30 to 59 day past dues particularly at year end due to holidays and whatever i used to see the same phenomena at regions bank they were just talking about it on their quarterly earnings release the most important thing is that over half of those were cleared as of last week so you can see that that was a fairly short term phenomena also contributing to a meaningful percentage of the total you ll see a rise in owner occupied real estate 30 to 59 day past dues and that was mostly about one credit that was in the process of being restructured and was in fact technically past due as of year end but that s not due to a payment related issue it s really more due to handling it was a busy quarter for the commercial bankers and we didn t get done what we should have gotten done on time we don t see past dues as an issue at this point catherine mealor kbw analyst got it okay very helpful thank you great quarter bill cimino vice president and director of investor relations thank you catherine and laura we re ready for our next caller please operator our next question is from austin nicholas of stephens robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer hi austin john c asbury president chief executive officer hey austin austin nicholas stephens analyst hey guys good morning let me just hit back on the margin one more time i think the previous guidance at the investor day was maybe for a flat to modestly up kind of margin off the 3q levels i guess is the delta versus kind of the message today that is it really just a flatter yield curve and kind of lower expectation for rate hikes that you re not seeing the benefit of on the asset side or is there more to it than just kind of those two components john c asbury president chief executive officer yeah austin in terms of what we talked in the third quarter we were thinking that we have a steeper yield curve going into 19 as well as we had two fed fund moves modeled in our outlook for 2019 obviously we ve shifted our view of that based on what s occurred during the fourth quarter and that s pretty much what s causing just to be flat and a little more negative on the margin although marginal downward bias austin nicholas stephens analyst got it okay that s what i figured i appreciate that maybe on the fee income that was pretty strong in this quarter you noted the swap fees and kind of insurance revenue there any outlook on kind of those specific line items that saw strength maybe specifically the swap fees and how you re thinking about those going into 19 john c asbury president chief executive officer well i ll start david ring our head of commercial banking is here as well so i ll ask him for some perspective to me part of this is demonstrating the maturation of the commercial banking effort particularly an example would be those who have been out or have joined us from larger institutions have probably dealt with industry hedging for a good bit of their career i ve dealt with it personally for 20 years so it s still a relatively new product it s an efficient form of hedging clearly for the borrower so as you see us doing more transactions larger transactions more of the build out and c i that s building our base of opportunity for interest rate hedging products which are generally plain vanilla swaps and i think also the expectation that this yield curve is going to remain flat for a while suggests it s a good opportunity to go ahead and lock in rates before something unexpected happens dave ring what is your outlook for interest rate swap income david v ring executive vice president commercial banking group executive yeah we re confident that our sales teams now have a full grasp of where the opportunities are we re continuing to lend into the same asset classes that we went into in the past so our swap opportunities are not only in real estate like they have mostly been but now in revolving lines of credit so when you see that rates are flat that is the perfect time for a client to enter into a swap if it comes ph cheaper and so some may see interest rates rising and they have to enter into a swap now but our philosophy is control your costs today and that s when we re seeing our john c asbury president chief executive officer yeah correct we used to call that you don t have to pay up the yield curve so we think that the market is supporting increased interest and benefit and interest rate hedgings and the fact that we continue to build our book of commercial and that we re growing our portfolio means more opportunities and for the more sophisticated client it s a much more efficient way to hedge than frankly take on a traditional fixed rate line david v ring executive vice president commercial banking group executive we re actually seeing as many requests for quotes as we saw last quarter and we have several in the queue already for this quarter john c asbury president chief executive officer okay austin so bottom line it has legs and we re feeling pretty good about that opportunity robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah just note austin that it was very high in the fourth quarter we did have significant loan growth so it s going to be it s going to fluctuate with loan growth quarter to quarter as well austin nicholas stephens analyst got it perfect thanks guys appreciate all the help robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer thank you bill cimino vice president and director of investor relations thanks austin and laura we re ready for our next caller please operator our next question is from laurie hunsicker of compass point john c asbury president chief executive officer hi laurie laurie hunsicker compass point analyst yeah hi good morning i just wanted to go back to margin from m a just want to make sure that i m understanding it and i really appreciate the color and the schedule that you guys have laid out on page two of your press release of accretion income does not include access national and so again i guess as we re thinking about this and the accretion income is going to be very heavily phased in in the june september quarter and then obviously winding down theoretically we could see your reported margin expanding while your core margin may expanding off of current levels current 370 levels while your core margin continues to contract am i thinking about that right robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer yes laurie you re thinking about it exactly right the accretion that we re running off on the union will continue over the quarter so decline over the quarterly basis we ll get the pickup in accretion from access starting in the first quarter or so that s why you could see it potentially be on a headline nim basis be flat or bit up in the first quarter but start to decline over the remaining quarters laurie hunsicker compass point analyst got it okay and then just to quantify that obviously your accretion income just basis points ph on your 370 margin this quarter was 13 basis points so if we look fully phased into the june quarter that could theoretically be about 16 basis points 17 basis points maybe 18 basis points depending robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer which quarter you re talking about laurie laurie hunsicker compass point analyst so in other word june quarter when it s fully phased right because you re only booking part way through march so as we think about robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah you are talking more probably around 15 basis points 16 basis points laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay perfect okay perfect and then just a couple of things here on the income statement the jump in boli linked quarter was there anything non recurring in that in that 2 07 million number robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer we did get some proceeds from life insurance proceeds from that it s about a couple hundred thousand dollars in the boli line so that would be considered non recurring from that point of view laurie hunsicker compass point analyst got it okay i m sorry that was the 222 000 that you referenced or no robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer no it was laurie hunsicker compass point analyst no that was something different okay so robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer no it s about 200 000 yeah i wasn t referencing boli on that one but it was about 200 000 in the boli in the quarterly numbers laurie hunsicker compass point analyst in the boli line okay and then on the other operating income number the 2 255 million can you just take us through what was non recurring in that because i feel like i m not getting all the adjustments robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah in that number is the 976 000 we received again from life insurance proceeds but related to xenith acquired loans so if you back up that you ll be more in line with what we had in the third quarter laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay and then where does the 933 000 adjustment from shore premier show up robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer well that was in the third quarter so we were just laurie hunsicker compass point analyst that was the third ok sorry just was reading that robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer it s a you should see it on a separate line in our press release laurie hunsicker compass point analyst got it okay i just wanted to make sure and then as we think about your tax rate next year what should that look like robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah that s a complicated question but we re modeling in the 17 range it s going to fluctuate quarter to quarter depending on when we re paying merger related costs et cetera and then the impact of access so i d say on a combined basis we re probably in the 17 range or so laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay great robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer it could be a little that could be a little heavy but we ll adjust as we go forward and provide some guidance laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay great and then just two last quick questions john can you just comment in light of your raised ph targets how you all are thinking about your dividend policy here john c asbury president chief executive officer i think that from our standpoint we have not changed really anything in terms of our philosophy robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer no our payout ratio the target of payout ratio continues to be in the 35 to 40 target range laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay great and then just one last question and i appreciate your focus on the access integration as we look forward this year but can you just refresh us now that you re just about to close this where you sit on m a thoughts especially given where your stock currency is just how you re thinking about that thanks john c asbury president chief executive officer yes laurie i think that we have always said that organic performance is our first and most important objective and that s what we re focused on it s very difficult to think about m a from this juncture because we have so much work ahead of us as it relates to access access opens up a world of opportunity for us in the greater washington area so we are incredibly enthusiastic and we are laser focused on making sure that we have a successful integration and conversion and on boarding of that team and we really need to let things settle down so to speak what we did say in our investor day in november in response and anticipating the question of how do you think about m a yeah i said there are really three options for the future the most important option is do nothing we have everything we need right here right now there s no compelling reason why we must do additional m a and to your point given where the stock price is that doesn t really necessarily suggest that we would be out there looking anytime soon that does not mean that in the future we wouldn t have other thoughts or other considerations but you can ask us again later in the year but right now we are exceptionally focused on making sure that everything goes well with access and then we need to let things settle down and just make sure that everything is working as expected laurie hunsicker compass point analyst great thank you bill cimino vice president and director of investor relations thanks laurie and laura we re ready for our next caller please operator our next question is from matthew keating of barclays matthew keating barclays analyst great thank you good morning john c asbury president chief executive officer good morning matthew keating barclays analyst hi thanks so rob maybe for you around core expense growth i understand the first three quarters of this year are going to be a bit noisy with the access national closing and integration but i guess at the investor day the bank talked about 4 to 4 5 core expense growth which was inclusive of some of the additional digital expenses the bank is contemplating for this year what do you think from a core expense growth rate sort of ex access national we should be thinking about for this year thanks john c asbury president chief executive officer yeah you re pretty much right on we re finishing up our 2019 budget where we have and we re talking about a 4 little over 4 growth in the expense run rate if you just look at on a union stand alone basis obviously that will be impacted by savings we ll get from access which will decrease that rate perhaps the positive or negative growth once we fully incorporate the cost savings on them if you look at on a quarterly run rate basis but above 4 little over 4 growth is what we re assuming robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer there are always the potential that we could do some strategic investment organically in terms of adding commercial teams expanding commercial teams if we were to do that that can add greater than planned expenses but we wouldn t do it unless we were confident of the return realization period and i m not saying there s anything specifically on the board right now either john c asbury president chief executive officer yeah we ll be looking for operating leverage coming out of that matthew keating barclays analyst great and then just a quick follow up for john you mentioned in the opening commentary around the potential brand initiatives and you re not ready not signing ph yet do you think that there ll be at some point this year can you kind of time bound when we might expect additional information around that thanks john c asbury president chief executive officer coming very soon probably sooner than you think we ll be back very shortly and we re talking about months from now not next year in terms of actually making it happen the reason why we re being a bit cagey about it quite candidly is simply two fold one we re still working on our final estimates of the actual cost and two we don t want that to be a distraction as it relates to the good news which is coming with respect to access and so we envision a bit more of a big bang look for us to comment on this again as we announce the closing of the access merger and don t look for anything dramatic i said this i ll reiterate we union bank and trust has been around over a 100 years the name union was intended to represent the unification of small community banks which had come together in the 1920 s to better serve their clients so we re still a union that still resonates the problem as you know is we can t use that across the franchise and there is some degree of market confusion up in northern virginia with the other bank whose name begins with a u and that s about all i ll say so we do think we have an appropriate logical way to deal with this and we look forward to sharing information with you on that very soon and then when we do we ll come back and we ll be real clear in terms of what it costs et cetera matthew keating barclays analyst understood thanks very much bill cimino vice president and director of investor relations thanks matt and laura we ve got time for one more caller please operator our next question comes from blair brantley of brean capital john c asbury president chief executive officer hi blair blair brantley brean capital analyst hey good morning everyone john c asbury president chief executive officer good morning blair blair brantley brean capital analyst i just wanted to circle back on the loan growth side can you give us an idea from a geographic perspective where the strength came from this quarter john c asbury president chief executive officer yes david ring would you like to comment on that david v ring executive vice president commercial banking group executive primarily three markets our coastal region which is our newest growth region where we ve added a full c i team which mean all we does well and so there s greater richmond area is number two and our north region which is primarily the area around fredericksburg has done very well and then our carolina s region which is mostly a long production market also had a very good year and a strong quarter but the big three were those i just named robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer and i want to elaborate on something because dave hit on a critically important point when he says coastal he s talking about the former hampton roads bank franchise the south side of hampton roads virginia beach norfolk et cetera where we only had a very small presence prior to the xenith combination as a reminder the xenith represented the combination of legacy richmond base xenith which was principally a branch like business bank not unlike access and so they always have had a really strong c i team in richmond and in northern virginia hampton roads looked very much like a traditional community bank so what has happened as we ve used that as a platform and we have built a very capable skilled commercial and industrial banking team post xenith acquisition and we are super excited about the potential of that market this is exactly what we said we will do this is exactly what we predicted would happen and so we are very bullish on that hampton roads region david v ring executive vice president commercial banking group executive lets say that s in dollars not percentage right which we throw things that s true dollar growth robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so we think we have a lot of upside there off of a small base john c asbury president chief executive officer in the context of c i hampton roads is essentially a new market entry for us and we are doing well down there blair brantley brean capital analyst okay great thanks what s the growth this quarter can you speak to what you saw from the pay down perspective and how that maybe compares to last quarter kind of multiple speakers john c asbury president chief executive officer well it is certainly less pay downs felt relatively normalized in q4 neighboring i m looking at the data here now we certainly saw elevated pay downs earlier in the year all the reasons we ve talked about before that seemed to abate somewhat in q4 yes for sure well from april to august we saw a lot of pay downs and it started to slow down in september and in the fourth quarter it s more normalized blair brantley brean capital analyst okay great thanks and then finally just on the pricing environment any update in terms of what the competition and how that feels relative to the first half of 18 maybe john c asbury president chief executive officer we don t have to fairly react to the competition as much as we look at market data overall that we subscribe with the s p and we ve seen our pricing be at least at market or above market so we re more relationship oriented lenders bankers and we take that into consideration what s fortunate for us is we have very loyal relationships so it s not simply about price it s about the relationship and the value we re bringing to them robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer we actually have been using over the course of the year a third party well known loan pricing bench marking service on the commercial side that dave ring and i have used for probably over a decade and it was interesting what it confirmed for us is what we sensed which is that we do a pretty good job we are clearly not outrunning business on the back of having the most aggressive pricing we re in pretty good shape there on a depository side i m going to ask our relatively new president maria tedesco to comment she s been here less than four months so this isn t entirely fair we are beginning to see movement on the deposit pricing side including to some extent from the larger banks one of the things that we have always done at union is had a one size fits all pricing strategy all markets same rate on the retail side maria do you have any comments on that and frankly i have to point out it s not exactly your question but i m going to answer it we see a lot of untapped potential on the retail side of the bank how do you think about what you re seeing in terms of pricing competition and opportunity in retail maria p tedesco president well we are looking as i mentioned at our investor day that we re looking at segmenting the branch and thinking of the markets not one size fits all and so we re implementing a regional pricing model and we go through this year we re not there today but we will be there soon enough i think that will help us stay competitive but also help on our margin size and if i could just comment about retail in general my thinking hasn t changed since the investor day i am very confident with the growth potential of retail but retail needs to deliver its potential and it s not quite there yet and essentially we ve taken a multi tier approach and already implemented a number of initiatives that i think will help continue to see them realize their potential and just to name a few we have implemented an incentive program which i believe intends very good balanced performance secondly we reintroduced a service and sales coaching model which includes training again elevating the skillset of the retail bankers we ve also introduced assessment through an exhaustive assessment around branch processes because we want them and that includes

chinese tariffs slowing global economy andrew burton getty images just in time for the annual meeting of the high and the mighty at the world economic forum in davos switzerland the international monetary fund imf has issued the january update to its world economic outlook weo to say that the outlook is muted may be an understatement for the year just passed the weo has maintained its previous forecast of global growth at 3 7 but cautioned that a slowdown in the last half of the year will carry over into coming quarters with global growth for 2019 forecast at 3 5 and at 3 6 for 2020 both lower than the prior weo estimate growth in advanced economies is projected to drop from 2 3 in 2018 to 2 0 in 2019 and 1 7 in 2020 primarily due to downward revisions in the eurozone brexit remains a major concern and recent developments have done nothing to rein in uncertainty u s growth in 2018 was revised downward to 2 3 and projected to dip to 2 5 in 2019 and dip further to 1 7 in 2020 as the unwinding of fiscal stimulus continues and the federal reserve s funds rate temporarily overshoots the neutral rate of interest ironically perhaps domestic u s demand is expected to remain strong contributing to higher levels of imports and a wider u s current account deficit economic growth in developing asian countries ticks down to 6 5 in 2018 and is projected to dip to 6 3 in 2019 before recovering a bit to 6 4 in 2020 trade tensions between china and the united states coupled with continued financial tightening in china are estimated to result in 6 6 economic growth in 2018 down from 6 9 in 2017 the weo notes that worries about china s economy have and may again lead to sell offs in the financial and commodity markets that add pressure to the country s trading partners commodity exporters and other emerging markets a key risk to the global economy going forward is tension over trade the tariff war between china and the united states is currently on hold but the weo comments that the possibility of tensions resurfacing in the spring casts a shadow over global economic prospects regarding commodities the weo expects crude oil prices to remain broadly at around 55 a barrel for west texas intermediate wti for the next four to five years a slowing global economy weakens demand for crude oil and uncertainty remains tied to supply increases and u s policy on iranian oil exports inflation has been mostly restrained except in the united states where the weo notes that above trend growth continues among emerging economies lower oil prices are relaxing inflationary worries in most countries the principal risks to the global outlook are trade negotiations and financial conditions if trade issues are not resolved and more tariffs are imposed costs will rise on intermediate goods and ultimately for consumers additionally uncertainty over trade issues lowers business investment disrupts supply chains and slows productivity growth financial sentiment nosedived in the last few months of 2018 dragging equity prices down sharply the weo noted other financial issues that could derail projections for growth in 2019 and 2020 interest rate spreads on italian debt a no deal brexit and a deeper than expected slowdown in china the weo suggests that policy priorities need to focus on preventing additional deceleration and strengthening resilience to that end addressing dissatisfaction with the world s rules based trading system need to be addressed cooperatively in an effort to reduce trade costs and resolve differences without imposing tariffs on the domestic front developed nations are encouraged to emphasize policies that boost productivity raise labor force participation particularly of women and ensure adequate social insurance including for those vulnerable to structural transformation emerging economies face a wider range of problems largely because they don t have much room for error high private debt burdens along with balance sheet and bond maturity mismatches need to be sorted out fiscal policy should ensure that debt ratios remain sustainable under increasingly difficult external financial conditions targeted subsidies and recurring expenses should help preserve capital outlays needed to boost potential growth and social spending to enhance inclusion the following table offers an overview of weo global growth

to that safe harbor statement and at the end of the call we will take questions from the research analyst community and now i ll turn the call over to john john c asbury president chief executive officer thank you bill and thanks to all for joining us today union closed out our transformative 2018 year with a strong fourth quarter to start we did what we said we would do we hit every one of our top tier financial targets that we ve laid out at the beginning of the year operating return on tangible common equity was 17 18 for the quarter operating roa was 1 36 for the quarter and the operating efficiency ratio was 53 5 for the quarter as we ve been saying the fourth quarter s results provide a better view of the underlying strength and earnings potential of this uniquely valuable franchise we continue to expect further improvements to these top tier financial metrics this year and next as communicated in our investor day presentation with the addition of access we have further stepped up our financial targets as follows roa between 1 4 and 1 6 rotce between 16 and 18 and an efficiency ratio at 50 or better as was the case in 2018 with xenith we expect the first three quarters of 2019 to be noisy as we get through integration and systems conversion in may we will start to demonstrate the improved results of the company post access acquisition in q4 19 since we have a slightly different timeline for our wealth integration which will not have its systems conversion complete until early 2020 we ll not fully realize the higher levels of financial performance for that business unit until early 2020 we are pleased to have achieved higher than expected loan growth at 13 annualized for the quarter which lifts our full year loan growth back up to our original upper single digit inaudible our loan growth was a result of both increased production and lower pay downs during the quarter pipelines remain strong and we expect the full year 2019 loan growth to be in the high single digit range of 7 to 9 consistent with our 2018 full year growth this includes growth from access national bank s baseline beginning when the merger closes on february 1 for the year if you review our 2018 priorities you ll see that we either accomplished or made significant progress on every one of them i mentioned already that we hit the top tier financial metrics on a quarterly basis a significant achievement we diversified our loan portfolio and revenue streams we re especially encouraged by the results we re seeing with our commercial banking emphasis and we continue to enhance our treasury management products and delivery we added two registered investment advisors in 2018 which is helping to diversify and grow fee income the pieces of the diversification strategy are coming together and we expect to make further progress there in 2019 our average loan to deposit ratio was 96 which is relatively in line with our long term loan to deposit ratio goal of 95 while deposit growth did not match loan growth during the quarter due to seasonally high loan growth we believe pacing deposits to loans is achievable for the full year 2019 but not necessarily in every quarter we improved the efficiency of the company a task that never ends efficiency is more than just the efficiency ratio or simplifying tasks and improving processes too we continued to build our brand and defined our value proposition to make banking easier and finally we successfully integrated xenith if you look at all that we accomplished including the successful integration and conversion of xenith the second quarter strategic actions to rationalize our business lines and our announced acquisition of access national bank substantially completing the virginia franchise these are great proof points of our team s ability to execute a tightly focused acceleration strategy if we demonstrated one thing and one thing only it would be our ability to make change happen within this company we want to use this ability to strengthen the union moat around our franchise and keep the company nimble adaptable and responsive to our environment i m very proud of the union team how well it has embraced the changes we have undertaken and how rapidly our company is evolving and as we ve demonstrated all year long we were able to do all of this while improving our quarterly financial results culminating and hitting our top tier financial metrics during q4 changing a company to build sustainable long term shareholder value while improving near term operating results is not a common occurrence and it s one that we re proud of achieving this past year this is a journey without end and we ll continue to demonstrate discipline focus and intensity in executing against our 2019 strategic priorities and building out our franchise as i introduced during our first ever investor day in november we ve established a new set of priorities for 2019 the first three are unchanged from last year they are one diversify the loan portfolio and revenue streams two grow core funding and three manage the higher levels of performance new to 2019 are four strengthen our digital capabilities five make banking easier and six integrate access national corporation the webcast for the investor day is still available if you want to catch our presentations and hear the details you can find that on our investor website i would like to comment on a topic that we covered in the investor day and that s our branding issue there are a number of inefficiencies with operating multiple brands across multiple states and we intend to work toward one distinctive and unified brand across the banking franchise we have previously announced we will adopt access s wealth management brand of middleburg for our combined wealth management group post merger the union bank trust brand is more challenging it s not usable in all of our markets yet it goes back a 100 years it s who we are we want to honor its heritage retain its brand equity but ensure it s distinctive enough to work on all of our markets we do have a plan in place to accomplish this and we intend to share that plan with you in the near term but not today i will now detail some key topics from the quarter and year while trying not to duplicate too much of rob s upcoming commentary loan growth was broad based with commercial and industrial loans having the largest linked quarter percentage gain at 56 annualized that c i would become our largest loan growth category is something we ve been predicting for some time and it s a good proof point that we are executing the strategy we ve been talking about since my arrival c i line utilization during the quarter was stable while commitments grew point to point deposits grew 5 5 annualized for the quarter while average deposit growth was 6 1 as with the third quarter point to point growth in deposits is lower than the average due to late quarter declines and demand deposits resulting from normal fluctuations among commercial customers this quarterly deposit growth rate is close to our expected loan growth rate for 2019 so the delta is not that large and we have numerous deposit growth initiatives under way that we believe are capable of pacing deposit growth to loan growth as a reminder as we build out our commercial banking book expect some unevenness when comparing period ending balances given the normal fluctuations that occur among business clients our loan pipelines have reloaded and while weighted to the earlier stages of the lending process the pipelines are as full now as they were going into the fourth quarter keep in mind this is only for the union side and we remain very optimistic about the potential we have with the access national bank franchise and their very attractive markets we will continue to opportunistically build out the commercial banking effort after hiring 25 c i bankers in 2018 and as our growth in the c i and owner occupied real estate loan types evidence we are building momentum however we still do not expect the new bankers full loan production impact to be felt before mid 2019 for those not familiar with the virginia banking history i ll say again most small to mid sized businesses in the commonwealth once banked with virginia based banks just like union until they were all lost to interstate banking consolidation over the course of the 90s we believe no one is as well positioned as union to recreate that market dynamic and we are now able to go toe to toe with the largest of our competitors in the space credit quality remains strong the economy in our footprint is steady and we re not seeing any systemic changes to our credit environment while we did have a modest uptick in charge offs for the quarter from a low base in q3 they involved a variety of different credits and skewed toward consumer for the full year 2018 charge offs totaled a very benign 12 basis points down from 15 basis points in 2017 charge offs will be lumpy quarter to quarter and we currently expect full year 2019 to look about like 2017 and 18 from a credit quality perspective with charge offs incrementally increasing from the 2018 low base barring some change in the macroeconomic environment i ll also point out that quarter over quarter rise and 30 day past dues at year end were part of a seasonal trend that we sometimes see around the year end while higher than prior periods we track these credits individually and as at last week the level has normalized with more than half of those 30 to 59 day past dues at year end now current we do not see past dues as a factor at this time later stage past dues in non performing assets were stable quarter over quarter as you ve heard me say each quarter since my arrival i believe problem asset levels at union and across the industry remain below the long term trend line but at this time we still do not see any early indications of a downturn in union s portfolio level credit quality eventually it will come we just can t yet tell you exactly when except that from this vantage point we don t see it happening in 2019 turning to access we announced last tuesday that all necessary approvals have been received and we expect to close on february 1 our integration teams are working well together and are finalizing preparations for a smooth legal day one and systems conversion is slated for mid may having just completed the xenith integration this is a process we know well we remain enthusiastic about the potential of our expanded presence in this tremendous growth market in summary union achieved a great deal in 2018 hitting our financial targets and making significant progress against our six strategic priorities we have now raised the bar with higher financial goals and refreshed priorities for 2019 we re excited to have the access teams join union in another week or so and look forward to coming together to form what is irrefutably virginia s regional bank i remain highly confident in what the future holds for union and the potential we have to deliver long term sustainable performance for our customers communities teammates and shareholders i ll close with a familiar message union is a uniquely valuable franchise dense and compact in great markets with a story unlike any other in our region we have assembled the right scale the right markets and the right team to deliver high performance and a franchise that can no longer be replicated in virginia with the access national bank partnership the strong hand we re holding grows stronger still and we intend to play it i ll now turn the call over to rob to cover the financial results for the quarter robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer well thank you john and good morning everyone thanks for joining us today i d now like to take a few minutes to provide you with some details of union s financial results for the fourth quarter which illustrates the earnings potential of this franchise please note that for the most part my commentary will focus on union s fourth quarter financial results on a non gaap operating basis which excludes 2 2 million in after tax merger related costs but does include losses from discontinued operations of 192 000 related to union s exit from the mortgage origination business for clarity i will specify which metrics are on a reported versus operating basis in the fourth quarter reported net income was 44 1 million and earnings per share was 0 67 reported return on assets improved 1 29 reported return on tangible common equity increased to 16 4 and reported efficiency ratio declined to 56 2 on a non gaap operating basis which as noted excludes 2 2 million in after tax merger related costs consolidated net earnings for the fourth quarter were 46 2 million or 0 70 per share we achieved our targeted top tier financial metrics for the quarter as the company s non gaap operating return on assets was 1 36 versus the fourth quarter goal of 1 3 non gaap operating return on tangible common equity was 17 2 exceeding the top end of our targeted range of 15 to 17 and the non gaap operating efficiency ratio came in at 53 5 in line with the lower than 55 target we set as john noted in his comments we expect further improvements to these top tier financial metrics this year and next with the addition of access and as a result we have raised our financial targets the new targets are return on assets between 1 4 and 1 6 that s up from 1 3 to 1 5 return on tangible common equity between 16 and 18 again up from 15 to 17 and an efficiency ratio at 50 or below which is down from the 55 or lower previous target we expect to achieve these new targets in 2020 once we have fully integrated access and realized the strategic financial benefits of the combination now turning to the major components of the income statement tax equivalent net interest income was 111 4 million which was up 3 4 million from the third quarter due to loan growth during the quarter the third quarter s tax equivalent net interest margin was 3 7 a decline of 6 basis points from the prior quarter net accretion of purchase accounting adjustments for loans time deposits and long term debt added 13 basis points to the net interest margin in the fourth quarter which was in line with the third quarter s 13 basis point impact the decline in the tax equivalent net interest margin was principally due to a 15 basis point increase in the cost of funds partially offset by a 9 basis point increase in the yield on earning assets the quarterly net increase in earning asset yields to 4 74 was primarily driven by higher loan portfolio yields which improved by 12 basis points to 5 8 during the quarter due to the impact of increased short term interest rates on variable rate loan yields the higher loan yields translated to an increase of approximately 10 basis points on the net interest margin for the quarter the quarterly 15 basis point increase in the cost of funds to 104 basis points was driven by higher deposit costs which increased 11 basis points from the third quarter to 76 basis points during the current quarter as well as the impact of a higher cost funding mix as average wholesale borrowing balances increased more than average deposits during the fourth quarter which increased the cost to fund the strong loan growth realized during the quarter the increase to the higher deposit cost lowered the net interest margin or impacted net interest margin by a negative 10 basis points and the average the mix of higher cost funding mix cost 6 basis points on the margin so basically loan yields increasing and deposit costs increasing offset each other on the margin and the entire decline in the margin for the quarter was due to the increase to the higher cost funding mix during the quarter to fund strong loan growth during the quarter the provision for loan losses for the fourth quarter was 4 8 million or 20 basis points on an annualized basis an increase of 1 7 million compared to the previous quarter the increase in the provision from the third quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by loan growth and higher levels of net charge offs in the current quarter for the fourth quarter of 2018 net charge offs were 5 million or 21 basis points on an annualized basis compared to 3 2 million or 30 basis points for the prior quarter and 2 7 million or 15 basis points for the same quarter last year for the year ended december 31 2018 net charge offs were 11 1 million or 12 basis points compared to 10 1 million or 15 basis points for the year ended 2017 non interest income increased 3 6 million to 23 5 million for the quarter from 19 9 million in the prior quarter excluding the 933 000 adjustment to reduce the shore premier gain recorded in third quarter of 2018 non interest income increased 2 7 million or 12 8 for the fourth quarter when compared to the prior quarter the increase in non interest income was primarily driven by life insurance proceeds of approximately 976 000 related to a xenith acquired loan that had been fully charged off prior to union s acquisition of xenith in addition an increase in customer related fee income of 222 000 due to higher overdraft fees and fiduciary and asset management fees increased during the quarter and an increase in interest rate swap fees of 814 000 during the quarter due to an increase in transaction volumes operating non interest expenses decreased 2 7 million or 3 6 to 72 2 million when compared to the third quarter of 2018 the decrease in operating non interest expense included a decline in marketing and advertising expenses due to timing and digital marketing expenses salaries and benefits of 698 000 primarily due to decreases in incentive plan and benefit costs professional services declined 692 000 primarily due to a decrease in consulting fees additionally operating non interest expense declined due to lower amortization of intangibles of 536 000 and a decline in branch closure cost of approximately 475 000 compared to the third quarter partially offsetting these declines was an increase in oreo and credit related expenses of 574 000 due to losses on sales of property as compared to gains recorded in the prior quarter the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 16 5 compared to 15 9 in the third quarter the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in non deductible merger expenses related to the pending access merger now turning to the balance sheet period end total assets stood at 13 8 billion at december 31 an increase of 394 million from september 30 primarily result of loan growth and increases in the investment securities portfolio during the quarter at quarter end loans held for investment were 9 7 billion an increase of 304 6 million or 12 9 on an annualized basis from september 30 on a pro forma basis as if the xenith acquisition occurred on december 31 of 2017 and also adjusted for the mid year sale of shore premier in the greensky portfolio loans held for investment increased 670 million or 7 3 in 2018 in line with our full year guidance looking forward as john noted we expect our 2019 loan growth to be relatively in line with the full year 2018 loan growth rate at december 31 total deposits stood at 10 billion an increase of 136 3 million or 5 5 on an annualized basis from september 30 while average deposits increased to 148 5 million or 6 1 annualized from the prior quarter on a pro forma basis as if the xenith acquisition occurred on december 31 2017 deposits increased 431 million or 4 5 in 2018 turning to credit quality non performing assets declined by 1 2 million to 33 7 million during the quarter or 35 basis points as a percentage of total loans and that s comprised of 27 million in non accruing loans and 6 7 million in foreclosed property balances the allowance for loan losses were relatively unchanged from september 30 at 41 million the allowance as a percentage of the total loan portfolio declined 2 basis points to 42 basis points at quarter end so to summarize our fourth quarter results demonstrate the significant earnings capacity we envisioned as a result of the union and xenith combination now that we have hit our top tier financial performance target ranges we will look to improve our performance in 2019 and hit the higher target levels we set once the strategic and financial benefits of the access combination are fully realized in 2020 as always we remain focused on leveraging the union franchise to generate sustainable profitable growth and remain committed to achieving top tier financial performance and building long term value for our shareholders with that let me turn it back over to bill cimino to open it up for questions bill cimino vice president and director of investor relations thanks rob and laura we are ready for our first caller please questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question is from catherine mealor of kbw robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer good morning catherine catherine mealor kbw analyst thanks good morning i wanted to start with the margin and see rob if you could give us your updated thoughts on your outlook for the margin and if anything has and how that looks with or without fed increases this year thanks robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer yes going forward catherine we re modeling that we won t have any fed increases during the year and the curve will remain very flat similar to where we sit today so we don t expect much improvement in the interest rate curve going forward that said as we look at core net interest margin from where we are at the end of this quarter we expect that we ll be flat to maybe down 2 basis points to 3 basis points for the year of 2019 that s on a union only basis when you bring in access it s pretty much the same story basically flat to where union ended up the year with some potential compression in the 2 basis points to 3 basis points range now on a headline nim basis union only would be down about 7 basis points because of lower accretion but with the acquisition of xenith and the impact of their accretion we re basically back to where we reported ourselves at this quarter so fairly flat on a headline line basis due to the accretion impact of access with some potential small compression bias going forward john c asbury president chief executive officer and catherine i want to reiterate something rob said earlier the increase in yield on the loan portfolio matched the increase in deposit rate paid over the quarter 13 annualized loan growth is a very strong number for us that s a seasonal high we will not be seeing that we do not expect to see that next year so we think that we have more of an opportunity to better match loan growth and deposit growth so we re not as reliant on wholesale funding which is obviously less expensive catherine mealor kbw analyst got it that make sense and then do you have the dollar amount of fair value accretion you re expecting for access national yet robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer well of course we re going to close the deal in another week or two february 1 so we ll have a final number once we get there but our current modeling and what we filed with the proxy prospectus was about 8 million to 9 million of accretion income for 2019 now remember that s nine months of accretion income as well so when you re looking at access and the impact for 2019 we won t get any income related to that until starting of february catherine mealor kbw analyst got it okay that s really helpful and then maybe one last one for me you noted in the press release you have had higher past due loans this quarter can you give us any color on that i know you also mentioned that some of those became current after year end but just any kind of commentary about what trends you re seeing there thanks john c asbury president chief executive officer yes well we were referencing 30 to 59 day past dues if you look at greater than 59 day past dues it was stable even actually down slightly we do sometimes see this phenomena we dig into this pretty hard we look at it credit by credit it s not uncommon for us to see a rise in 30 to 59 day past dues particularly at year end due to holidays and whatever i used to see the same phenomena at regions bank they were just talking about it on their quarterly earnings release the most important thing is that over half of those were cleared as of last week so you can see that that was a fairly short term phenomena also contributing to a meaningful percentage of the total you ll see a rise in owner occupied real estate 30 to 59 day past dues and that was mostly about one credit that was in the process of being restructured and was in fact technically past due as of year end but that s not due to a payment related issue it s really more due to handling it was a busy quarter for the commercial bankers and we didn t get done what we should have gotten done on time we don t see past dues as an issue at this point catherine mealor kbw analyst got it okay very helpful thank you great quarter bill cimino vice president and director of investor relations thank you catherine and laura we re ready for our next caller please operator our next question is from austin nicholas of stephens robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer hi austin john c asbury president chief executive officer hey austin austin nicholas stephens analyst hey guys good morning let me just hit back on the margin one more time i think the previous guidance at the investor day was maybe for a flat to modestly up kind of margin off the 3q levels i guess is the delta versus kind of the message today that is it really just a flatter yield curve and kind of lower expectation for rate hikes that you re not seeing the benefit of on the asset side or is there more to it than just kind of those two components john c asbury president chief executive officer yeah austin in terms of what we talked in the third quarter we were thinking that we have a steeper yield curve going into 19 as well as we had two fed fund moves modeled in our outlook for 2019 obviously we ve shifted our view of that based on what s occurred during the fourth quarter and that s pretty much what s causing just to be flat and a little more negative on the margin although marginal downward bias austin nicholas stephens analyst got it okay that s what i figured i appreciate that maybe on the fee income that was pretty strong in this quarter you noted the swap fees and kind of insurance revenue there any outlook on kind of those specific line items that saw strength maybe specifically the swap fees and how you re thinking about those going into 19 john c asbury president chief executive officer well i ll start david ring our head of commercial banking is here as well so i ll ask him for some perspective to me part of this is demonstrating the maturation of the commercial banking effort particularly an example would be those who have been out or have joined us from larger institutions have probably dealt with industry hedging for a good bit of their career i ve dealt with it personally for 20 years so it s still a relatively new product it s an efficient form of hedging clearly for the borrower so as you see us doing more transactions larger transactions more of the build out and c i that s building our base of opportunity for interest rate hedging products which are generally plain vanilla swaps and i think also the expectation that this yield curve is going to remain flat for a while suggests it s a good opportunity to go ahead and lock in rates before something unexpected happens dave ring what is your outlook for interest rate swap income david v ring executive vice president commercial banking group executive yeah we re confident that our sales teams now have a full grasp of where the opportunities are we re continuing to lend into the same asset classes that we went into in the past so our swap opportunities are not only in real estate like they have mostly been but now in revolving lines of credit so when you see that rates are flat that is the perfect time for a client to enter into a swap if it comes ph cheaper and so some may see interest rates rising and they have to enter into a swap now but our philosophy is control your costs today and that s when we re seeing our john c asbury president chief executive officer yeah correct we used to call that you don t have to pay up the yield curve so we think that the market is supporting increased interest and benefit and interest rate hedgings and the fact that we continue to build our book of commercial and that we re growing our portfolio means more opportunities and for the more sophisticated client it s a much more efficient way to hedge than frankly take on a traditional fixed rate line david v ring executive vice president commercial banking group executive we re actually seeing as many requests for quotes as we saw last quarter and we have several in the queue already for this quarter john c asbury president chief executive officer okay austin so bottom line it has legs and we re feeling pretty good about that opportunity robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah just note austin that it was very high in the fourth quarter we did have significant loan growth so it s going to be it s going to fluctuate with loan growth quarter to quarter as well austin nicholas stephens analyst got it perfect thanks guys appreciate all the help robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer thank you bill cimino vice president and director of investor relations thanks austin and laura we re ready for our next caller please operator our next question is from laurie hunsicker of compass point john c asbury president chief executive officer hi laurie laurie hunsicker compass point analyst yeah hi good morning i just wanted to go back to margin from m a just want to make sure that i m understanding it and i really appreciate the color and the schedule that you guys have laid out on page two of your press release of accretion income does not include access national and so again i guess as we re thinking about this and the accretion income is going to be very heavily phased in in the june september quarter and then obviously winding down theoretically we could see your reported margin expanding while your core margin may expanding off of current levels current 370 levels while your core margin continues to contract am i thinking about that right robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer yes laurie you re thinking about it exactly right the accretion that we re running off on the union will continue over the quarter so decline over the quarterly basis we ll get the pickup in accretion from access starting in the first quarter or so that s why you could see it potentially be on a headline nim basis be flat or bit up in the first quarter but start to decline over the remaining quarters laurie hunsicker compass point analyst got it okay and then just to quantify that obviously your accretion income just basis points ph on your 370 margin this quarter was 13 basis points so if we look fully phased into the june quarter that could theoretically be about 16 basis points 17 basis points maybe 18 basis points depending robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer which quarter you re talking about laurie laurie hunsicker compass point analyst so in other word june quarter when it s fully phased right because you re only booking part way through march so as we think about robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah you are talking more probably around 15 basis points 16 basis points laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay perfect okay perfect and then just a couple of things here on the income statement the jump in boli linked quarter was there anything non recurring in that in that 2 07 million number robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer we did get some proceeds from life insurance proceeds from that it s about a couple hundred thousand dollars in the boli line so that would be considered non recurring from that point of view laurie hunsicker compass point analyst got it okay i m sorry that was the 222 000 that you referenced or no robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer no it was laurie hunsicker compass point analyst no that was something different okay so robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer no it s about 200 000 yeah i wasn t referencing boli on that one but it was about 200 000 in the boli in the quarterly numbers laurie hunsicker compass point analyst in the boli line okay and then on the other operating income number the 2 255 million can you just take us through what was non recurring in that because i feel like i m not getting all the adjustments robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah in that number is the 976 000 we received again from life insurance proceeds but related to xenith acquired loans so if you back up that you ll be more in line with what we had in the third quarter laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay and then where does the 933 000 adjustment from shore premier show up robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer well that was in the third quarter so we were just laurie hunsicker compass point analyst that was the third ok sorry just was reading that robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer it s a you should see it on a separate line in our press release laurie hunsicker compass point analyst got it okay i just wanted to make sure and then as we think about your tax rate next year what should that look like robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah that s a complicated question but we re modeling in the 17 range it s going to fluctuate quarter to quarter depending on when we re paying merger related costs et cetera and then the impact of access so i d say on a combined basis we re probably in the 17 range or so laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay great robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer it could be a little that could be a little heavy but we ll adjust as we go forward and provide some guidance laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay great and then just two last quick questions john can you just comment in light of your raised ph targets how you all are thinking about your dividend policy here john c asbury president chief executive officer i think that from our standpoint we have not changed really anything in terms of our philosophy robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer no our payout ratio the target of payout ratio continues to be in the 35 to 40 target range laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay great and then just one last question and i appreciate your focus on the access integration as we look forward this year but can you just refresh us now that you re just about to close this where you sit on m a thoughts especially given where your stock currency is just how you re thinking about that thanks john c asbury president chief executive officer yes laurie i think that we have always said that organic performance is our first and most important objective and that s what we re focused on it s very difficult to think about m a from this juncture because we have so much work ahead of us as it relates to access access opens up a world of opportunity for us in the greater washington area so we are incredibly enthusiastic and we are laser focused on making sure that we have a successful integration and conversion and on boarding of that team and we really need to let things settle down so to speak what we did say in our investor day in november in response and anticipating the question of how do you think about m a yeah i said there are really three options for the future the most important option is do nothing we have everything we need right here right now there s no compelling reason why we must do additional m a and to your point given where the stock price is that doesn t really necessarily suggest that we would be out there looking anytime soon that does not mean that in the future we wouldn t have other thoughts or other considerations but you can ask us again later in the year but right now we are exceptionally focused on making sure that everything goes well with access and then we need to let things settle down and just make sure that everything is working as expected laurie hunsicker compass point analyst great thank you bill cimino vice president and director of investor relations thanks laurie and laura we re ready for our next caller please operator our next question is from matthew keating of barclays matthew keating barclays analyst great thank you good morning john c asbury president chief executive officer good morning matthew keating barclays analyst hi thanks so rob maybe for you around core expense growth i understand the first three quarters of this year are going to be a bit noisy with the access national closing and integration but i guess at the investor day the bank talked about 4 to 4 5 core expense growth which was inclusive of some of the additional digital expenses the bank is contemplating for this year what do you think from a core expense growth rate sort of ex access national we should be thinking about for this year thanks john c asbury president chief executive officer yeah you re pretty much right on we re finishing up our 2019 budget where we have and we re talking about a 4 little over 4 growth in the expense run rate if you just look at on a union stand alone basis obviously that will be impacted by savings we ll get from access which will decrease that rate perhaps the positive or negative growth once we fully incorporate the cost savings on them if you look at on a quarterly run rate basis but above 4 little over 4 growth is what we re assuming robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer there are always the potential that we could do some strategic investment organically in terms of adding commercial teams expanding commercial teams if we were to do that that can add greater than planned expenses but we wouldn t do it unless we were confident of the return realization period and i m not saying there s anything specifically on the board right now either john c asbury president chief executive officer yeah we ll be looking for operating leverage coming out of that matthew keating barclays analyst great and then just a quick follow up for john you mentioned in the opening commentary around the potential brand initiatives and you re not ready not signing ph yet do you think that there ll be at some point this year can you kind of time bound when we might expect additional information around that thanks john c asbury president chief executive officer coming very soon probably sooner than you think we ll be back very shortly and we re talking about months from now not next year in terms of actually making it happen the reason why we re being a bit cagey about it quite candidly is simply two fold one we re still working on our final estimates of the actual cost and two we don t want that to be a distraction as it relates to the good news which is coming with respect to access and so we envision a bit more of a big bang look for us to comment on this again as we announce the closing of the access merger and don t look for anything dramatic i said this i ll reiterate we union bank and trust has been around over a 100 years the name union was intended to represent the unification of small community banks which had come together in the 1920 s to better serve their clients so we re still a union that still resonates the problem as you know is we can t use that across the franchise and there is some degree of market confusion up in northern virginia with the other bank whose name begins with a u and that s about all i ll say so we do think we have an appropriate logical way to deal with this and we look forward to sharing information with you on that very soon and then when we do we ll come back and we ll be real clear in terms of what it costs et cetera matthew keating barclays analyst understood thanks very much bill cimino vice president and director of investor relations thanks matt and laura we ve got time for one more caller please operator our next question comes from blair brantley of brean capital john c asbury president chief executive officer hi blair blair brantley brean capital analyst hey good morning everyone john c asbury president chief executive officer good morning blair blair brantley brean capital analyst i just wanted to circle back on the loan growth side can you give us an idea from a geographic perspective where the strength came from this quarter john c asbury president chief executive officer yes david ring would you like to comment on that david v ring executive vice president commercial banking group executive primarily three markets our coastal region which is our newest growth region where we ve added a full c i team which mean all we does well and so there s greater richmond area is number two and our north region which is primarily the area around fredericksburg has done very well and then our carolina s region which is mostly a long production market also had a very good year and a strong quarter but the big three were those i just named robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer and i want to elaborate on something because dave hit on a critically important point when he says coastal he s talking about the former hampton roads bank franchise the south side of hampton roads virginia beach norfolk et cetera where we only had a very small presence prior to the xenith combination as a reminder the xenith represented the combination of legacy richmond base xenith which was principally a branch like business bank not unlike access and so they always have had a really strong c i team in richmond and in northern virginia hampton roads looked very much like a traditional community bank so what has happened as we ve used that as a platform and we have built a very capable skilled commercial and industrial banking team post xenith acquisition and we are super excited about the potential of that market this is exactly what we said we will do this is exactly what we predicted would happen and so we are very bullish on that hampton roads region david v ring executive vice president commercial banking group executive lets say that s in dollars not percentage right which we throw things that s true dollar growth robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so we think we have a lot of upside there off of a small base john c asbury president chief executive officer in the context of c i hampton roads is essentially a new market entry for us and we are doing well down there blair brantley brean capital analyst okay great thanks what s the growth this quarter can you speak to what you saw from the pay down perspective and how that maybe compares to last quarter kind of multiple speakers john c asbury president chief executive officer well it is certainly less pay downs felt relatively normalized in q4 neighboring i m looking at the data here now we certainly saw elevated pay downs earlier in the year all the reasons we ve talked about before that seemed to abate somewhat in q4 yes for sure well from april to august we saw a lot of pay downs and it started to slow down in september and in the fourth quarter it s more normalized blair brantley brean capital analyst okay great thanks and then finally just on the pricing environment any update in terms of what the competition and how that feels relative to the first half of 18 maybe john c asbury president chief executive officer we don t have to fairly react to the competition as much as we look at market data overall that we subscribe with the s p and we ve seen our pricing be at least at market or above market so we re more relationship oriented lenders bankers and we take that into consideration what s fortunate for us is we have very loyal relationships so it s not simply about price it s about the relationship and the value we re bringing to them robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer we actually have been using over the course of the year a third party well known loan pricing bench marking service on the commercial side that dave ring and i have used for probably over a decade and it was interesting what it confirmed for us is what we sensed which is that we do a pretty good job we are clearly not outrunning business on the back of having the most aggressive pricing we re in pretty good shape there on a depository side i m going to ask our relatively new president maria tedesco to comment she s been here less than four months so this isn t entirely fair we are beginning to see movement on the deposit pricing side including to some extent from the larger banks one of the things that we have always done at union is had a one size fits all pricing strategy all markets same rate on the retail side maria do you have any comments on that and frankly i have to point out it s not exactly your question but i m going to answer it we see a lot of untapped potential on the retail side of the bank how do you think about what you re seeing in terms of pricing competition and opportunity in retail maria p tedesco president well we are looking as i mentioned at our investor day that we re looking at segmenting the branch and thinking of the markets not one size fits all and so we re implementing a regional pricing model and we go through this year we re not there today but we will be there soon enough i think that will help us stay competitive but also help on our margin size and if i could just comment about retail in general my thinking hasn t changed since the investor day i am very confident with the growth potential of retail but retail needs to deliver its potential and it s not quite there yet and essentially we ve taken a multi tier approach and already implemented a number of initiatives that i think will help continue to see them realize their potential and just to name a few we have implemented an incentive program which i believe intends very good balanced performance secondly we reintroduced a service and sales coaching model which includes training again elevating the skillset of the retail bankers we ve also introduced assessment through an exhaustive assessment around branch processes because we want them and that includes lending by the way our lending processes streamlining them not only for our teammates but certainly that makes banking easy and in addition to that obviously as you all know our digital agenda we re going to continue to execute on a digital agenda which will help again make banking easy which is our objective all of this i think will help us be more competitive and grow the retail franchise to all know as a greater percent robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer and then again as we bring greater resources to the table for access they have by necessity had a very focused intensive deposit gathering effort particularly for small business and so that model not only will continue up there we intend to import that into other markets where we think that would be useful that was your reference to branch segmentation and we ll talk more about that later on blair brantley brean capital analyst great thank you appreciate the color robert michael gorman executive vice president chief financial officer thank you bill cimino vice president and director of investor relations thanks blair and thanks everyone for dialing in today as a reminder we ll have

while global growth in 2018 remained close to postcrisis highs the global expansion is weakening and at a rate that is somewhat faster than expected this update of the world economic outlook weo projects global growth at 3 5 percent in 2019 and 3 6 percent in 2020 0 2 and 0 1 percentage point below last october s projections the downward revisions are modest however we believe the risks to more significant downward corrections are rising while financial markets in advanced economies appeared to be decoupled from trade tensions for much of 2018 the two have become intertwined more recently tightening financial conditions and escalating the risks to global growth we have revised downwards our forecasts for advanced economies slightly mainly due to downward revisions for the euro area within the euro area the significant revisions are for germany where production difficulties in the auto sector and lower external demand will weigh on growth in 2019 and for italy where sovereign and financial risks and the connections between them are adding headwinds to growth the us expansion continues but the forecast remains for a deceleration with the unwinding of fiscal stimulus across advanced economies we foresee growth to slow from 2 3 percent in 2018 to 2 percent in 2019 and 1 7 percent in 2020 this softening growth momentum has provided little lift to inflation while core inflation is close to target in the united states where growth is above trend it remains significantly below target in the euro area and japan economic activity in emerging and developing economies is also projected to tick down to 4 5 percent in 2019 with a rebound to 4 9 percent in 2020 the projection for 2019 has been lowered 0 2 percentage point from october mainly because of a large projected contraction in turkey amid policy tightening and adjustment to more restrictive external financing conditions there is also a significant downgrade to growth in mexico in 2019 20 reflecting lower private investment the projected rebound in 2020 is due to an expected recovery in argentina and turkey the outlook for emerging markets and developing economies reflects the continued headwinds from weaker capital flows following higher us policy rates and exchange rate depreciations even though they have become less extreme across emerging economies some of the pickup in inflation reversed towards the end of 2018 overall the cyclical forces that propelled broad based global growth since the second half of 2017 may be weakening somewhat faster than we expected in october trade and investment have slowed industrial production outside the united states has decelerated and purchasing managers indices have weakened flagging softening momentum while this does not mean we are staring at a major downturn it is important to take stock of the many rising risks an escalation of trade tensions and a worsening of financial conditions are key sources of risk to the outlook higher trade uncertainty will further dampen investment and disrupt global supply chains a more serious tightening of financial conditions is particularly costly given the high levels of private and public sector debt in countries china s growth slowdown could be faster than expected especially if trade tensions continue and this can trigger abrupt sell offs in financial and commodity markets as was the case in 2015 16 in europe the brexit cliffhanger continues and the costly spillovers between sovereign and financial risk in italy remain a threat in the united states a protracted us federal government shutdown poses downside risks policy priorities given this backdrop policymakers need to act now to reverse headwinds to growth and prepare for the next downturn the main policy priority is for countries to resolve cooperatively and quickly their trade disagreements and the resulting policy uncertainty rather than raising harmful barriers further and destabilizing an already slowing global economy the call of group of twenty leaders to reform the world trade organization in buenos aires must be accomplished where fiscal space is low fiscal policy needs to adjust in a growth friendly manner to ensure public debt is on a sustainable path while protecting the most vulnerable monetary policy in advanced economies should continue to normalize carefully the major central banks are keenly aware of the slowing momentum and we expect they will calibrate their next steps in line with these developments macroprudential tools should be used where financial vulnerabilities are building up across all economies measures to boost potential output growth and enhance inclusiveness are imperatives lastly given that policy space for countries is more limited than in 2008 multilateral cooperation will be even more important in the event of a sharper decline in global growth and it is essential that multilateral institutions like the imf have adequate resources to deal with the rising risks source imf
by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s home sales tumbled to their lowest level in three years in december and house price increases slowed sharply suggesting a further loss of momentum in the housing market the weak report from the national association of realtors nar on tuesday also suggested the economy was slowing a month long partial shutdown of the federal government which has delayed data from the commerce department is however making it difficult to get a good read of the economy we believe the economic outlook also took a toll on consumers and caused them to pull back from putting down payments on the most expensive purchase they will ever make in their lives said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york the nar said existing home sales declined 6 4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 99 million units last month that was the lowest level since november 2015 november s sales pace was revised slightly up to 5 33 million unit from the previously reported 5 32 million units economists polled by reuters had forecast existing home sales falling 1 0 percent to a rate of 5 25 million units in december existing home sales which make up about 90 percent of u s home sales plunged 10 3 percent from a year ago for all of 2018 sales fell 3 1 percent to 5 34 million units the weakest since 2015 the housing market has been stymied by higher mortgage rates as well as land and labor shortages which have led to tight inventory and more expensive homes but there are glimmers of hope for the sector the 30 year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to a four month low with much of the moderation occurring in the second half of december and house price inflation is slowing the median existing house price increased 2 9 percent from a year ago to 253 600 in december that was the smallest increase since february 2012 a survey last week showed a rebound in homebuilders confidence in january amid optimism over market conditions now and over the next six months as well buyer traffic stocks on wall street were trading lower amid fears of slowing global economic growth after the international monetary fund trimmed its outlook the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies and u s treasury prices rose broad weakness homebuilders are hopeful that the moderation in mortgage rates will help the housing market continue to grow at a modest clip as we enter the new year the shutdown started on dec 22 as president donald trump demanded that congress give him 5 7 billion this year to help build a wall on the country s border with mexico it has affected the commerce department leading to the suspension of the publication of data compiled by its bureau of economic analysis and census bureau including new home sales housing starts and building permits data released before the shutdown had pointed to persistent weakness in the housing market with economists estimating that housing would be again a drag on gross domestic product in the fourth quarter residential construction has subtracted from gdp growth since the first quarter of 2018 economists estimate that the impasse over the border wall was cutting off at least two tenths of a percentage point from quarterly gdp growth a week the realtors group said the longest government shutdown in the history of the united states had so far not had an impact on home sales but warned this could change last month existing home sales fell in all four regions there were 1 55 million previously owned homes on the market in december down from 1 74 million in november but up from 1 46 million a year ago at december s sales pace it would take 3 7 months to exhaust the current inventory down from 3 9 in november and up from 3 2 a year ago a six to seven months supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 46 days in december up from 42 days in november and 40 days a year ago thirty nine percent of homes sold in december were on the market for less than a month the share of first time buyers fell to 32 percent last month from 33 percent in november economists and realtors say a 40 percent share of first time buyers is needed for a robust housing market sales fell in all price segments of the market last month with steep declines at the lower end which accounts for a large portion of the housing market reporting by lucia mutikani editing by andrea ricci

did you ever notice these libertarian types never ever have a problem with overpaid ceos in america or anywhere else for that matter it s always the working class union members government employees teachers unions etc that they take aim at frequent fox guest and regular writer at right wing rags such as the national review the washington examiner and the washington times kristin tate did just that in her recent op ed for the hill this weekend attacking furloughed federal employees as a bunch of overpaid lazy impossible to fire entitled leaches living lives of luxury mooching off of you hard working taxpayers griping about how they make more than their private sector counterparts and heaven forbid have benefits like paid vacation holidays health insurance and pensions the horror she spent the first half of the column conflating federal workers with members of congress and complaining about how much they make federal employees get perks taxpayers can only dream of how many headlines have you read about the government shutdown over the last month considering that most of our lives have not really been affected and that federal employees will be receiving back pay is it possible that the shutdown is not the disaster pundits declare it to be the minimal effects on our lives shows that our government is already far too bloated and serves as a reminder that the recipients of our tax dollars enjoy benefits well beyond the average american removed from the market forces at play in the rest of the country federal employees and politicians are insulated from the effects of their own actions while getting privileges that most private sector workers can only dream of here are some of the many perks that members of congress receive they get an obamacare gold plan for health care and outpatient care which is subsidized by taxpayers congress was also exempted by the obama administration from paying taxes on their insurance plans which saves each member 12 000 a year members of congress are enrolled in the coveted federal pension which is of course a lifelong retirement benefit of up to 139 200 again funded by taxpayers the federal pension is head and shoulders better than most private pensions and even state pensions they have advantages on wall street while stock trades using legislative information is illegal lawmakers do not have to disclose their stock trades like the private sector thanks to a 2013 amendment they can also leverage their political influence to sit on corporate boards there is a reason why members of congress have historically gained much more with their stock market returns than the average household moreover members of congress get death benefits of at least 174 000 that is almost double the death benefits for troops killed in service the death benefits act as a guaranteed life insurance policy that the rest of us would have to pay into for years to receive furthermore our politicians have a schedule of just 138 work days a year on average in 2012 it was just 126 days including only one full five day week despite the part time schedule members of congress receive a 174 000 annual salary more than three times the average salary for americans who work full time congress also gets 4 million annually to spend on office supplies as well as 250 000 annually to spend on mass mailings this includes sending information to constituents about their work and is essentially a campaign contribution funded by taxpayers lawmakers enjoy free parking spaces and airline travel on most trips in 2016 alone these flights cost taxpayers about 1 5 million for 535 members of course some of the most lucrative benefits of being in congress come after leaving office as a significant portion of retired members of congress become lobbyists those who become lobbyists can earn an average of more than 2 million annually after that diatribe she finally moved onto her targets in the headline those furloughed government workers federal workers also enjoy a sweet deal here are some of their perks they make wildly above market compensation federal workers receive pay that is 17 percent higher than private sector employees on average performing comparable work that is on top of putting in 12 percent fewer hours furthermore a princeton university study found that when taking differences in employee characteristics into account federal workers actually earn 34 percent more than comparable private sector workers they receive cadillac federal employees health benefits 75 percent of which is subsidized these plans includes medical plus vision and dental benefits on top of that federal retirees are eligible for covered health benefits at 57 years old a rare luxury in the private sector they also have generous pension plans and social security benefits such payments are three times higher than private sector 401 k and social security benefits it is also worth noting that federal workers face a 0 2 percent chance of getting fired in a given year that is more than 45 times lower than their private sector counterparts in some cases it takes the effort from four different agencies to fire federal employees and the process often takes years even in simple cases this shield protects public employees who are cited for malfeasance or incompetence meanwhile a brookings institution study found that 65 percent of federal employees think job security is more important than helping the public while only 30 percent think their organization does a good job disciplining poor performers during this protracted government shutdown the media would have you believe that federal workers are eating cat food while on furlough for most of those affected by the shutdown they get most of january off with guaranteed full back pay when the government reopens when a private business is affected by a closure or new federal mandates how many of its employees get time off and full back pay washington was envisioned as a respite for public servants so both federal employees and members of congress should be saying thanks to their lucky stars for the continued beneficence of taxpayers instead of blaming each other for the shutdown so going without a paycheck maybe losing your house running up your credit cards along with all of host of horror stories we ve seen in the media about how this shutdown is affecting these people s lives is just like taking a vacation and yes government workers do make more on average than their private sector counterparts but there are reasons for that and it s not some simple cut and dry issue as eugene kelly discussed in a 2010 article for factcheck org but any compensation comparison between the average federal civilian employee and average private sector employee oversimplifies the debate glossing over the important differences in occupation skill level age and education that determine salaries the bea has posted an faq on federal pay providing a number of reasons why the average compensation for federal civilian employees is higher than the average compensation for private sector employees federal civilian workers are more educated the federal government has a higher proportion of white collar jobs lower skilled and lower paid positions have been contracted out to private industries in recent years raising the average pay of federal civilian employees federal civilian workers receive better pension and health insurance benefits on average than private sector employees some of whom receive no benefits furthermore the 123 049 average compensation figure for federal workers is greatly inflated and several thousand dollars too high the bea tells us that total compensation includes an unknown amount for retirees health and life insurance benefits more importantly it includes billions of dollars that congress appropriates each year to pay unfunded liabilities for retirees and current workers covered by the old civil service retirement system before it was replaced for newly hired workers starting jan 1 1987 these payments for former workers obviously don t benefit current workers and should not be included in their average total compensation it s also never a problem with people like tate that we have a race to the bottom going on in the private sector as pew research reported last year for most u s workers real wages have barely budged in decades on the face of it these should be heady times for american workers u s unemployment is as low as it s been in nearly two decades 3 9 as of july and the nation s private sector employers have been adding jobs for 101 straight months 19 5 million since the great recession related cuts finally abated in early 2010 and 1 5 million just since the beginning of the year but despite the strong labor market wage growth has lagged economists expectations in fact despite some ups and downs over the past several decades today s real average wage that is the wage after accounting for inflation has about the same purchasing power it did 40 years ago and what wage gains there have been have mostly flowed to the highest paid tier of workers and as yahoo finance reported last august ceos now make 312 times more then typical workers the top executives of the biggest companies in the u s make about 312 times more than their workers according to a new report by the economic policy institute epi that estimate is up from 270 times in 2016 looking at ceo compensation across 350 publicly held companies co authors larry mishel and jessica schneider found that the average ceo in 2017 received 18 9 million in compensation the ratio reflects the different worlds of ceos and their workers mishel told yahoo finance profits rose a ton but ceo compensation rose a lot more but in libertarian land the real problem is that those government moochers are overpaid not that those in the private sector are underpaid it s always a race to the bottom with these people divide and conquer pit one class of working people against another and laugh all the way to the bank while they fight among themselves
this paper was originally written for the carter center s symposium on the 40th anniversary of the establishment of u s china diplomatic relations the u s china relationship is confronting its most daunting challenge in the forty years since the two countries established diplomatic ties current trends portend steadily worsening relations over the long term with increasingly adverse consequences for all actors involved specifically beijing and washington are transitioning from a sometimes contentious yet mutually beneficial relationship to an increasingly antagonistic mutually destructive set of interactions the often positive and optimistic forces interests and beliefs that sustained bilateral ties for decades are giving way to undue pessimism hostility and a zero sum mindset in almost every area of engagement both sides bear responsibility for this pervasive deterioration but at present the united states under president donald trump is unquestionably contributing most publicly to it primarily through its ill considered rhetorical and other overreactions to perceived chinese misbehavior while nothing about this degenerating relationship is inevitable despite the uninformed alarmist predictions of doomsayers on both sides the threat of an even more precipitous and dangerous decline in the relationship is very real and demands serious corrective measures to avert a potential catastrophe michael d swaine swaine was a senior fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace and one of the most prominent american analysts in chinese security studies more dalzell60 to understand how we have reached this point and how to put the sino american relationship on a more positive path analysts first need to dispel the simplistic and largely negative misconceptions about the past that predominate today especially in the united states next observers need to grasp the highly adverse structural and attitudinal trends driving the current negative dynamic the serious dangers these trends pose for both countries and the world including the possibility of a new cold war and the high stakes involved in correcting or mitigating them from that vantage point policymakers may better discern which actions each side must take to stabilize and strengthen the relationship for their mutual benefit forty years of benefits and challenges since january 1979 the u s china relationship has witnessed enormous levels of both positive and negative change yet most often these changes have been beneficial on the positive side the two nations have developed a mutually productive array of ties and interactions in a growing multitude of areas from trade and investment to social and cultural exchanges as well as common initiatives for dealing with global threats such as climate change wmd proliferation and pandemics in the process china has become vastly more integrated with the rest of the international community more observant of international laws norms and procedures and more open to a much greater level of social economic and political influence than ever obtained prior to 1979 for serious students of the history of u s china relations before and after normalization there is simply no question that despite recent setbacks in some areas discussed below beijing has made enormous strides largely as a result of its opening to the outside and its adoption of market based economic development these advances have introduced greatly increased standards of living improved social infrastructure wider freedom to travel and express a variety of views and more openness to foreign influences of all sorts at many intervals along the way understandings between washington and beijing in particular have provided a major impetus for such chinese gains today within the washington policy community and the trump administration one often hears the mistaken assertion that china s progress over the last forty years has come at america s expense on the contrary these advances have tangibly benefitted the united states and many other countries china s reform driven development has contributed substantially to overall global growth most notably during recessions like the 2008 2010 downturn when the u s economy was in dire straits u s traders and investors who engage with china have made significant profits for their shareholders in the united states and elsewhere until the trump administration made the destructive decision to withdraw from the paris climate accord beijing and washington had cooperated to pursue benefits not only for themselves but for the world in curbing climate change moreover even though beijing has certainly stolen u s technology in various areas chinese investments in and technical exchanges with the united states contributed greatly to the development of cutting edge technologies in silicon valley and beyond and still do americans have also obtained economically priced and increasingly well made products designed assembled or manufactured in china and beijing has over the years provided critical diplomatic and political assistance albeit not always as much as washington has desired in addressing such global problems such as terrorism wmd proliferation humanitarian assistance disaster relief and pandemics finally for nearly two decades prior to 1989 the united states benefitted from close military and security cooperation with beijing directed at their common adversary the soviet union this strategic alignment directed at moscow was one of the main reasons for establishing u s china diplomatic relations along with washington s desire to fully integrate beijing into the international community and tap into the country s enormous potential market and despite today s oft heard refrain u s engagement with beijing was never predicated on the expectation that it would inevitably produce a politically democratic china at most some u s leaders hoped for but did not require greater levels of largely undefined liberalization in many spheres none of the above positive outcomes for the united states and the world would have occurred if washington had clung to the adversarial posture toward beijing that began with the establishment of the people s republic of china in 1949 and continued for the ensuing two decades nor would they have occurred if the united states had limited its diplomatic opening in the 1970s and 1980s to a few narrow areas of military cooperation and assistance on the negative side a number of challenges and setbacks have also accompanied the many advances since the two sides established full diplomatic relations in 1979 beijing and washington have differed significantly over the handling of many critical issues in ways that often reflected their differing political systems the legacy of hostility and conflict resulting from the korean war and the cold war and their contrasting political and social cultures and beliefs these policy divergences included the handling of volatile disputes over regional sovereignty and security issues such as taiwan controversial maritime claims along china s periphery and the korean peninsula they have extended as well to disputes over reciprocity and fairness in trade and investment cyber and other forms of espionage human rights practices within and beyond china and other international laws and global norms many of these differences have existed since 1949 others emerged or gained greater currency as normalization unfolded and still others came about only after china s development and impact on asia and the world reached massive proportions in the early 2000s for the most part however until recent years these differences while generating significant temporary downturns in the relationship usually following disruptive or unexpected actions such as the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 did not fundamentally alter the underlying strategic economic and political interests of both countries in maintaining workable and productive relations in fact by the advent of the twenty first century it had become clear that in addition to the above long standing bases for a strong u s china relationship a range of new or greatly increased largely international challenges and opportunities had emerged to reinforce both countries interest in preserving cooperative relations these included unprecedented levels of interdependence among the u s china and many other states resulting from the accelerated globalization of economic technological and social exchanges and the equally unprecedented emergence of nontraditional threats such as climate change environmental degradation global pandemics terrorism and transnational crime it became increasingly clear that the united states and china could not effectively deal with such deeply rooted problems on their own or even bilaterally successful management would require truly international forms of cooperation guided largely by those nations with the most wealth resources capabilities and intellectual capital namely the west led by the united states and both china and japan challenges become hostilities the impact of chinese repression american hyper nationalism and a shifting power balance unfortunately the positive momentum in the relationship has not lasted while new challenges and opportunities initially served to justify and compel greater u s china cooperation in the first decade of the new century three other major unprecedented negative sets of trends both domestic and international also appeared around the same time these trends greatly aggravated the differences between the united states and china and eventually overshadowed the many positive factors at work in the relationship the first trend emerged in the 1990s and 2000s and produced two serious negative outcomes severe damage to beijing s reputation in the west which undermined expectations of china s continued reform and opening and a deepening of chinese suspicions of the united states and other democracies these developments stemmed from beijing s response to three major challenges to ccp rule the collapse of communist and authoritarian states caused in part by the explosion of rapid internet based forms of communication with freer societies the emergence of unprecedented levels of corruption and socioeconomic disorder in china in the 2000s largely as a result of decades of market led rapid economic growth and the failure to develop an effective legal system and more dangerous forms of domestic terrorism and unrest occurring primarily in the ethnic minority areas of tibet and xinjiang this triple threat to ccp rule greatly heightened the insecurities of china s leaders prompting efforts to purge the party ranks strengthen overall party controls throughout chinese society and increase the economic role of the state those changes began during the jiang zemin and hu jintao eras but have intensified greatly under xi jinping most recently such perceived threats to the party s leadership have caused xi to build up his personal position within the party thus undermining the gradual evolution of the chinese political system toward a more predictable collective and institutionalized pattern of rule as a result of beijing s actions china s image among democratic states already damaged by the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 declined much further as did western confidence in china s commitment to pursue continued growth through greater opening marketization and support for the rule of law to compound this blow to the relationship chinese leaders have become more deeply suspicious of western and especially u s views and policies toward china indeed by the mid 1990s the ccp leadership concluded that washington and other democratic nations had contributed decisively to the collapse or weakening of one party systems elsewhere and might be seeking similar ends for the prc regime such fears and suspicions were magnified by the long standing deeply rooted sense of resentment toward the west many chinese feel as a result of china s so called century of humiliation a second set of highly negative trends that emerged in the 2000s involved domestic developments in the u s and the west adding more suspicions on both sides while also emboldening china s leaders in potentially dangerous ways specifically the 2008 global recession the deepening polarization of american society and the resulting near paralysis of the u s political system in dealing with critical domestic issues such as ballooning health care and entitlement costs and huge government deficits created two negative consequences for the u s china relationship one is that many chinese leaders somewhat tentatively concluded that the united states had likely entered a period of systemic decline in which america s ability to challenge or contain china s rise would drop significantly and the american model of pluralist democracy and market led economic growth would gradually lose its lustre this dual perception has strengthened the outlook of those within the chinese leadership including xi who support a more confident use of china s growing economic and military capabilities to push back against washington s supposed containment efforts and more vigorously defend or advance beijing s expanding interests overseas this approach has largely eclipsed the long standing emphasis of the deng xiaoping era on maintaining a relatively low international profile it has given greater license to those within china who prefer to give vent more vigorously to long held resentments against the west or against so called hostile western forces usually referring to the united states even more worrisome in the united states and other western countries worsening domestic economic and social problems exacerbated by the unprecedented surge of both legal and illegal non white immigrants into europe and the united states that began in the 2010s have led to the emergence of chauvinistic forms of nationalism hostile to china and other countries according to the line of thinking currently so prominent in american politics the globalization of economic and social systems most acutely manifested by beijing s conspicuous economic impact on americans daily lives lies at the root of growing domestic economic inequality job losses social injustice weakened national sovereignty and threatened cultural identity in the united states such hyper nationalism is reflected most distinctively in the extremist views of president trump he has criticized u s politicians and global corporations for selling out u s workers and the national interest in general by their support for unfair multilateral trade agreements and by moving manufacturing facilities to foreign countries most notably for u s china relations trump and his supporters have singled out china for special denunciation when they blast a range of other countries as economic predators or cheaters that aim to enrich themselves at america s expense a third major factor contributing to the overwhelming negative dynamics emerging in u s china relations is china s very rapid growth which has passed certain key thresholds over the last eighteen years china has become the largest trading power in the world surpassed the japanese economy to become the second largest economic power overall become a major source of innovation in key high tech sectors accumulated massive foreign exchange reserves and transformed its military from a defense oriented force focused mainly on the homeland and taiwan to a more expansive sophisticated force capable of operating at significant distances from china while contributing to global growth and the rise of living standards in many countries the systemic changes arising from these developments have enhanced chinese confidence abroad while greatly stoking american fears by some measures china is now poised to equal america s military footprint in the western pacific which would effectively end seventy years of u s maritime dominance in that critical region in addition beijing is using its economic resources to create what it hopes will become a vast network of interlinked economic structures and relationships extending from china to europe and africa via both land and maritime routes the so called belt and road initiative bri it is also supporting or leading a variety of other multilateral and bilateral economic and security initiatives such as new investment banks asian economic associations and strategic partnerships with u s friends and adversaries alike that could significantly shape the contours of the international system in new directions further as mentioned above china is more assertively advancing by economic political and military means its claims to disputed areas along its maritime periphery from northeast to southeast asia thus alarming many nearby states chinese confidence and assertiveness has increased but certain more pessimistic chinese sentiments have surfaced as well providing more fuel for the fears of american hyper nationalists in recent years slowing growth and rising wages have intensified worries among chinese economic policy specialists about the so called middle income trap this has produced a policy consensus regarding the urgency of transforming china s economy from a labor intensive to a more competitive innovation driven economic model that in turn seems to underlie china s present very conspicuous efforts to propel china into the top ranks of high tech nations at the fastest possible pace by fair means or foul for instance while spending billions of dollars on legitimate research and development some chinese entities now also engage in unprecedented levels of cyber espionage physical theft coercive contract arrangements and other underhanded efforts to obtain cutting edge technologies while certainly not justifying the blanket label of economic predator applied by the trumpists see below these activities along with perceived unfair protections of chinese domestic industries have significantly aggravated relations with more developed rule of law based nations such as the united states of particular note they have contributed greatly to the general souring of attitudes toward the china market evident among many u s businesses thus weakening a major historical pillar of strong u s china relations a relationship adrift and taking on water as a result of all the negative changes outlined above the common and in some areas growing strategic logic economic incentives and societal ties that long anchored the u s china relationship in the past are today rapidly disintegrating under a tidal wave of growing mutual suspicion faulty interpretations worst case assumptions about motives and zero sum policy calculations although this is happening in both washington and beijing it is at this time particularly evident in the united states american policy under trump has turned its back on the shared chinese and american interest in combating common transnational threats such as climate change and has withdrawn from or undermined potential mechanisms such as the trans pacific partnership and a revised world trade organization agreement for more effectively managing bilateral and multilateral economic problems instead the trump administration has adopted crude sledgehammer like economic policies centered on the imposition of legally questionable tariffs to force beijing to submit to fully open its markets and eliminate state involvement in the chinese economy even more ominously trump administration strategy statements like the 2017 u s national security strategy the 2018 summary of the national defense strategy and the so called u s free and open indo pacific strategy explicitly label china as a fundamental existential threat to western interests these statements allege that beijing is plotting to build a revisionist sino centric world order fundamentally incompatible with the u s led liberal international system to support this distorted viewpoint and justify its draconian actions u s officials with the implicit endorsement of too much of the overly accepting american media now depict beijing as a proponent of debt trap diplomacy involving the use of loans to subjugate developing states as a vigorous practitioner of destructive predatory trade and investment practices toward the united states and others and as a nation aiming to dominate asia and eventually the world by a combination of economic and military means in truth these accusations grossly inflate and oversell genuine american and western concerns rooted in observable facts for example while several recipients of chinese infrastructure and development loans face serious repayment problems often due to reckless and inexperienced practices on both sides there is no conclusive evidence that china is intentionally seeking to drive countries into debt problems to gain control over their assets policies etc proponents of the debt trap diplomacy argument generally base their conclusion on a single case hambantota port in sri lanka while ignoring the other tools china uses to deal with bilateral debt problems and even in that case there is no publicly available information indicating that when the export import bank of china made its first loan to sri lanka to support this project the ultimate purpose was to help china gain a concession to develop and operate the port similarly the charge that beijing is a predatory and mercantilistic economic power places a simplistic distorting label on a much more complex reality yes china s government excessively supports many industries steals technology and limits access to many domestic markets these are problems that although by no means unique to china need addressing forthrightly yet they should not obscure the fact that china is absolutely not a non market economic power the core of its economy remains driven by a huge number of privately owned market driven small and medium sized enterprises and the majority of its exports are produced or assembled by foreign corporations or joint chinese foreign ventures moreover if china were a purely predatory economic power it would not be the largest single contributor to global growth since 2008 according to the world bank thirdly despite constant repetition by officials and pundits alike there is no substantive evidence that beijing is pursuing a deliberate strategy to dominate asia and the world militarily and overturn the existing global order beijing is certainly acquiring military capabilities that undermine america s long standing predominance in that realm most notably and almost exclusively in the western pacific and it at times uses its military and para military power to intimidate other claimants to disputed maritime territories in the east and south china seas yet the former behavior is a perhaps understandable response to beijing s desire to reduce the continued vulnerability of its growing domestic and foreign assets to america s still dominant power not proof of a belligerent intent to take over the region although this could change if the current rivalry deepens greatly the latter behavior is certainly very troubling but speaks to the need for a binding code of conduct that prohibits such actions along with limits on specific types of militarization in sensitive areas beijing has shown no signs that it would reject either development to the contrary it has professed some support for them and should be pressed more to back up its words with concrete actions the u s should do the same finally the idea that china wants to overturn the global order is perhaps the most distorted accusation of all beijing has benefitted enormously from the post wwii economic order it also has taken advantage of that order in at times unacceptable ways and seeks to modify it to better reflect its growing influence this suggests the need to adapt existing institutions such as the wto and imf to more reasonably reflect china s expanding global impact while providing clearer more comprehensive and enforceable rules of behavior acceptable to all powers beijing is certainly not a proponent of pluralist liberal democracy and in that sense does not support regional or global norms or practices designed to expand such systems internationally but it is far from clear that the continued expansion of democratic systems is essential to the maintenance of the global order indeed in addition to supporting to varying degrees the major economic pillars of that order as noted above china in fact supports many others including wmd non proliferation agreements efforts to protect against nontraditional security threats such as terrorism pandemics climate change and international crime and many tenants of the un charter e g regarding the restrictive use of force to resolve inter state disputes this is hardly evidence of a desire to replace the existing order with a largely undefined revisionist order as washington now alleges lacking conclusive evidence for the overblown categorical condemnations they tend to fashion the trump administration its supporters and some individual scholars or analysts seek to buttress their accusations with arm waving references to the general history of rising powers realpolitik theories of anarchic struggle among power maximizing states or assumptions about foreign policy behavior based almost solely on a state s political system ignoring the obvious benefits accruing from the balanced u s china policy of the past the trump administration many republican and democratic members of congress and some china experts have endorsed a new highly distorted narrative of a failed american policy of concession weakness and dashed expectations that has allegedly permitted beijing to undermine u s interests at almost every turn although u s policymakers have certainly made mistakes over the past forty years as indicated above the history of u s china relations since diplomatic normalization belies this distorted viewpoint china and the united states have not always agreed and they have sometimes sharply diverged but they have nevertheless managed to work together to strengthen the regional and global economy during difficult times apply pressure on aspiring nuclear weapons states such as iran and north korea and deal with a growing variety of transnational threats the idea of a failed u s policy line provides a simple seductive story for posturing politicians ambitious former officials and iconoclastic trumpists looking for ways to blame america s ills on both the incompetence of past administrations and of course the treacherous chinese while current u s policies are most at fault for driving the current downward spiral in u s china relations beijing is far from blameless as suggested above in recent years and especially under xi chinese propaganda has become more hostile toward supposed foreign threats to domestic stability and prosperity chinese officials at many levels are now more assertive in cautioning the public about interactions with foreigners in addition the overall expansion of intrusive chinese government surveillance within china is extending to foreign business leaders ngo staff and students and beijing is now resorting to truly outrageous attempts to control domestic unrest in ethnic minority areas by placing hundreds of thousands of its own citizens in so called reeducation and training camps in violation of chinese laws and processes all of these actions contribute to the growing climate of suspicion and hostility in the relationship the chinese government only worsens this situation by denying the legitimacy of virtually all criticisms of its behavior while mouthing simplistic self serving slogans and platitudes such as repeated references to china s peaceful intentions its purely defense oriented security strategy and its commitment to win win outcomes with all nations such propagandistic emanations simply heighten u s suspicions and hyperbole and undercut the arguments of those seeking a more fact based pragmatic relationship in sum the u s china relationship is now not merely adrift without a strong anchor it is taking on water worse yet some on board seem to be arguing that it should be allowed to sink looking to the future the possibility of more serious crises and a destructive new cold war amid this dangerous downward spiral both beijing and washington have fewer incentives to undertake meaningful confidence building measures much less seek out areas of mutual accommodation and restraint on the contrary this state of affairs inclines both sides to rely more heavily on military and other coercive means to signal the firmness of their resolve it heightens sensitivities to perceived challenges both real and imagined thereby increasing the possibility of truly dangerous crises even over relatively minor disputes the danger of such crises is most evident in the western pacific where china s growing military and economic strength and the presence of several volatile points of contention between the two powers from korea and taiwan to the south china sea could result in otherwise avoidable miscalculations as each side seeks to push back against perceived tests of its determination indeed in the absence of serious and sustained efforts to moderate this current ugly dynamic the chances of a significant political military crisis in the not too distant future are increasing this could take many forms beijing could decide that what it regards as aggressive u s containment and pushback efforts justify unprecedented displays of chinese determination in the form for example of the permanent deployment of military forces on its artificial islands in the south china sea and the declaration of a corresponding air defense identification zone adiz for its part washington could decide that it needs to augment radically its deterrence capacities regarding taiwan by allowing u s warships to visit the island on a regular basis worse it could take steps to block improvements in cross strait relations so as to ensure that a now strategically valuable taiwan remains separate from mainland china this would be a direct violation of washington s long standing one china policy that has ensured peace with beijing for forty years for some misguided proponents of a supposedly more realistic adversarial relationship such crises would presumably serve a positive function by strengthening public and elite determination to push back against the other side in the u s such individuals seem to believe that only the threat or actual implementation of a complete disengagement and containment effort against beijing can generate the resources and strength of will necessary to prevent china from dominating the west and destroying the global order some advocates of this reckless and ill conceived approach insist that its positive results will prevent the emergence of a new cold war environment by forcing beijing to submit to u s demands in truth such an approach would almost inevitably produce a new cold war especially if u s russia relations continue to worsen and sino russian relations continue to improve and such an environment would prove far more destructive than beneficial for all nations concerned that is largely because u s and chinese interests today are more compatible and the fortunes of the two protagonists and the world more intertwined than was ever the case during the original cold war unlike present day beijing and washington cold war era russia and the united states were largely separated from one another economically culturally and socially few russians lived and worked abroad and few foreigners beyond those from the eastern bloc worked and lived in russia moreover economic exchange between the united states and the soviet union was minimal few countries relied heavily on russia for prosperity and stability unlike moscow then beijing today exerts major and deepening influence on countries both in asia and around the globe its economic and technological advances are heavily intertwined with many nations in the west and beyond and its military poses an increasingly credible challenge to u s military predominance in asia as noted above the huge potential risks and dangers inherent in the current situation are compounded by the fact that the united states is more insecure less confident more internally divided and more dependent on the world now than it was during the height of the cold war as a result in a new cold war a stronger china would be more likely to overestimate its ability to outmaneuver and pressure the united states by the same token a more insecure yet still very strong washington could prove more susceptible to overreaction than it was in the face of soviet cold war threats taken together these factors indicate that efforts by either or both sides to isolate or undermine the other in the spirit of the cold war of the 1950s and early 1960s will produce major dangers for both countries and other nations for that reason many other capitals would resist attempts by washington or beijing to compel them to choose sides in a zero sum struggle for dominance the resulting disruption would severely undermine the world economy cripple global and regional cooperation on many issues and impel some nations to devote more resources to military defense instead of economic development the net result of all this would be the increased likelihood of instability and crisis within nations within regions and ultimately across the globe the path back to a more realistic productive relationship given the above there is little doubt that the u s china relationship will be more contentious and intensely competitive for the foreseeable future than it has been at any time over the past forty years regardless of who leads either country that said more intensely competitive interactions do not necessarily mean a sharply confrontational zero sum relationship of the kind now favored by the trump administration and likely advocated by some in china there is an alternative to the emergence of what would amount to a new extremely destructive cold war the challenge for both sides is to develop a bilateral relationship that more realistically addresses the genuine as opposed to imaginary or exaggerated concerns of the other side while recognizing the very real common reasons to cooperate effectively where needed despite the current downward spiral incentives exist in washington beijing and other capitals to fashion what amounts to a middle path that rejects the self destructive worst case assumptions increasingly evident today along with the unrealistic belief that the relationship can somehow return to the more easily managed cooperative and competitive dynamics of the past finding this middle path requires first serious efforts to put a floor under the current near free fall in relations by minimizing the chances of highly escalatory crises occurring over inadvertent incidents or volatile issues especially in asia this is particularly important given the increasing likelihood of such crises as i have indicated above hence more substantive confidence building and crisis management measures are urgently needed track one and track two discussions have produced some notable successes in this area in recent years but such exchanges have often focused too narrowly on the prevention or successful handling of purely military incidents or accidents especially in the track one arena these undertakings largely ignore or omit the larger and arguably more relevant civilian and civil military political and structural decision making context within which each nation s militaries operate this larger context would be as critical a factor in determining the evolution and outcome of a future serious u s china crisis as would purely military to military interactions the problematic features of the broader decision making context of u s china relations that need to be addressed in a frank and open crisis management dialogue include among other things a destabilizing civilian and military leadership assumptions about the requirements for successful crisis stability and crisis deterrence such as the need to seize the initiative early in a crisis b the use of misleading or vague forms of crisis signaling at all levels c confusion or ignorance in each country with regard to the other side s civil military decision making processes and d misconceptions about the level of control exercised by the other side over an allied third party these critical features have been examined in track two discussions but have apparently not been seriously explored on an official or semi official basis the growing levels of distrust and uncertainty in the relationship make it all the more imperative for the two countries to deal directly with these concerns a first step in this direction should be the formation of a senior level u s china civil military dialogue on crisis avoidance and crisis management using input from relevant track two activities but for such a dialogue to occur both sides will need to step back from the current use of simplistic demonizing slogans and self serving platitudes to characterize the relationship instead they must internalize the reality that under current conditions a serious political military crisis between the united states and china has the potential to escalate to a major military conflagration given this stark fact each side must recognize that the other is not necessarily interested in provoking and manipulating a crisis to achieve a decisive advantage in the relationship and that any effort to do so would likely result in disaster that recognition is essential for the initial good faith effort required to engage in a frank discussion of the potentialities of crisis mismanagement on either side beyond the development of leadership crisis management understandings and skills a serious and sustained senior level crisis management dialogue if undertaken with relatively open minds could also have much broader positive consequences by increasing overall levels of understanding and perhaps even trust between chinese and american leaders such changes in perception would have positive implications for u s china interactions not only in those areas most directly associated with political military crises but in many other areas as well indeed the development of more effective crisis management and confidence building measures could promote efforts to deal more frankly with the major issues of serious contention in the relationship including trade and investment tensions technology development issues military deployments and intentions the threats posed by domestic influence campaigns and even human rights disputes in each of these policy areas greater trust and understanding could facilitate less politicized efforts to discern the actual nature and extent of the differences between the two sides and the possible dimensions of any achievable middle ground understanding this would involve a willingness to seek truth from facts and equally important an acknowledgement that the criticisms of the other side while in many cases greatly exaggerated have some basis in truth a good first step toward a more honest pragmatic description of u s concerns and desires regarding china in the economic arena was recently provided by former senior state department official robert zoellick in a set of remarks given in beijing after describing a range of u s concerns in a nonconfrontational manner he urged his chinese audience not to assume a defensive posture rely on economic autarky or maneuver on a purely tactical level vis à vis the united states 1 the same advice could also be given to u s officials while a serious crisis management dialogue and frank constructive efforts to identify the possible middle ground on specific policy areas of contention can go a long way to placing the u s china relationship on less volatile and more productive footing a more fundamental course correction is necessary for the long term the u s china relationship needs to develop a new strategic narrative one based on a realistic and feasible set of facts and assumptions about the changing capabilities actions and intentions on both sides this is particularly needed in the asia pacific where the sources of serious conflict are most present as i have written in creating a stable asia an agenda for a u s china balance of power beijing and washington must eventually recognize that neither power will dominate this vital region in the future the near inevitable balance of power that will most likely emerge instead must be made stable to avoid the most serious outcomes discussed in this essay 2 this can only happen on the basis of a common appreciation of the huge benefits that will accrue to both countries from a the cultivation of a single integrated asian economic system rather than a set of mutually exclusive and competing sub systems b effective crisis avoidance and management mechanisms and understandings regarding the region s most volatile hotspots and c a more defense oriented less escalatory set of common force postures and military doctrines the strategic logic of such a stable mutually beneficial balance of power will derive from the two nations common need to continue receiving the obvious rewards the increasingly vital region offers a steadily worsening relationship would inevitably put these benefits at risk building some level of trust and understanding between beijing and washington through a serious crisis management dialogue follow on policy discussions and ultimately a new strategic narrative seems inconceivable under current conditions it is possible even likely that leadership on both sides will need to change for real progress to occur but the u s china relationship has become too large too interdependent and too vital to global political and economic stability for the two countries to lapse into a truly hostile relationship the enormity of the potential consequences arising from avoidable errors reflects the reality today the sino american relationship cannot and must not be allowed to rest on the kind of adversarial zero sum views we currently confront a more stable asia much less a more stable overall sino u s relationship will not develop overnight this transformation can only take place over a period of years under the direction of experienced diplomats business leaders and military officers who possess a strong sense of the high stakes involved and a clear understanding of the dangers of allowing the corrosive status quo to continue the result will not be a return to the past model of relations but rather a set of interactions that is more competitive more equally balanced and yet still in many ways cooperative and mutually beneficial although undoubtedly more challenging to maintain than in the past it is essential that both sides embrace and work together to bring about this more stable set of interactions that is the only way to help ensure that the next forty years of the u s china relationship are as mutually beneficial and conflict free despite the many challenges encountered as the previous forty years have been this article was originally written for the carter center s symposium on the 40th anniversary of the establishment of u s china diplomatic relations
the monetary policy committee mpc of the central bank of nigeria cbn has on tuesday maintained benchmark interest rate otherwise known as monetary policy rate mpr at 14 per cent for 30 months in a bid to tackle accelerating inflation rate in the country addressing journalists in abuja at the end of the 265th meeting of the mpc godwin emefiele the central bank governor said all the 11 members were present at the meeting voted unanimously for retention the mpr which was last changed in july 2016 the cash reserves ratio crr also remained unchanged at 22 5 per cent liquidity at 30 per cent and asymmetric corridor at 200 and 500 basis points around the mpr emefiele noted that concerns were raised on the impact of the continued trade tensions between the united states of america and china as well as the brexit situation in europe on the domestic risk to growth he mentioned the persistent security challenge in the northeast the herdsmen attack in other regions and perceived political risk due to the upcoming general elections in light of the concerned risk confronting the economy including the global and domestic inflationary measure which has intensified the risk of currency depreciation the mpc was of the view that a loosening option was very remote the mpc also felt that tightening will result in the loss of the gains so far achieved noting that it may drive the banks to reprise assets thus increasing the cost of credit as well as elevating credit risk in the economy it will also worsen non performing loans in the banks the committee also felt that tightening will dampen investment and hamper improvement in output growth given the already fragile growth performance so far achieved in light of the above factors the committee decided by a vote of all eleven members to keep the policy parameters unchanged from their current levels he said on the overall outlook and risks the cbn governor said forecasts of key macroeconomic variables indicate a positive outlook for the economy in 2019 he said that while the imf had forecasted that the country s gdp would grow by two per cent the world bank by 2 2 per cent the cbn was of the view that the country would grow by at least 2 28 per cent committee noted the relative stability at both the bureau de change and investors and exporter s window of the foreign exchange market supported by the bank s exchange rate market policies it was observed with satisfaction the contribution to stability in the market and positive implication of the currency swap agreement with china and the inflow of the 2 8 billion dollars euro bond the committee also noted the marginal increase in the foreign reserve from 42 45 billion as at the end of december 2018 to 43 28 billion dollars as of jan 21 2019 the committee recommended that the government should focus its expenditure on infrastructure investment and urged the federal government to sustain the pace in addressing the infrastructure deficit in nigeria it noted that the immediate impact of this approach on gdp will be slow in coming but eventually expand the economy s productive base reduce unemployment and increase aggregate demand in a more sustainable manner he said emefiele said that the committee acknowledged the strategic role of the private sector in the economy s growth and remained concerned over the slow growth in credit to the private sector in 2018 he revealed that it was for this reason that the bank in collaboration with the nigerian incentive based risk sharing for agric lending plan to establish a national micro finance bank with branches in all states and local government areas he said the main objective of the bank would be to provide low interest rate lending to small scale businesses in nigeria the committee according to emefiele also raised concern on the country s debt level warning that it could fast be approaching the pre 2005 paris club exit level in addition he said that the committee advised the fiscal authorities to expedite action in broadening the country s tax base to increase its revenue news continues after this advertisement
via caixinglobal business is usually booming for wu xia in the lead up to lunar new year china s most important national holiday while her neighborhood shop sells everything from teapots to toothbrushes the traditional lanterns red envelopes and other decorations popular in chinese households during the week long festival make up a big part of her annual sales but this year the cheery kaleidoscope of red and gold hanging outside her shanghai store masks the subdued mood of many of china s small business owners we saw a big change last year several years ago there were a lot of laborers building the train networks who would buy everything they needed from our shop but shanghai does not need this kind of labor any more people are leaving the city said wu 44 who moved to shanghai with her husband sun from the eastern province of anhui a decade ago to make their fortune the couple whose grown children are now working in local department stores are considering shutting up shop like many small business owners who spoke to the australian financial review they say rising rents red tape and high costs have made life difficult in shanghai you also need a license to run a business and many of the small vendors have been kicked out because they don t have a license she said the couple are the face of the millions of small business owners the chinese government said it wants to help with tax cuts and other incentives to get the world s second largest economy firing on all cylinders again while official 2018 gross domestic product data gdp data to be released on monday will show the world s second largest economy grew at more than 6 5 many small business owners say they are not seeing the benefits of the country s economic miracle they are a world apart from the billionaire property and tech entrepreneurs china has become famous for for many life is better than for previous generations in the country but the promise of easy money that lured them to big cities like shanghai a decade ago has dried up the golden era of shanghai is over declared steve venturini who is leaving china after running a popular italian bistro and gelateria in shanghai s former french concession for 10 years entrepreneurs like italian born venturini whose father is from australia said business became untenable due to soaring costs taxes and tighter regulation this came at a time when the prices for luxury goods such as the pasta and ice cream his customers would queue up for were falling it s always been tough but the government doesn t care if you are making a profit or not prices dropped but rents and utility fees and taxes keep going up said venturini who is moving to japan where his wife was offered a job while beijing is promising to cut taxes for small business many small business owners say this defeats the point as many never paid tax in the first place we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us while china s unemployment rate and economic growth is better than in many western countries including australia growth in the world s second largest economy is slowing to its lowest rate in a decade official gdp data due out monday is expected to show growth slowed to 6 4 with full year growth coming in around 6 6 but the official figures will mask the challenges facing many of china s small businesses which are struggling to compete with large state owned companies and the boom in online shopping and services despite this beijing s economic policymakers made it clear last week that it wants to help the millions of small business owners who make up the backbone of the world s second largest economy i feel business is getting more difficult it is getting harder to run a business in china now said shen lihua who opened his souvenir store in shanghai s tourist hot spot yuyuan garden 14 years ago he is busy when the reporter arrives as locals pile in to buy lunar new year decorations but he said business is generally slow his main concern is rising rents labor costs and tougher regulation which was making it harder to make a profit many small business owners seem unaware of the tax cuts outlined by the government last week shen said tax cuts are nothing new he said his taxes were cut several years ago from 1 200 yuan 177 a month to 200 yuan a month but during the same period the rent for a 160 square meter 1 722 square foot storage warehouse rose from 40 000 yuan a year to 160 000 yuan business is not good there are less pedestrians and less crowds than before said another stall owner che mingli who is also selling lunar new year decorations new regulations mean the trestle tables laden with goods cannot be extended out onto the street like they were previously and he said this has reduced sales he blames a sluggish stock market for keeping people away because they are concerned about their investments and have less money to spend people are less comfortable spending he said che opened the business 10 years ago and said business was good up until 2017 when he started to feel a slowdown his rent has almost doubled in the past two years while s china s growth still overshadows many western economies including australia the economic slowdown is causing problems for president xi jinping as he comes under pressure from the united states to give up some of the generous trade benefits that contributed to its boom the latest slew of economic data including falling car sales slowing retail sales and the country s debt pile is making investors globally anxious if china runs into trouble the world economy will feel the effects while few believe the country is heading for a recession china s ruling communist party is being forced to explore new ways to stimulate investment and growth without jeopardizing efforts to reduce debt china s inflation adjusted gdp slowed to 6 5 in the third quarter and economists expect this to slow to 6 4 in the fourth quarter according to consensus estimates published by bloomberg and reuters china s leaders will officially release 2019 gdp forecasts in march comments by top economists in china and government officials suggest the government is preparing to lower targets for the current year to as low as 6 economists in australia and globally are divided over how to accurately measure the health of the chinese economy many believe the official data in a country where the ruling communist party does not tolerate provincial governments missing targets is unreliable but others point to a long history of china bears being proved wrong and believe growth remains robust compared to almost everywhere else in the world there is little doubt growth is slowing though and the big question is how far will china s leaders go to stimulate growth and resolve its trade dispute with washington retail sales in november grew at their weakest rate in 15 years the purchasing managers index pmi was flat in november for the first time in two years and power consumption slipped 9 percentage points in 2018 china s car sales fell for the first time in almost three decades in 2018 after the government cut subsidies there are already signs in the local media that beijing will lower last year s 6 5 target to as low as 6 property sales are falling amid reports developers are offering steep discounts to attract buyers
published tuesday 22 january 2019 print disqus by keith weiner last week we joked that we don t challenge beliefs here s one that we want to challenge today the dollar doesn t work as a currency because it s losing value even the dollar s proponents admit it loses value the fed itself states that its mandate is price stability which it admits means relentless two percent annual debasemen t orwell would be proud so there is no question that the dollar loses value the only mainstream debate is whether this is good or bad our focus today is whether this is why the dollar doesn t work why it s failing prices have been rising for 100 years there is no reason why they couldn t go on rising for another 100 or 1000 the inflation argument as we call it does not reach anyone other than those who already think the dollar is failing the rest shrug it off most people really care only if their income goes up slower than prices go up as an aside this is an inaccurate view measured in gold prices are falling this is the simple consequence of relentless productivity improvements in every industry from mining and farming to distribution to manufacturing in an article for forbes keith found that the resources that go into producing a gallon of milk fell by about 90 between 1965 and 2012 and wages are falling also read the article to see just how much anyway people care if their wage is falling faster or slower than prices mainstream economics encourages this with its paradigm of purchasing power they don t encourage thought about how much cheaper things really have become the argument that we need to move to the gold standard because inflation is not compelling to most people we believe it s more compelling to show that the dollar makes it profitable to destroy capital unlike rising prices capital destruction is not sustainable and also unlike rising prices capital destruction is a real worry to the 1 now let s get back to the argument the dollar doesn t work as a currency is that even true everyone knows he can take out a twenty dollar bill and buy dinner or gasoline anyone can write a check to pay the landlord dollars or deposit his paycheck everywhere you look you see people using the dollar as medium of exchange which is not our definition of money what exactly isn t working here how do you explain to all those wage earners employers landlords restaurants and gas stations that they aren t successfully doing what they are doing keith spoke at an austrian economics conference at king juan carlos university in madrid in november the speaker before him said that only gold is money the audience these are professors and phd s and graduate students interested in austrian economics were incredulous they demanded if the guy really said there is no money today and if so how does he explain the vast flows of commerce around the globe the explanation is that we have a currency that s working just fine as a medium of exchange and keith stood up and explained that the definition of money is either a the most marketable commodity or b the extinguisher of debt marketability refers to the loss you incur if you trade in and out of something in more technical terms this is the bid ask spread the bid ask spread of the dollar is zero there is no spread this means that trade using dollars is frictionless well at least frictionless on account of the medium of exchange not only is the dollar working as a medium of exchange it could not possibly work better though it s not working for other functions now let s look at gold an american eagle gold coin in the typical retail shop on the corner of first street and main has a bid ask spread of 5 or more on the internet you might get this down to 2 though the transaction is not instantaneous plus shipping cost how is this better than the us dollar it cannot compete as a currency online gold accounts which hold generic bulk bullion are better still one industry leader sells gold to you at spot 0 5 and buys it back from you at spot 0 5 this is a bid ask spread of 1 it is closer to the dollar but it still cannot compete unless the price of gold is rising rapidly and consistently enough that a gold account is a free dollar machine like bitcoin was in 2017 we can hear the objection all the way through the internet yes but no one is using gold now if people were to start to use it these spreads would tighten that is true they will tighten perhaps significantly but our point is that they cannot go to zero the spread on the dollar is zero so that s the number to beat money gold is the most marketable commodity if you don t believe us we suggest you ask how much the local landscape center will pay you for a load of gravel compare that to how much they will charge to sell it to you or go to a scrap metals dealer and ask for their bid on some lengths of copper pipe or a jewelry shop to sell your diamond not even in the gold standard does the bid ask spread on the gold coin go to zero unless as in 19th century america the government subsidized the coinage even bulk generic bullion in a storage account would not be frictionless enter currency currency is the most marketable credit instrument people today often wonder what would have made anyone in the 19th century accept paper bank notes if they weren t warehouse receipts and what makes people today accept the us dollar no it s not the military threat to blow up libya that makes americans happy to accept dollars currency unlike gold metal can have a zero spread that means it s perfectly frictionless the engine of commerce seeks the lowest friction lubricant for its gears and cogs an individual may hoard gold coins under his mattress which is his right that should never be questioned but production and trade demand greater efficiency they demand currency absent a zero friction gold currency they will use the zero friction irredeemable currency the us dollar the dollar is failing as a stable store of value even dollar apologists know this that s why they prefer to own assets that are going up the dollar is failing as a unit of account notwithstanding the fact of a low inflation rate the dollar is failing as a unit of measure of economic value it s failing as a vehicle for savings thus rendering saving impossible thus dooming young wage earners to never achieve their retirement goals however it is not failing as a medium of exchange in order for gold to get into the same arena to compete with the dollar as medium much less displace it there will have to be a gold currency with zero spread such a currency would offer people the best of both worlds frictionless medium of exchange plus act as a stable numeraire stable measure of value and a stable vehicle for savings we think the outcome of such a contest is easily predictable supply and demand fundamentals monday was martin luther king day in the us the price of gold dropped six bucks the price of silver fell 26 cents a greater percentage the price of gold can sometimes correlate well with the price of stocks for example april 2009 july 2011 the price of gold went from 892 to 1 626 while in the same time period the s p went from 841 to 1 289 the percentages are different gold s was 82 and the s p s 53 but they moved together and now they seem to be anti correlated we often argue that the obvious explanation for price moves is wrong but in this case we think that gold is trading as the un confidence asset but let s add some color to this no one vacillates back and forth on a daily basis believing that the system will collapse alternatively with everything is fine that s not what these safe haven risk on trades are about for now the gold buyers are not buying armageddon or even insurance against systemic collapse the vacillation comes from them trying to figure out of the fed has effectively added a third mandate a rising stock market they re wrong the fed hasn t done any such thing but so long as people believe in the mythical greenspan put or now the powell put they will trade this way the fed cares about credit not stock prices but in a near zero interest rate world the price of stocks would be astronomical but for concerns about credit so the more the fed can do to fix credit the more stock prices can go up and by fix of course we mean enable profligate and zombie borrowers to borrow more at dirtier cheaper rates so long as the fed is doing this then speculators feel safe to buy more assets including stocks and why shouldn t they anyways people are still very much in a bubble frame of mind when facing the prospect that the fed cannot or will not keep pumping air into the stock market as they picture it they just turn to the next asset to bet on in this case gold if the price of gold rises enough then many may conclude that it s on and gold could get a risk on greed bet too when they finally lose the bubble mentality then they may buy gold much more than today but then it won t be for price gains we will see that trend change long before the price action shows it so let s take a look at the only true picture of the supply and demand fundamentals of gold and silver but first here is the chart of the prices of gold and silver the bank for international settlements defines a zombie corporation as when profits interest expense next this is a graph of the gold price measured in silver otherwise known as the gold to silver ratio see here for an explanation of bid and offer prices for the ratio it rose this week here is the gold graph showing gold basis cobasis and the price of the dollar in terms of gold price we just rolled to the april contract the rise in the cobasis ongoing since mid december is evident this is despite or not the drop in the value of the dollar inverse to the rise in the price of gold and also with friday s 10 sell off in gold the monetary metals gold fundamental price fell 10 to 1 334 now let s look at silver as the price of silver fell more the cobasis scarcity rose more the monetary metals silver fundamental price is unchanged 16 00 isn t that incredible the market price dropped almost two percent and our model of the fundamentals is stable 2019 monetary metals digg this article published tuesday 22 january 2019 e mail print source goldseek com please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus

sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news the term neoliberalism isn t new it was coined in 1938 at a meeting in which social democracy was framed as analogous to a collectivism like nazism and communism but neoliberalism today is a conundrum its slimy tendrils claw into everyday western life yet it is so anonymous that we seldom even recognize it as a pervasive ideology neoliberalism pushes deregulation on economies around the world forces open national markets to trade and capital and demands that governments shrink themselves via austerity or privatization neoliberalism s anonymity is its essential symptom and cause of its power and the sunrise movement is seeking to make the consequences of neoliberalism transparent in society you know sunrise even if you can t immediately grasp why they re the cohort of primarily college aged activists who are promoting the green new deal you saw pictures of their sit in in front of nancy pelosi s congressional office in the news and on 60 minutes when rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny joined them in support of objectives to virtually eliminate greenhouse gas ghg emissions in a decade the earth is on track for 3 4 c degrees of warming which would cause sea level rise of several feet and make extreme weather more frequent and dangerous among other consequences the next 4 to 12 years are critical if the world wants to limit that warming waiting to reduce greenhouse gases will make the challenge harder the sunrise movement is working to build a cohort of young people to make climate change an urgent priority across the us end the corrupting influence of fossil fuel executives on politics and elect leaders who stand up for the health and wellbeing of all people the sunrise movement s green new deal would eliminate ghg emissions from electricity transportation manufacturing agriculture and other sectors within 10 years it includes a job guarantee program to assure a living wage job to every person who wants one while also seeking to mitigate deeply entrenched racial regional and gender based inequalities in income and wealth the principles of the sunrise movement george monbiot an environmental writer and political activist wrote about neoliberalism for the guardian and that article has become suggested reading for sunrise participants why is monbiot s message resonating with these young green new deal activists well instead of competition division and isolation the sunrise movement wants you to feel part of action that can change the world literally for the better and it will only happen when people come together and work toward social change sunrise is the antithesis of neoliberalism in order to build the movement for a green new deal a plan that would transform the us economy and society at the scale needed to stop the climate crisis the sunrise movement has created a series of guidelines for their actions in a side by side comparison with neoliberalism it is evident how the rich and powerful who control environmental and climate change politics differ from this group of young people who are scared about what the climate crisis means for the people and places they love the sunrise movement is motivated by the belief that if they unite by the millions they can gain political power and reclaim our democracy chip in a few dollars a month to help support independent cleantech coverage that helps to accelerate the cleantech revolution trickle down vs robust technological workforce neoliberalism neoliberalism shapes the ideal of society as a kind of universal market and not a civil sphere or a kind of family and of human beings as profit and loss calculators and not bearers of grace or of inalienable rights and duties writes stephen metcalf in the guardian with a goal to weaken the welfare state and any commitment to full employment to cut taxes and deregulate neoliberalism has been a way of reordering social reality and of rethinking our status as individuals sunrise we are a movement to stop climate change and create millions of good paying jobs in the process as they unite to make climate change an urgent priority across the us the sunrise movement has a goal to end the corrupting influence of fossil fuel executives on our politics and elect leaders who stand up for the health and wellbeing of all people policies to address climate change will bear directly on the future of individuals in the us impacting everything from their financial status lifestyles and local community culture no longer can it be assumed that us elected officials will take climate change matters into their legislative hands for the betterment of society at large each person in the us needs to be actively involved in the quest to reduce ghg emissions in our nation concrete examples show what governments local councils civil society organizations and other stakeholders have been doing to strengthen education and training on climate change both locally and regionally kate ringness of the ny jobs project adds that a good starting place for any state looking to expand advanced energy manufacturing would be to think about its resources and how they can work together what we call an economic cluster the idea behind an economic cluster is to grow an industry holistically that means encouraging cross pollination between innovation access to capital workforce development the value chain and the local market to support a robust industry closed door vs open communications neoliberalism no restrictions on manufacturing no barriers to commerce no tariffs that was the neoliberal economic vision that adam smith described he said free trade was the best way for a nation s economy to develop such ideas were liberal in the sense of no controls this application of individualism encouraged free enterprise and free competition which came to mean free for the capitalists to make huge profits as they wished neoliberalism according to corpwatch means embraces liberating free enterprise or private enterprise from any bonds imposed by the government no matter how much social damage this release of responsibility causes sunrise we grow our power through talking to our communities with pledges to talk to neighbors families religious leaders classmates and teachers about the green new deal the sunrise youth are seeing strength and work rooted in local communities local knowledge around climate and energy issues like this needs to be considered as a strategic leadership element when advocates work toward inclusivity cultural respect and equity enhancing quality of life for all people includes transitioning from reliance on fossil fuels and the movement toward renewable clean energy sources like solar wind micro hydro and biomass inequality vs embracing diversity neoliberalism the organization of labor and collective bargaining by trade unions are portrayed by neoliberalists as market distortions that impede the formation of a natural hierarchy of winners and losers says monbiot inequality is recast as virtuous a reward for utility and a generator of wealth which trickles down to enrich everyone efforts to create a more equal society are seen as both counterproductive and morally corrosive sunrise we are americans from all walks of life the sunrise movement has embraced people across colors and creeds from the plains mountains and coasts they acknowledge that the power of the wealthy might be a divisive force but through valuing each other in their differences the sunrise youth can unite in a shared fight to make real the promise of a society that works for all rep ocasio cortez already has shot back to the green new deal s vocal opposition noting that most queries into its financial grounding seem to arise in bad faith why is it she retorts that these questions arise only in connection with useful ideas not wasteful ideas alongside an emerging pattern of renewable industry growth comes the major challenge to educating future professionals there is an essential need to build a conduit from the classroom to installation worksite since renewable energy is still considered an emerging field many students have a limited understanding of how to translate engineering theory into actual solar practice professional role models who offer their personal insights and industry experience narratives can offset those gaps and create a robust diverse and more equitable renewable energy workforce implicit aggression vs passivism neoliberalism a paper for the international monetary fund outlines how although growth benefits are uncertain within neoliberal policies costs in terms of increased economic volatility and crisis frequency seem more evident since 1980 there have been about 150 episodes of surges in capital inflows in more than 50 emerging market economies about 20 of the time these episodes end in a financial crisis and many of these crises are associated with large output declines in addition to raising the odds of a crash financial openness has distributional effects appreciably raising inequality sunrise we are nonviolent in word and deed understanding that maximum participation is necessary in order to achieve climate action goals the sunrise movement has adopted an explicit nonviolent approach to activism scientific information is not prescriptive because it does not mandate or require specific public policy by providing knowledge of the harm caused by human activities and its complex mitigation process the sunrise movement is drawing upon scientific evidence of existing and potential harm from anthropogenic global climate change that gives rise to public policy and ethical concerns which can be upsetting to some people whose livelihoods and cultural ways of being have surrounded fossil fuels by asking people to accept that asking people to accept an ethical responsibility to adopt urgent actions to reduce ghg emissions the sunrise movement is interrupting many people s flow that feeling of calm and certainty in order to accept the reality of a value neutral scientific problem agreeing to non violent discourse is a necessity if the sunrise movement is to inspire real institutional change the unwillingness of policy makers in the us to date to reduce ghg emissions in some proportion to its historical emissions given that they have known for over 30 years about their impacts mocks principles of democracy in a report on climate change in the journal ethics the authors ask of fossil fuel companies and climate change do all citizens actually have equal rights does anyone have the right to knowingly impose preventable harm on those who have not given their consent to being harmed a closed circle vs telling and respecting multiple perspectives neoliberalism the problem with transparency does not begin at the highest echelons of the government a transatlantic network of academics businessmen journalists and activists funded a series of think tanks which promotes the neoliberal ideology the american enterprise institute the heritage foundation the cato institute the institute of economic affairs the centre for policy studies and the adam smith institute think tanks are quite opaque sunrise we tell our stories and we honor each other s stories from elizabeth warren to nina turner to the occupy alumni who embraced the 2016 sanders presidential candidacy now more than ever there is a stronger field of what klein calls a coalition inspiring progressive leaders out there than at any point in my lifetime we are leaderful as many in the movement for black lives say voices like those from the sunrise movement and ocasio cortez are fear inspiring for the fossil fuel industry hence the oft cited media positioning of the green new deal as dangerous false meritocracy vs open discussions of financial privilege neoliberalism the rich persuade themselves that they acquired their wealth through merit ignoring the advantages such as education inheritance and class that may have helped to secure it in a world governed by competition those who fall behind become defined and self defined as losers sunrise we ask for help and we give what we can dedicated to each activist offering an individual contribution the sunrise movement recognizes that youth come from different financial backgrounds which frame their activism some of us give time through volunteering anywhere from 1 to 50 hours per week some of us give money some of us donate housing or meeting space we invite our community into the movement by asking for the help we need massive change in the factors that affect us household finances have occurred in the last 30 years jobs wages benefits education technology and financial products a report by the stanford social innovation review states that it s clear that we need new products programs and policies designed for the actual financial lives and choices that american households face today right to profit vs making change incrementally neoliberalism the adam smith institute feeds into a clearly delineated ideological assumption the private sector rightfully driven by the profit motive tempered by tolerance for risk rewards innovation such a statement illustrates the trust s commercial basis sunrise we take initiative thomas friedman new york times opinion columnist says he likes like the urgency and energy she ocasio cortex and groups like the sunrise movement are bringing to this task so for now i say let a hundred green new deal ideas bloom and maybe that s the key it s time to celebrate innovation in practical and amazing far reaching ways for clean tech to really become everyday in our lives financial rewards for the few vs a rising tide neoliberalism economic growth has been markedly slower in the neoliberal era which monbiot describes as since 1980 in britain and the us than it was in the preceding decades oh but there s one caveat the very rich haven t experienced this slow economic growth at all inequality in the distribution of both income and wealth after 60 years of decline rose rapidly in this era due to the smashing of trade unions tax reductions rising rents privatization and deregulation sunrise we embrace experimentation and we learn together like the sunrise movement friedman envisions what such experimentation might look like if i were drafting a green new deal platform today it would put in place steadily rising mileage manufacturing and emissions standards stronger building codes and carbon market prices that would say to our industries and innovators here are the goals here is the level of clean power or efficiency that you have to hit every year and may the best company win consumerism vs mutual care neoliberalism neoliberalism grabs onto competition as the defining characteristic of human relations that means people aren t citizens but consumers consumers prove their patriotism by buying and selling klein decries neoliberalism as the causal factor for the political turmoil around us arguing that policies of deregulation privatization austerity and corporate trade have forced living standards to decline precipitously people she says have lost jobs they have lost pensions they have lost much of the safety net that used to make these losses less frightening they see a future for their kids even worse than their precarious present sunrise we take care of ourselves each other and our shared home a 2019 report by oil change international states that the us is on pace to release 120 billion tons of new carbon pollution equivalent to the lifetime co2 emissions of nearly 1 000 coal fired power plants into the atmosphere between 2018 and 2050 if not curtailed us oil and gas expansion will impede the rest of the world s ability to manage a climate safe equitable decline of oil and gas production the report warns glass ceiling vs intersectionality neoliberalism neoliberalism is not simply a name for pro market policies or for the compromises with finance capitalism made by failing social democratic parties argues metcalf it is a name for a premise that quietly has come to regulate all we practice and believe that competition is the only legitimate organizing principle for human activity he adds there was from the beginning an inevitable relationship between the utopian ideal of the free market and the dystopian present in which we find ourselves between the market as unique discloser of value and guardian of liberty and our current descent into post truth and illiberalism sunrise we stand with other movements for change guided by the knowledge that it takes numbers to foster political and social change the sunrise movement is motivated by an intersectional approach to gaining winning and holding power at every level of government we work with other movements who share our values and are also working to win political power great again vs resilient determination neoliberalism the greater the failure the more extreme the neoliberal ideology becomes according to monbiot governments use neoliberal crises as both excuse and opportunity to cut taxes privatize remaining public services rip holes in the social safety net deregulate corporations and re regulate citizens the self hating state he says now sinks its teeth into every organ of the public sector sunrise we shine bright there are hard and sad days to be sure who believes that america can remain a great country and not lead the next great global industry friedman asks the sunrise coterie is well aware that the activism ahead won t be easy work but they are committed to bringing a spirit of positivity and hope to their work changing the world is a fulfilling and joyful process and we let that show this optimism is reminiscent of social activist rebecca solnit s plea in 2004 i want to illuminate a past that is too seldom recognized one in which the power of individuals and unarmed people is colossal in which the scale of change in the world and the collective imagination over the past few decades is staggering in which the astonishing things that have taken place can brace us to enter that dark future with boldness to recognize the momentousness of what has happened is to apprehend what might happen inside the word emergency is emerge from an emergency new things come forth the old certainties are crumbling fast but danger and possibilities are sisters final thoughts klein asserts that the neoliberal agenda is not the only way forward for the us a good chunk of trump s support could be peeled away if there were a genuine redistributive agenda on the table an agenda to take on the billionaire class with more than rhetoric and use the money for a green new deal such a plan could create a tidal wave of well paying unionised jobs bring badly needed resources and opportunities to communities of colour and insist that polluters should pay for workers to be retrained and fully included in this future it could fashion policies that fight institutionalised racism economic inequality and climate change at the same time it could take on bad trade deals and police violence and honour indigenous people as the original protectors of the land water and air the sunrise movement has embraced the idea that those affected by environmental problems must be included in the process of remedying those problems this group of youth activists are proof that citizens of all walks can engage in activism on behalf of environmental justice after all in a democracy it is the people not the government who are ultimately responsible for fair use of the environment sources solnit r 2004 hope in the dark new york

negotiations won t be delayed and that there won t be a second brexit referendum with all this in mind here are five things the global markets were talking about on tuesday 1 stocks dip on global growth worries in japan the nikkei edged lower overnight retreating from a one month high print monday as investors took profits from recent gainers amid concerns about slowing economic growth the

resisted china s economic slowdown hitting a record above 10m bpd in q4 2018 but many now believe that the world s second largest economy may be experiencing peak energy growth with its demand set to reduce as the slowdown takes a deeper effect opec indicated last week that they had cut oil output sharply in december 2018 before a new accord to limit supply took effect on january 1 this would suggest that the main producers have made a strong start to avoid creating a supply glut in 2019 in its monthly report opec s oil output fell by 751k bpd in december to 31 58m bpd the biggest month on

however analysts are now questioning whether beijing will continue to prop up the yuan given the country s narrowing current account surplus and the slowing domestic economy both of which are likely to weaken the currency has beijing done enough to stop slowdown in china growth has beijing done enough to stop slowdown in china growth the uptick was on the back of a weakened us dollar optimism over a permanent trade war truce with the united states and the hope that the chinese authorities would intervene to support the yuan a sharp appreciation in the currency already appeared to be rapidly losing steam on monday it was changing hands at 6 7892 against the us dollar down 0 17 per cent last week the yuan posted its first weekly decline in five weeks leaving it up 1 5 per cent so far this year traders and fund managers are predicting a year of volatility for the yuan despite its strong start to 2019 imports are outstripping exports leading to a decline in china s current account this may lead china to accelerate the opening up of domestic capital markets to foreign investment as it looks to redress its balance of payments bop this could lead to increased volatility experts said the driving forces for a weaker yuan include a slowing domestic economy a narrowing current account surplus and the authorities tolerance for greater foreign exchange flexibility said haibin zhu jp morgan s china chief economist in recent months however the chinese government has maintained its tried and tested interventionist stance towards the currency the people s bank of china pboc has been propping up the yuan since august to prevent rapid depreciation it introduced functions that help curb sharp movements in the yuan including the countercyclical factor in currency fixing calculation and controls on shorting it also signed a memorandum of cooperation with the hong kong monetary authority hkma for the issuance of bills in hong kong that would allow it to manage yuan liquidity outside the mainland these actions helped engineer a halt to the yuan s decline against the us dollar last year when it slumped 5 7 per cent a benjamin franklin us 100 banknote and a chinese 100 yuan banknote depicting late chinese chairman mao zedong are seen in a picture illustration photo reuters they also prolonged the sort of policies the pboc has been using to control the yuan s movements for the past decade in recent years it imposed tight capital controls to stop money leaving china even as it continued liberalising the flow of money into china as a result the yuan appreciated or depreciated against the us dollar by a maximum of 7 per cent a year a basket of currencies from the us other major trading partners was more volatile in comparison gaining or losing up to 13 per cent against the dollar but with china s economy struggling policymakers are entering uncharted territory the government will be concerned by the dip in gross domestic product gdp which grew at 6 4 per cent for the final quarter of last year its lowest quarterly growth reading since the global financial crisis analysts are as a result diverging in their outlooks for the yuan in 2019 particularly when it comes to policy support melody jiang asia strategist at seb a swedish bank sees the yuan on the strong side forecasting it to end the year at 6 75 against the dollar china s economy will continue to slow moderately while us china tensions are unlikely to escalate on the tariff front she said meanwhile others such as jp morgan s zhu said he expected the pboc to tolerate greater yuan flexibility and for the currency to weaken to 7 10 per dollar by the end of the year the bop account appears stable on the surface much of the rise in net capital inflows has been due to a sharp reduction in outward foreign direct investment a very large rise in offshore corporate borrowing and an increase in portfolio inflows which could be sensitive to exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations zhu said hsbc economist qu hongbin also predicted the yuan to end the year at 7 10 because of lingering uncertainty over trade tensions between the us and china the government s deleveraging campaign has already tightened financial conditions and remain a risk to the economy qu said yan yan liang chief economist at the state administration of foreign exchange said the government was not afraid of breaking 7 00 level against the us dollar a rate which would be viewed as a symbolic level of depreciation the key question was whether breaking 7 00 would cause herding behaviour that would result in excessive depreciation and hurt the stability of financial markets yan said in the future we should continue to increase the flexibility of the yuan exchange rate system there is no need to hold on to a particular level yan told local media last week greater flexibility in the yuan exchange is something most analysts are aligned on by default if you have a more liberalised current and capital account that would mean you no longer have a controlled exchange rate said aidan yao senior emerging asia economist at axa investment managers the yuan needs to become more liberalised and market driven in this case this article appeared in the south china morning post print edition as expect unexpected as opinions split on yuan
bullard gordin grouse kane berman majozi rw johnson straight talk singapore revisited wsm opinion china s loans to south africa i charles collocott examines our debt situation and explains why we should look at other country s experiences china s loans to south africa brief i 22 january 2019 introduction in this brief i will give a short review of the overall debt risk currently facing south africa followed by a summary of the chinese loans taken on so far and the reasons given by government for refusing to disclose the terms i close the brief by laying the grounds for enquiries into the experiences other countries have had with chinese debt in order to see what south africa can possibly learn from them the general debt risk picture when a government s borrowing is not accompanied by sufficient economic growth and revenue generation to service its debt this can result in a downward spiral that ends with debt restructuring and bailouts according to a study by the world bank on a sample of 79 countries the threshold debt to gdp level is 77 1 beyond this each additional percentage point in debt to gdp costs the economy 0 0174 in annual real growth a more recent study by the centre for global development shows a statistically significant threshold effect in countries with rising debt to gdp ratios above 50 60 where growth drops off and leads to default or debt restructuring south africa falls into this category with its debt to gdp ratio almost doubling from 27 8 in 2007 to 53 1 by 2017 adding to south africa s concerns are the current levels of debt held by the state owned enterprises soes and critically not just the government guaranteed debt with cross default clauses in place within the soe loan agreements if for example eskom were to default on its payment to just one debtor this would trigger an automatic recall on the loans to all its debtors on that basis all eskom s debt is effectively government guaranteed because government cannot allow the parastatal to go into liquidation through a triggering of the cross default clause therefore a highly conservative assumption would be that the only soe debt government is liable for is the debt which it has guaranteed the latest reported total guaranteed debt figure is r670 billion with r350 billion held by eskom alone adding the recent r411 billion in chinese loans would take the total figure to around r1 081 billion making up 87 of the government s revenue and 23 of gdp if this total of r1 081 billion was called upon this would push the debt to gdp ratio to 69 95 assuming pre existing debt and gdp remained constant the primary concerns around south africa reaching unsustainable debt levels are that it will impede sound public investment reduce economic growth and do significant damage to citizens livelihood so far in 2018 government has taken a series of three loans from china totalling r411 billion if included on government s books this would make up 12 5 of the r3 293 trillion total debt so there can be little doubt that the sheer size of the recent chinese loans alone has added a significant amount of additional risk to south africa s budget the little we know about the chinese loans and government s arguments for non disclosure with regard to the latest and largest tranche of r370 billion said to be earmarked for an economic stimulus package government refuses to divulge any information about it not the currency what it will be spent on interest rates repayment period etc adding to the abstruseness is that government officials have repeatedly called the r 370 billion a gift however officials have also made mention of the not exorbitant interest rate attached a gift with interest payments that accrue to the giver is a strange gift indeed hence we feel it safe to assume that it is indeed a loan also odd was the finance minister mr tito mboweni s responsewhen he was asked by parliament s standing committee on finance why the terms were being kept so secret he responded with i understand the concerns that the committee has regarding the loan however china are our friends it is very difficult to set rules when it comes to friends and money we know that an earlier tranche of r37 billion was loaned to eskom it is in us dollars and will thus need to be paid back in us dollars which adds exchange rate risk this loan is to help eskom finish the kusile power station has a grace period of 5 years and repayment begins thereafter in 20 instalments over 10 years in response to questions in parliament for further information such as interest rates and if it has been securitised president ramaphosa said the conditions of the loan agreement could not be made public due to confidentiality clauses and that further disclosure would place eskom in a disadvantageous position when seeking further funding from the markets however there cannot possibly be any way in which non disclosure of investment terms will not increase real and perceived risk for possible future investors this is because withholding material information for any investment by default increases the risk of that investment there are therefore three other possible reasons for non disclosure of the terms first is that the chinese debt may have been given seniority status in repayments making current and future creditors to eskom subordinate and more at risk and government wrongly thinks not disclosing this is the better option second and similar to the first is that the loans may have been secured using eskom s assets also making future investments more risky and less attractive and again government is misdirected in its reasoning for nondisclosure the third possibility is that the terms are so massively skewed in china s favour that government simply does not want to disclose them in fear of a public backlash leading up to the general elections finally the r4 billion tranche was loaned to transnet and will be used for operation expenses and capital expenditure it is a five year rand denominated loan that will be paid back quarterly at a floating and undisclosed interest rate the basis going forward with south africa at risk of reaching or having reached a threshold level of debt to gdp it is important to have a clear picture of the implications of any additional debt burden unfortunately given the secrecy surrounding the recent chinese loans this is currently not fully possible further adding to the fog is that in contrast with other major creditors china does not formally participate in multilateral mechanisms such as the paris club in dealing with sovereign loans and defaults chinese debt relief is done in an ad hoc case by case basis and as such there is no guiding framework to define china s approach to debt relief and restructuring we must therefore rely on anecdotal evidence so to try and gauge a range of potential outcomes my next two briefs will look at the experience six other countries have had with taking on chinese debt the fourth brief will look at how those experiences could or should be applied to south africa and the final brief will include ancillary matters as well as an overall

unitholders 792 630 583 803 2 797 674 2 397 644 this is a non gaap financial measure please see below for further explanation adjusted ebitda we use adjusted ebitda attributable to common stockholders unitholders adjusted ebitda a non gaap financial measure as a measure of our operating performance the most directly comparable gaap measure to adjusted ebitda is net earnings we calculate adjusted ebitda beginning with consolidated net earnings attributable to common stockholders and removing the effect of interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization impairment charges gains or losses from the disposition of investments in real estate excluding development properties and land gains from the revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt and derivative contracts including cash charges similar adjustments we make to our ffo measures see definition below and other items such as stock based compensation and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency and derivatives we also include a pro forma adjustment to reflect a full period of noi on the operating properties we acquire or stabilize during the quarter and to remove noi on properties we dispose of during the quarter assuming all transactions occurred at the beginning of the quarter the pro forma adjustment also includes economic ownership changes in our ventures to reflect the full quarter at the new ownership percentage we believe adjusted ebitda provides investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view our operating performance analyze our ability to meet interest payment obligations and make quarterly preferred stock dividends on an unleveraged basis before the effects of income tax depreciation and amortization expense gains and losses on the disposition of non development properties and other items outlined above that affect comparability while all items are not infrequent or unusual in nature these items may result from market fluctuations that can have inconsistent effects on our results of operations the economics underlying these items reflect market and financing conditions in the short term but can obscure our performance and the value of our long term investment decisions and strategies we calculate our adjusted ebitda based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures we reflect our share of our adjusted ebitda measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis we reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100 of the equity by adjusting our adjusted ebitda measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods while we believe adjusted ebitda is an important measure it should not be used alone because it excludes significant components of net earnings such as our historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures distribution requirements contractual commitments or interest and principal payments on our outstanding debt and is therefore limited as an analytical tool our computation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to ebitda reported by other companies in both the real estate industry and other industries we compensate for the limitations of adjusted ebitda by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to gaap along with this detailed discussion of adjusted ebitda and a reconciliation to adjusted ebitda from consolidated net earnings attributable to common stockholders business line reporting is a non gaap financial measure core ffo and development gains are generated by our three lines of business i real estate operations ii strategic capital and iii development the real estate operations line of business represents total prologis core ffo less the amount allocated to the strategic capital line of business the amount of core ffo allocated to the strategic capital line of business represents the third party share of asset management net promotes and transactional fees that we earn from our consolidated and unconsolidated co investment ventures less costs directly associated to our strategic capital group realized development gains include our share of gains on dispositions of development properties and land net of taxes to calculate the per share amount the amount generated by each line of business is divided by the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding used in our core ffo per share calculation management believes evaluating our results by line of business is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance because it helps the investing public compare the operating performance of prologis respective businesses to other companies comparable businesses prologis computation of ffo by line of business may not be comparable to that reported by other real estate investment trusts as they may

referred to as ffo ffo is a non gaap financial measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo is net earnings the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as earnings computed under gaap to exclude historical cost depreciation and gains and losses from the sales along with impairment charges of previously depreciated properties we also exclude the gains on revaluation of equity investments upon acquisition of a controlling interest and the gain recognized from a partial sale of our investment as these are similar to gains from the sales of previously depreciated properties we exclude similar adjustments from our unconsolidated entities and the third parties share of our consolidated co investment ventures our ffo measures our ffo measures begin with nareit s definition and we make certain adjustments to reflect our business and the way that management plans and executes our business strategy while not infrequent or unusual the additional items we adjust for in calculating ffo as modified by prologis core ffo and affo as defined below are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period although these items may have a material impact on our operations and are reflected in our financial statements the removal of the effects of these items allows us to better understand the core operating performance of our properties over the long term these items have both positive and negative short term effects on our results of operations in inconsistent and unpredictable directions that are not relevant to our long term outlook we calculate our ffo measures as defined below based on our proportionate ownership share of both our unconsolidated and consolidated ventures we reflect our share of our ffo measures for unconsolidated ventures by applying our average ownership percentage for the period to the applicable reconciling items on an entity by entity basis we reflect our share for consolidated ventures in which we do not own 100 of the equity by adjusting our ffo measures to remove the noncontrolling interests share of the applicable reconciling items based on our average ownership percentage for the applicable periods these ffo measures are used by management as supplemental financial measures of operating performance and we believe that it is important that stockholders potential investors and financial analysts understand the measures management uses we do not use our ffo measures as nor should they be considered to be alternatives to net earnings computed under gaap as indicators of our operating performance as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under gaap or as indicators of our ability to fund our cash needs we analyze our operating performance principally by the rental revenues of our real estate and the revenues from our strategic capital business net of operating administrative and financing expenses this income stream is not directly impacted by fluctuations in the market value of our investments in real estate or debt securities ffo as modified by prologis to arrive at ffo as modified by prologis we adjust the nareit defined ffo measure to exclude the impact of foreign currency related items and deferred tax specifically i deferred income tax benefits and deferred income tax expenses recognized by our subsidiaries ii current income tax expense related to acquired tax liabilities that were recorded as deferred tax liabilities in an acquisition to the extent the expense is offset with a deferred income tax benefit in earnings that is excluded from our defined ffo measure iii unhedged foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from debt transactions between us and our foreign consolidated subsidiaries and our foreign unconsolidated entities iv foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement based on current foreign currency exchange rates of certain third party debt of our foreign consolidated and unconsolidated entities and v mark to market adjustments associated with derivative financial instruments we use ffo as modified by prologis so that management analysts and investors are able to evaluate our performance against other reits that do not have similar operations or operations in jurisdictions outside the u s core ffo in addition to ffo as modified by prologis we also use core ffo to arrive at core ffo we adjust ffo as modified by prologis to exclude the following recurring and nonrecurring items that we recognized directly in ffo as modified by prologis i gains or losses from the disposition of land and development properties that were developed with the intent to contribute or sell ii income tax expense related to the sale of investments in real estate iii impairment charges recognized related to our investments in real estate generally as a result of our change in intent to contribute or sell these properties iv gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt and redemption and repurchase of preferred stock and v expenses related to natural disasters we use core ffo including by segment and region to i assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies ii evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods iii evaluate the performance of our management iv budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources v provide guidance to the financial markets to understand our expected operating performance and vi evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results affo to arrive at affo we adjust core ffo to include realized gains from the disposition of land and development properties and recurring capital expenditures and exclude the following items that we recognize directly in core ffo i straight line rents ii amortization of above and below market lease intangibles iii amortization of management contracts iv amortization of debt premiums and discounts and financing costs net of amounts capitalized and v stock compensation expense we use affo to i assess our operating performance as compared to other real estate companies ii evaluate our performance and the performance of our properties in comparison with expected results and results of previous periods iii evaluate the performance of our management iv budget and forecast future results to assist in the allocation of resources and v evaluate how a specific potential investment will impact our future results limitations on the use of our ffo measures while we believe our modified ffo measures are important supplemental measures neither nareit s nor our measures of ffo should be used alone because they exclude significant economic components of net earnings computed under gaap and are therefore limited as an analytical tool accordingly these are only a few of the many measures we use when analyzing our business some of the limitations are the current income tax expenses that are excluded from our modified ffo measures represent the taxes and transaction costs that are payable depreciation and amortization of real estate assets are economic costs that are excluded from ffo ffo is limited as it does not reflect the cash requirements that may be necessary for future replacements of the real estate assets furthermore the amortization of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of logistics facilities are not reflected in ffo gains or losses from non development property dispositions and impairment charges related to expected dispositions represent changes in value of the properties by excluding these gains and losses ffo does not capture realized changes in the value of disposed properties arising from changes in market conditions the deferred income tax benefits and expenses that are excluded from our modified ffo measures result from the creation of a deferred income tax asset or liability that may have to be settled at some future point our modified ffo measures do not currently reflect any income or expense that may result from such settlement the foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are excluded from our modified ffo measures are generally recognized based on movements in foreign currency exchange rates through a specific point in time the ultimate settlement of our foreign currency denominated net assets is indefinite as to timing and amount our ffo measures are limited in that they do not reflect the current period changes in these net assets that result from periodic foreign currency exchange rate movements the gains and losses on extinguishment of debt or preferred stock that we exclude from our core ffo may provide a benefit or cost to us as we may be settling our obligation at less or more than our future obligation the natural disaster expenses that we exclude from core ffo are costs that we have incurred we compensate for these limitations by using our ffo measures only in conjunction with net earnings computed under gaap when making our decisions this information should be read with our complete consolidated financial statements prepared under gaap to assist investors in compensating for these limitations

store population for the three months ended december 31 2018 as our owned and managed properties that were in the operating portfolio at january 1 2017 and owned throughout the same three month period in both 2018 and 2017 the same store population excludes non industrial real estate properties and properties held for sale to third parties along with development properties that were not stabilized at the beginning of the period january 1 2017 and properties acquired or disposed of to third parties during the period beginning january 1 2018 we modified our definition of same store to align on consistent methodologies with members of the industrial reit group this did not materially change our historical amounts reported to derive an appropriate measure of period to period operating

3 international monetary fund at 2 814 tonnes gold in its reserves the imf is on the third spot manas chakravarty india is one of the brightest spots in the global economy the international monetary fund has just given us another pat on the back its world economic outlook update predicts that while global growth will slow this year growth in india will accelerate the imf forecasts india s gdp growth to increase from 7 3 in 2018 19 to 7 5 in 2019 20 story continues below advertisement remove ad why is india expected to grow faster the imf report says india s economy is poised to pick up in 2019 benefiting from lower oil prices and a slower pace of monetary tightening than previously expected as inflation pressures ease notice that the key to higher indian growth is lower crude oil prices it reduces inflation allows the central bank to have a looser monetary policy brings down interest rates takes the pressure off the current account deficit and strengthens the currency the reason why the imf has increased its gdp growth projection from 7 4 to 7 5 in 2019 20 is lower oil prices by how much does it expect oil prices to be lower the imf has a benchmark based on the simple average prices of uk brent dubai fateh and west texas intermediate crude oil the average price of oil in us dollars a barrel for this benchmark was 68 58 in 2018 the assumed price based on futures markets as of november 27 2018 is 58 95 in 2019 and 58 74 in 2020 if oil prices pan out as predicted there s no doubt that growth in the indian economy will get a boost the question is what is the imf s track record when it comes to predicting oil prices cast your eyes on the accompanying chart it shows the changes in oil prices forecast by the imf s world economic outlook publication and its updates between october 2017 and january 2019 story continues below advertisement remove ad in october 2018 the world economic outlook thought that crude oil prices would decline by 0 2 in 2018 come january 2018 however it realised prices were headed higher and hastily revised its forecast for 2018 this time saying it would rise by 11 7 in april it revised it upwards to 18 by july with a relentless rise in crude it panicked and jacked up its oil price growth estimate to 33 by october last year it lowered its estimate to 31 4 and in january 2019 its latest weo update says crude oil price growth in 2018 was 29 9 clearly the imf has no special insight into the trajectory of crude oil prices all it does is follow the market and the market changes frequently so yes we should celebrate india s resilience in the face of slowing global growth but we need to take the imf projections with a pinch of salt and we need to keep a wary eye on oil prices

at the beginning of last year economists and market investors concurred that the united states economy would grow robustly during the year thanks to fiscal stimulus from december 2017 s tax reform bill economists cautioned that the concomitant large federal budget deficit would add to an already tight labour market in raising inflation and interest rates eventually constraining growth but inflation turned out to be lower than expected due to weaker than anticipated wage gains a collapse in oil prices and a strong dollar lowering the price of imports excess demand was also restrained by us companies investing little of their tax cut windfall profits and repatriated foreign cash holdings in new domestic production instead distributing them to shareholders whose savings rose
neoliberalism s anonymity is its essential symptom and cause of its power and the sunrise movement is seeking to make the consequences of neoliberalism transparent in society you know sunrise even if you can t immediately grasp why they re the cohort of primarily college aged activists who are promoting the green new deal you saw pictures of their sit in in front of nancy pelosi s congressional office in the news and on 60 minutes when rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny joined them in support of objectives to virtually eliminate greenhouse gas ghg emissions in a decade by carolyn fortuna cleantechnica the term neoliberalism isn t new it was coined in 1938 at a meeting in which social democracy was framed as analogous to a collectivism like nazism and communism but neoliberalism today is a conundrum its slimy tendrils claw into everyday western life yet it is so anonymous that we seldom even recognize it as a pervasive ideology neoliberalism pushes deregulation on economies around the world forces open national markets to trade and capital and demands that governments shrink themselves via austerity or privatization the earth is on track for 3 4 c degrees of warming which would cause sea level rise of several feet and make extreme weather more frequent and dangerous among other consequences the next 4 to 12 years are critical if the world wants to limit that warming waiting to reduce greenhouse gases will make the challenge harder the sunrise movement is working to build a cohort of young people to make climate change an urgent priority across the us end the corrupting influence of fossil fuel executives on politics and elect leaders who stand up for the health and wellbeing of all people the sunrise movement s green new dealwould eliminate ghg emissions from electricity transportation manufacturing agriculture and other sectors within 10 years it includes a job guarantee program to assure a living wage job to every person who wants one while also seeking to mitigate deeply entrenched racial regional and gender based inequalities in income and wealth the principles of the sunrise movement george monbiot an environmental writer and political activist wrote about neoliberalism for the guardian and that article has become suggested reading for sunrise participants why is monbiot s message resonating with these young green new deal activists well instead of competition division and isolation the sunrise movement wants you to feel part of action that can change the world literally for the better and it will only happen when people come together and work toward social change sunrise is the antithesis of neoliberalism in order to build the movement for a green new deal a plan that would transform the us economy and society at the scale needed to stop the climate crisis the sunrise movement has created a series of guidelines for their actions in a side by side comparison with neoliberalism it is evident how the rich and powerful who control environmental and climate change politics differ from this group of young people who are scared about what the climate crisis means for the people and places they love the sunrise movement is motivated by the belief that if they unite by the millions they can gain political power and reclaim our democracy trickle down vs robust technological workforce neoliberalism neoliberalism shapes the ideal of society as a kind of universal market and not a civil sphere or a kind of family and of human beings as profit and loss calculators and not bearers of grace or of inalienable rights and duties writes stephen metcalf in the guardian with a goal to weaken the welfare state and any commitment to full employment to cut taxes and deregulate neoliberalism has been a way of reordering social reality and of rethinking our status as individuals sunrise we are a movement to stop climate change and create millions of good paying jobs in the process as they unite to make climate change an urgent priority across the us the sunrise movement has a goal to end the corrupting influence of fossil fuel executives on our politics and elect leaders who stand up for the health and wellbeing of all people policies to address climate change will bear directly on the future of individuals in the us impacting everything from their financial status lifestyles and local community culture no longer can it be assumed that us elected officials will take climate change matters into their legislative hands for the betterment of society at large each person in the us needs to be actively involved in the quest to reduce ghg emissions in our nation concrete examples show what governments local councils civil society organizations and other stakeholders have been doing to strengthen education and training on climate change both locally and regionally kate ringness of the ny jobs project adds that a good starting place for any state looking to expand advanced energy manufacturing would be to think about its resources and how they can work together what we call an economic cluster the idea behind an economic cluster is to grow an industry holistically that means encouraging cross pollination between innovation access to capital workforce development the value chain and the local market to support a robust industry closed door vs open communications neoliberalism no restrictions on manufacturing no barriers to commerce no tariffs that was the neoliberal economic vision that adam smith described he said free trade was the best way for a nation s economy to develop such ideas were liberal in the sense of no controls this application of individualism encouraged free enterprise and free competition which came to mean free for the capitalists to make huge profits as they wished neoliberalism according to corpwatch means embraces liberating free enterprise or private enterprise from any bonds imposed by the government no matter how much social damage this release of responsibility causes sunrise we grow our power through talking to our communities with pledges to talk to neighbors families religious leaders classmates and teachers about the green new deal the sunrise youth are seeing strength and work rooted in local communities local knowledge around climate and energy issues like this needs to be considered as a strategic leadership element when advocates work toward inclusivity cultural respect and equity enhancing quality of life for all people includes transitioning from reliance on fossil fuels and the movement toward renewable clean energy sources like solar wind micro hydro and biomass inequality vs embracing diversity neoliberalism the organization of labor and collective bargaining by trade unions are portrayed by neoliberalists as market distortions that impede the formation of a natural hierarchy of winners and losers says monbiot inequality is recast as virtuous a reward for utility and a generator of wealth which trickles down to enrich everyone efforts to create a more equal society are seen as both counterproductive and morally corrosive sunrise we are americans from all walks of life the sunrise movement has embraced people across colors and creeds from the plains mountains and coasts they acknowledge that the power of the wealthy might be a divisive force but through valuing each other in their differences the sunrise youth can unite in a shared fight to make real the promise of a society that works for all rep ocasio cortez already has shot back to the green new deal s vocal opposition noting that most queries into its financial grounding seem to arise in bad faith why is it she retorts that these questions arise only in connection with useful ideas not wasteful ideas alongside an emerging pattern of renewable industry growth comes the major challenge to educating future professionals there is an essential need to build a conduit from the classroom to installation worksite since renewable energy is still considered an emerging field many students have a limited understanding of how to translate engineering theory into actual solar practice professional role models who offer their personal insights and industry experience narratives can offset those gaps and create a robust diverse and more equitable renewable energy workforce implicit aggression vs passivism neoliberalism a paper for the international monetary fund outlines how although growth benefits are uncertain within neoliberal policies costs in terms of increased economic volatility and crisis frequency seem more evident since 1980 there have been about 150 episodes of surges in capital inflows in more than 50 emerging market economies about 20 of the time these episodes end in a financial crisis and many of these crises are associated with large output declines in addition to raising the odds of a crash financial openness has distributional effects appreciably raising inequality sunrise we are nonviolent in word and deed understanding that maximum participation is necessary in order to achieve climate action goals the sunrise movement has adopted an explicit nonviolent approach to activism scientific information is not prescriptive because it does not mandate or require specific public policy by providing knowledge of the harm caused by human activities and its complex mitigation process the sunrise movement is drawing upon scientific evidence of existing and potential harm from anthropogenic global climate change that gives rise to public policy and ethical concerns which can be upsetting to some people whose livelihoods and cultural ways of being have surrounded fossil fuels by asking people to accept that asking people to accept an ethical responsibility to adopt urgent actions to reduce ghg emissions the sunrise movement is interrupting many people s flow that feeling of calm and certainty in order to accept the reality of a value neutral scientific problem agreeing to non violent discourse is a necessity if the sunrise movement is to inspire real institutional change the unwillingness of policy makers in the us to date to reduce ghg emissions in some proportion to its historical emissions given that they have known for over 30 years about their impacts mocks principles of democracy in a report on climate change in the journal ethics the authors ask of fossil fuel companies and climate change do all citizens actually have equal rights does anyone have the right to knowingly impose preventable harm on those who have not given their consent to being harmed a closed circle vs telling and respecting multiple perspectives neoliberalism the problem with transparency does not begin at the highest echelons of the government a transatlantic network of academics businessmen journalists and activists funded a series of think tanks which promotes the neoliberal ideology the american enterprise institute the heritage foundation the cato institute the institute of economic affairs the centre for policy studies and the adam smith institute think tanks are quite opaque sunrise we tell our stories and we honor each other s stories from elizabeth warren to nina turner to the occupy alumni who embraced the 2016 sanders presidential candidacy now more than ever there is a stronger field of what klein calls a coalition inspiring progressive leaders out there than at any point in my lifetime we are leaderful as many in the movement for black lives say voices like those from the sunrise movement and ocasio cortez are fear inspiring for the fossil fuel industry hence the oft cited media positioning of the green new deal as dangerous false meritocracy vs open discussions of financial privilege neoliberalism the rich persuade themselves that they acquired their wealth through merit ignoring the advantages such as education inheritance and class that may have helped to secure it in a world governed by competition those who fall behind become defined and self defined as losers sunrise we ask for help and we give what we can dedicated to each activist offering an individual contribution the sunrise movement recognizes that youth come from different financial backgrounds which frame their activism some of us give time through volunteering anywhere from 1 to 50 hours per week some of us give money some of us donate housing or meeting space we invite our community into the movement by asking for the help we need massive change in the factors that affect us household finances have occurred in the last 30 years jobs wages benefits education technology and financial products a report by the stanford social innovation review states that it s clear that we need new products programs and policies designed for the actual financial lives and choices that american households face today right to profit vs making change incrementally neoliberalism the adam smith institute feeds into a clearly delineated ideological assumption the private sector rightfully driven by the profit motive tempered by tolerance for risk rewards innovation such a statement illustrates the trust s commercial basis sunrise we take initiative thomas friedman new york times opinion columnist says he likes like the urgency and energy she ocasio cortex and groups like the sunrise movement are bringing to this task so for now i say let a hundred green new deal ideas bloom and maybe that s the key it s time to celebrate innovation in practical and amazing far reaching ways for clean tech to really become everyday in our lives financial rewards for the few vs a rising tide neoliberalism economic growth has been markedly slower in the neoliberal era which monbiot describes as since 1980 in britain and the us than it was in the preceding decades oh but there s one caveat the very rich haven t experienced this slow economic growth at all inequality in the distribution of both income and wealth after 60 years of decline rose rapidly in this era due to the smashing of trade unions tax reductions rising rents privatization and deregulation sunrise we embrace experimentation and we learn together like the sunrise movement friedman envisions what such experimentation might look like if i were drafting a green new deal platform today it would put in place steadily rising mileage manufacturing and emissions standards stronger building codes and carbon market prices that would say to our industries and innovators here are the goals here is the level of clean power or efficiency that you have to hit every year and may the best company win consumerism vs mutual care neoliberalism neoliberalism grabs onto competition as the defining characteristic of human relations that means people aren t citizens but consumers consumers prove their patriotism by buying and selling kleindecries neoliberalism as the causal factor for the political turmoil around us arguing that policies of deregulation privatization austerity and corporate trade have forced living standards to decline precipitously people she says have lost jobs they have lost pensions they have lost much of the safety net that used to make these losses less frightening they see a future for their kids even worse than their precarious present sunrise we take care of ourselves each other and our shared home a 2019 reportby oil change international states that the us is on pace to release 120 billion tons of new carbon pollution equivalent to the lifetime co2 emissions of nearly 1 000 coal fired power plants into the atmosphere between 2018 and 2050 if not curtailed us oil and gas expansion will impede the rest of the world s ability to manage a climate safe equitable decline of oil and gas production the report warns glass ceiling vs intersectionality neoliberalism neoliberalism is not simply a name for pro market policies or for the compromises with finance capitalism made by failing social democratic parties argues metcalf it is a name for a premise that quietly has come to regulate all we practice and believe that competition is the only legitimate organizing principle for human activity he adds there was from the beginning an inevitable relationship between the utopian ideal of the free market and the dystopian present in which we find ourselves between the market as unique discloser of value and guardian of liberty and our current descent into post truth and illiberalism sunrise we stand with other movements for change guided by the knowledge that it takes numbers to foster political and social change the sunrise movement is motivated by an intersectional approach to gaining winning and holding power at every level of government we work with other movements who share our values and are also working to win political power great again vs resilient determination neoliberalism the greater the failure the more extreme the neoliberal ideology becomes according to monbiot governments use neoliberal crises as both excuse and opportunity to cut taxes privatize remaining public services rip holes in the social safety net deregulate corporations and re regulate citizens the self hating state he says now sinks its teeth into every organ of the public sector sunrise we shine bright there are hard and sad days to be sure who believes that america can remain a great country and not lead the next great global industry friedmanasks the sunrise coterie is well aware that the activism ahead won t be easy work but they are committed to bringing a spirit of positivity and hope to their work changing the world is a fulfilling and joyful process and we let that show this optimism is reminiscent of social activist rebecca solnit s plea in 2004 i want to illuminate a past that is too seldom recognized one in which the power of individuals and unarmed people is colossal in which the scale of change in the world and the collective imagination over the past few decades is staggering in which the astonishing things that have taken place can brace us to enter that dark future with boldness to recognize the momentousness of what has happened is to apprehend what might happen inside the word emergency is emerge from an emergency new things come forth the old certainties are crumbling fast but danger and possibilities are sisters final thoughts klein asserts that the neoliberal agenda is not the only way forward for the us a good chunk of trump s support could be peeled away if there were a genuine redistributive agenda on the table an agenda to take on the billionaire class with more than rhetoric and use the money for a green new deal such a plan could create a tidal wave of well paying unionised jobs bring badly needed resources and opportunities to communities of colour and insist that polluters should pay for workers to be retrained and fully included in this future it could fashion policies that fight institutionalised racism economic inequality and climate change at the same time it could take on bad trade deals and police violence and honour indigenous people as the original protectors of the land water and air the sunrise movement has embraced the idea that those affected by environmental problems must be included in the process of remedying those problems this group of youth activists are proof that citizens of all walks can engage in activism on behalf of environmental justice after all in a democracy it is the people not the government who are ultimately responsible for fair use of the environment sources solnit r 2004 hope in the dark new york nation books p 12 copyright free images from pixabay originally appeared at our sister site cleantechnica

there appears to be a sense of vague anxiety about the future fourth quarter gross domestic product gdp grew at the slowest pace since the global financial crisis easing to 6 4 percent year on year as expected from 6 5 percent in the third quarter the national bureau of statistics said on monday that pulled full year growth down to 6 6 percent the slowest annual pace since 1990 gdp in 2017 grew a revised 6 8 percent with support measures expected to take some time to kick in most analysts believe conditions are likely to get worse before they get better and see a further slowing to 6 3 percent this year u s president donald trump said on monday that economic indicators meant it was time for china to make a trade deal with the united states china posts slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to u s trade tensions and new policies makes so much sense for china to finally do a real deal and stop playing around trump wrote on twitter some china watchers believe actual growth is already weaker than official data suggest uncertainties aplenty despite a raft of policy easing steps so far december data released along with gdp showed continued weakness across broad areas of the economy at the end of last year factory output picked up unexpectedly to 5 7 percent from 5 4 percent but it was one of the few bright spots along with a stronger services sector while regulators have been fast tracking construction projects most of the gain appeared due to higher mining and oil production reuters calculations showed average daily steel output hit its lowest level since march as producers cut output amid shrinking profit margins despite the slowing economy chinese officials also pledged to continue with a crackdown on air pollution that has weighed on the industrial sector other data on monday showed investment and retail sales continued to languish while the jobless rate edged higher fixed asset investment rose 5 9 percent in 2018 the slowest in at least 22 years as a regulatory crackdown on riskier financing and debt weighed on local government spending early in the year property investment is also looking wobbly with analysts waiting to see if beijing will risk loosening restrictions on home buyers that have kept a potential housing bubble in check chinese consumers are clearly feeling the pressure though retail sales growth picked up marginally in december to 8 2 percent the consumer strength gauge is around the weakest in 15 years auto sales in the world s biggest car market shrank for the first time since the 1990s officials recently pledged to boost consumer demand for big ticket items from cars to appliances but gains in disposable income are slowing while household debt is on the rise other data in recent weeks showed exports and imports unexpectedly shrank last month while falling factory orders point to a further drop in activity in coming months and more job shedding some factories in guangdong china s export hub have shut earlier than usual ahead of the long lunar new year holiday as new business dries up trade pressures even if china and the united states agree on a trade deal in current talks which would be a tall order analysts said it would be no panacea for china or its exporters demand is weakening globally not just in the united states net exports actually dragged on china s growth by 8 6 percent last year reuters calculations based on official data showed trade negotiators are facing an early march deadline and washington has threatened to sharply hike tariffs if there are no substantial signs of agreement white house officials have given markedly different views on progress so far china s vice premier and lead negotiator liu he is due to visit washington for the next round of talks at the end of the month more stimulus to free up more funds for lending particularly to vulnerable smaller firms the central bank has cut the amount of reserves that banks need to set aside as reserves rrr five times over the past year and guided borrowing costs lower further rrr reductions are expected in coming quarters but most analysts do not see a cut in benchmark interest rates yet as policymakers wait to see if earlier steps begin to stabilise activity more forceful easing could also pressure the yuan and aggravate high debt levels with money going into less efficient or speculative investments as it often has in the past the government may unveil more fiscal stimulus during the annual parliament meeting in march including bigger tax cuts and more spending on infrastructure projects some analysts believe it could deliver 2 trillion yuan 295 13 billion worth of cuts in taxes and fees this year and allow local governments to issue another 2 trillion yuan in special bonds largely used to fund key projects china has ample room for policy adjustments statistics bureau chief ning jizhe said on monday still some analysts do not expect the economy to bottom out convincingly until summer
weakest china growth in almost 30 years analysts ask if beijing is doing enough to stop slowdown china s economic growth rate in 2018 slipped to its lowest level in nearly three decades raising concerns over whether beijing has done enough to arrest the deepening slowdown at a time when the external environment is turning hostile and a mountain of debt at home is restricting the scope for additional stimulus the official growth rate of 6 6 per cent in 2018 while a decent figure given the size of china s economy and in line with the government s target for growth of about 6 5 per cent for the year was the lowest since a rise 3 9 per cent in 1990 a year when china was sanctioned by western countries over its ruthless crackdown on the pro democracy movement the previous year the fourth quarter growth rate of 6 4 per cent compared to the previous year matched that of the first quarter of 2009 the lowest growth rate since the chinese government began publishing quarterly growth rates at the beginning of 1992 the 2009 reading occurred at the beginning of the global financial market crash that sparked recessions throughout the west the fourth quarter growth rate was down from 6 5 per cent in the third quarter according to data released monday by the national bureau of statistics and matched the median forecast of 6 4 per cent from a bloomberg survey of analysts the 2018 annual growth rate was down from 6 8 per cent in 2017 other economic data released monday were better than expected but still indicated a subdued economy retail sales grew 8 2 per cent december compared to a year earlier up slightly from 8 1 per cent in november which was the lowest growth rate in 15 years the retail sales growth rate was higher than expected with analysts predicting a like sized gain of 8 1 per cent according to a bloomberg survey industrial product grew 5 7 per cent in december compared to a year earlier up from 5 4 per cent in november which was the lowest reading since november 2008 the rise was higher than expected with analysts forecasting a gain of 5 3 per cent according to a bloomberg survey fixed asset investment rose 5 9 per cent in 2018 from a year earlier down from 7 2 per cent in 2017 and lower than bloomberg s survey expectations of 6 0 per cent within fixed asset investment property investment grew 9 5 per cent over the course of 2018 as the data was released chinese president xi jinping gathered the country s provincial governors and ministers in beijing for a special session on how to manage major risks including ideological political and economic risks xi delivered an opening speech for the study session on monday morning in the summary of xi s speech published by the state news agency xinhua he said there are challenges and difficulties in implementing supply side structural reforms xi urged local authorities and ministries to keep a balance between nurturing growth and preventing risks all regions and departments must take effective measures to stabilise employment to keep economic activity within a reasonable range xi was quoted as saying analysts expect china s economy to weaken further during the first six months of this year before stabilising in the second half as beijing stimulus efforts including more infrastructure spending a further tax cut and lowering the cost of lending for smaller businesses take hold the government s cut in individual taxes from october last year may have played a hand in lifting consumer spending slightly based in december but analysts at capital economics said such impact is not likely to be long lasting we expect the uptick in industrial output and consumer spending to prove short lived said analysts at capital economics in a note published monday still with the headwinds from cooling global growth and the lagged impact of slower credit growth set to intensify in the coming months china s economy is likely to weaken further before growth stabilises in the second half of the year on the back of expanded policy stimulus more importantly employment and wage growth are facing downward pressure this year this will have a depressing effect on consumption said cicc analysts in a research note pointing to sagging growth in smartphone and car sales in china as evidence of more cautious consumer spending chinese smartphone sales dropped 8 per cent in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the same period a year earlier according to counterpoint research canalys another research company estimated an even steeper decline of around 15 per cent in the same quarter last month iphone maker apple issued its first revenue warning in nearly 12 years citing weak chinese demand car sales a key indicator for chinese consumption also dropped last year for the first time in almost 30 years considering the deterioration of corporate profitability the downward pressure on the real estate market still uncertain external demand and the decline in the growth rate of new service industries pressure on employment in many industries this year cannot be ruled out the cicc analysts said nomura analysts said current stimulus measures will not be sufficient and the government will need to do more to prevent a rapid deterioration in the economy we believe beijing will further ramp up its stimulus measures although it currently seems reluctant to ease tightening measure in the property sector leaving almost the entire onus on infrastructure investment we believe deregulating the property markets in big cities is the key to unlocking a growth recovery said analysts from nomura jp morgan s analysts forecast a significant value added tax cut fiscal subsidies on home appliance and auto purchases as well as an expansion in government s budget deficit target to be announced in the coming months to boost spending along with monetary policy moves to support lending such as another bank reserve ratio cut early in the second quarter given the continued headwinds created by the government campaign to reduce debt and risky lending in the economy as well as the trade war with the united states the government reportedly will set a growth target range of between 6 and 6 5 per cent for this year the growth target range will be released publicly at the national people s congress in early march source south china morning post
