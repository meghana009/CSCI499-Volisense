this is the final article in an occasional series exploring wealth and income inequality in connecticut and its impact on a state struggling to cope with massive debt find the other articles here there is no shortage of ideas to address the extremes of income and wealth inequality that threaten connecticut s economic future whether it involves the investments in education and social programs that liberals favor or the austerity and tax cuts espoused by conservatives there s general agreement on the need to reduce connecticut s deep pockets of poverty but there s a third component to this debate a challenge more daunting in connecticut than in most other states connecticut has amassed more than 80 billion in debt much tied to a pension system neglected for decades so how can it address wealth and income inequality when the math already suggests all income groups will be asked to sacrifice over the next 15 years just to cover this bill inequality is one of the reasons the world s falling apart said university of connecticut economist fred carstensen who heads the connecticut center for economic analysis while economists and politicians differ over how to address the problem those on all sides of the inequality debate generally agree there is an economic tipping point when disparities become too extreme and too many are struggling when adequate investment in human capital higher education adequate health care and decent housing are impossible because of debt or under employment inequality becomes a significant drag on economic growth while income is limited to the earnings one household receives over a set period of time usually a year wealth incorporates stocks property and other assets a household possesses as well as the mortgages and debts that burden it if you don t have wealth if you don t have assets against which you can draw so you can balance things out over a longer time period you are living literally paycheck to paycheck carstensen said fred carstensen credit ryan caron king connecticut public radio those living paycheck to paycheck are one crisis one accident away from the governmental safety net that could mean food stamps rental and child care subsidies government sponsored health coverage or hospital emergency room services that the patient cannot cover the key carstensen said is not perfect equality of wealth and income but rather a focus on drawing people out of poverty and keeping the middle class from falling backward a 2014 study of the u s and 22 other countries in north america and europe also suggested targeting the lower portion of the inequality spectrum according to the organisation for economic cooperation and development a progressive policy think tank based in paris the key lies in reducing income disparities at the bottom of the income distribution inequality is one of the reasons the world s falling apart fred carstensen countries that had dramatically reduced poverty enjoyed more robust economic growth than those that had produced extreme degrees of income inequality some degree of tax hikes by raising top marginal rates and closing deductions which tend to benefit high earners disproportionally may well be necessary the study reported but the other key is to use those funds to increase access to public services including high quality education job training transportation and health care it is not just poverty the incomes of the lowest 10 percent of the population that inhibits growth the study states policymakers need to be concerned about the bottom 40 percent more generally including the vulnerable lower middle classes at risk of failing to benefit from the recovery and future growth anti poverty programs will not be enough economic danger signs there are signs that income and wealth inequality are undermining connecticut s economy despite a healthy 4 2 percent unemployment rate the top 1 percent of earners in connecticut captured all of the post recession income growth between 2009 and 2013 according to a 2016 analysis by the economic policy institute of washington d c a nonpartisan think tank while the remaining 99 percent watched their earnings fall nearly 2 percent by comparison the top 1 percent nationally captured 85 percent of all income growth there are other warning signs as well connecticut is the only state not to have recovered all jobs lost in the last recession having regained just over 90 percent and child poverty levels have increased by 50 percent since 2000 according to the connecticut association for human services meanwhile the health care safety net has sprung several holes due to state budget cuts starting in 2016 an estimated 23 700 working poor adults lost medicaid coverage through the husky a program when income eligibility guidelines were reduced that meant families of three earning between 40 380 and 31 139 lost coverage connecticut had 140 531 households in 2016 with incomes defined as extremely low further complicating matters health care advocates estimate 80 percent of those cut from husky a could not afford to purchase insurance on the state s health care exchange despite government subsidies and now are uninsured lawmakers ordered a second tightening in 2017 from 155 percent to 138 percent of the federal poverty level a limit of 28 676 for a family of three this would have removed coverage for another 13 500 families starting this summer but the general assembly reversed that decision in may after fierce public outcries lawmakers also repealed new limits on a health care program for seniors last may but have no plan for covering the added costs next fiscal year when state finances are projected to be 10 percent in deficit a gap of about 1 7 billion both access to higher education and housing also have become more restricted between 2010 and 2017 tuition and mandatory fees for an in state resident attending the university of connecticut rose by 35 percent over the same period the increases for the connecticut state university and community college systems were 25 percent and 23 percent respectively connecticut had 140 531 households in 2016 with incomes defined as extremely low according to the national low income housing coalition the nlihc also found the state had 36 affordable and available homes per 100 renter households in that category government must invest for the economy to grow faced with these challenges some argue connecticut must find the resources to spend more even though government must spend more to cover pension and retirement health care debt left by past generations it still must invest more some say in education health care and infrastructure jamie mills director of fiscal policy for connecticut voices for children credit keith m phaneuf ctmirror org every child in connecticut should have the pathway to success through quality education through opportunities to go to college to own their own home and to have a successful life and raise their children there said jamie mills director of fiscal policy for connecticut voices for children a new haven based research and public policy group i think we are at a tipping point where that is no longer the reality for a significant number of people who live in connecticut right now mills said lawmakers have no choice but to ease budgetary capping systems otherwise surging pension and other debt costs which already have drained resources from education health care and transportation will take an even higher toll on these areas yale law school professor anika singh lemar said education and quality housing are the two main public resources people must have to climb the socio economic ladder i think the most troubling aspect of our current state of inequality is about unequal access to opportunity and we do a particularly bad job in that in connecticut where the sort of preliminary public goods that create opportunity are highly segregated by class and race lemar said anika singh lemar credit ryan caron king connecticut public radio lemar who runs the community and economic development clinic at yale said connecticut needs to focus on de concentrating classrooms in urban cities and addressing its high housing costs so we have classrooms in our urban cities where you have 26 kids in the classroom over half of whom are struggling with food insecurity various forms of trauma exposure no previous educational experience in a pre k classroom lemar said and we expect classrooms to deal with that you have to de concentrate poverty in our schools while connecticut has one of the most highly educated populations in the country it s not educated enough to meet the demands of our future workforce according to jennifer widness president of the connecticut conference of independent colleges a coalition of private colleges and universities jennifer widness president of the connecticut conference of independent colleges within six years connecticut will require a workforce in which 70 percent have some post secondary training according to an analysis from georgetown university s center for workforce the current level is 54 percent and the education gaps between whites and minority students are greater in connecticut than in almost all other states widness said noting that the best way to increase educational attainment is through greater state investment in financial aid carstensen who frequently refers to connecticut as an i t island said the state has little chance of generating long term economic growth without greater investment in both its information technology and transportation infrastructure tackle housing and health care left a street in the north end of hartford juxtaposed next to a view of scarborough street right in the west end credit ryan caron king connecticut public radio connecticut also needs to provide more housing options for the poor besides in its struggling cities david fink a consultant for partnership for strong communities said this would give low income families the mobility to choose which communities work best for them but this traditionally has sparked fierce political resistance and would require a coordinated education effort by the state and by nonprofit housing advocates to make change unless you think you can have the votes to mandate towns to do it you have to convince town after town and that requires work fink said rep brandon mcgee d hartford credit keith m phaneuf ctmirror org affordable housing is a key tool to reduce recidivism and help inmates find a stable life upon release from prison said rep brandon mcgee d hartford but quality housing is just the first step in a larger effort to revitalize connecticut s cities he said in order for connecticut to close the income and wealth inequality gap we have to begin investing in the urban centers mcgee said many of our urban centers have high mill rates we re spending a lot of money on social services and many of our people are not even making enough for meaningful wages that will allow for them to lift themselves up out of poverty investing in health care could in some cases cost more up front but also has the potential to deliver major savings said patricia baker president and ceo of the nonprofit connecticut health foundation the fact of the matter is we have to address health and well being because the cost of it is eating up our resources she said direct out of pocket spending is the most regressive form of health care financing the journal health affairs concluded in 2011 when it published a study conducted by the rand corporation the study found a typical american family a median income married couple with two children and employer sponsored health insurance saw its income grow by 23 000 between 1999 and 2009 but rising health care costs left them with just 1 140 extra income after adjusting for inflation patricia baker president and ceo of the connecticut health foundation credit keith m phaneuf ctmirror org the foundation supports holding the line against any further cuts to the husky program or to school based clinics that expand health care access dramatically in low income communities but the foundation s recommendations go far beyond simply maintaining state spending to preserve health care access we have to tackle the delivery system and we have to move to paying for outcomes as opposed to episodes of care baker said this is i think fundamental to building a healthier connecticut connecticut should also continue to support the state innovation model initiative also known as sim which is exploring ways to design primary care to promote wellness baker said adding that the state should invest in growing its stable of community health workers these frontline public health workers bridge the gap between the doctor s office and the patient and can improve access to care for example baker said a community health worker could help the parents of a child with asthma learn new cleaning techniques to minimize asthma triggers who pays the very big bill but if connecticut already is at risk of significant tax hikes over the coming decade and a half to cover its debt costs how would it pay for new investments in services and infrastructure the first step according to salvatore luciano the new head of the connecticut afl cio would be to raise taxes on wealthy households and major corporations sal luciano head of the connecticut afl cio credit ctmirror org i don t think people realize how huge the wealth disparity is in connecticut luciano said i think that s a big part of the problem according to the economic policy institute the top 1 percent of households nationally emerged from the last recession earning 25 3 times what the bottom 99 percent average in connecticut the ratio is 42 6 to 1 and in fairfield county it s 73 7 to 1 but peter gioia economist for the connecticut business and industry association warned state officials must try to hold the line on taxes wherever possible if you raise taxes at this point in time you will have a flood of people leaving the state he said you ve got to stabilize your tax base there s a whole cottage industry of financial advisors that are talking to people about this tax trend and showing them where else they can go gioia said that s what is hurting connecticut now more than anything and i think it will continue to accelerate gioia echoed carstensen s concerns about the need to invest in transportation but said connecticut has to try to identify resources within its existing budget if the choice comes down to raising taxes or expanding transportation spending the latter will have to wait he said gioia and other business leaders also have pointed repeatedly to a series of studies released in 2011 and 2012 by the connecticut institute for the 21st century a business coalition focused on achieving greater cost efficiency in state government in one report focused on connecticut s dual public private system of delivering social services the institute called that model a confusing non integrated inconsistent and out of balance system that is neither efficient nor effective if you raise taxes at this point in time you will have a flood of people leaving the state you ve got to stabilize your tax base peter gioia gioia and others also have argued there may be too many community based nonprofits competing for scarce state dollars state government might be able to cut costs shift significant amounts of savings to cover rising pension costs and still have some left over to bolster nonprofit providers if the overall number of agencies were reduced he said former hedge fund manager david stemerman a greenwich republican who sought the gop gubernatorial nomination last year said connecticut should try to buy senior public sector employees as well as retirees out of their pensions with lump sum offers connecticut s reckless savings habits between 1939 and 2010 which created the current retirement benefit crisis have offended taxpayers and every effort must be made to reduce the cost of that multi generational mistake he said people are deeply concerned that one day the money might run out stemerman said and we need to have an honest conversation across the board but has the money run out yet connecticut s tax system is projected to raise more than 16 4 billion this fiscal year 2018 republican gubernatorial contender david stemerman that s more than the 12 billion it raised in the 2010 11 fiscal year the last fiscal year before a major 1 8 billion tax hike signed by gov dannel p malloy took effect it s also more than the 12 4 billion that taxes raised in 2007 08 the last fiscal year before the great recession and while state tax hikes frequently fail to raise as much additional funding as lawmakers were counting on when they approved them an economic danger sign connecticut is not seeing less revenue either welcome the wealthy don t villify them still it s not just gioia and stemerman who argue that connecticut needs to recognize that taxpayers wealthy ones in particular have been pushed too far the state commission on fiscal stability and economic competitiveness a 14 member panel dominated by business leaders last year recommended a comprehensive blueprint for stabilizing the state s finances and jump starting the economy it drew criticism in part for centering much of the blueprint on a state tax reorganization plan that would benefit the wealthy the most and potentially shift burdens onto the middle class the group recommended lowering state income tax rates across the board connecticut s richest residents who pay the most would scoop up most of that savings this would be offset by higher sales and business taxes as well as by a 1 billion cut in state operating expenses commission on fiscal stability and economic growth co chairs jim smith left and robert patricelli credit keith m phaneuf ctmirror org file photo given that surging pension and other debt costs largely are fixed by contract critics said much of this cut would come from municipal aid weakening the cities and driving up property taxes the commission s co chairmen health care entrepreneur robert patricelli and webster bank chairman and former ceo jim smith say this tax restructuring would generate economic growth and begin to remove connecticut s stigma as a tax and spend state the president of the connecticut hedge fund association bruce mcguire said the state should create new enterprise zones that offer tax discounts to hedge funds willing to relocate here according to the state s nonpartisan office of legislative research connecticut has the second largest hedge fund industry in the u s there are 211 hedge fund managers and about 700 hedge funds listed on preqin s a leading online industry information source two of the world s largest bridgewater associates of westport and aqr capital management of greenwich managed 151 7 billion and 74 billion respectively in assets based on 2015 data and while they represent a small percentage of the population they rank among connecticut s biggest taxpayers bruce mcguire president of the connecticut hedge fund association credit keith m phaneuf ctmirror org by offering the right incentives particularly in shoreline cities like stamford or new haven mcguire said the state could build its hedge fund industry as part of a larger plan to revitalize urban centers we should focus our attention and energy on making stamford a thriving center mcguire 54 said that s what millennials and more than a few people my age want don t forget the middle class but others argue it is connecticut s middle class that needs the most attention with many at risk of slipping out of that demographic and needing more government assistance luciano said boosting the minimum wage from 10 10 per hour to 15 should be a priority patricelli and smith s panel also endorsed that target though they said it might need to be phased in over a few years sen cathy osten d sprague co chairwoman of the legislature s appropriations committee said connecticut needs to embrace more efforts like its manufacturing pipeline program last year the state provided high skill job training such as welding drafting sheet metal fabrication for more than 2 000 individuals primarily through its community college system it then placed them in jobs with major manufacturers such as general dynamics electric boat shipyard in groton sen cathy osten d sprague credit jacqueline rabe thomas ctmirror org file photo it sets people on the pathway not only to cover their expenses but to have that quintessential american dream to own a house osten said gov elect ned lamont whose first budget proposal is due to the legislature in mid february has said he wants to hold the line on state income and sales tax rates and while he praised the fiscal stability commission for its work lamont said his first priority will be to offer relief to the middle class given the fiscal realities of the state the commission s recommendation of cutting the top rate on the income tax is not an immediate priority he said connecticut s middle class deserves a break and that s where we re going to concentrate the energies of this administration and the budget lamont unveiled a plan during the campaign to bolster the property tax credit within the state income tax which is only available to middle and low income households gov elect ned lamont credit mark pazniokas ctmirror org the new governor also said he hopes to shield municipal aid particularly for connecticut s poor urban centers by creating a responsibly balanced budget that stabilizes the state s finances we can eventually restore municipal aid to its proper levels instead of leaving municipalities to choose between making draconian cuts or increasing property taxes on hard pressed homeowners he said make sure the state s tax credits pay off big carstensen insists the ultimate answer both to meeting the challenge of extreme wealth inequality as well as the state s huge debt rests neither with spending nor taxes simply put state government first must get a lot smarter connecticut offers dozens of credits exemptions and other tax breaks across its entire revenue system income sales corporation and other levies worth more than 6 5 billion per year according to the legislature s nonpartisan office of fiscal analysis how effective are those grants loans and tax breaks do they create jobs what if they created enough jobs which in turn generated enough income sales and other tax receipts that state government came out ahead other states have much more sophisticated ways of tracking their own economic activity carstensen said noting that the state s chief fiscal offices don t have in house economists we don t collect any granular information he added that cripples the whole process with a more strategic approach to leveraging tax credits and other forms of economic development assistance tying them to job creation in cutting edge industries connecticut s economy could reach new heights carstensen said we re flying blind he added we are the land of steady habits and until that changes that means among other things we are the land of not paying attention to what is going on
opposition to free trade is clearly growing both the progressive and the corporate elements of the democratic party are now critical of agreements like the north american free trade agreement and the trans pacific partnership less clear are the alternatives to free trade that might emerge as progressives continue to build power inside and outside of the democratic party we must clarify our understanding of the international political economy and imagine and begin to build real alternatives to free trade building these alternatives must become an essential component of a more progressive us foreign policy the conventional wisdom says that if you oppose free trade you must support protectionism or economic nationalism this is misleading there is no such thing as free trade people create all of the systems that govern our political economy these systems inevitably favor certain human activities over others and we can design them to act any way that we want the important question is for whom are trade policies free put another way who do trade policies favor debunking free trade free trade is free only for capital owners the plutocratic few who own and control multinational corporations when countries enter into free trade agreements the governments of both countries effectively agree that their laws will not favor businesses from their country over businesses from any other countries the main way that free trade does this is by attempting to reduce all tariffs to as close to 0 percent as possible to eliminate import quotas that countries can use to limit the amount and types of goods imported from specified countries and to discourage countries from more directly subsidizing their own businesses far from promoting freedom for everyone free trade empowers multinationals from the global north to control the world political economy in two important ways first free trade facilitates global north multinationals to maintain the unequal trade they established with the global south during colonialism this increases inequalities of power and wealth between global north and global south second free trade empowers global north multinationals to plan the world economy alongside global south multinationals the junior partners of the global north multinationals and to pit working class people in the global north and global south against one another thus free trade is the modern form that imperialism takes throughout us history the us government has used military force to expand free trade throughout the world for more than a century us backed military coups and us backed military dictatorships have led to partnerships between the us government us multinationals and local elites across the globe that are built around creating trade that concentrates wealth for multinationals this remains a core source of violence in the world with many implications today for instance central american refugees at the southern us border are criminalized for fleeing a history of us military coups and intervention in central america and the neoliberal trade policies that us multinationals and local elites created in their aftermath colonialism and the history of unequal trade in the 1950s the argentinian economist raúl prebisch and the german economist hans singer developed dependency theory which describes the unequal terms of trade that the global north established with the global south during colonialism the same unequal economic relationships that free trade protects today prebisch and singer attacked the mainstream trade theory of comparative advantage which holds that countries naturally produce the goods that they are most efficient at producing core to the idea of comparative advantage and to mainstream economic theory today is the idea that the invisible hand of the market guides these natural choices however during colonialism global north colonizers did not rely upon the market s invisible hand instead they ensured through physical violence and use of tariffs that they still prevent global south countries from using today that they would have a monopoly on the production of manufactured and high tech goods the most profitable sectors of the economy global north corporations sold these goods to people in their own countries and to people in global south countries while making sure that global south corporations lacked the capacity to make such goods on their own the global north turned the global south into an exporter of raw materials a position from which they are still largely unable to escape so that they could have access to an ever expanding supply of low cost raw materials that they needed for manufactured goods global north countries by reorganizing global south economies to become raw material exporters also ensured access to global south markets throughout colonialism and to a somewhat lesser extent today global north corporations have been able to own and capture the profits from global south corporations that produce raw materials in addition to owning global north corporations that produce manufactured goods it is important to note that global north governments have used protectionism to maintain these unequal economic relationships developed during colonialism for example the british used tariffs and subsidies to help their corporations become the colonial world s dominant producer and exporter of textiles and the machines of the early industrial revolution the most profitable manufactured goods of the day they didn t stop using protectionism even while attempting to impose free trade on all other countries including their american colonies until they had become the dominant producer of manufactured goods during the 1800s similarly the us relied extensively on tariffs until becoming the dominant producer and exporter of manufactured goods during the early 1900s this hypocrisy continues today more powerful global north governments do not even honor the spirit of their own free trade agreements as they frequently favor their own industries especially their agricultural pharmaceutical and digital technology industries at the same time global north governments use free trade agreements to demand that global south countries cannot use the same tools that global north governments have used to propel their corporations to their dominant economic position of today free trade imperialism continuing the unequal trade of colonialism with mass global south resistance to colonialism increasing in the early 1900s and intensifying in the aftermath of the world wars global north corporations and governments no longer needed colonialism from their perspective moving toward the international economic model that would become free trade was much more cost effective as the us sociologist johanna bockman writes of us government and business elites in the aftermath of the second world war supported neither free trade nor globalization imagined as a level playing field with flows moving evenly around the globe instead they supported the international neocolonial system through the while using the rhetoric of free trade and modernization to support us national interests today s free trade agreements are about enforcing the unequal economic relationships that global north corporations have continued to enjoy since the times of colonialism roughly 70 years after the global north created the post second world war international order global north corporations continue to own and control a disproportionate amount of the most profitable industries in the global economy though many us commentators warn of the rise of brazil russia india and china us corporations in 2013 still had leading positions in 18 of the 25 most profitable industries moreover us corporations are dominant in the most profitable advanced industries including banking and financial services aerospace and defense chemicals computer hardware and software insurance pharmaceuticals heavy machinery and oil and gas while the us has roughly 5 percent of the world s population and 25 percent of the global share of gross domestic product us corporations likely control far more than 25 percent of the profit producing capital in the world these profits are concentrated among the shareholders of multinationals incorporated in the us which according to one estimate are at least 85 percent owned by us citizens these profits are not being shared with vast majority of people in the world most of whom do not own any wealth let alone shares in corporations global north and us multinational dominance of the world economy is not an accident as global north governments and multinationals have used the international institutions they created following the second world war to continue to dominate the world economy these institutions include the united nations the gatt which has since become the world trade organization wto the international monetary fund imf and the world bank the wto is the main international institution that makes and enforces trade policies the core gatt wto principles are non discrimination and national treatment non discrimination means that countries will not use their trade policies to discriminate between goods that are produced in different foreign countries national treatment means that countries will not use their trade policies to favor products produced in their own country over products produced in any other country as described above global north countries used their trade policies to promote the products of the corporations based in their countries for centuries the free trade principles of non discrimination and national treatment deny the ability of any country to use those same policies today this allows global north corporations to ensure that global south governments will not create policies that can help their own corporations develop the wealth they need to compete additionally since the gatt wto free trade framework facilitates continued global north corporate control over advanced industries global north corporations are far more likely to develop the high tech industries of the future as they own the profits from today s advanced industries which they can invest in research and development as lawrence summers economic adviser to the clinton and obama administrations points out the gatt wto free trade regime has been so successful that today s free trade agreements aren t even about the traditional obstacles to free trade as these obstacles are already effectively eliminated in most countries instead today s agreements involve protecting the property rights especially the intellectual property rights of multinationals and harmonizing the regulatory regimes across countries with which multinationals must comply in other words today s free trade agreements are about enforcing the unequal economic relationships that global north corporations have continued to enjoy since the times of colonialism the most egregious example of global north countries using the wto to codify their colonial unequal economic relationships is the trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips an agreement that is part of the wto trips extend patent copyright and trademark protections to all wto members effectively the entire world economy however the global north is a net intellectual property producer and the global south is a net intellectual property consumer trips intellectual property protections extend to goods like pharmaceuticals digital technology hardware and software and most art and media entertainment intellectual property protections allow the global north corporations that own the patents copyrights and trademarks for these products to maintain monopoly control over them global north corporations can charge high prices for pharmaceuticals and digital technology to global south consumers transferring wealth to global north corporations further intellectual property protections make it impossible for global south corporations to compete with global north corporations to produce these goods meaning that global north corporations can continue to monopolize the profits economic and military violence is the visible hand the global north governments and corporations have used to concentrate the world s wealth since the post wwii restructuring of the international economy global south countries have needed to find capital to develop their own industries the gatt wto free trade framework bars global south countries from creating policies that can help their own industries develop their own surplus capital as described above so global south countries have resorted to borrowing money from the financial sector the imf and the world bank have promoted and subsidized global north banks lending to global south countries and have only made capital available to global south countries if they accept the conditions of the north s free trade policies as well as privatization of any state owned businesses and deregulation of their economies through the work of gatt wto the imf and the world bank global south governments and corporations have been kept in the unequal economic position developed during colonialism as vijay prashad explains us and western militaries have also helped to expand free trade throughout the world by supporting military dictators and military coups throughout asia africa and latin america this economic and military violence is the visible hand the global north governments and corporations have used to concentrate the world s wealth this visible hand explains how global north and especially us corporations continue to own and control a disproportionate amount of the most profitable industries in the global economy learning from past efforts to reform international institutions before more deeply exploring the alternatives to free trade that we can create today we should focus on two post wwii efforts to change the established international political economy order john maynard keynes and e f schumacher s attempt to create an international clearing union icu in the 1940s and the non aligned movement s effort to create structural adjustment in the 1960s and 1970s during the 1940s the economists keynes and schumacher advocated for an international system of capital controls and economists including yanis varoufakis and paul davidson have revived this effort today keynes and schumacher considered their proposal for an icu as a solution to two key problems with the international financial system first global north multinationals and banks extract profits from the global south this extraction reduces the global south s relative purchasing power as profits are not recirculated within the global south which makes the global south increasingly reliant on importing advanced goods the purchase of which depletes their currency eventually this dampening of purchasing power around the world creates global recessions second national governments cannot simply increase their country s purchasing power through public spending if national governments spend creating money in their own currency their currency depreciates relative to other currencies as the supply of their own currency has increased making imports even more expensive further depressing the country s purchasing power keynes and schumacher were effectively arguing that the rules of the international financial system depressed purchasing power and caused recessions because the rules allowed global north multinationals to concentrate capital that they refused to redistribute without redistribution global south purchasing power remains too low in order to incentivize global north multinationals to invest at high enough levels required to avoid recession the solution according to keynes and schumacher was to create an icu which would effectively act as an international bank through which all currency exchanges would occur the icu would track global north trade surpluses and if such surpluses exceeded certain amounts the icu would effectively tax the global north currency and redistribute the amount of money taxed to the global south country to increase its purchasing power and to help its country build its own productive capacity this system keynes and schumacher argued would recirculate profit throughout the world and keep aggregate demand high enough to avoid the instability of recessions today calls remain for a similar system with the main difference being that economist varoufakis prefers that the surplus redistribution be managed by a transparent digital distributed ledger the technology at the core of bitcoin and other digital cryptocurrencies rather than by international bureaucrats the key insight from the icu proposal is that global north multinational corporate concentration of capital creates international economic instability and that we need an international institution to redistribute global north profits unctad s vision for reforming the world economy another alternative worth examining is the effort by the non aligned movement to create structural adjustment of the world political economy in the 1960s and 1970s the non aligned movement a group of global south countries claiming independence from the us and the ussr led by indonesia india egypt tanzania yugoslavia cuba and others created the united nations conference on trade and development unctad for which prebisch the argentinian economist who developed dependency theory was the first secretary general the non aligned movement attempted to use unctad to create what they envisioned as structural adjustment of the international political economy the imf would later co opt the term to help impose the free trade washington consensus throughout the global south the unctad structural adjustment program called for new policies and institutions that shifted control of capital from the global north to the global south including marketing cartels that pooled global south multinational corporate power grants from the global north to provide financial and technological assistance to global south multinationals and minimum market share agreements whereby global north countries agreed to buy certain amounts of advanced goods from global south multinationals giving them access to markets the short answer for why unctad s efforts failed is because global south countries lacked the required political power they could not create the program on their own and their unity could not withstand the global recession of the 1970s the key insight from unctad s structural adjustment program is that the current terms for economic competition between global north and global south multinationals are unequal and deliberate policies for transferring capital technology and market access to the global south are required to reverse these unequal terms just as deliberate global north policies were required to create these unequal terms in the first place but a key problem with unctad s structural adjustment plan is that it does not address inequalities of wealth and power within countries unctad s program was designed to shift power between the wealthy and powerful in the global north and the global south it wasn t necessarily designed to create a democratic political economy throughout the world that shifts power to the grassroots masses and away from the elite few who own multinationals we can however begin to build alternatives to free trade that both shift power and wealth from the global north to global south and from the elite few to the grassroots masses throughout the global north and the global south building upon the insights from keynes and schumacher s attempt to create the icu and the non aligned movement s attempt to use unctad to reform the world economy we can work toward a progressive international political economy that promotes material dignity and freedom for all the people of the world before you go truthout

accomplishments of eleven years of the process of change in evo morales bolivia stansfield smith via chicagoalbasolidarity evo morales will soon have been the president of bolivia for 12 years heralding the ascent of the indigenous social movements to governmental power this ended the apartheid system against the indigenous that existed for 500 years in bolivia evo won in 2005 with 53 7 of the vote followed by re elections in 2009 with 64 2 and 2014 with 61 3 the country has made great strides in economic development national sovereignty women s and original peoples rights respect for mother earth raising the people s standard of living level of education and health care his presidency which has brought an era of relative social peace and economic growth has been the longest in bolivia s history since 1825 bolivia has had 83 presidents with 37 almost half by means of coups d etat previous presidents typically lacked social legitimacy representing a political system that excluded participation of the indigenous peoples plagued by social and economic inequality subjugated to foreign interests and complicit with the looting of natural resources by 2002 after years of neoliberal regimes serving foreign mostly us corporations the proportion of the rural population living in extreme poverty had risen to 75 the election of evo a campesino movement leader and head of the movement toward socialism mas began what his government describes as the process of change that shifted power away from bolivia s traditional elite the mostly white owners of industry and agriculture and towards the majority the mostly indigenous workers and campesinos reflecting on the historic significance of the changes underway in bolivia morales declared we are the indigenous blood of mother earth until now bolivia has been ruled by a few families that have all the political and economic power they despise humiliate marginalize and hate the majority of the indigenous population after 525 years of colonization we indigenous peoples are part of the construction of a new plurinational state and we have full participation in international political organizations and forums why has economic development been so successful during the process of change the mas government undertook an anti neoliberal program which has enabled the economy to grow an average 5 per year since 2006 compared to 2 8 during the years 1951 2005 as a result the gross domestic product has grown four fold from 9 billion in 2005 to 36 billion today bolivia has become the fastest growing economy in latin america this economic strategy focused on regaining national sovereignty over the country s natural resources and using this wealth not to enrich foreign multinationals but to raise the standard of living of the neglected people of bolivia in 2006 evo morales asserted public ownership over the country s gas and oil resources making foreign companies turn over extractive industry resources to the state the state now fully controls sales transport and distribution as well as key decisions regarding the extraction and refining of raw materials the nationalization decree also forced foreign oil companies to renegotiate contracts with the new administration today foreign corporations still extract most of bolivia s natural gas but do so as contractors hired by the state on the state s terms prior to the nationalizations not only of gas and oil but telecommunications water electricity and a number of mines foreign corporations pocketed about 85 of the profits generated by natural gas production morales increased the country s profit share from gas from about 15 before his presidency to between 80 90 in 2005 before nationalization government gas revenues totalled 0 6 billion in 2015 it was over four times as much 2 6 billion in fact down from 4 5 billion in 2014 in 2015 all gas and oil revenues yielded 4 billion making up nearly half of bolivia s export earnings over ten years evo s bolivia has gained 31 5 billion from the nationalizations compared to a mere 2 5 billion earned during the previous ten years of neoliberal policies this vastly increased revenue largely used to benefit the people starkly exemplifies the extent the people have been robbed to serve foreign corporate interests by the end of 2013 the state owned portion of the economy reached 35 double that of previous neoliberal governments the state has become the main generator of wealth and public investment amounted to over 5 billion in 2016 compared to a mere 629 million in 2006 much of this new revenue funds the country s impressive development infrastructure community projects such as schools gyms clinics roads and subsidies for agricultural production it is spent on the people s health and education on price controls for staple foods on wage increases and social security benefits this humane redistribution of national wealth away from corporate interests to serving the poor majority has allowed one in five bolivians two million people to escape a life of poverty even the world bank has recognized the country as world champion in income growth for the poorest 40 of its population in the us the government is taking the opposite course turning its back on the poor here the poverty has grown over the same period from 12 3 to 12 7 vacant homes number 18 600 000 enough for each homeless person to have 6 the government cut food stamps by 8 7 billion in 2014 cut 500 000 poor from the program in 2016 with plans to slash 19 3 billion per year for ten years yet washington increases the military budget this year by 80 billion an amount that could make public college free for bolivia to industrialize and diversify the economy to move away from dependence on natural resource exports is a difficult long term task the country did create 485 000 jobs in the productive sector between 2006 2010 and developed industries to process natural resources it advanced significantly its agricultural production now providing 95 of the country s food yet raw materials still account for 90 of bolivia s exports big investments are underway in infrastructure construction hydrocarbon exploration industrialization of natural gas for fertilizers and plastics more lithium production and electric power for export here we have the presence of china with cooperation without pre conditions with credit without conditions evo morales said contrasting chinese aid to western aid new social programs to eliminate poverty in bolivia under evo poverty has declined from 60 6 of the population in 2005 to 38 6 in 2016 extreme poverty those living on less than 1 25 per day fell from 38 to 16 8 the real minimum wage has risen from 440 bolivars a month to 2 000 a month from 57 to 287 unemployment stands at under 4 the lowest in latin america down from 8 5 in 2005 here are some of the measures to combat poverty more than 4 8 million bolivians in a country of just over 10 million today benefit from these programs programs which not just combat poverty but improve public health and education meanwhile in the us the bottom 90 of households are poorer today than they were in 1987 bolivia has cut income inequality by two thirds with the share of income of the top 10 vis à vis the poorest 10 has dropped from 128 to 1 in 2005 to 37 to 1 in 2016 in the us after years of neoliberal programs we have the shocking fact that the three richest us citizens have more wealth than the bottom 50 of the population gains for rights of original peoples the country after a national discussion initiated by bolivia s five main indigenous campesino organizations adopted a new constitution the new document recognized bolivia as a plurinational state with equal status and autonomy for original peoples and also reclaimed control over natural resources the new government has even established a ministry of decolonization with a depatriarchalization unit to further the uprooting of the previous apartheid system by 2011 90 of the 166 elected representatives of the national assembly came directly from the ranks of the progressive social movements gains in education and health care bolivia had an illiteracy rate of 13 when evo morales became president after a mass literacy campaign that used cuba s yes i can program 850 000 were educated and by 2008 bolivia was declared free of illiteracy the country is second to cuba in latin america in terms of funding education there are now 16 000 educational establishments in the country 4 500 of them were built since 2006 with the funds from the nationalized gas industry life expectancy of bolivians during evo s presidency has increased from 64 years to 71 years this is partly the result of the almost 700 members of the cuban medical brigade working in the country cuba s operation miracle has also enabled 676 000 bolivians to have had their vision restored moreover around 5 000 bolivians have obtained their medical degrees in cuba going back to their country to provide their services the country now has 47 new hospitals and over 3 000 health centers being built land distribution and food self sufficiency before evo became president 5 of property owners owned 70 of the arable land from 2006 2010 over 35 million hectares of land 1 3rd of bolivia was handed over to original peoples peasant communities to be run communally this included government lands large estates and forest another 21 million hectares previously occupied illegally by large landowners were declared public lands mostly protected forests the land reform law expropriated underutilized lands and permitted seizure of property from landowners employing forced labor or debt peonage in all approximately 800 000 low income peasants have benefited of those who received titles to their land 46 have been women for the first time since the european conquest smallholders control 55 of all land the government ensures that these small producers receive preferential access to equipment supplies loans and state subsidized markets key factors in enabling the country to become self sufficient in food us interference and regime change attempts as john perkins points out in confessions of an economic hitman any government pursuing anti neoliberal economic policies or its own foreign policy independent of the us as the case with rafael correa s ecuador and evo s bolivia becomes a us target for overthrow evo morales has become one of washington s most disfavored leaders in the americas washington continues to be concerned about evo revolutionizing the indigenous movements in the region and tries to tarnish his reputation as an indigenous movement leader wikileaks documents show that the us tried to undermine the presidencies of evo morales and rafael correa even before they were elected right after evo s inauguration the us ambassador made it clear to him that funding by the inter american development bank idb the world bank and imf depended on his good behavior that is back off nationalizing bolivia s petroleum resources when morales rejected these orders including naming government ministers and military leaders without seeking prior us embassy consent washington began financing bolivian opposition groups seeking to overthrow the indigenous government washington used usaid ned idb world bank and imf to take punitive measures such as vetoing multilateral loans postponing talks on alleviating bolivia s foreign debts and discouraging international loans and grants us ambassador greenlee wrote in a cable in january 2006 just months after morales election u s assistance the largest of any bilateral donor by a factor of three is often hidden by our use of third parties to dispense aid with u s funds he noted many usaid administered economic programs run counter to the direction the gob wishes to move the country us embassy cables showed washington sought to create divisions in the social and indigenous movements that make up the support base of the country s first indigenous led government despite recognizing these were traditionally confrontational organizations vis a vis the us greenlee believed that working more closely with these social sector representatives who expressed dissent towards morales seems to be most beneficial to interests usaid poured at least 85 million into bolivia initially the us hoped to destabilize the government by training the separatists in the richer santa cruz area in the eastern lowlands usaid money flowed to groups in these opposition based areas as part of usaid s larger effort to strengthen regional governments as a counter balance to the central government soon these eastern regions the media luna were in open rebellion demanding a referendum on autonomy resulting protests led to the killing of at least 20 mas supporters who had mobilized to crush the rebellion the separatists goal was to divide bolivia into two separate republics a poor one governed by an indigenous majority and a much wealthier one run by european descendants in the areas home to the gas transnationals and large agribusiness the us never denounced opposition violence not even after the massacre of the mas supporters moreover the us embassy knew in advance of the opposition plans to blow up gas lines but did not report it nor even attempt to dissuade the opposition from doing so evo was soon to expel us ambassador goldberg for his interference nevertheless usaid still channeled at least 200 million into the country since 2009 usaid was eventually expelled in 2013 once the media luna separatist plan collapsed usaid switched to courting indigenous communities by using environmental ngos the aymaras evo is one and quechuas bolivia s two largest indigenous peoples live mostly in the highlands and central regions the east is home to the remaining 34 indigenous peoples in 2011 new anti government protests in the east again arose this time around a planned tipnis highway protests against the government around the tipnis isiboro sécure national park and indigenous territory the bolivian government planned to build a highway actually to widen pave and connect two roads with a 20 40 mile new connector going through the tipnis western funded ngos along with some local indigenous groups organized an international campaign against the mas government claiming evo was repressing the indigenous and destroying untouched nature this campaign was partly funded by usaid and received sympathetic reporting in nacla upsidedownworld amazon watch and other liberal left alternative media which either omitted or discounted the us role avaaz and allied ngos in solidarity with the protest groups organized international petition of protest this foreign interference served to exacerbate a resolvable internal bolivian dispute fred fuentes and cory morningstar wrote several exposés of this western campaign against evo the covering up of the facts surrounding the tipnis road and the protests including the usaid funding evo morales even revealed transcripts of phone calls between the anti highway march organizers and u s embassy officials including calls right before the march set out that the tipnis protest leaders supported the redd reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation which would give western ngos and these indigenous groups funds for monitoring tipnis forests was also not mentioned by liberal left alternative media redd uses poor nations for carbon offsets so corporations in rich countries can continue polluting many western solidarity activists uncritically supported the anti highway march many of their articles about the issue downplayed and made no mention of connections between the protest leaders and washington and the santa cruz right wing eventually the issue was resolved through a consultation process and 55 of the 69 tipnis indigenous communities agreed to the road us manipulation helped cause evo s loss in the 2016 constitutional referendum the us again intervened to influence the february 21 2016 referendum to change the constitution to allow evo morales to run again for the presidency a smear campaign against him took place including false stories of his corruption nepotism and fathering a child with a lover which led to him losing the vote the day is now recognized as the day of the lie on the 2017 anniversary mobilizations around the country backed the process of change and rejected the previous year s vote washington is already at work to block his renomination in 2019 usaid and ned funding of oppositional forces according to bolivia s cabinet chief juan ramon quintana from 2006 2015 ned funded around 40 institutions in bolivia including economic and social centers foundations and non governmental organizations for a total of over 10 million for 2013 the combined ned and usaid allocations for cuba venezuela ecuador and bolivia totalled over 60 million with the bulk of these funds destined to cuba and ecuador the issue of extractivism in bolivia linda farthing notes that in world colonial and neocolonial history the exploitation of considerable natural resources has also been nearly unparalleled it included spain s richest gold and silver mine one the richest tin mines two of today s largest silver and iron ore mines half of the world s lithium and south america s second largest gas reserves she adds it comes as no surprise that bolivia s history and environment have been dominated by relentless extraction a central challenge facing latin american governments is overcoming this dependency on raw material exports to a world market controlled by western powers this issue who some present as extractivism has become one of the main points of liberal left and environmental ngo criticism of the positive changes in both evo s bolivia and correa s ecuador extractivism is a deliberately politically neutral and ahistorical term that conceals the brutal history that created the present first world third world system extractivism glosses over what has been 500 years of mass murder of original peoples their slavery and semi slavery for the purpose of plundering their gold silver and other natural resources the third world remains dependent on raw material exports with their economies fragmented into specialized extractive industries geared towards a world market controlled by the first world alongside backward low tech domestic industries and a bloated informal sector bolivia cannot compete in industrial production with countries with more modern institutions citizens with a higher educational level developed infrastructure and with access to the sea to break free from being a low cost provider of raw materials whether mineral or agricultural will be a long process as fred fuentes notes the question of extractivism centers on how a third world country like bolivia can overcome centuries of colonialism and neocolonialism to provide its people with basic services while trying to respect the environment the main culprits are not bolivian but the western governments and their corporations defenders of the indigenous and bolivia must demand the west pay its ecological debt and transfer the necessary technology for sustainable development to countries such as bolivia until this occurs activists in rich nations have no right to tell bolivians what they can and cannot do to satisfy the basic needs of their people otherwise telling bolivian people that they have no right to a highway or to extract gas to fund social programs as some ngos demanded means telling bolivians they have no right to develop their economy or fight poverty environmental achievements bolivian vice president alvaro linera points out that bolivia contributes 0 1 of the world s greenhouse gases but its trees clean 2 of the world s carbon dioxide resupplying that as oxygen he attacks the western colonial elitist environmental ngos for imposing their environmental demands on the third world saying they are blind to the third world s right to development fuentes called out western so called defenders of bolivia s environment who attack evo morales over extractivism for not devoting a single article on how the government has drastically cut deforestation 64 between 2010 2013 he asked why have media outlets seemingly so concerned about bolivia s environment failed to investigate what might be the steepest reduction in greenhouse gas emission per capita of any country in the world they also do not mention that in south america bolivia has the greatest number of trees per inhabitant peru has 1 500 brazil 1 400 argentina 1 200 colombia 1000 ecuador 600 paraguay 2 500 bolivia has 5 400 and this year they will plant another 5 million misrepresenting the morales government s environmental record often aims to delegitimize morales position not only as a leading spokesperson for the indigenous but in the global fight against climate change evo has rejected the carbon offset redd schemes many western environmental ngos supported and clearly blames global warming on the first world s capitalist operations i m convinced that capitalism is the worst enemy of humanity and the environment enemy of the entire planet he has demanded the western rich countries repay their climate debt by transfer of technology and funds to the third world bolivia as a center of anti imperialist social movements the bolivian government has sought to build political alliances with other governments and social movements in order to help strengthen the global forces for fundamental change liberal left critics of evo morales who attack him around tipnis extractivism even for being a neoliberal so often willing to offer a checklist of measures for how bolivian socialism should be built so often willing to portray evo morales as backtracking after he took office tend to go mum on his anti imperialist measures conferences and statements evo morales has become an outspoken world leader against us hegemony and has pushed hard to make bolivia a center of anti imperialist social movements bolivia organized a number of international conferences people s summit on climate change 2010 anti imperialist and anticolonial summit of the peoples of latin america and the world 2013 anti imperialist international trade union conference 2014 the g77 summit of 133 third world nations 2014 the key promotor of the united nations world conference on indigenous peoples 2014 world people s conference on climate change and the defense of life 2015 world conference of the peoples for a world without borders towards universal citizenship 2017 he has called for rich countries to pay climate reparation to those poorer ones suffering the effects of climate change warning of a coming climate holocaust that will destroy parts of africa and many island nations he called for an international climate court of justice to prosecute countries for climate crimes in 2016 he inaugurated a military anti imperialist commando school saying we want to build anti colonial and anti capitalist thinking with this school that binds the armed forces to social movements and counteracts the influence of the school of the americas that always saw the indigenous as internal enemies besides expelling the us ambassador and usaid for their roles in coup plotting the drug enforcement administration dea was expelled in 2009 for its actions against social organizations and for interfering with the actual struggle against narco trafficking evo morales anti cocaine program has resulted in land used for coca production being reduced by one fifth since 2005 the oas considers bolivia s program a best practice replication it is also praised by the un office of drug control the dea s military base was transformed into the cochabamba airport and renamed soberania i am pleased to have expelled the u s ambassador the drug enforcement administration and to have closed the u s military base in bolivia now without a u s ambassador there is less conspiracy and more political stability and social stability and in reference to the imf and world bank which had served to force bolivia to divert funds away from social welfare programs he added without the international monetary fund we are better off economically speaking of the us 700 billion military budget evo said if that money was used for cooperation or to fight poverty we could solve so many problems the us creates and perpetuates international conflicts for profit the capitalist system that represents is not a policy that embodies the people of the united states but a policy of the transnational corporations especially those that commercialize weapons and push for an arms race they use any pretext against the anti imperialist countries to subdue and dominate them politically and rob them economically they re after our natural resources challenges facing the process of change evo has said that the retreat of the left in latin america is due to the incapacity of progressive governments to face a media war and the lack of political training of the youth vice president alvaro garcia linera also pointed out that progressive governments have failed to promote a kind of cultural revolution alongside the political revolution social programs have successfully lifted many out of poverty creating a new middle class with new consumerist attitudes without promoting a corresponding new value system progressive governments must do more to tackle the entrenched corruption of the neoliberal years the question of the continuity of leadership remains a challenge and latin american economic integration remains a weakness despite considerable advances in political regional integration three factors may cause bolivia s process of change to stagnate and be partially reversed it has not moved beyond anti neoliberalism policies that have brought great benefits to the people in a more anti capitalist direction while the mas government has democratized the traditional bolivian state it has modified this bourgeois state but not replaced it with a new one that would be a superior tool for the indigenous campesino and working people to advance their struggle it has not built an organization of activists committed to leading this struggle with the people now coming on 12 years of the process of change bolivia is a new country under the leadership of evo morales and garcia linera each passing year is one more of social political and economic transformation of opening up national decision making to the indigenous communities peasant and worker social movements not only have the faces of those who govern radically changed but the country itself from one of the poorest countries in latin america it has become the leader in sustained economic growth from a country founded on social exclusion to the point of apartheid it has become a country of inclusion for all where more than half the congress consists of women where illiteracy is eliminated where the people have free health care and education and have gained much greater control over the wealth of their natural resources notes linda farthing gives different figures the total government take shot up to about 70 percent of production making gas its primary income source with annual revenues jumping from 332 million before nationalization to more than 2 billion today these figures understate the actual figure as they exclude the 12 million undocumented who are disproportionately poor federico fuentes bad left government vs good social movements in steve ellner ed latin america s radical left

how major sectors fared in 2018 ibrahim apekhade yusuf and charles okonji in this report attempt a post mortem of major commanding heights of the economy in the outgoing year vis à vis their performances impacts and or otherwise in real terms to say the last 12 months have been momentous for the country is certainly stating the obvious from telecoms to manufacturing agriculture fiscal policy services to the formal and informal sectors the nation s economic managers sure had a lot of issues to ponder about in terms of regulation policy initiatives challenges and lessons learnt according to public opinion poll released by noipolls nigerians believe that the country has not fared well mostly in the areas of job creation 89 per cent infrastructural development 65 percent and the economy 63 percent on a brighter note 69 percent of nigerians believe that the country has fared well in the area of agriculture in 2018 job creation as a burning issue comes as no surprise considering the rising rate of unemployment in nigeria according to a national bureau of statistics nbs unemployment rates rose from 16 2 percent in 2016 to 18 8 per cent in 2017 data from trade economics revealed that gdp from agriculture in nigeria increased to n5 2 million in the third quarter of 2018 from n3 7 million in the second quarter of 2018 thus gdp from agriculture averaged n3 8 million from 2010 until 2018 reaching an all time high of n5 2 million in the third quarter of 2018 the devil in the details in its assessment of the first quarter 2018 the nigeria bureau of statistics nbs indicated that the country s economic growth slowed to 1 95 percent in first quarter of 2018 from 2 11 percent recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 it said real gdp value as at end march 2018 stands at n16 106 trillion as against the nominal gdp figure of n28 464 trillion according to the imf world economic outlook report released in july 2018 indicates that the nigerian economy was projected to grow by 2 1 per cent in 2018 and 2 3 per cent in 2019 however due to unfavourable developments in the economy this growth rate was downgraded to 1 9 per cent for 2018 this was specifically due to reductions in oil production and contractions in the agricultural sector a consequence of the so called farmers herders clashes among others according to the imf report another sign of a poorly performing economy was the state of the nigerian equities market with investors losing over n700 billion as at september 2018 with political uncertainty playing a role in the downward trend of the market thus the continual caution exercised by foreign portfolio investors in the market led to significant sell offs which also impacted negatively on the foreign reserves this scary nature of the continual fall in many stock prices has affected the desire by many to invest in the market these are clear signs of a troubled economy according to the imf world economic outlook report released in july 2018 indicates that the nigerian economy was projected to grow by 2 1 per cent in 2018 and 2 3 per cent in 2019 however due to unfavourable developments in the economy this growth rate has been downgraded to 1 9 per cent for 2018 this is specifically due to reductions in oil production and contractions in the agricultural sector a consequence of the so called farmers herders clashes among others according to the imf report the economy is said to be performing poorly in the past three months the nation s external reserves have been on a steady decline despite rising crude oil prices internationally the reserves have fallen from 47 8 billion to 43 97 billion indicating a seven month low this is a clear case of capital reversal as confirmed by the central bank of nigeria cbn due partly to developments in the united states where the benchmark interest rate has been increased for the third time this year with this development international capital from developing and emerging markets has been flowing in the direction of the united states of america lull in capital market last year also saw a run on the stock market with investors losing over n700 billion as at september 2018 with political uncertainty playing a role in the downward trend of the market banking the banking sub sector also witnessed some changes of some sorts in the third quarter of 2018 september to be precise skye bank plc was taken over by polaris bank limited due to financial distress financial in the takeover a fresh n786 billion soft and long term financing at single digit interest rate was injected to keep the rejuvenated operations ongoing while the initial n350 billion injected by the apex bank would be withdrawn at a joint press briefing by the apex bank and nigerian deposit insurance corporation ndic the regulators were unanimous in affirming the continued operations of customers accounts under polaris bank justifying the move the cbn governor mr godwin emefiele said the result of examinations and forensic audit of the bank revealed that skye bank required urgent recapitalisation and can no longer continue to live on borrowed times with indefinite liquidity support from the cbn but the shareholders of the bank have been unable to recapitalise it in a related development access bank acquired diamond bank the transaction rightly tagged deal of the year came as a huge relief also to the central bank of nigeria cbn which could have been called upon so soon after it liquidated skye bank to intervene the same way with diamond bank only that this time may be without the corresponding bail out because the regulator had hinted that such funds required to bail out any financial entity about n180 billion in the case of polaris bank was no longer available the cbn demonstrated its understanding in two ways first it sustained diamond bank s operation by granting it approval to operate as a national bank following its application for it with the approval and the change to national bank status it enabled the bank to maintain a lower minimum capital requirement of 10 per cent as against the 15 per cent required for international banks second according to the boards of access bank plc and diamond bank plc they have received no objection from the central bank of nigeria cbn regarding a potential merger between the two banks which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2019 ease of doing business despite many hiccups the nation scored some good point in the area of ease of doing business as it moved up the ladder in 24 places last year according to the senior special assistant to the president on industry trade and investment secretary to the presidential enabling business environment council dr jumoke oduwole who spoke recently in lagos during the lagos chamber of commerce and industry international investment conference with the theme promoting industrialisation for economic recovery and sustainable growth empahsised that there is a lot going for the country in the sme space oduwole who was represented by an official of the council mr soji akinyele disclosed that the action plan targeted the sme sector of the economy with 11 initiatives the first action plan contained eight initiatives for the sector oduwole pointed out that the first phase of the national action plan was responsible for moving nigeria 24 places up the ladder of the world bank ease of doing business ranking resignation of kemi adeosun perhaps one of the sore points of year 2018 was the resignation of mrs kemi adeosun as finance minister under controversial circumstances she was alleged to have forged her national youth corps service exemption certificate she was eventually replaced by the minister of state budget and national planning mrs zainab ahmed telecoms the telecoms sector also witnessed what could be best described as a dramatic turn of events mtn nigeria which was billed to enlist at the stock market had to pull the brakes following allegations by the attorney of general of the federation abubakar malami that the telco owed the federal government 2billion in tax debt which it had been repatriating abroad in the last few years the matter was a subject of lingering litigation but reason prevailed as the two parties agreed to an out of court settlement in a related development the stalemate which greeted the planned sale of 9mobile was also put to rest in the last quarter of 2018 following the takeover of the telco by teleology nigeria limited which announced the constitution of a new board of directors for the embattled operator experts verdict citing the gross domestic product gdp statistic released by the national bureau of statistics nbs in the last quarter of 2018 the director general of the lagos chamber of commerce and industry lcci muda yusuf said the economy grew by 1 81 year on year in the third quarter of 2018 this figure he stressed indicated an expansion in the economy for q3 2018 compared to the 1 17 gdp growth rate of the corresponding quarter in the previous year there is also an improvement in the quarter on quarter gdp growth rates from 1 50 in q2 2018 on the other hand the year on year nominal growth rate was 13 58 the real gdp value for q3 2018 stood at n18 1 trillion whereas its nominal value was n33 trillion reflecting the effect of inflation in nigeria this performance was however lower than the international monetary fund imf and economic recovery and growth plan ergp growth forecasts of 3 5 2 1 and 4 1 respectively for 2018 the exchange rate he stressed was relatively stable in 2018 in different segments of the fx market for instance at the parallel market the naira hovered within the band of n361 n363 the interbank foreign exchange market moved around n305 75 n306 and at the i e fx window the naira traded within the tight band of n360 95 n363 32 higher oil prices and stable local production levels of crude oil are the two key critical factors that helped to restore calm in the forex market the local forex market is already responding to recent sharp fall in oil prices for instance the local currency has dropped to n373 in the parallel market from n363 it traded for a better part of 2018 after 18 consecutive months of decline inflation rate began to rise in august 2018 with headline inflation of 11 26 in october 2018 compared to 15 13 in january 2018 and 18 7 in january 2017 following the bottoming out of high base effect in august 2018 the country is likely to see headline inflation trending up in the early part of 2019 the 2018 world bank ease of doing business report ranked nigeria 146 out of 190 countries the report showed that the country took a step backwards from the 145th position it ranked in 2017 the ranking takes to account trading regulations property rights contract enforcement investment laws and availability of credit this ranking did not reflect efforts of the present administration through the presidential ease of doing business council pebec and series of presidential executive orders targeted at improving the business environment in the view of the director general of the nigerian association of chambers of commerce industry mines and agriculture naccima ambassador ayoola olukanni 2018 was a tough year but there are small mercies summarily 2018 is a mixed bag for us we worn in some areas and we lost in some areas so let us learn lessons from the areas we lost and build on it for 2019 in terms of increasing the space of opportunities for the private sector he said like naccima the president manufacturers association of nigeria mansur ahmed said the manufacturing sector didn t fare any better according to him the manufacturing output in the year 2018 was not encouraging there is the need to sustain investment and to push the sector forward to avoid what happened in 2018 repeating itself expatiating he said in 2018 the manufacturing sector grew by 3 and later went down to 1 5 which indicates the tragic fall in the overall manufacturing suffered loss in capacity utilisation it recorded 54 in 2018 as against 57 in 2017 again if you look at the budget there is a significant reduction in the allocation to agriculture where as in 2018 the allocation was over n89 billion and in 2019 it came down to about n80 billion this is not good for the growth of the sector
via kitco bankruptcy happens gradually then suddenly ernest hemingway all signs point in the same direction we are heading toward another financial crisis and this time it will likely be much worse than 2008 there is a growing chorus of economists and analysts who have already sounded the alarm but most tend to wrap their warnings in mind numbing statistical detail in the following article i aim to outline where we are and how we got here in a simplified manner with the hope that you can prepare yourself as best you can in the early 2000s i wrote several articles warning investors about skyrocketing deficits debt overvalued stock markets and dangerous policy decisions by government and the federal reserve as we all know by 2008 a lot of what i was afraid would happen happened when the crash came i further predicted we would not go into a depression quite yet for one simple reason the fed would print a lot of new money quantitative easing which would act as a floor for the entire financial system i warned we would pay the price down the road because there is no such thing as a free lunch or as the eagles song says every form of refuge has its price one should never underestimate the power of greed however what i did not predict was which road would lead us to perdition namely that the easy monetary policy of near zero interest rates and quantitative easing would fuel a global debt bomb and stock market frenzy that is currently magnitudes larger than the level of debt that triggered the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008 to me it seemed that given that near death experience it would be unfathomable for policy makers to allow the financial sector to not only continue piling up debt but to do so at a breath taking pace i guess one should never underestimate the power of greed so here is how it played out in simple terms when the 2008 crisis unfolded the us government and the federal reserve bailed out the financial sector to prevent the entire system from imploding to achieve this they took interest rates to zero printed 3 5 trillion of new money and ran up the fiscal deficits with an initial 700 billion bailout however instead of bailing out joe average on main street all that new and free money was only made available to those who already had money and coveted more wall street which caused the problem in the first place corporate america the one percent and the us government there is nothing like the offer of free money to make moral hazard popular especially on wall street in economics moral hazard occurs when someone increases their exposure to risk when that risk is insured especially when a person takes on additional risk because someone else bears the cost of that risk in this case that someone was the government and ultimately the taxpayer global debt has nearly doubled since 2008 we live in an environment where risk is not only encouraged but where investors believe they have policy makers as a back stop to protect them in the event of a crash they feel they can count on being rescued by the same failed policies that bailed them out in 2008 this blind greed is what has led us to the current insane levels of debt all categories of debt have gone through the roof global debt government corporate household and financial has nearly doubled to 247 trillion since 2008 that is debt that will never be paid back ever in the us alone federal government debt now stands at 21 trillion it was 8 trillion in 2006 which i thought was dangerous back then it boggles my mind that every year since 2008 policy makers and wall street economists have been talking about normalizing rates getting them to a fed rate of five or six per cent with a straight face how will anyone be able to service let alone pay back this pile of debt with normal interest rates they can t this is the same box japan has been in for the past 30 years since its own financial crisis if japan allowed normal interest rates the country would be bankrupt and it s not only the us that s sitting on a time bomb china has a big problem too its 34 trillion pile of public and private debt is an explosive threat to the global economy by one estimate china s borrowing has quadrupled in seven years to a lesser but equally dangerous extent many other major countries face similar issues with debt including italy why should we care about china and italy our global financial system is such that a financial accident in one location can easily set off a series of events that jeopardizes the entire system think back to the role tiny iceland played at the beginning of the last unraveling in 2007 contagion spreads quickly in our interconnected global financial system what might trigger the next crisis we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us so what might trigger the next crisis and why won t we have the tools we had in 2008 to prevent a total collapse let s look at where all that newly borrowed money went and again i am simplifying things at the height of the financial crisis when policy makers were selling the public on the need to bail out financial institutions we were told that by doing so and by making money cheap banks would lend to thousands of businesses that would make capital investments and create jobs but for a number of reasons corporate america decided instead to use all that free money to boost share prices via share buy backs dividends and mergers and acquisitions wealthy individuals also used cheap money to inflate the values of high end properties worldwide the result was that artificially low interest rates caused the s p to rise by 300 percent from its post crash lows and an additional 80 percent from its pre crash peak both corporate and stock markets are now in bubble territory due to artificial central bank driven low interest rates that have everyone chasing ever riskier investments to achieve higher returns why is this happening consider that 17 trillion of new wealth was created by the s p in the last 10 years those who benefit are those who can access that easy money but are also encouraged to be profligate namely the banks hedge funds and corporate directors and officers in other words the one percent as for the folks on main street who never had an opportunity to tap into that open spigot they saw their income barely budge income inequality in the us is among the worst in the developed world one would think the one percent would be content after this much pillaging not quite as a final cash grab reminiscent of the roman general scipio who not only destroyed and plundered carthage but as a final insult also plowed over and sowed the city with salt after defeating it in the third punic war congress passed a multi trillion dollar tax cut that benefited mostly the very rich and left the bill to future taxpayers this was a last attempt to goose an already overvalued stock market it worked well for about a year loose threads will unravel the next crisis can start out of nowhere it can be triggered by the failure of a financial institution a made at home political crisis or a serious geopolitical event anything that removes the cloak of confidence that the entire financial system is based on all it will take is something to tug on that loose thread hard enough to unravel that confidence and expose how naked the system truly is and that s when the panic sets in when everyone starts to rush for the exits asset values stocks bonds real estate crash my guess is that as markets continue to weaken we will expose an over leveraged institution that will intensify a panic in the markets which in turn will expose the problems in other institutions and so on and so forth until policy makers are compelled to act this is exactly what happened in 2008 but this time we don t have the same tools to prevent a collapse lowering interest rates isn t really an option printing more money would have serious repercussions for the value of the us dollar and other forms of fiscal stimulus for the economy will only add to the country s debt load which could spark panic among foreign lenders the tool box is empty simply put we squandered our chances over the past 10 years the tool box is empty the impending unravelling will be ugly if you thought the rise of populism that took place as a result of the inequality that deepened in the aftermath of the last crisis was bad read a few history books and brace yourself for what happens when populism really takes hold the reader may ask what can i do to prepare unfortunately the answer is not much no one will remain unscathed i believe that in this scenario all asset prices will fall this time even cash which was king during the last crisis might have risk given an inflationary depression scenario gold might fall in the initial stages of a panic as it did in 2008 but recover strongly once the markets see the endless money printing on the horizon recent market activity suggests a major correction has already begun be prepared for a drawn out roller coaster ride with intermittent moments of reprieve provided by comforting words from the fed talk of trade war resolutions sporadic upbeat economic data etc how to manage your risk however you can manage your risk by being cautious i suggest some cash a lot of gold and a lot of praying no one likes a party spoiler especially a chicken little there were plenty of people besides me warning investors in the years preceding the 2008 crisis a lot of them far smarter than i am but when panic sets in it moves at breakneck speed and most people freeze hoping it s just a bad dream that will go away by the time they decide to act asset prices are at rock bottom i am often asked advice which i am loath to give when markets initially start to correct many people s first reaction is to hold on until a bounce brings them back to the value before the correction this is how greed works i always ask the question how important is that marginal upside to you in a market that is already overvalued and are you willing to risk the value of your portfolio if things really fell apart just to get that extra little upside so you have a couple of choices take some chips off the table or party like it s 1929

beijing china s economic performance in 2018 was rather disappointing according to official statistics the country s growth rate up to the end of the third quarter was 6 7 per cent the lowest since the global financial crisis the real situation was probably even worse a lack of progress on institutional reform together with obstacles to structural adjustment have been fuelling doubt among many foreign and domestic observers about china s growth prospects some even anticipate a financial crisis caused by a bursting housing bubble or large scale debt defaults by local governments and corporations the trade war with the united states only deepens such worries although a slowdown was inevitable in china after four decades of breakneck growth the chinese government should try to stop further deceleration this year otherwise china s economic financial and social stability will be jeopardised this can be achieved if the government adjusts its macroeconomic policy stance begin with monetary policy the people s bank of china pboc is currently responsible for at a minimum maintaining the stability of economic growth employment prices and the exchange rate that is too many objectives to pursue simultaneously as reflected in sudden and frequent monetary policy reversals since late 2011 the pboc has changed its policy stance four times in response to fluctuations in housing prices but its manoeuvres have often undermined its other objectives for example while tightening monetary policy can rein in runaway housing prices it exacerbates the growth slowdown in fact monetary tightening might not even be called for though many argue that the pboc s past liquidity injections especially its large stimulus in response to the 2008 global economic crisis caused the real estate bubble housing prices began to skyrocket long before indeed it is not at all clear that increasing the money supply boosts prices it may even work the other way around because rising housing prices have absorbed too much liquidity the pboc has to increase the money supply to support the real economy with china s growth steadily declining and the consumer price index at around 2 per cent the pboc would do well to adopt a more expansionary monetary policy fiscal levers can be used to contain housing prices which given popular frustration with the real estate market remains an important objective of course expansionary monetary policy would put downward pressure on the renminbi compounding the effects of the us federal reserve s fed ongoing normalisation of interest rates but that needs to be allowed to happen with the pboc no longer shouldering the responsibility for maintaining exchange rate stability for too long china s obsession with currency stability has deprived the pboc of true monetary autonomy it is time to move on chinese enterprises should have learned by this point how to protect themselves from exchange rate fluctuations and china maintains capital controls that effectively protect it against an excessively sharp devaluation let alone a run on the renminbi in any event the more important challenge for china s leaders is to devise a new approach to fiscal policy even us president donald trump s administration with its limited understanding of economics recognises government s vital role in strengthening areas in which the private sector has insufficient incentive to invest but that are important to national security and economic stability at the end of 2017 china s official public debt to gdp ratio stood at 36 2 per cent the real figure is probably significantly higher if one accounts for contingent liabilities especially the debts owned by local government financing vehicles but even then china s fiscal position is rather strong compared to most countries especially bearing in mind that not all local government debts are bad debts this means that china still has room to pursue expansionary fiscal policy with a focus on reversing the investment slowdown that fuelled the decline in gdp growth in 2018 in the first three quarters of 2018 fixed investment grew by just 5 4 per cent year on year compared with 7 5 per cent in 2017 largely because growth in infrastructure investment which accounted for some 27 per cent of fixed investment plummeted from 19 8 per cent in 2017 to just 3 3 per cent in 2018 a major concern here relates to the efficiency of infrastructure investments but the concern that inefficient investments are fuelling debt accumulation can be addressed effectively with better designed projects and appropriate limitations on the role of local governments in particular rather than permit local governments to borrow from commercial banks to fund infrastructure investments the central government should foot the bill the combination of higher expenditures and lower revenues resulting from tax cuts and fee reductions may cause china s budget deficit to gdp ratio to exceed 3 per cent but like the cny7 threshold for the us dollar exchange rate that threshold should not be considered sacred as long as interest rates for government bonds can be kept low the government should not be afraid to issue more of them expansionary macroeconomic policy alone will not resolve all of china s problems in the long term and it undoubtedly carries significant risks but given the paramount importance of stabilising growth the chinese authorities need to use all of the tools at their disposal yu yongding a former president of the china society of world economics and director of the institute of world economics and politics at the chinese academy of social sciences served on the monetary policy committee of the people s bank of china from 2004 to 2006 copyright project syndicate

investors and analysts believed the u s federal reserve s cautious stance on monetary tightening and market optimism about global trade boosted the yuan while depressing the u s dollar usd till the end of friday s trading session the yuan surged around 0 7 percent to roughly 6 74 yuan per u s dollar recovering a considerable part of its steep losses since april 2018 while marking a vigorous start of the new year two main drivers behind yuan s bullish mood the current appreciation in the cny exchange rate came mainly as a result of the overall pressure on the usd index and the expectation for an easing of the china u s trade dispute said the foreign exchange desk on treasury department bank of china new york branch in an analysis china s economy has been undergoing structural reform with the introduction of various macro economic policies the bank believed that the yuan s strong buying momentum showed world financial markets have restored confidence in the chinese currency with the deepening of china s reform and opening up steady expansion of the domestic financial market and the higher status of cny in the international monetary system it is expected that investors willingness to hold cny will increase further said the bank s foreign exchange desk the resumption of trade talks between the united states and china is another booster of the market optimism and the rise of the yuan it added danske bank the largest bank in denmark believed that the significant depreciation pressure on the yuan is turning into a moderate strengthening trend we see two main drivers behind the stronger cny 1 rising optimism about a trade deal with the united states and china 2 an overall weakening of the usd on the back of more dovish speeches by federal reserve members that suggest it will be on hold for a while it said in a note on friday the danish bank said market expectations for progress in china u s trade talks and for the performance of chinese economy in the second quarter this year will offer more tailwinds ahead to the yuan bank of america merrill lynch predicted that the yuan would rally toward 6 65 yuan per u s dollar given that possible progress in china u s trade talks would result in risk on emerging market sentiment according to its weekly foreign exchange report released on friday it also expected the u s dollar to weaken in 2019 over the waning u s fiscal stimulus the ongoing u s government shutdown and a cautious fed that has become more dependent on economic data in policy making fed s dovish stance weakens dollar the latest remarks of the fed s chair and other officials continued to weigh heavily against the greenback as investors built up their bets on fewer interest rate hikes in 2019 fed chairman jerome powell stressed patience in the central bank s policy making at a forum held at the economic club of washington on thursday saying we re waiting and watching as inflation is low and under control bank of china said powell s remarks strengthened the fed s dovish attitude which drove the u s dollar index to weaken overall the index which measures the greenback against six major peers is a key metric of its value they were indications that the u s central bank would likely loosen its constraints on the money flowing in the market which would consequently pare the greenback s comparative edge its next rate hike is expected to be postponed kevin chen chief economist of the u s wealth management firm horizon financial told xinhua on friday chen added that the value of the yuan has been on the rise as an emerging market currency while global risky assets overall including equities have been rallying which dampened the u s dollar s safe haven demands charles evans president of the federal reserve bank of chicago said on thursday that the fed had good capacity to wait in terms of determining whether to raise interest rates or not the fed officials remarks were in line with the federal open market committee s fomc s cautious stance on the fed monetary policy which was seen in its dec 18 19 policy meeting minutes released on wednesday the committee could afford to be patient about further policy firming said the fomc a fed branch that determines u s interest rates and money supply growth considering the status quo of the financial markets the committee stressed that a relatively limited amount of additional tightening likely would be appropriate moreover u s consumer price index fell in december for the first time in nine months to the weakest reading since march last year according to latest data released by the labor department on friday the tepid data indicated mild inflation pressure which would give fed the leeway to mull their rate hike decisions further later this year chen noted that the u s dollar extended losses due to slowing u s economic growth a move too to drive the yuan to appreciate considering the current strong rebounds downward risks for the yuan is expected to take a break now the foreign exchange desk of bank of china noted that opportunities and challenges would coexist in the movement of the yuan exchange rate in 2019 which it said will be

this is the fifth article in an occasional series exploring wealth and income inequality in connecticut and its impact on a state struggling to cope with massive debt find the other articles here for nearly a decade it has been the favorite argument of those opposed to higher state taxes for connecticut s wealthy migration simply put if you tax them they will leave for republicans and many moderate democrats income and wealth migration is not only a very real threat but a problem that s already upon us as connecticut increasingly raises taxes to cover surging pension costs among labor urban democrats and other progressives however the millionaire with a suitcase is a myth a fiscal boogey man used to scare liberals but despite the preponderance of stories of wealthy residents fleeing connecticut the empirical evidence shows the rich tend to move less frequently than low and middle income residents the need for employment is still one of the main reasons people move while home and business ownership most common among high income households promote stability more importantly income migration hasn t been a big driver of states overall economic health one of the largest tax cuts for the rich in modern connecticut history nearly three decades ago did not spark an influx of millionaires into this state but that doesn t mean connecticut has nothing to fear research shows the wealthy pay more attention to state tax rates than any other economic class although the sample size is small the ratio of income leaving connecticut versus that moving in has accelerated in the last few years as decades of fiscal carelessness at the capitol garner increasing media coverage connecticut s affluent can see a scenario in which they long have been targeted to pick up the tab and as politicians raise state taxes with increasing frequency while the highways and rail systems serving fairfield county slow down wealthy families say they are losing patience people move because of professional opportunities said university of connecticut economist fred carstensen who heads the connecticut center for economic analysis they retire and choose a lifestyle which leads some to move taxes have ranked as a particularly strong driver it s not that important but it s a convenient thing to talk about but former hedge fund manager david stemerman of greenwich a republican who centered his 2018 gubernatorial bid on a message that connecticut taxpayers have been taken for granted for decades said a reckoning is underway 2018 republican gubernatorial contender david stemerman this assumption that the wealth in fairfield county would always be there was built up to some degree by a lack of engagement from fairfield county stemerman added but they also have the view that they ve been taken advantage of well the door swings both ways migration trends at first glance at first glance income migration appears very real connecticut lost 16 33 billion in annual federally adjusted gross income between 1992 and 2016 according to an analysis of tax data prepared by regular forbes contributor travis h brown creator of the website howmoneywalks com it was one of 25 states that lost income during that period due to migration there are exceptions hawaii which ranks third in median household income gained a modest 933 million in annual adjusted gross income but many of the biggest losers on that list are states that ranked and still rank among the highest in income in the nation besides connecticut it also includes california new jersey maryland and massachusetts in other words the people moving out of rich states usually are richer than the people moving in year after year not surprisingly the reverse is also generally true of the 10 poorest states based on per capita income four lost income via migration between 1992 and 2016 and only two louisiana and oklahoma lost more than 1 billion arkansas gained 2 66 billion during this period consistently adding income most years yet still scores badly on most metrics used to measure poverty but even after the annual exodus the rich states usually are still rich and the poor states usually are still poor according to statistics from the state department of revenue services the number of connecticut households that reported earning more than 1 million erupted upward by 124 percent between 2002 and 2007 after climbing just 8 6 percent over the prior five years this happened even while income was migrating annually out of the state simply put the boom within connecticut overwhelmed any migration trends embedded elites or transitory millionaires so maybe migration hasn t been a key factor in moving a state up or down the wealth scale at least so far an analysis published in 2016 in the american sociological review concluded the wealthy generally are embedded elites and not transitory millionaires we find that millionaire tax flight is occurring but only at the margins of statistical and socioeconomic significance wrote the panel of stanford university sociologists and u s treasury department economists who reviewed census data and 45 million tax records dating back 13 years researchers concluded the wealthy are sensitive to state and local tax rates more so than the rest of the population but they are different in other ways as well wealthy households are embedded in the regions where they achieve success and they have limited interest in moving to procure tax advantages researchers wrote why so the study found that richer people are more likely to be married have children and to own their own homes and businesses it also found the business connection should not be underestimated as an impediment to moving when economic success is a joint product rather than a purely individual accomplishment there is a difficult network coordination problem for migration one s own willingness to migrate for tax purposes must align with that of co founders collaborators and perhaps even clients analysts wrote people who achieve top incomes in this view are deeply embedded insiders who yield remarkable returns in part because of their social placement in a localized economic world the study found the migration rate nationally of households reporting more than 1 million in income per year was 2 4 percent which is lower than the 2 9 percent rate for the general population researchers did find that florida appears to be the core pathway for tax induced migration but other low tax states are nowhere close to being equally attractive to the wealthy florida which ranked 39th in per capita income in 2017 according to the u s census bureau gained the most income through migration but florida generally is considered an outlier given its extremely attractive climate when florida is excluded there is virtually no tax migration the report states ct gave the rich a big tax break in 1991 the 2016 study of millionaire migration found much of the growing interest in higher tax rates for the wealthy is a response to federal tax policy of the past three decades that policy largely was a shift away from taxation of the elite a process to untax the one percent that includes reductions in tax rates on top incomes capital gains and multi million dollar inheritances an oct 23 poll commissioned by sacred heart university and hearst connecticut media group found almost two thirds of connecticut voters support raising income taxes on millionaires to balance the state budget if cuts to services can t do the job one hole in the millionaire migration theory can be found through an analysis of federal tax data and connecticut history one of the forgotten side effects of the establishment of a state income tax in 1991 was that it offered an enormous tax break for connecticut s wealthiest residents who already had been paying income taxes for 20 years prior connecticut used to impose taxes on capital gains dividends and interest provided a household made enough of them since the early 1970s gov dannel p malloy credit mark pazniokas ctmirror org by 1991 connecticut taxed capital gains at 7 percent the top rate on dividends and interest was 14 percent but once the state income tax was established all earnings capital gains dividends interest and general wages were taxed at the same flat 4 5 percent rate that was huge for connecticut s wealthiest households which traditionally derive the bulk of their income from investments according to a 2018 report from the legislature s nonpartisan office of fiscal analysis a connecticut household earning 96 000 per year generates less than 10 percent of its income from investments for a household making more than 2 million per year the average share approaches 79 percent even today the top rate on the state income tax stands at 6 99 percent that effectively matches the capital gains rate pre 1991 and represents only half of the top rate from back then on dividends in other words many of connecticut s wealthiest households pay the same or a lesser effective income tax rate now than they would have in 1991 and when connecticut dramatically cut taxes on investment earnings 28 years ago did the rich come pouring into the state according to internal revenue services tax migration data the incomes of those moving out of connecticut topped those of the households moving into the state for the entire decade of the 1990s major tax hikes coming more frequently but this doesn t mean wealth and income migration don t exist and there are reasons carstensen said why connecticut policymakers should be concerned for one thing it s a short ride to any of connecticut s borders we have the highest proportion of residents who work out of state of any state in the country carstensen said adding that s a major reason one key metric of economic health has been sketchy economists look not just at overall state income tax receipts but also at what share they represent of overall household income total receipts fell from almost 3 9 percent of total household earnings in connecticut in 2012 to 3 6 percent in 2014 the last year of available data carstensen said much of that decline he added involves connecticut s struggles to regain financial services sector jobs lost in the last recession some of those displaced connecticut residents found new jobs in new york and new jersey and there is another issue the state tax hikes are coming more frequently a poll released in the summer of 2009 by quinnipiac university found 55 percent of voters didn t believe increasing taxes would prompt the wealthy to leave connecticut compared with 42 percent who said it would but a few months after that the legislature and gov m jodi rell agreed upon a new budget that increased taxes by nearly 875 million the centerpiece of that plan was a big bump in the top marginal income tax rate from 5 to 6 5 percent two years later gov dannel p malloy signed into law a tax hike worth more than 1 8 billion per year and while it also raised income tax rates on middle income households it boosted the top marginal rate to 6 7 percent malloy who warned frequently about the threat of wealth migration had inherited an unprecedented 3 7 billion deficit equal to more than 18 percent of the general fund during his first year in office connecticut business and industry association economist peter gioia a third major tax hike in 2015 worth almost 900 million per year included another boost in the top income tax rate up to 6 99 percent is income migration starting to accelerate income migration out of connecticut may be nothing new but a small sample size shows the rate appears to be accelerating though irs tax migration data is available going back several decades the federal government switched to a new measurement methodology beginning with its comparison of the 2011 and 2012 tax years according to that new methodology the ratio of income leaving connecticut versus that moving into the state is larger now than it was for most of the past two decades and the ratio has risen significantly during the last two years on record in 2014 income moved out of connecticut 1 31 times faster than it moved into the state when compared against the previous year by 2015 the exit ratio was 1 53 to 1 and by 2016 it had reached 1 80 to 1 there s a whole cottage industry of financial advisors that are talking to people about this tax trend and showing them where else they can go said peter gioia chief economist for the connecticut business and industry association that s what is hurting connecticut now more than anything and i think it will continue to accelerate gioia also dismissed the argument that migration isn t a problem as long as florida is the only popular destination one attractive alternative to connecticut is risky enough we re an old state and people want sunny weather he said decades of pension debt take taxpayers for granted and don t underestimate the impact of growing news media coverage of connecticut s irresponsible history of amassing pension debt and the pressure it is putting on state finances warned state rep chris davis of ellington ranking house republican on the finance revenue and bonding committee rep chris davis r ellington credit keith m phaneuf ctmirror org if you speak to a lot of people especially those nearing the end of their working years they are looking at the state of connecticut now and they see a mindset of perpetual tax increases said davis stemerman who lost a five way gop primary to former ge executive bob stefanowski raised similar concerns during the campaign what s happened in connecticut is now so bad that people all over the state including fairfield county know something is wrong said stemerman connecticut amassed more than 80 billion in retirement benefit debt and other unfunded liabilities with most of that damage done between 1939 and 2010 for decades governors and legislatures routinely shortchanged contributions to pension benefits they pledged to state employees and teachers effectively mailing a bill to future taxpayers sometimes the fiscal abuse was extreme for example between 1979 and 1988 the state never contributed more than 40 percent of the recommended payment for the teachers pension analysts now are projecting debt costs will skyrocket over the next decade and a half placing extreme pressure on state programs many of which have been cut in recent years and taxes which already have increased significantly stemerman said those who discount the theory of wealth and income migration should not underestimate common sense the message connecticut sent for generations is clear the state could afford to postpone billions of dollars in contributions thereby forfeiting billions more in potential investment earnings because its wealthy taxpayers could always make up the difference at some time in the future when i spoke to people about this they were deeply disappointed dismayed and disgusted by what they heard stemerman said they spoke about this in simple terms of fairness they are being stuck with a bill from a failure to make responsible decisions according to state department of revenue services data households that earned more than 350 000 per year in 2016 just 3 percent of all filers paid 41 percent of all state income taxes stemerman said while he believes taxpayers across connecticut feel taken advantage of when they hear the state pension history the sticker shock is severe in fairfield county because of geography it is part of the new york media market he said they are somewhat disconnected to what is happening in hartford some feel they ve been taken advantage of while they were not as engaged or paying attention as well as they should have greenwich billionaire thomas peterffy attracted headlines in 2012 when he funded a superpac that spent tens of thousands of dollars on commercials criticizing democrats running for the state legislature peterffy who grew up in socialist hungary and immigrated to the united states in 1956 eventually would launch interactive brokers an online brokerage firm based in greenwich i grew up in a socialist country he said in a youtube video titled freedom to succeed and i have seen what that does to people there is no hope no freedom no pride in achievement the nation became poorer and poorer and that is what i see happening here peterffy added that america s wealth comes from the efforts of people striving for success take away their incentive with bad mouthing success and you take away the wealth that helps us take care of the needy peterffy moved to florida following the 2014 elections the most recent forbes magazine list of the nation s 400 richest people listed nine billionaires from connecticut which is two more than last year but just a few years ago connecticut boasted 13 billionaires doing too much or too little for hedge funds and those wary of connecticut s rising taxes warn that a small but vital component of the economy the hedge fund industry has great potential to be mobile bruce mcguire president of the connecticut hedge fund association credit keith m phaneuf ctmirror org according to the state s nonpartisan office of legislative research connecticut has the second largest hedge fund industry in the

business leaders expressed fears that connecticut s hedge fund industry could shrink as other states try to lure managers away bruce mcguire of darien president of the connecticut hedge fund association said the state should be developing high speed rail services creating vibrant cities and offering tax incentives to preserve and grow an industry that pays more than its fair share of taxes instead it has allowed its highways to become congested and rail service is slower now than it was decades ago i live here i spend money here i bought my house here mcguire 54 said adding that his daughter a recent college graduate went to work for a tech company in boston now i feel like i should be telling my son to go to new york go to boston easing the taxes on the rich if state officials underestimate public indignation when it comes to connecticut s legacy of pension debt some argue the estate tax is another major turnoff for the wealthy jim smith left and robert patricelli credit ctmirror org the tax is applied only to estates valued at more than 2 6 million though the maximum tax liability starting in 2019 is capped at 15 million still connecticut is one of 17 states that levies an estate or an inheritance tax and the trend is headed away from connecticut indiana and tennessee repealed their taxes in 2013 and 2016 respectively while delaware s went away this year new jersey s estate tax will disappear starting january 1 congress recently raised the exclusion level on the federal estate tax from 5 49 million to 11 2 million connecticut has adopted a plan to gradually raise its exemption level up to the federal threshold by 2020 but with major state budget deficits projected between now and then it remains unclear whether the general assembly will stick with that plan eliminating connecticut s estate tax entirely while reducing income tax rates were two of the key recommendations this year from the state commission on fiscal stability and economic competitiveness a 14 member panel dominated by business leaders the co chairmen health care entrepreneur robert patricelli and webster bank chairman and former ceo jim smith have taken heat from labor leaders and other progressives for this plan even though it recommends boosting the minimum wage to 15 per hour it hinges on tax cuts that benefit the wealthy the most to fund these tax cuts the commission also recommends boosting sales and business taxes and cutting 1 billion from the state s operating budget given that most of the state s debt costs are fixed by contract critics say this cut likely would fall heavily on municipal aid driving up property taxes the commission s proposals taken holistically can change connecticut s future smith said patricelli says the panel s work is not perfect adding the group essentially had just two months to chart a blueprint for reversing seven decades of irresponsible budgeting and promoting statewide economic prosperity there s still room

s focus for his first budget due in february is clear connecticut s middle class deserves a break and that s where we re going to concentrate the energies of this administration and the budget he said labor pushes back critics of the fiscal stability panel often point to one comment from commission member cindi bigelow ceo of bigelow tea who said during a feb 9 public hearing that we want to make

ten years after china helped stave off the threat of a global depression with a huge stimulus plan investors are looking once again toward beijing as the world economy heads for a slowdown or worse in 2019 booming china has accounted for about a third of the growth in the global economy in recent years so recent signs that it is losing momentum is unsettling when the us boom turbo charged by president donald trump s tax cuts of 2017 seems to have peaked and europe s heavyweights are stalling china s slowdown is already being felt around the world from apple s profit warning due to weaker sales of its iphones to carmaker jaguar land rover laying off workers after a 22 per cent fall in sales in the country in 2018 policy sources said the government is planning a lower economic growth target of 6 6 5 per cent for 2019 after an expected 6 6 per cent in 2018 which would be the slowest expansion since 1990 in the first few days of 2019 china raised infrastructure spending with a 34 billion railway investment and its central bank loosened the screws on banks to encourage them lend more its fifth such move in a year china that s what worries me most joachim fels managing director and global economic advisor at bond giant pacific investment management company said as he surveyed the outlook for the world economy in 2019 as well as cutting china s appetite for imports a deeper slowdown could weaken its yuan currency and fan the flames of the trade war between beijing and washington however fels said his recession models for 2019 were flashing only orange warnings not red in part because the us federal reserve was likely to pause its run of interest rate hikes after one or two more increases china is expected to do more to act to help its economy too although officials in beijing say they do not plan a stimulus of the magnitude of the nearly 600 billion package unleashed in 2008 shortly after the collapse of lehman brothers i find it hard to look at it historically and bet against the chinese authorities managing to stabilise their economy jim mccormick global head of desk strategy for rbs division natwest markets said when china wants to stabilise its economy they tend to be successful in november the organisation for economic co operation and development trimmed its forecasts for chinese growth to 6 3 per cent in 2019 followed by 6 0 per cent in 2020 since then the impact of us china trade tensions have become more apparent oecd senior economist margit molnar said suggesting the forecasts could be lowered again higher borrowing by local governments in china suggested a pick up in infrastructure spending was coming she said potentially helping to offset signs of fragile confidence among chinese consumers the major issue is to guarantee a gradual slowing molnar said for the time being the concerns of investors in late 2018 about the global economy have eased leading to a tentative recovery in battered stock markets a round of talks between us and chinese trade officials in beijing did not end in acrimony and in europe a slowdown is probably in part due to one off factors such as new pollution rules for carmakers and the impact of the gilets jaunes protests in france which has been felt in the supply chains that stretch across the border into germany steven bell chief economist with bmo global asset management said surveys of purchasing managers in the private sector around the world suggested a broad pick up in industrial production was not far off and for many consumers in rich economies low inflation and gradually rising wages will help their spending power but even if the world economy avoids a painful slowdown this year it faces daunting fundamental challenges many countries seem stuck in a rut of slow productivity growth which puts a brake on earnings and has propelled the rise of populist politics from trump to the protests in france reuters william schomberg

cnn so much ink has been spilled for so long on the national debt it might be nice if that 22 trillion plus on the red side of the us balance sheet just didn t really matter that s exactly the thinking behind a new school of economic theory that the government should be spending more not less the status quo is that republicans promised strong growth kickstarted by the tax cuts they passed without democratic help would help pay for the tax cuts themselves that s a question mark in any case but it will only really work with so called entitlement reform to curb the growth in spending of medicare and social security they passed the tax cuts the easy part without addressing the spending the hard part the end result is that the us deficit the amount of money the us government takes in from taxes and other things subtracted from the amount it spends is projected to be more than a trillion dollars this year in total it ll be 22 trillion any day now and it s going to get a lot bigger cue the annual ish political fight over raising the us debt limit the top amount the government is allowed under law to borrow by the way lawmakers don t even raise the debt limit any more recently they ve just suspended the idea of a debt limit for a year democrats indicated this year they want to create an automatic mechanism to raise the debt ceiling but republicans aren t sold on the idea growing debt has caused more than its share of distress among politicians who warn about the dangers of the us essentially being in hock to its creditors but no amount of warning has stopped each successive recent president from finding a way to add their own spending projects but never enough belt tightening to offset new spending the last time the us didn t spend more than it took in was in 2001 george w bush spent big on the war on terrorism and also his prescription drug addition to medicare barack obama spent big on stimulus during the great recession and on obamacare and donald trump spent on his tax cuts when democrats took power in congress a new wave of of lawmakers wanted to scrap nonbinding so called paygo pay as you go rules so that they could introduce and vote for new government programs to give free education and better health care and deal with climate change without having to pay for them by either raising taxes or cutting spending elsewhere in the budget democratic elders prevailed for now on that front but it s clear that more progressive democrats who helped land their party the majority and who are more in line with the bernie sanders wing of the party than the hillary clinton one have big plans for the government to help people and no desire to balance the budget alexandria ocasio cortez the poster child for the new democrats has spoken freely about her desire to impose a marginal tax rate upward of 70 on the wealthiest americans that sounds politically crazy after republicans just lowered taxes on the wealthiest americans but it s not exactly unprecedented similar rates were in place under republican and democratic administrations in the 50s and 60s nor is it out of step with what a lot of economists have been saying according to an approving column by new york times columnist paul krugman ocasio cortez and other progressives like sanders aren t afraid to talk about spending trillions on new programs without cutting other programs debt be damned you can pay for it by saving costs on expenditures that we re already doing ocasio cortez recently told business insider we can do it by saving money on military spending we can pay for it by raising taxes on the very rich we can pay for it with a transaction tax we can pay for it with deficit spending the school of thought that allows such dreams modern monetary theory suggests seriously that if a government that controls a currency needs more money it just prints more it can t go bankrupt if it s printing its own money just print more essentially the idea is that the deficit actually equals wealth in the private sector and that s a good thing what are the treasuries securing that debt if not the promise of newly printed money and as long as there s a market for them they should be used by the government to improve society if that sounds a bit socialist it is but so are the self described democratic socialists like sanders and ocasio cortez the liberal krugman for the record while approving of the higher taxes has been less friendly to mmt as its known while it may literally be true that a government with its own currency can t go bankrupt it can destroy that currency if it loses fiscal credibility he wrote back in 2011 but people like stephanie kelton sanders economist in 2016 a professor at stony brook university and a proselytizer for this view toward currencies and national economies argues that the government essentially prints money each time it authorizes new unpaid for programs and that it hasn t hurt the economy by causing runaway inflation we asked her for her her thoughts on the national debt as it approaches 22 trillion that exchange is below cnn we ve spent years and years in us politics worrying about the national debt which is going to hit 22 trillion any day 22 trillion sounds like so much money and the rate at which the debt has been increasing seems to be speeding up why is this not such a big deal kelton few people understand what the national debt is and most people tend to conflate government deficits with the national debt so let s start by clarifying these terms the national debt is nothing more than a historical record of all the dollars that were spent by government but not taxed back when the government spends more than it collects in the form of taxes and other payments we label it deficit spending but that s only part of the story to complete the picture suppose the government spends 100 into the economy but only taxes 90 back out the result is a surplus equal to 10 that shows up somewhere in the non government part of the economy in other words the government s red ink becomes our black ink their deficits are our financial surpluses so where does the debt come into play whenever the government runs a deficit it sells government bonds called u s treasuries this is usually referred to as borrowing but that s actually misleading what s really happening is that the government is allowing people to trade in their dollars for a bond that pays some interest a pretty good deal if you happen to be lucky enough to hold some of that 22 trillion cnn what size annual deficit would worry you and why kelton inflation is the relevant risk not the size of the annual deficit in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis budget deficits rose to more than 10 percent of gdp they were big by historic standards but they were nothing to worry about in fact most economists seem to agree that bigger and better targeted deficits would have helped the economy recover much more quickly today the government is running annual budget deficits that are expected to reach 1 trillion that s a lot of zeros but so what remember their red ink is our black ink what worries me about the deficits we re running today is not their size but their nature a big part of the reason the government is running bigger deficits right now is because republicans voted for tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the richest americans and large corporations income and wealth inequality already at alarming levels will only widen so i worry about the way these deficits are being used to funnel resources to the people who least need the help cnn if republicans can slash tax rates and democrats should pass massive benefits programs like medicare for all and free college without regard to debt what s the brake what keeps politicians in check with what they can promise to voters or should there be a brake kelton the brake is inflation if policymakers run wild cutting taxes and pumping money into the economy with reckless abandon inflation will spike and voters will presumably check those politicians at the ballot box so in a sense democracy is the thing that keeps politicians in check but that doesn t mean we can t pass medicare for all or make public colleges and universities tuition free even with the tax cuts in place the debt is not the constraining factor except perhaps politically the point is this the economic constraint is inflation cnn part of what you argue is that if inflation gets out of hand that s a good time for congress to raise taxes but the political momentum is in the opposite direction as we saw last year with the tax cuts what s your thinking on where political reality runs into economic theory kelton i believe the government should use the federal budgeting process to maintain a balanced economy that means balancing the risks of inflation against the benefits of full employment it means embarking on new spending programs only if those programs can be implemented without causing excessive inflation it might be necessary to raise taxes in order to prevent say a massive infrastructure program from pushing the economy beyond its limit but taxes aren t the only way to curb inflation the most important thing is to understand what s actually driving the inflation historically the big drivers of inflation have been energy housing and health care so even if the political reality means you can t raise taxes you can still fight inflation with policies that increase the supply of available housing units promote energy efficiency and lower health care costs i also wouldn t discount the possibility that our political realities might evolve rather quickly with an mmt informed congress cnn is mmt a socialist idea or is it a free market idea explain kelton neither mmt is mostly a descriptive project it provides a lens that can be used to understand how a modern capitalist economy works based on that understanding mmt also offers a prescriptive side which shows how fiscal monetary regulatory policies can be used to constrain inflation while maintaining full employment cnn if the national debt

in recent weeks the macro story focused on the shifting outlook for fed policy and the sino american trade relationship there is unlikely to be further progress on either issue in the week ahead the fed won t until toward the middle of the year at the earliest the government shutdown will limit new readings on the us economy us and chinese officials just met mid level chinese officials can easily sign on to buy more us foodstuff and energy because they previously agreed to do this the more contentious issues will take further negotiations the next set of talks will take place at the end of this month when chinese vice premier liu he travels to washington the focus in the in the week ahead shifts to europe and the outlook is not good the protracted and painful uk exit from the eu is approaching a climax of sorts as the house of commons will vote on the withdrawal bill worrisome economic data from the eurozone will likely include softer and recession like drop in despite the gestures concessions and threats prime minister may appears unable to marshal a majority of the house of commons to support the agreement struck with the eu the bbc projects that the government is facing a defeat of historic proportions it shows as many as 433 mps will vote against the bill and 206 in favor of it one study noted that in the past century the government has been defeated by more than 100 votes three times and the largest margin was by 166 this obviously increases the likelihood of a disruptive exit without an agreement it is not clear what happens next may has rejected a plan

march 29 pricing in the options market looks as if traders have pushed their expectations out as well reuters reports that the two largest donors of brexit hargreaves and odey now fear that it will not take place at all the former expects that a delay will be implemented before a second referendum is called and the latter appears to have reversed his initial trading position is now playing from the long side sterling rallied strongly ahead of the weekend it traded on both sides of thursday s range on friday against both the and and closed above thursday s high outside day this bullish price action suggests market participants may be looking beyond the january 15 vote in the house of commons sterling closed at its best level against the dollar since november 22 the nearby hurdle for sterling is about 1 2870 and a move above there can see an assault o 1 30 the recorded an outside day and an outside week against sterling confirming a near term top is in place over the past five months the euro tried to convincingly penetrate gbp0 9100 with little success the market appeared to have given up on this and took the euro to gbp0 8920 50 day moving average before the weekend the 100 day moving average is found near gbp0 8900 and a break of the gbp0 8880 area could spur another 1 drop in the euro which requires breaking below the 200 day moving average near gbp0 8860 although the are countless imponderables about brexit on increased chances of a delay while the economic political outlook in emu take a toll the euro can return to the lower end of the broad trading range that goes back to mid 2017 in the gbp0 8700 to be sure the news from the eurozone is moving from bad to worse economic activity slumped sharply in november fanning fears of a recession especially in germany and italy which contracted in q3 economists had expected and industrial output to have expanded by 0 3 in november instead it fell 1 9 and 1 6 in germany and italy respectively industrial production in germany was 4 7 lower than a year ago and 2 6 lower in italy and reports were equally dismal economists had expected spain s industrial output to have risen by 0 4 it fell by 1 5 for a 2 8 year over year contraction french output was forecast to be flat but it reported a 1 3 decline for a 2 1 year over year fall the eurozone will report the aggregate figure at the start of the new week economists have revised their forecasts and now look for a 1 5 decline which would be the year over year rate to 2 1 the weakest in five years economists and perhaps officials have been slow to recognize the magnitude of the economic slow down that hit the euro area in h2 2018 except for the employment data economists forecasts median in the bloomberg surveys have consistently been above the actual reports what is going to end the surprise will economists begin adjusting their forecasts or with the economic activity strengthen we think that risks remain on the downside for the upcoming economic data the auto sector may be an important part of the drivers so to speak of the economic slowdown and emu auto registrations a proxy for sales may attract more attention than usual some national figures do not look good and that is after november registrations were 8 8 lower year over year the euro area also reports construction output for november the construction sector has contracted for three of the four months through october construction is strong in eastern and central europe in emu germany 5 0 year over year netherlands 7 7 and portugal 4 5 stand out construction output for the eurozone as a whole rose 1 8 year over year in october in addition to weakening activity price pressures have subsided the preliminary december report showed that eurozone cpi slowed to 1 6 from 1 9 in november this largely reflects the decline in prices and can be expected to be confirmed toward the end of the week ahead the rate was flat at 1 0 the preliminary january figures wouldn t be published until february 1 two considerations show little change so far rallied 25 off the late december low but reversed ahead of the weekend and is now virtually unchanged from a month ago deutsche bank s trade weighted index for the euro is slightly softer from a month ago there is little pressure on the ecb to make a formal decision for a few months like the fed it can be patient we think the risks of diverging action by the two central banks near the middle of the year is more likely than the consensus we expect domestic and foreign economic conditions an easing of equity volatility and a clearer picture on trade to allow the federal reserve to hike rates around the middle of the year around the same time the ecb will likely conclude that a new targeted long term

his administration has been targeted his assessment that too many of our citizens think they can get something without making the necessary effort is often the sentiment of elites and will win him few new friends the cabinet of spain s minority government approved a budget that raises taxes on high income earners and boosts infrastructure spending while it may be broadly consistent with the demand for the gilet jaunes it looks likely to struggle in parliament the debate could take the next few weeks but the inability to pass a budget would likely trigger snap elections after resolving its budget dispute with the eu the populist nationalist government in italy faces a new crisis albeit modest over a troubled previously family owned bank carige mi the interplay between national law and eu regulation requires some difficult decisions by people who have been very critical of past support for banks not a penny more may be a nice rallying cry when in opposition but when actually faced with the choices the lesser evil is often chosen no matter how distasteful while we see the main focus being in europe in the week ahead there are three other developments to monitor first the us government shutdown is now record long what has been a stalemate with the between the executive and legislative branches may involve the judicial branch if the president declares an emergency to circumvent the legislative branch s power of the purse the longer the shut down continues the more harm is done to the economy and the enforcement of regulations the white house economic adviser hassett was just as tone deaf as macron when he said that the furloughed workers were better off because they did not have to take vacation days over the holidays second the has appreciated by about 3 2 since the end of october part of this reflects the setback in the us dollar more broadly the recovery of many emerging market currencies we think it is also likely that china is allowing it to appreciate to remove a potential flashpoint in negotiations with the americans however yuan strength runs contrary to the thrust of policy which is aimed at supporting the economy we have been looking for china to signal that it does not want further appreciation and press reports quoting a source close to the pboc indicated as much that means to expect the dollar to trade between cny6 70 cny7 0

what hit headlines on the first working day of the new year was the finding that china s gross domestic production gdp growth in the last quarter of 2018 would remain below 6 5 percent according to the china finance magazine that is published by the people s bank of china u s based companies that sell a great number of goods to china lowered their sales and profit forecasts for the first quarter of 2019 expecting that the sales in the chinese market would go down to the short term turmoil in currencies of many emerging countries it seems that the economic circles and the financial markets are in a state ready to take an immediate position against all kinds of bad news in 2019 even though organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec member and non member countries have cut their production by 1 2 million barrels from jan 1 onward the decline in the oil prices are still continuing due to the expected shrinkage in oil demand in the first days of the year the u s energy information administration eia withdrew its crude oil price forecast to 61 keeping in mind that turkey is a country which primarily does substantial exports to first and second generation neighboring countries like russia and qatar for the decline in commodity prices to not affect turkey s export performance we must have a strong target market diversification it can be said that 2019 is a year whose luggage is full due to the global regional political tensions and uncertainties over primarily the u s china trade war the global debt problem of over 250 trillion the monetary policy preferences of the leading central banks and the syria issue under the eu title let s also add to these issues brexit the elections for the european parliament in may the problematic italian economy the election of a new president to the european central bank ecb and the risk of recession for eu economies let s not also forget the elections in india thailand argentina and south africa developing economies will have to manage their monetary fiscal and direct control policies with high caliber attention and acumen for such a loaded 2019 countries agendas full for 2019 all countries carefully followed by the international economic circles have a troublesome agenda for this year in addition to the decline in inflation rates the chinese economy is going through a troubled period due to the loss in production and consumption rates and the effect of the chinese central bank sustaining the monetary expansion on the chinese economy s performance is unclear regarding the level reached by real sector credits having said that how the first phase of the negotiations on the trade wars between china and the united states ended is also arousing curiosity for the last one and a half years many international institutions have warned that trade wars do not have a winner today both the u s and the chinese administrations are aware of the fact that trade wars are beginning to harm their country s economies therefore they will appear to have produced a solution without losing their status on the u s front it was understood that u s federal reserve fed officials had made the new interest rate hike with hesitation especially during the last month s meeting on top of that there are moderate statements coming from fed presidents who are authorized to vote on monetary policy whereas there are pigeon statements from those who are not authorized to vote the expectation and probability prospect that the u s economy is facing a recession a serious depression has doubled compared to three months ago this is why the statements from fed officials seem to have thrown the euro dollar parity over 1 15 things do not seem to be going easy on the eu front either the european agenda is quite intense from the brexit vote in the u k parliament on jan 15 to the european parliament elections in may from the concerns on the italian economy to who will be elected as the ecb president in the midst of these uncertainties the world bank pulled down its global growth expectations for 2019 and 2020 the global growth forecast for the end of 2018 has been lowered from 3 1 percent to 3 percent for 2019 from 3 percent to 2 9 percent and for 2020 from 2 9 percent to 2 8 percent it expects the global growth to be 2 8 percent in 2021 while the world bank predicts for the developed economies to close the end of 2018 with 2 2 percent it has shaped its forecast as 2 percent for 2019 the same data for developing economies for the end of 2018 has been dropped down from 4 5 percent to 4 2 percent for 2019 from 4 7 percent to 4 2 percent and from 4 7 percent to 4 5 percent for 2020
with more stock market volatility likely and slower economic growth on the cards investors must exercise caution this year writes louise mcbride investor pessimism is high this new year the dismal performance of a number of stock markets in 2018 disappointed many trade wars brexit and rising interest rates weighed heavily on investors minds and continue to do so one of the biggest concerns on investors minds today though is whether or not we re on the cusp of a recession the current economic cycle which began in march 2009 has been going on for almost 10 years this makes it one of the longest stretches of global economic growth on record the question i keep getting is when will this economic cycle end said davy head of global investment strategy alan werlau we are moving into a period in 2019 when the economy will still be growing but at a slower yet healthy pace although barclays believes that investment returns this year won t be any worse than in 2018 the financial institution is urging investors to be cautious bit by bit 2018 has turned into a nightmare for global financial assets said barclays in its latest global outlook we do not believe financial assets will rebound strongly in 2019 the good news is that 2019 returns are unlikely to be as bad as 2018 at some point this year the us federal reserve will likely approach the end of its interest rate hiking cycle we expect the world s major economies to still grow at or above trend on the other hand global growth should be a little weaker in 2019 than in 2018 after years of positive returns and low volatility in the run up to 2018 investing is set to become more challenging in the months ahead barclays is advising investors to lower their expectations and to be nimble in our view the best years of the decade long economic recovery and market rally are behind us said barclays in its global outlook we recommend entering 2019 with a cautious frame of mind with subdued expectations for financial market returns and prepared for the higher financial volatility which accompanied the october sell off to be more persistent than such spikes have proven in recent years so against this backdrop of investor caution and slower economic growth which investments could come up trumps in 2019 and which could disappoint healthcare shares barclays describes itself as cautiously optimistic on us equities in particular us healthcare information technology and materials stocks stockbroker davy is also tipping global healthcare stocks the sector we like most and which we feel will continue to do well is healthcare said werlau global healthcare stocks are offering fair value we like healthcare as a sector because it performs well at this point in the economic cycle we feel healthcare will continue to outperform in 2019 and beyond in particular the shares of healthcare companies specialising in global ageing or global obesity could be worth considering according to werlau quality stocks investors should increase their exposure to quality stocks stocks which typically offer more reliability and less risk advised werlau when you are late on in an economic cycle the emphasis should be on getting quality stocks into your portfolio said werlau quality stocks typically include companies with good corporate governance clean and strong balance sheets and less debt walmart mcdonald s pfizer and procter gamble are some stocks recently tipped by the us financial giant citigroup as quality stocks worth considering some stocks recently described by the investment bank goldman sachs as ones which it considers to be of high quality include alphabet the owner of google pepsico and mastercard companies with strong competitive advantages are also worth considering according to the dublin wealth management business gillen markets ryanair is one company which has a much lower cost base than all its competitors said david coffey senior investment adviser with gillen markets while the airline industry is cyclical in nature it is also a structural growth story as people continue to travel more regularly a cyclical stock is a stock whose price is affected by ups and down in the economy gold inflation inflation is something investors should watch closely this year and which could see gold and silver mining stocks do well according to coffey with many developed economies already at or close to full employment inflation may start to edge higher in 2019 said coffey we believe that gold and silver miners would benefit if inflation was to move substantially above 2pc gold tends to do well when inflation is high and the gold and silver miners are highly correlated with the price of gold and silver we also think the gold miners look like good value at current levels regardless of what happens with inflation and if inflation does go higher the goldminers should benefit the philadelphia gold and silver miners index a stock market index of 30 precious metal mining companies is back trading at levels it traded at in 1983 this sector has been out of favour with equity investors for a long time and may appeal to contrarian investors emerging markets some analysts expect emerging market shares to do well in 2019 but others are more cautious emerging markets include the markets of emerging or developing economies such as china and india i think the global economy will do well next year and in that environment emerging markets are the one to buy said andrew milligan head of global strategy with aberdeen standard investments asi we like emerging market debt emerging market debt includes sovereign and corporate bonds issued by less developed countries such bonds often carry a lot of risk though as more than 20 countries are considered to be emerging markets and the performance of each of these countries shares and bonds varies widely do your research if considering investing in emerging markets in our view investors hoping for a repeat of 2017 when virtually all emerging market financial assets did very well are likely to be disappointed in 2019 said barclays in its latest global outlook emerging market financial assets in general are unlikely to have a strong 2019 china s slowing exports are likely to be one of the challenges facing emerging market equities this year but emerging market credit is likely to be more resilient according to barclays commercial property logistics could be one of the best performing parts of the commercial property market this year according to asi logistics market conditions are thriving particularly in fringe locations close to major conurbations where ecommerce is boosting demand said asi in its latest european real estate outlook there is strong demand for last mile delivery hubs for retail goods bought online vacancy rates are low and competition from higher value land uses is limiting supply too asi also believes that investors in private rented accommodation in major european cities could do well this year particularly in germany austria switzerland netherlands and the nordics it also expects investment returns on prime offices typically offices based in major commercial centres and close to good transport links in major european cities such as amsterdam stockholm berlin lisbon and madrid to be strong investment no nos shares of carmakers concerns about the environmental impact of diesel and petrol and plans to ban such fuel have put many car manufacturers under pressure we re wary of auto stocks around the world because of the pressures on that sector said andrew milligan of aberdeen standard investments from a european investor point of view one of the big issues they need to think about in 2019 is diesel and slowing car sales luxury brands barclays is not that keen on us consumer discretionary stocks the stocks of companies which produce or sell goods and services that people want but don t necessarily need davy too is cautious about consumer discretionary stocks we have cut exposure to consumer discretionary stocks such as luxury brands as these are the things which people stop buying when things get slower said alan werlau of davy european shares european shares may not deliver the best returns this year eu companies have not been creating good profit growth recently said milligan then on top of this there are worries about brexit and italy europe has certainly seen a big growth slowdown in recent months european equities is not the most attractive of markets one thing to watch this year is how well will the populist parties do and what that will mean for the monetary union and the european economy ftse 350 and brexit uncertainty around brexit continues this year with investors watching if and how britain will leave the eu investors in domestic oriented british companies are likely to be badly burnt regardless of whether the uk government can secure a deal with eu on brexit or not according to werlau if you need to be in the british stock market the ftse 100 is the only place to be said werlau avoid the ftse 350 or domestically oriented british companies as these are likely to get hit more given the weak sterling there are a number of possible brexit scenarios that could unfold one involves a deal between the uk and the eu on brexit another involves the failure to secure such a deal and another scenario is where there is a second referendum on brexit in which the uk votes to stay in the eu if a deal happens the market will probably rally said werlau sterling will be stronger and people will be happy that would be a relief though short lived a lot of the uncertainty around brexit has slowed business sentiment and hurt consumer confidence any euphoria that will come will eventually wear off i wouldn t expect a strong sustainable rally of sterling or of stock markets domestic oriented uk companies would suffer the most in a no deal brexit according to werlau if there s no deal sterling will probably get weaker and it will stay weak for a while said werlau the ftse 100 would probably be okay and benefit from the weak sterling small and mid sized uk companies would probably get crushed at this stage if we had a second referendum where the uk votes to stay in the eu you d get a rally sterling would firm up against the euro and the dollar
the newly emerged middle class are trailblazers in their own nations and represent on a massive scale agents of global economic transformation their effect on the global economy is already starkly apparent in the seismic shift in global economic gravity over the past few decades due to a myriad of factors greater trade and investment flows urbanization expanding labor forces rising wages infrastructure spending rising life expectancies political stability prudent macroeconomic management and of course the emerging middle classes of many developing nations the world has been turned upside down as recently as 1980 the world economy beat to the tune of the united states in particular and the developed economies in general the west towered over the rest but currently the tables have turned according to the international monetary fund where the developing nations accounted for roughly one third of world gdp in 1980 this cohort now accounts for over 55 of the global total with china the world s second largest economy leading the way by pumping millions of new workers into the global labor force over the past three decades china and other developing nations have dealt both a supply side shock more workers and demand side shock more consumers to the world economy much of the economic narrative over the past few years has been focused on the former notably in many developed nations the united states included where the common refrain is that the rising supply of workers in the developing nations has undermined the jobs and incomes of workers in the west to a degree this is true although many empirical studies suggest that more united states jobs have been lost to automation and technological advances than to low cost labor in mexico or china the more salient point is that the millions of workers in the emerging markets are also consumers with more disposable income than their parents or grandparents ever had while the spending power of the west has been diminished by the united states led financial crisis and ensuing austerity in euro zone area of the european union the purchasing power among developing consumers is on a secular upswing where in the past factory workers in asia would trudge off to work on saturday morning today they are more likely to head for the local shopping malls for a day of socialising and shopping any first time visitor to the emerging cities of shanghai dubai mumbai ho chi minh city istanbul and sao paulo is struck by the vigor and vitality of the local consumer out in force and shopping in an air conditioned mall that might be mistaken for a mall in suburban america the size and scale of these urban buyers and their pent up demand for electronic goods appliances automobiles skin care products clothing and other goods are increasingly setting global trends emerging market consumers are leading in global fashion and driving global sales in a number of industries indeed in a seminal shift global consumption is tilting toward the developing nations and away from the united states and the west according to both the recent undp and imf documents the gap in global personal consumption is narrowing in favor of the developing nations where the spread was roughly 80 20 in favor of the developed nations in 1980 the spread has now narrowed to roughly 60 40 and the will have little doubt that in the not too distant future the lines will cross with the newly emerging middle class poised to take the global baton of consumption from consumers in the west and as the emerging market middle classes consume more world trade flows are being altered according to the imf a shift in world imports is well under way with the developing nations share of world imports reaching a record 56 last year totalling a record 10 5 trillion again in just a matter of years the lines are set to cross and imports from the developing nations led by rising purchases of goods and services from the middle class are set to easily supersede those of the developed nations the aftershocks from the rise of the middle class in the developing nations are evident in various guises their pent up demand for electronic goods appliances automobiles skincare products clothing and other goods has reached the point where emerging market consumers are now dictating the global revenues and profitability of these industries and others in addition as the new global consuming class adopts and acquires western lifestyles moves from the village to the city works in air conditioned offices drives to work consumes more protein there will be greater demand and higher prices for energy water agricultural goods and other natural resources put in another way the monopoly the west has long enjoyed in devouring the world s natural resources is over for much of the post cold war era the equation was rather simple the developing nations produced commodities and the west consumed them those days however are past millions of the new middle class consumers are pressuring the global commodity infrastructure there is a dramatic shift in underlying demand for global energy with the developing nations clearly now the global drivers of energy demand and prices according to the imf the same holds true for the global consumption of meat fruits and vegetables with the developing nations driven by a more affluent emerging market consumer already out consuming the developed nations pick virtually any commodity and the story is basically the same copper silver iron ore meat corn wheat soybeans the future price of these commodities and others will increasingly reflect the rising per capita incomes and attendant jump in consumption among consumers in the developing nations in the end the world has changed in the years ahead the global economy will increasingly beat to the tune of millions of other middle class consumers
already struggling to make ends meet the masses are braced for yet another mini budget a second by the incumbent government finance minister asad umar says the mini budget to be unveiled on jan 23 will facilitate businessmen and carry good news for the stock exchange but with the government already struggling with crises such as those relating to fiscal deficit and balance of payments expecting good news is like expecting the unexpected and since a budget is all about generating money people know very well that they are only going to be burdened with more taxes in the new mini budget the tsunami of change has transformed into a storm of inflation in just five months of the new government economic indicators both at the maco and the micro level are nothing to write home about the rupee has plummeted to an all time low against the american dollar foreign exchange reserves are alarmingly low exports have only marginally increased despite a massive depreciation of the rupee bears continue to dominate the stock market due to uncertainties over the government s economic policies and in the political arena the central bank s interest rate has gone up to 10 a cut in the development outlay in the first mini budget is feared to bring down the economic growth from 5 8 in the last fiscal year to something around 4 in the ongoing one household budgets too have taken a huge hit while power and gas tariffs have undergone big hikes the trickle down effect of the falling oil prices in international market has been too small the rise in the value of dollar has its effects too the prices of medicines have already gone up by up to 15 and those of many other imported items are anticipated to rise adding to all that is the government s anti encroachment drive that has resulted in huge unemployment and that too at a time of increasing hardship published in the express tribune january 13 2019 like opinion editorial on facebook follow etoped on twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces

first a review of last week s events eur usd on wednesday january 9 after repeated attempts the pair managed to break through the upper limit of the mid term side channel in which it was located starting from november 2018 having overcome the resistance in the area of 1 1500 it reached the height of 1 1570 after which the followed by a trend reversal and the pair once again found itself within the above channel ending the week at 1 1470 the weakening of the dollar was influenced by a number of factors the unplanned holidays of the us government a very cautious pigeon speech of fed chairman jerome powell at the economic club meeting in washington where he pronounced the word patience five times but the main factor according to many experts was the active strengthening of the chinese yuan before the expected signing of a trade agreement with the united states gbp usd recall that only 15 of analysts sided with the bulls last week but they were right unclear prospects for the dollar outweighed the concerns associated with brexit the pound was supported by positive uk gdp data released on friday january 11th as a result the pair rose by almost 150 points reaching the height of 1 2865 after which a slight rebound followed and the quotes dropped to the zone of 1 2840 usd jpy after the new year storm caused by the lack of liquidity the japanese currency is complete calm moving in a fairly narrow side corridor within 107 75 109 10 the pair met the end of the week in the same place where it started near the pivot point 108 50 the reason for this is the emerging balance between the attractiveness of the yen as a safe haven currency and the growing interest in other currencies that can bring grat profits if a trade deal is concluded between the us and china cryptocurrencies our review is fundamentally different from other reviews in that it is not an opinion of one particular analyst in our analysis we strive to collect as many opinions of various experts as possible so that getting rid of harmful noises we can identify the main trend that determines the movement of the pairs in one direction or another however it can be very difficult as for example now for cryptocurrencies some experts consider the decline of the main crypto pairs last week as the end of the positive correction that started in mid december 2018 and a return to the negative dynamics of the market and someone on the contrary see it as a post holiday syndrome at the end of which the quotes will again rush up whatever it may be the crypto market s capitalization fell from 138 billion on january 6 to 123 billion on friday january 11 having lost almost 11 the quotes of major cryptocurrencies bitcoin litecoin ethereum ripple and many other also fell thus the pair btc usd is traded near the three week low in the 3 700 zone the reasons for the fall are the fact that investors hoping for a festive gap disappointed are now closing their positions and the fact that about 40 000 ethereum coins have been stolen from gate io exchange the news about the failure of the japanese regulator fsa to launch etf based on cryptocurrency might also add to the negative reasons in general there are many reasons but the fact remains that all the main altcoins have moved to the red zone and are traded down from 5 to 23 as say eth as for the forecast for the coming week summarizing the opinions of a number of analysts as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis we can say the following eur usd as you know the european currency has a strong correlation with oil and metals and on the commodity market we are now witnessing a positive trend especially with regard to energy the intentions of opec to completely remove the excess oil from the market should lead to a further increase in prices which plays into the hands of the euro the pause taken by the fed regarding the increase in lending rates for the us dollar is worrying investors as a result at the moment 65 of analysts supported by 90 of oscillators and 70 of trend indicators on d1 have voted for the rise the pair above the 1 1500 zone up and its growth first to the height of 1 1550 and then to the level of 1 1625 the experts who still remain loyal to the us currency believe that returning to the medium term channel 1 1300 1 1500 it will not break out of it for a long time and this is why the pair is expected to decline first to its central line 1 1400 and then 100 points lower gbp usd it is clear that the absolute majority of indicators are currently colored green however already 10 of oscillators on d1 signal that this pair is overbought the possibility of its falling to the horizon 1 2600 is indicated by graphical analysis on the daily time frame as well as for experts there is no clear advantage here either for bulls or bears 55 of them have voted for the growth of the pair and 45 are for its fall on tuesday january 15 the british parliament will vote on brexit it is likely that the version of the agreement with the eu proposed by prime minister teresa may will be rejected and another delay is coming at the same time it is becoming more and more obvious that a tough divorce with the european union is not included in the government s plans which positively affects the quotes of the british currency the additional support for the pound is rendered by the rise in oil prices until the results of the voting become known there is no sense to make any predictions one can only specify the key levels support 1 2780 1 2720 1 2660 and 1 2600 resistance 1 2925 and 1 3050 usd jpy indicators and graphical analysis on d1 predict a strengthening of the japanese currency with which 65 of experts agree they expect the pair to decline to 107 50 107 80 and then even lower to support 106 70 on the other hand due to low interest rates in japan the pair is quite strongly correlated with the major global stock indices and the upward trend in this market implies a possible growth of the pair to the levels of 109 10 and 109 45 and in case of the breakdown of the latter its transition to the zone of 110 25 110 80 cryptocurrencies despite the fall in the crypto market capitalization the average daily number of transactions with bitcoin approached 280 000 over the last week which is comparable to the peaks of 2018 therefore it is is hardly worth it to predict the end of the benchmark cryptocurrency and indeed the entire market but the probability of the btc usd breakout of support 3 700 and its return to the mid december lows in the 3 250 zone remains quite high this scenario is supported by 45 of experts most analysts believe that next week the pair will be able to stay in the three week speculative zone of 3 685 4 385 however they speak very cautiously about the rise to the level of 5 000 and only in the longer term the expectations for ethereum are somewhat better experts expect that after the

london ahead of his election last july pakistani prime minister imran khan s rhetoric regarding the middle east seemed overtly pro iranian to many in the gulf cooperation council despite pakistan s history of friendly ties with gulf countries in 2015 khan and his pakistan tehreek e insaf pti party supported the iran nuclear agreement which many in the gulf saw as empowering tehran to further its destabilising regional agenda khan and the pti were driving forces in the pakistani parliament to reject joining the saudi led arab coalition in yemen in 2015 viewed by many analysts as a proxy war between saudi arabia and the united arab emirates on one side and iran on the other on going in for us saudi alliance to fight in yemen has pakistan not suffered enough by participating in others wars khan said on twitter in march 2015 with elections a few years later and with political and economic motivations in mind iranian officials felt that the time to strengthen relations with islamabad was ripe in terms of economic motivations and considering renewed sanctions tied to the us withdrawal from the iran nuclear deal tehran was hoping that khan s election might revive the iran pakistan gas pipeline project which has been in the making since 1995 the project which includes a 2 800km natural gas pipeline has been plagued with setbacks iranian officials blamed the united states and gulf arab countries for pakistan s lack of commitment in finishing its part of the plan politically because of khan s parliamentary stances and public statements iran felt that a shift in relations was at hand it appeared tehran was aggressively courting khan with iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif who was first foreign official to visit the new prime minister the fact that pakistan s relations with the united states have been experiencing some difficulties has increased tehran s hopes that islamabad might turn away from washington and its regional allies notably saudi arabia but also the uae and strike closer relations with tehran shireen hunter a research professor at georgetown university s school of foreign service wrote in september however it appears that long standing relations economic realities and the responsibilities of leading a country trumped khan s populist views in september media reports claiming that khan would make his first official overseas trip to iran were proven false he opted to visit riyadh instead the motivations are plentiful a report from thomson reuters said pakistan is facing an economic crisis due to depleting foreign reserves and a widening current account deficit since khan took office in august the khan government would either have to work with the international monetary fund for a bailout which would impose austerity measures further devaluating the rupee results that often lead to public unrest or seek financial help elsewhere in october riyadh allocated 3 billion in foreign currency support for up to a year to help pakistan s balance of payments predicament saudi arabia also agreed to a 1 year deferred payment facility of up to 3 billion on oil imports the gulf arab support did not end there during an official visit january 6 to islamabad uae crown prince sheikh mohammed bin zayed al nahyan said pakistan would be receiving a 3 billion loan package and 3 2 billion in oil imports on deferred payment saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman bin abdulaziz is expected to visit pakistan in february with speculation in the pakistani media pointing towards further local investments including finalising a memorandum of understanding to establish a petrochemical complex in pakistan analysts said the support comes with a caveat with some diplomatic payback likely it s unlikely a 6 billion gift would come with no strings attached michael kugelman deputy director of the asia programme at the wilson centre in washington told voice of america i imagine in all likelihood islamabad had to reassert its allegiance to ksa with the implication that pakistan should back away from the imran khan government s strong assertion of neutrality in the iran saudi arabia rivalry as far as tehran is concerned it appears that the damage is done an editorial last november in iran s mehr news agency described khan as being subservient to riyadh saying speculation had been put to rest khan was walking in the footsteps of his predecessor

an occasional series examining the legacy of the administration of gov dannel p malloy and the challenges awaiting his successor ned lamont it was gov dannel p malloy s personal white whale two line items buried amongst hundreds of others rose from the pages of the state budget to confound his plans year after year required contributions to state employees and teachers pensions cash starved after seven decades of inadequate funding they exploded during malloy s tenure stealing billions of dollars the governor would have preferred to spend on roads schools and even tax rebates this behemoth of debt a monster seven decades in the making forced malloy to temper his aspirations for transportation tax relief and other initiatives and to impose two major tax hikes during his eight years but if malloy couldn t slay the monster he made progress in taming it despite being saddled from day one with a huge deficit an empty reserve and a weak recovery from the last recession he became the first connecticut governor in modern history to make all required pension contributions breaking a longstanding practice of leaving a bill for connecticut s children someday to cover and while the governor s efforts to reduce connecticut s reliance on property taxes bogged down he largely was able to shield municipal aid from the budget axe at a time when many other states did not malloy also secured two major concessions packages from state employee unions deals that reduced pension liabilities and increased health care cost sharing dramatically but not without a cost to get those changes the governor locked connecticut into an additional decade of having to provide retirement benefits that some legislators argue simply are unaffordable and while he may not be remembered fondly for the tax increases malloy says the truth of his success lies in other numbers i measure myself by what we accomplished not how well it s known or understood or appreciated malloy who has two weeks left on the job told the ct mirror during an interview last week and i can assure you i m not going to spend any time after the 9th of january wondering when i m going to be loved it s not going to happen cash starved pensions malloy s greatest nemesis gov dannel p malloy briefing reporters about budget negotiations at left is lt gov nancy wyman credit mark pazniokas ctmirror org the democratic governor s greatest nemesis arguably wasn t the republican party or even the sluggish economy it was the state s obligation to its retired workers in the last budget approved by gov m jodi rell covering the 2010 11 fiscal year required contributions to state employees and teachers pensions amounted to 1 1 billion or just over 6 percent of the general fund by malloy s last year they had more than doubled approaching 2 5 billion and devouring 13 percent of the budget put another way every single year the governor had to find on average another 164 million to feed this two headed fiscal beast despite those costs malloy made the full required contribution every year unlike any other governor is modern times and while he and state employee unions struck a deal in 2017 that delayed some of the pension obligations until after 2032 malloy still was the first governor in decades not to bill connecticut s children for the retirement benefits promised to today s public sector workers a fact he plays down i told you what i was going to do he said referring to a pledge in his 2010 campaign not to skirt pension obligations the things i told you i was going to do i did most of them and i fought very hard to do the rest his critics disagree was he honest about tax increases then candidate dannel malloy making his pledge about taxes in 2010 embroiled in a tight gubernatorial race in 2010 against greenwich republican tom foley who d made the dubious pledge to solve an unprecedented 3 7 billion budget deficit without raising taxes malloy was being pressed to make the same promise i want to be very clear we re not going to raise taxes malloy said during a televised debate on oct 30 2010 that is the last thing we will do malloy briefly paused and then awkwardly added a qualifier if we have to and only then to protect the safety net did most voters take the last thing to mean tax hikes were the furthest thing from malloy s mind or simply the last step in a budget preparation process that would begin with spending cuts that s what i meant malloy said referring to the latter interpretation while conceding some likely misunderstood i understand that happened but that certainly was not my intention and every time we raised taxes it was the last thing i considered i never intentionally misled anyone while i was in office never malloy added and i always answered everyone s questions whether i liked them or not connecticut didn t buy that answer then and still doesn t now said republican political strategist liz kurantowicz it s too bad we don t have lemon law for politicians she said he just wouldn t level with the people of this state i think that s built into his low approval ratings after the election malloy signed into law one of the largest tax hikes in state history worth more than 1 8 billion per year it s too bad we don t have lemon law for politicians he just wouldn t level with the people of this state i think that s built into his low approval ratings liz kurantowicz gop strategist four years later when malloy ran for re election again matched up against foley he dismissed nonpartisan projections of a 1 3 billion hole in the first post election budget and pledged not to raise taxes we really don t have a deficit he told the ct mirror in june 2014 i know that s hard to believe it was hard to believe because it wasn t true malloy won the deficit remained the same and the governor signed a budget that raised about 670 million in taxes and canceled about 220 million in tax cuts scheduled to take effect after the election after his no deficit prediction malloy would close the next three fiscal years 2015 through 2017 with modest shortfalls you like to win everything malloy said of his budget struggles you don t want to get 90 percent of anything you want to get 100 percent at least that s how i m constituted having said that i don t dwell on it i think it s more of the same bait and switch kurantowicz countered that s his legacy in many respects i think he had this sense in his view that he had to be right that everything he did had to be right said senate republican leader len fasano of north haven if the revenue wasn t there to balance the budget he had to say sure it is you just can t see it malloy inherited fiscal mess of historic proportions but the democratic governor said what his critics couldn t see or wouldn t be honest about were the magnitude of problems stacked against him the ticking fiscal time bombs that were the pension funds were the biggest problem but far from the only one former gov m jodi rell credit mark pazniokas ctmirror org his predecessor republican gov m jodi rell and the democrat controlled 2010 legislature left malloy a built in deficit in his first budget a 3 7 billion gap that approached 20 percent of all general fund spending they also had racked up more than 900 million in operating debt not only did they leave that entire bill for malloy but they also borrowed another 90 million to cover the initial payments on that operating debt until they were out of office malloy cleaned that up too rell and the 2010 legislature emptied a nearly 1 4 billion emergency budget reserve raided state employee pension contributions during their last two years in office and propped up one fifth of the entire education cost sharing grant program for cities and towns with temporary federal aid that expired after rell left office malloy who had been stamford s mayor for 14 years through 2009 kept a campaign pledge not to reduce education grants despite the loss of federal funds governor malloy did a whole lot to shield municipal governments said joe delong executive director of the connecticut conference of municipalities he looked those fiscal challenges right in the eye even if we didn t agree with him on all issues there has to be a certain level of praise that goes along with that republican legislators businesses and taxpayer groups balked at malloy s 2011 tax increase and hammered the governor when his first budget sprang a leak one of the chief reasons was that the administration was counting on roughly 800 million of the 3 7 billion deficit problem to be solved by economic growth few in the gop recalled or mentioned that foley s plan to avoid tax hikes assumed between two and three times the rosy economic growth that malloy had built into his budget joseph brennan president and ceo of the connecticut business and industry association said many business leaders understood despite the political rhetoric that some level of tax increase was necessary during the past eight years people just felt there was too much of a reliance on raising revenue at a time when our economy was still in a fragile condition he said adding that malloy didn t help himself by setting expectations on the campaign trail that weren t met when he was in office the business backlash peaked in may 2015 when ge formerly general electric and several other major corporations issued statements warning that malloy s second round of major tax hikes might push them out the door raising taxes again on connecticut s residents businesses and services makes businesses including our own and citizens seriously consider whether it makes any sense to continue to be located in this state the corporation wrote eight months later it would make good on its threat rejecting a last minute incentive pitch from malloy and moving its headquarters from fairfield to boston every company every individual has their tipping point brennan said in 2015 we got very very close for too many individuals too many companies gov dannel p malloy speaks at utc s newly renovated research center in east hartford friday credit kyle constable ctmirror org but brennan added that malloy deserves credit for incentive packages that helped united technologies corp both retain and expand pratt and whitney in east hartford and sikorsky aircraft in stratford these moves coupled with aid that helped general dynamics electric boat shipyard in groton to also expand preserved connecticut s vital engineering and advanced manufacturing base the importance of advanced manufacturing to the connecticut economy keeping robust the critically important subcontractor supply chains that serve those companies cannot be understated brennan said hundreds of companies and tens of thousands of jobs rely on those firms the trends are positive now after decades of decline i m the only governor that s sustained a 100 000 job increase in the private sector malloy said transportation a missed opportunity that job increase might have been higher had state government invested in transportation to the magnitude malloy discussed while campaigning for his first term in 2010 big fuel tax increases between 2005 and 2007 coupled with surging petroleum wholesale prices swelled connecticut s coffers going into the last recession but between 2005 and 2013 nearly 1 4 billion in fuel tax receipts were spent on non transportation programs malloy who campaigned on a pledge to reverse this trend did so but he wasn t able to wean the general fund off fuel tax receipts entirely until the start of his second term and while he began that term in january 2015 by proposing a 30 year 100 billion rebuild of connecticut s aging overcrowded transportation system he didn t recommend any long term funding source appointing a study panel instead malloy waited until legislators approved a new legal lockbox amendment to the state constitution to protect transportation fund revenues which didn t make it onto the ballot until this past november it was adopted overwhelmingly but lawmakers refused to adopt tolls or gasoline tax hikes and the governor spent much of the past year warning that without a big infusion of cash connecticut s ability to tackle necessary major projects such as repairing the elevated section of interstate 84 in hartford and completing its rebuild of the mixmaster junction of i 84 and route 8 in waterbury will vanish by 2021 interstate 84 in hartford donald shubert president of the connecticut construction industries association said malloy took some important steps forward in transportation but we had the opportunity to make a tremendous amount more of progress than we did over the past eight years in december 2010 just before rell left office connecticut had 1 7 billion in approved yet unissued transportation bonds in other words project financing that exists only on paper often because the state can t afford to make debt payments if it borrows the funds and even though malloy borrowed at a faster pace than rell during his second term the transportation financing backlog has more than doubled and now approaches 3 8 billion the economic stakes of that backlog are huge every 1 of state borrowing spent on transportation usually leverage 3 to 4 of federal grants that also go into the construction economy university of connecticut economist fred v carstensen who heads the connecticut center for economic analysis says that every 1 billion in backlogged transportation bonding represents about 10 000 potential construction or related jobs as pension costs rose government had to shrink but malloy said he had to make tough choices as pension costs rose and one of those was to shrink government during his tenure malloy cut executive branch staffing by more than 10 percent shaving off more than 2 500 jobs though it doesn t grab a lot of headlines malloy also slowed to a halt big spending growth in another major segment of the budget annual increases that typically reached 7 percent now have flattened out thanks to a variety of managed care initiatives the growth in medicaid is not a problem for us like it is in so many other states said ben barnes malloy s budget chief for his entire tenure malloy s labor concessions packages froze wages increased worker s share of health care costs and reduced pension benefits often putting him at odds with a vital part of his political base gubernatorial candidate dan malloy walked a picket line with unionized healthcare workers in hartford on primary day in 2010 credit ctmirror org file photo i fought with the unions i fought with the teachers he said adding he was greatly resented for the first round of concessions he demanded i fought with everybody saying he never expected to win a second term the governor added that i had a short time to do as many big things as i could i didn t have a lot of time for pleasantries hartford attorney daniel livingston chief negotiator for the state employees bargaining agent coalition said the governor respected collective bargaining and tried to protect the public services upon which we all depend but while workers were being asked to sacrifice malloy refused to elevate state income tax rates on the wealthy anywhere close to what labor leaders had proposed labor leaders and other progressives flinched during malloy s first budget address in february 2011 when the new governor said that while i do believe in a progressive income tax i do not believe that we should punish success or wealth our core fiscal problem comes from income inequality educational and economic opportunity that depends more on zip code than ability or character livingston said and an outdated tax structure that makes those things worse instead of better too often working families private sector and especially public sector have paid the price for our failure to address these core truths lawmakers craft a final budget without malloy still malloy said there was no way to face the problems he faced and not run into disappointment or even resentment and when legislators from both parties compromised to end 10 months of budget gridlock in november 2017 they excluded the malloy administration from those talks and did so again when the next budget was passed in may 2018 we certainly brawled on a regular basis but he certainly was a very hard working governor said house minority leader themis klarides r derby he believed what he believed in and he would not let anybody sway him but klarides added that in 2017 things got to a point where it just wasn t working when the republicans say dan malloy wrecked the economy it is such a ridiculous thing to say in so many ways he put the state in a position where future growth is possible roy occhiogrosso democratic strategist after the budget was passed complete with an 80 million two year emergency bailout for the city of hartford legislators were shocked when malloy executed a deal that guaranteed more than 500 million in debt assistance for hartford over two decades the governor and state treasurer denise l nappier said the budget authorized such a deal and that lawmakers didn t understand what they had passed top lawmakers from both parties said malloy had violated legislative intent he knew darn well this was not what the leaders intended klarides said senate republican leader len fasano left and gov dannel p malloy credit ctmirror org file photos he wanted to say because i wasn t in the room they didn t know what they were doing fasano said that s the prickly attitude he s always had but roy occhiogrosso the political strategist who advised malloy s 2010 and 2014 campaigns and served in his administration said malloy fearlessly waded into issues that many politicians in some cases for generations ignored when the republicans say dan malloy wrecked the economy it is such a ridiculous thing to say in so many ways he put the state in a position where future growth is possible occhiogrosso predicts malloy s legacy will be viewed increasingly favorably over time particularly when future generations don t receive a bill for the billions of dollars of present day pension costs whether it s governor lamont or some future governor people will see it when they have the ability to spend money that dan malloy couldn t spend he

today china is the driving engine of global economic growth a major crisis of the chinese economy will almost certainly drag the global economy into the next recession in the 2020s this may turn out to be far more damaging than the great recession of 2008 minqi li is a political economist at the university of utah and an advocate of china s maoist new left his most recent book china and the 21st century crisis outlines capitalism s next looming crisis regardless of the proximate cause this coming crisis will be economic political and ecological it will also be global china s economic boom from the 1990s onwards was based on three primary conditions the rapid growth of exports to western capitalist economies the intense exploitation of a large cheap workforce and ruthless environmental degradation following the 2008 global financial crisis however all three conditions for growth continue to be undermined as chinese exports to the west slowed china depended more and more on investment generally fuelled by massive fiscal stimulus programmes and government borrowing to drive economic growth as china s debt gdp ratio surges the risk of a sudden sharp drop in business investment and borrowing mounts li 97 more fundamentally for li the high level of investment is driving down china s capital productivity leading to falling rates of profit for capital li 3 under the current trend china s profit rate the rate of return on invested capital will fall to a level that is likely to precipitate a major crisis in the 2020s if not sooner li 171 workers against boss communism in china the industrial working class in china is the world s largest moreover at a time when large parts of the world are suffering under the tyranny of neoliberal austerity the working class in china is somewhat exceptionally making significant gains in their struggle against capitalist exploitation li 29 workers claiming of economic and political rights takes the form of mass incidents a term used by the chinese censor to describe large sit ins mass strikes rallies and riots some 8 700 mass incidents occurred in 1993 60 000 in 2003 and 120 000 in 2008 li estimates that the annual number of such incidents has remained above 100 000 in recent years some 10 million chinese people are currently involved li 182 he claims that the spectre of a working class revolution which haunted the european capitalist classes for almost a century after 1848 is resurfacing in china in the twenty first century p 7 workers struggles have grown in both size and militancy despite state repression workers have been able to win concessions from capital in 2007 crane drivers at shenzhen port terminals went on strike winning pay raises as well as compensation for overtime and housing subsidies in 2010 strike waves swept china s automobile textile and electronics industries local governments increased minimum wages soon after from 2010 to 2014 shenzhen s local minimum wage jumped from 900 to 1808 yuan per month in shanghai from 960 to 1820 yuan li 29 specifically and perhaps most importantly for li wages have grown more rapidly than labour productivity with important economic and political implications li 7 chinese capitalist prosperity is founded on the intense exploitation of semi proletarian rural wage workers li 28 in these circumstances the chinese communist party relies on rapid economic growth and rising living standards to retain its authority li estimates that the chinese capitalist class needs to secure economic growth rates of about 5 per cent per annum to sustain overall political and economic stability li 161 capitalism s grow or die imperative however confronts two quite fundamental barriers firstly state concessions to rising popular demands will increase the cost of capital accumulation this contradiction is not a new phenomenon in the 1970s and 1980s countries transitioning to neoliberal capitalism such as south korea brazil or poland encountered similar tensions between capital accumulation strategies and securing political legitimacy by raising living standards state elites resolved these contradictions by relocating their low value added activities to another part of the globe by availing of abundant natural resources or by promising its workforce access to the labour market of a core capitalist country li 77 8 china however is not in a position to adopt any of these options this is largely due to the way china s emergence has reshaped the wider capitalist world system for the first time in the history of capitalism the gap between core capitalist countries and peripheral regions has begun to narrow li 176 as china develops further global labour and resource costs will tend to rise li 13 this is politically significant in the late 1970s china s reintegration into the global capitalist economy provided a large cheap labour force for exploitation and arguably tilted the global balance of power in favour of the capitalist classes li 3 today however conditions have changed it is highly unlikely that another large geographical area such as india for example could be mobilised to contain the rising labour costs evident now in china and the wider capitalist world for one thing an industrialisation on the required scale would immediately run into ecological barriers such as the availability of fossil fuel resources and of environmental space this brings us to the second fundamental barrier facing state capitalism in china as well as capitalism generally nature the spectre of ecological catastrophe capitalism is fundamentally incompatible with ecological sustainability today various global ecological systems edge towards collapse li 11 even if the world commits to zero economic growth today for all practical purposes it is already too late to avoid dangerous climate breakdown li 175 the question rather is whether humanity can manage to avoid the very worst climate catastrophes that would destroy the material foundation of human civilisation the current global economy is built upon capital infrastructure that is heavily dependent on fossil fuels given this fact li highlights that attempts to replace or adapt capital infrastructure are slow typically taking place at a rate of 4 5 per cent a year in a capitalist economy li 111 li further claims that world production of oil natural gas and coal is likely to peak before 2050 while nuclear and renewable energies will be insufficient to offset fossil fuel decline li 141 declines in world energy consumption after the 2030s will likely precipitate a prolonged major crisis of global capitalism li 13 within this general picture of the ecological limits to global capitalism chinese capitalism plays a central role today china is the world s largest energy consumer and greenhouse gas emitter li 12 in a very immediate sense china faces particularly acute problems when it comes to the availability of clean air and clean water in particular china s fresh water resources are highly unevenly distributed northern china has 47 per cent of the national population but less than 20 per cent of water resources about 300 million people in rural china rely on unsafe drinking water some 100 000 people die annually due to water pollution related disease li 159 environmental degradation plays a part in undermining state legitimacy the basic requirements of climate stabilisation are fundamentally incompatible with the operation of a capitalist economy in china the required reduction in carbon dioxide emissions implies drastic reductions in china s economic growth rates by the 2020s the only scenario where humanity enters the 2040s on a sustainable path is one where the chinese economy approaches zero or possibly negative growth li 148 in other words a sustainable path equates with a non capitalist economy now recall li s analysis that the chinese capitalist class needs to secure economic growth rates of about 5 per cent per annum to sustain overall political and economic stability li 161 if the chinese economy grows at this rate apart from carbon emissions china s demand for oil natural gas and coal is likely to impose unbearable burdens on world energy markets in the 2020s and 2030s li 171 this will occasion peak oil scares and geopolitical tensions in short workers struggles combine with environmental limits to present the chinese state and its neoliberal mode of capital accumulation with a serious crisis of legitimacy china s boss communism versus humanity ideologically the chinese dictatorship is not helped by its single minded faith in the efficiency and rationality of the capitalist market li 186 alternative strategies for crisis resolution for example are emphatically discarded bo xilai who advanced state owned enterprises and income redistribution in chongqing represented the last significant faction within the chinese communist party politburo opposed to neoliberal capitalism li glosses over authoritarianism in chongqing including bo xilai s suppression of factory workers protests in the early 2000s in 2012 xilai was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment ostensibly on corruption charges the eclipse of the opposition faction enabled xi jinping to emerge as president and the ccp to embark on further rounds of neoliberal reforms including more financial liberalisation and further privatisation of remaining state owned enterprises needless to say china s ruling class has not trusted their own personal fortunes to the invisible hand of the market political corruption and theft of state assets are rife in 2012 for example a new york times investigation found that former prime minister wen jiabao s family had accumulated assets worth some 2 7 billion us dollars pervasive corruption not only undermines the legitimacy of chinese capitalism it further undermines the ability of the ruling class to safeguard its own class interest li 35 from the early 2000s onwards corruption rising inequality insecurity environmental degradation and political repression have all steadily undermined the popular legitimacy of state capitalism in china the country s ruling class are wedded to international capital and like the ruling class globally are living on borrowed time capitalism s social and ecologically damaging crises however present opportunities for authoritarian solutions fake revolutions to present themselves predictably li quickly claims that the putative leadership of popular struggles may lie with china s maoist new left a synthesis of newly radicalised worker activists college students and intellectuals as well as veteran communist party cadres li 12 34 there is a strong hint of wishful thinking here there is also a deliberate amnesia around actually existing maoism s historical record particularly the hardship famine and absence of control experienced by peasants and workers in mid 20th century china self emancipation of the working class was not on mao s agenda this narrows li s perspective of possible socialist transformations towards state socialism and the vanguard party the emergence of contemporary struggles in a globalised china suggests more complex possibilities and more democratic aspirations despite considerable authoritarian pressures and risks workers in china continue to walk off the job every day those of us outside of china would do well to take inspiration from the most restive elements of the world s working class the question for us all is whether a democratic movement for a liberated humanity internationalist in spirit ecological in sensibility and opposed to exploitation and oppression can organise fight and win and can it do so before environmental collapse the clock is ticking notes li participated in student dissident activities in beijing at the end of the 1980s and spent two years in prison for giving a political speech at the campus of beijing university in the early 1990s in prison li switched from being a neoliberal to a marxist leninist maoist before emigrating to the united states in 1994 where he has continued to research political economic and social development in china the author discusses his research in an interview here li counters the possibility of green capitalism in china heralded by establishment commentators who highlight the state s increased investment in solar and wind energy as a wonderland limited by the availability of land and precious metals p 130 li does not dwell on the possibility of military confrontation between china and the us and its allies in east asia the us military industrial complex has certainly considered this possibility from 2011 onwards two thirds of us naval forces have been transferred to asia and the pacific while 400 american bases surround china with ships missiles and troops in an arc that extends from australia through the pacific to japan korea and

i am writing with regard to the sponsored article in your newspaper under the title it is time to say the truth about ukraine in this regard i am very surprised that such publication which is full of lies and obvious propaganda may appear in such a respected and strong media as the jerusalem post first i would like to stress that the maidan and the revolution of dignity in the winter of 2013 2014 have become an important turning point in the modern history of ukraine which laid the basis of a new progressive nation the nation which refused to tolerate any corrupt government and political appointees of the kremlin regime since the mentioned revolution ukraine has made more progress as a country than it had since declaring independence in 1991 in just a few years ukrainian society has undergone a massive tectonic shift as it shed the legacy of soviet past and chose a pro western democratic orientation which countries gain strength and momentum every day for many ukrainians a considerable achievement of the revolution of dignity was the restoration of the course of european integration including ukraine s visa free regime with the european union and the signing of an association agreement with the bloc the association agreement with the european union proves its effectiveness on a daily basis after cursory ex president v yanukovich left an empty state treasury ukraine managed to avoid default and since the end of 2016 the country has restored economic growth ukraine s gdp in 2014 2015 against the backdrop of the war waged by russia in donbass and the occupation of crimea fell by 17 5 according to the atlantic council estimations ukraine has lost 100 billion us dollars because of russian aggression this year the economic growth is expected to equal 3 4 and it will be the record of the last eight years the main drivers of economic growth will be the revival of ukraine s industrial sector and development of innovative industries in april 2017 the government adopted its strategy 2020 with the goal of boosting economic growth to five to 7 by 2020 thereby ensuring long term prosperity for all ukrainians the plan also lays the groundwork for positioning ukraine as the eurasian hub where it can use its geographic and market advantage to compete at the crossroads of two of the world s largest economic trading blocks european and asian ukraine has free trade agreements with the eu cis commonwealth of independent states efta european free trade association canada georgia macedonia and montenegro with israel an fta agreement is ready for signing in the doing business 2019 rating ukraine has risen to 5 points and took 71 positions from 190 countries of the world the country has shown the highest growth in such categories as taxation increase by 110 positions to 54th position international trade 70 positions to 78th place and protection of investors rights 56 positions to 72nd place also it should be noted that in the ranking of agency moody s investors service ukraine has improved its credit rating in the international economic list it has changed from caa3 to caa2 which means changing the forecast from stable to positive if to recall the state of the armed forces of ukraine at the beginning of the russian aggression in the spring of 2014 one should say that nowadays ukraine s army takes over modern forms of confrontation in all areas both traditional and new including information and cyberspace and is becoming the army of a new generation of ukrainians and we have achieved all of this while fighting a russian led war which has cost thousands of lives and with a russian occupation of the crimean peninsula and the donbass region devastating our economy the writer is ukraine s ambassador to israel
the european investment bank eib europe s long term lending institution formally opened the bank s first permanent representation in ethiopia in 2016 the office leads engagement by the eib both to support long term infrastructure and private sector investment in ethiopia and to manage relations with the african union commission and other international organizations based in addis ababa the bank s ethiopia office head christophe litt spoke to capital about some of the projects in their pipeline capital tell us about some of your current projects christophe litt if we look at the public sector projects we are currently appraising two strategic projects one is called a jobs compact the initial idea was to build three industrial parks which would be expected to create about 100 000 jobs and 30 percent of those jobs would go to refugees based in the country so the idea is really to better integrate refugees who have been here for many years this was announced by the ethiopian prime minister in new york at the obama refugee summit in 2016 during that time the prime minister met with the bank s president representatives of the world bank european union and dfid and with all those institutions we confirmed our interest in financing the so called jobs compact project a lot has happened since then there was a pre appraisal or pre feasibility study carried out by mckinsey to identify the best sectors that could be developed in each of these parks given their location but also taking into account all the existing initiatives in the country a so called refugees skills survey was also undertaken we also tried to determine what kind of institutional setting would be appropriate for each of the parks what kind of governance what kind of partnership public private or exclusively public or private and so on when it comes to eib what we will do at least initially is to finance dire dawa phase two which is will focus on the electrical appliances sector so it will not be textile it could be automotive it could be all kinds of electrical equipments now we are entering the phase of the feasibility study and the environmental and social impact assessments we will also have to look at some of the associated infrastructures such as housing transport energy to determine the perimeter of our intervention our partners would follow a budgetary support approach which means the financing would not directly be linked with the construction of the park but to some objectives that need to be reached by the government to make the jobs compact concept a success for example to improve investment climate jobs productivity job creation refugee status all those aspects will be taken into account so our approaches are fully complimentary eib is more of a project based organization we really look at projects and it is more difficult for us to influence those more high level topics which will be key for for the success of our financing of dire dawa phase ii if the investment climate is better and productivity is better you can attract more investors and can be more successful etc capital the dire dawa phase two projects will focus on electrical appliances why was that particular sector chosen litt mckinsey did a very comprehensive study on all the existing projects currently being developed in the country or that will be developed they looked at all potential sectors given the competitive advantages that can be offered by the country dire dawa is close to djibouti and there is a lot of textile projects already they had interviews with foreign companies to see what they were looking for what kind of competitive advantages that place may offer and that was the proposal capital do you have other projects in the public sector litt there is another that i really find interesting because it is focusing on an existing industry in the country which has a lot of know how and has a big potential but needs some support it is the mojo leather city project the idea is to build an industrial park in mojo focusing on the leather industry there will be a state of the art water treatment facility it is a very polluting industry using lots of chemicals i have been to mojo to visit some of the tanneries and they would clearly benefit from such a project so the idea is to build a new park based on the so called one stop shop concept the cost is still to be determined but it could be around 100 million euros and in such a case eib would provide 50 million half of the cost the eu has approved already a 15 million euro grant to finance some components one is all the studies and environmental impact and social assessments the second thing is to work on the value chain improve the raw material leather and third to focus on social aspects capital so the financing for this project has already been acquired litt we are talking about the pipeline so for those two projects we are currently appraising them doing a full due diligence with the help of our technical team and sector specialists and when all the studies will be finalized we will prepare what is called an investment proposal that will be submitted to the management committee of the bank and its board of directors then we will be in a position to sign the financing of these projects in the form of a long term loan at concessional rate usually it takes 9 to 12 months to get through all these processes but it will all depend of course on when the studies are available capital when you invest in these kinds of projects is it at the recommendation of the ethiopian government do they give you lists of areas to focus on litt they don t exactly give us directions of course this is a public project and we lend to the government the government is the borrower so it has to be approved by the government it is more a formal step but we also receive a financing request which confirms the interest of the government for an eib financing for a specific project we are in regular contact and have weekly discussion with the ministry of finance to discuss with them potential projects and make sure we provide the right support given the overall economic strategy of the government capital for the jobs compact project you said 30 percent of the jobs created will go to refugees where did that idea come from litt the project was initiated by dfid there is a similar project in jordan i think that there is a strong desire from the ethiopian government to better integrate refugees in general but there are of course several factors to be taken into account such as the skill and profile of refugees compared to the needs of investors it is something that we will see in time but the idea is that at least 30 thousand refugees should benefit from this project to get the possibility to have a job at the end of the process capital what about the private sector what is the bank s engagement in that sector litt for the private sector we also have quite a few leads we have two types of instruments the first is what we call corporate loan whereby we provide senior debt of maximum 50 percent of the cost of a project to a corporate that invests in the country we are following various projects such as investment to build malt houses in the country and aluminum cans we also had contacts with breweries who are looking at extending their operations then we also have project finance instrument which is a loan that we make to an spv special purpose vehicle a company that is being set up for a specific purpose and all the cash flows from the project will be used to pay back the loan for that instrument we are also looking at various projects such as the corbetti geothermal project for corbetti the idea is to provide 50 percent of the senior debt necessary for the first 60 or 70 megawatts the project has been a bit delayed but we already had a team going on site and starting appraisal a few years ago now the promoter has signed the power purchase agreement ppa and we expect that the project will move forward we are also looking at the so called scaling solar projects that are being launched by the world bank all this is of course private lending so we lend to a private company although there is a public private partnership as the electricity is purchased by the state for the term of the project and based on pre agreed tariff we are also in discussions with ocp the fertilizer company which is building a plant in dire dawa it is a usd 2 5 billion project for phase one we also have two other interesting projects that we are also appraising at the moment the first one is called women entrepreneurship development program wedp which was set up a few years ago by the world bank and the idea for eib would be to provide a concessional loan to the ethiopian development bank which then will on lend to selected micro finance institutions who will then provide financing to women who have existing businesses and are looking to expand it appraisal for that project has already started the objective will also be for eib to provide technical assistance where needed for example in the form of capacity building or training of some of the stakeholders so basically this will take the form of a grant alongside our the loan to make the project more robust the other project that is a bit similar but is at a very early stage is in the honey sector we had preliminary discussions with the agricultural transformation agency who is working on the honey value chain ethiopia is the 10th producer but is definitely not the 10th exporter so there is a big potential there and we are trying to see how we can cooperate for example through the financing of small farmers or beekeepers using a facility that eib has developed specifically for such beneficiaries also through microfinance institutions capital how do you assess the capacities of micro finance institutions in this country litt the first thing is that our loan for the above projects would be to the development bank so the risk that we take in the end is on the ethiopian government but of course we want to make sure that our financing go to the micro finance institutions that are sustainable so a full due diligence of these institutions will be carried out by our sector specialists capital what about the startup sector in the country that is growing do you have interests in financing litt it is difficult for us to directly invest in startups it takes a lot of human resources and the potential amount to invest is a bit too small for us given that we invest about eur 3bn a year in africa we have done it with m birr it is an exception because we found the potential impact of this investment quite unique one way for eib to reach start ups is to invest in venture capital funds these funds will then invest in innovative companies particularly startups these are also usually funds that are a bit small in size and have a lot of risks this why we have set up a program called boost africa with the african development bank and the eu the idea is to de risk our investment in venture capital funds by using a so called first loss tranche let s say that we have identified a good venture capital fund in ethiopia but it is a bit too risky so the eu would co invest in the fund but its investment will be a first loss tranche which means that if the fund does not perform as expected the losses will first be absorbed by this tranche and then eib and the other private investors would be senior to this tranche the idea is really to reduce the level of risk of such projects so that it reaches a level that is acceptable to eib and to private investors

unable to get new work as corporations refuse to hire older workers that s men who commit suicide and suffer addiction and overdose deaths at rates so high that life expectancy in the richest country in the world is declining that s tragic and that s what s deeply unlikeable not elizabeth warren s proposed remedies for that pain in denmark hygge is achieved in part with tax rates that are consistently among the highest in the world these levies provide a sense of safety and security for danes that is unimaginable for most americans that includes free university tuition universal health care generous unemployment benefits and 52 weeks of paid leave shared by new parents collective social spending buys happiness a study by baylor university showed that s true in america too the researchers found americans are happier in states where taxpayer money is spent on public goods like libraries parks highways and natural resources the likes of ocasio cortez and elizabeth warren contend that americans deserve some hygge of their own they differ on how to get there some would like to increase the income of the 99 percent enabling them to buy what they need some want to tax corporations and the 1 percent at the high rates paid in the 1950s and 1960s to cover the costs of public services either way or some of both american hygge is possible elizabeth warren born in 1949 grew up in the years when the rich paid 70 to 90 percent marginal tax rates much of that money went to pay down the debts of world war ii but it also paid for the benefits in the g i bill including college and trade school tuition veterans hospitals and low interest mortgages between 1945 and 1966 a fifth of all new single family homes were financed by the g i loan program when warren was 12 her father a salesman for the montgomery ward stores suffered a heart attack medical bills piled up the family car was repossessed warren s mother fearing foreclosure went to work at sears at the age of 50 for minimum wage that 1 15 an hour job saved the family s home that s when minimum wage was worth more at its peak in 1968 the rate was worth 8 68 in inflation adjusted dollars it has been stuck at 7 25 since 2009 losing almost 10 percent of its value due to inflation today s minimum wage for full time work will not keep a mother and her child out of poverty won t cover the rent on a two bedroom apartment won t provide for a family s basic survival warren wants a minimum wage sufficient for a family of three to live on she says a government that works for the people should ensure the minimum wage is sufficient to give workers a shot at climbing into the middle class she wants other wages and benefits to rise as well and one way she proposes to do that is to require that 40 percent of corporate board members be elected by workers she introduced legislation requiring that for very large corporations the idea is to make corporations more accountable to employees customers and communities if 40 percent of board members were worker representatives corporations would be less likely to stiff the pension fund move manufacturing to mexico or pay the ceo 1 000 times the earnings of the average worker ocasio cortez approaches the problem differently she wants the government to provide services as denmark does taxes would be higher particularly for the 1 percent but other costs would be lower or disappear such as health insurance premiums and college tuition ocasio cortez worked low wage jobs as a restaurant server and bartender to support herself she knows the stress and she knows it s wrong she says when you can t provide for your kids working a full time job working two full time jobs when you can t have health care that is not that is not dignified the green new deal she is promoting is much more than a plan to decarbonize it is a holistic program to establish a more fair and just economy it would ensure that workers are trained and prepared to transition to a clean energy world and guarantee workers right to unionize it would apply special focus to historically impoverished marginalized and deindustrialized communities to promote economic security it would include basic income programs universal health care and a living wage job guarantee to every person seeking employment that would cost a lot hygge is expensive but americans deserve it just as much as danes
lighthizer nicknamed the trade war general by bloomberg produced a 200 page document under section 301 which reads like a charge sheet and a month before trump fired the first shot in his trade war against china last april us trade representative ustr robert lighthizer produced just such a report for the president to be able to take such action against another country an investigation initiated under section 301 must first establish that it is engaging in unfair trade policies section 301 of the 1974 trade act may sound arcane to anyone not closely following the progress of the trade war negotiations but in fact it is one of washington s most effective weapons in bringing pressure on beijing when it comes to the trade war against china us president donald trump likes to wield one particularly big stick a piece of legislation that allows him to take unilateral action free from the constraints of international treaties and world trade organisation wto agreements against another country as the trade war between china and the united states rumbles on its focus has shifted from deficits and surpluses towards more technological matters washington is not only demanding beijing end its practice of forcing foreign joint venture partners to transfer technologies to their chinese collaborators but also scrutinising the work of chinese researchers based in the us in the third of a series of reports on these issues we look at the how the us is using legislation to address its grievances it paints a sinister picture accusing the communist party of carefully orchestrating an elaborate onslaught against american businesses to weaken the economic and technological advantages enjoyed by the us the report provided the legal basis for trump s escalating series of tariffs against chinese imports currently on hold at 10 per cent on us 200 billion worth of chinese goods but threatened to rise to 25 per cent if the 90 day truce does not end in agreement the ustr investigation was ambitious and extensive going far beyond the us trade deficit with china with almost every area of china s economic and investment activities coming under scrutiny particularly those related to technology the ustr investigation scrutinised almost all areas of china s economic and investment activity especially technology photo shutterstock the main allegations levelled against beijing included forced technology transfer discriminatory investment restrictions predatory acquisitions cyberattacks and espionage beijing has vehemently protested the report s findings and challenged the use of section 301 at meetings of the wto which itself is coming under intense pressure from the trump administration the ustr feels china s intellectual property and technology transfer are practices that are not sufficiently covered under the world trade organisation the wto is not clear enough on these issues said craig allen president of the us china business council at least in my view the section 301 investigation is very significant but what we hope from the negotiations is the lifting of section 301 sanctions on march 2 he said some chinese experts see the ustr report as an underhanded way to stop china from challenging us leadership in technology and the global economy even more moderate observers agree the report lacks verifiable evidence and seems to have selectively chosen data and examples to fit its narrative some cases particularly those related to technology transfer and outbound investment are misleading and exaggerated they say the us administration has labelled china as one of its two strategic competitors and the ustr report highlights us concerns on intellectual property and state owned enterprises although many of its accusations are not factual said wang huiyao director of the centre for china and globalisation a think tank based in beijing for instance the ustr report omitted findings by the american chamber of commerce in china and the european union chamber of commerce in china which showed intellectual property rights ipr protection had gradually improved although much work remained to be done he said the eu chamber of commerce in china in its 2018 business confidence survey noted that european business sentiment about ipr enforcement had shown a steady improvement in recent years with the proportion of respondents who viewed ipr enforcement as adequate or excellent rising from 13 per cent to 34 per cent between 2013 and 2018 there is still progress to be made however with 29 per cent of respondents reported having suffered significant damage as a result of ipr infringement the report said in 2016 amcham china published an article on its website that said that while ipr protection remained a significant problem it had improved immensely since the 1990s when it was the cause of major frictions between china and its trading partners by last year further improvements were reported by amcham china in its 2018 american business in china white paper china continues to promote an innovation driven society in line with this several reforms have been made to improve ip protection such as introducing specialised intellectual property courts the revision of the trademark law and the patent law and the incorporation of the plant variety protection concept into the seed law amcham china said although ip challenges receive considerable attention from chinese authorities significant issues continue to challenge both foreign and domestic companies operating in china one chinese trade policy adviser said that beijing needed to seriously study the report including its 1 139 footnotes and to think if there is room to fix the shortcomings in its rules and industrial policies no matter how mistaken or distorted the report is this is a chance to create a level playing field in china he told the south china morning post but the war of words rages on in an update to its report in november the office of the ustr said china did not respond constructively and failed to take any substantial actions to address us concerns it said china had largely denied there were problems with its policies on technology transfer and intellectual property protection china s ministry of commerce responded swiftly that the accusations in the updated section 301 report were groundless and completely unacceptable the bad industrial and trade practices documented in the ustr report are a key aspect of the negotiations which have been under way since december when china and the us agreed to the 90 day tariff ceasefire while many economists in china agree beijing should use the opportunity to restart its stalled economic reforms they also see the section 301 report as biased and unfair the report was drawn largely from a public hearing and written submissions to the ustr which sought comment from private sector advisory committees it received about 70 written submissions from trade associations us companies and workers academics think tanks and law firms chinese law and trade associations also submitted their opinions but these were largely disregarded in the final document the following are some examples from the four key issues listed in the ustr reports unfair technology transfer in many sectors that beijing considers important it requires foreign companies to set up joint ventures with chinese partners car manufacturing and new energy vehicles are two sectors cited in the report as examples of how china is using that strategy to gain access to us technology the report alleges that china is using complicated and non transparent administrative approvals and licensing processes to force foreign companies to comply with its policy vaguely worded provisions and uncertainty about the applicable rules provide chinese authorities with wide discretion to use administrative processes to pressure technology transfer restrict investments to protect domestic competitors or otherwise act in furtherance of industrial policy objectives it said in addition china imposes administrative licensing requirements on more than 100 different business activities such as food and drug production mining or telecommunications services for all enterprises in china the report claimed these information disclosure requirements put us companies at risk of sensitive information leaking with some of the reviewing panellists drawn from their competitors the ustr cited business surveys and studies consultancies and chinese government documents in the past decade to support its claim that china deliberately forced technology transfers at a ustr public hearing in october 2017 stephen ezell vice president of global innovation policy at the information technology and innovation foundation said china had tied general motors access to government subsidies for electric vehicle purchases to the company s willingness to disclose key information about its electric hybrid car ford had been forced to do the same he said the chinese side said the claim was exaggerated and not supported by concrete evidence in response richard ellings of the commission on the theft of american intellectual property who was also cited in the report said most interviews had to be done in private and remained anonymous because companies were worried about possible reprisals by the chinese government the report quoted an annual member survey by the us china business council in 2017 which found 19 per cent of companies polled had been directly asked to transfer technology to china in the previous year but the section 301 report did not say that the council also found that the request had come most frequently from a chinese business partner rather than a government entity of the companies that said they were asked to transfer their technologies 33 per cent said the request came from a central government entity and 25 per cent said it came from the local government china watchers said the numbers were not solid evidence but agreed that china could do more two us consultants based in beijing said on condition of anonymity that part of the problem was the poor negotiation skills of us companies forced technology transfer is not a state sponsored issue although there may be one or two cases said one part of the reason is insufficient preparation and the poor negotiation capabilities of us companies lu xiang a us specialist with the chinese academy of social sciences said there was no national policy on forced technology transfer but many chinese partners may have acted aggressively to acquire technology from their foreign partners since the us has raised concerns it is necessary for china to be more specific in its rules to eliminate any possible leeway he said a former trade official in beijing said the fact some chinese partners in these joint venture were state owned companies made it difficult for them to convince the us side that contracts on technology transfer were based on market rules and voluntary principles in a draft law on foreign investment unveiled in december china s legislative body proposed to ban administrative authorities from forcing technology transfers from foreign companies and to offer equal opportunities for them to participate in drawing up industrial standards with domestic rivals discriminatory licensing restrictions the section 301 report also criticised discriminatory restrictions faced by american businesses with some laws and regulations such as the regulations on administration of the import and export of technologies tier and contract law applying unequally to domestic and foreign firms tier imposes a number of procedural requirements that the contract law does not it said adding that the regulations imposed restrictions such as indemnity items and ownership in technology improvements on us companies to negotiate market based terms for technology transfer into china under tier all technology import contracts must be notified to china and copies of such contracts provided if such contracts are not duly notified as required the foreign technology licencer is denied the ability to remit any royalty payments back to its home country the report said from the outset foreign imported technology licensers including us technology licensers must meet obligations that are not imposed on their chinese competitors under the contract law the us did not provide examples to support the argument but a chinese law professor who declined to reveal his name due to a reluctance to criticise the government admitted there was room for china to fix the conflicts in the laws this is what china should eradicate the conflicts of rules and offer equal treatment but this part matters little to the overall investigation he said cyberattacks and cyberespionage starting in 2008 experts expressed concern that china s cyberintrusions were becoming more frequent more targeted and more sophisticated the ustr report said citing law enforcement and private sources it said the chinese government had gained access to trade secrets technical data negotiating positions and sensitive and proprietary internal communications in the fields of oil exploration shale gas technology and high end steel production the section 301 report accuses china of gaining access to trade secrets and other sensitive data through cyberattacks and cyberespionage photo reuters beijing it said provided the intelligence to chinese state owned enterprises through a process that includes a formal request and feedback loop as well as a mechanism for information exchange via a classified communication system the ustr report also cited a 2013 study by cybersecurity firm mandiant that the people s liberation army stole data from at least 141 organisations 115 of which were based in the us representing 20 major business sectors to support commercial interests in china in another example included in the report the us steel corporation filed claims of unfair trade actions under section 337 of the 1930 trade act to the us international trade commission in 2016 against china s largest steelmaker baosteel claiming it was known to be one of the beneficiaries of china s state sponsored cyberattacks but the us steel corporation dropped the cyberattack claim in february 2017 due to a lack of evidence lu the us specialist from the chinese academy of social sciences said china and the us had yet to a reach consensus on how to identify state backed cyberattacks and the us had barely offered any evidence to china the accusations are groundless he said both countries really need to sit down and take the time to negotiate there is still a long way to go in its updated report in november the ustr quoted cybersecurity firms and government reports that china had increased cyberattacks on the us in 2018 including hacking related to an alaskan trade mission to china and around the us midterm elections the accusations of cyberintrusion and cybertheft have expanded to include australia germany japan and south korea with the ustr report citing japan and australia considering bans on chinese hi tech giants zte and huawei however arne schoenbohm head of germany s federal office for information security has expressed scepticism about the calls to boycott huawei he told news weekly der spiegel in december that the it watchdog had found no evidence huawei could use its facilities to spy for the chinese government for serious decisions such as a ban you need evidence schoenbohm said after his office examined huawei products and visited its facilities in bonn outbound investment nearly 100 pages of the ustr report are devoted to china s outbound investment policies over the past two decades from government approval procedures through financial support to attempts at acquiring foreign technologies despite chinese participants in the public hearing asserting that all chinese investment in the us was driven by market considerations rather than government policies the ustr said it does not find these statements persuasive the report quoted official us data on investment flows as well as us research agencies such as rhodium group and the american enterprise institute to assert that china s outbound investment had grown significantly in the technology and innovation related sectors targeted by chinese industrial policies it also said chinese state firms had played an important role in shaping these investment flows with a quarter of acquisitions from 2000 to 2016 carried out by state firms representing a 29 per cent share in the total transactional value according to rhodium data in its updated report the ustr said multiple data sources including chinese and foreign media reports data providers and company filings to stock exchanges had concluded that china s sustained interest in acquiring technology in the united states increasingly relies upon venture capital investment the report reviewed in detail china s acquisitions in seven hi tech sectors in the us aviation integrated circuits information technology electronics biotechnology industrial machinery and robotics renewable energy and the car industry it also listed 25 outbound acquisition projects conducted or led by chinese state owned companies in short the chinese government has the means and authority to prevail and does prevail on chinese firms on where to invest what to invest and how much to invest the report concluded shou huisheng a researcher on international relations at tsinghua university said foreign companies were worried about losing competitiveness in the face of chinese state intervention in outbound economic and investment activities this has caused the us china rivalry to escalate to a full blown competition about ideology he said there have been voices in china to reform the state support model given the severe external situation we are facing because a strong government hand will ultimately strangle enterprises ability to innovate more than a trade imbalance whatever the outcome of the us china negotiations it is clear from the wide ranging claims of the report that the dispute is about much more than a trade imbalance how effectively beijing can address the concerns it raises may determine the success or otherwise of the talks and what happens after the current truce ends chinese government advisers have said that even though both sides want to find a solution to the trade war it is unrealistic to expect beijing to make any radical changes of its industrial and technology catch up policies while washington is unlikely to stop boycotting chinese technology

advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content craig alexander deloitte canada s chief economist told several hundred housing executives at a bild calgary region dinner last week that he expected the bank s decision this came as no surprise because financial markets had priced out any rate hike in january in the wake of the tumble in oil and in light of the volatility of the stock market in december said alexander the bank of canada said it still believes that they will ultimately need to move interest rates back to what they consider to be neutral i would argue that the neutral for canada is actually the bottom of that range most forecasters were forecasting the bank of canada would take the overnight rate up to two and a half percent in 2019 and i don t think they re going to get there i think ultimately by the time we get towards the end of this year i think they re going to realize the economy isn t as strong and i think we re going to get a half of a point increase in interest rates this year and i think there s a growing case that they remain on hold a small increase or keeping the rate on hold is good news for prospective home buyers because rising rates make the mortgage stress test more severe advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content alexander expects the national economy to level out we are going to see businesses outside the energy patch investing more because capacity utilization is running at very high levels he said i think we are going to see exports benefitting from a weak canadian dollar but fundamentally the exports and investment can t pick up the slack in the moderation in housing and consumer spending and that s why economic growth drops down to less than two percent last fall alexander had high expectations for the alberta economy as december unfolded i got less enthused he said my forecast for alberta was for growth of 2 3 percent basically neck and neck with b c for the fastest rate of economic growth but now alberta is below the middle of the pack of provinces in terms of growth alexander updated his forecast because of oil the drop in oil prices and oil production curtailment knocks alberta s economic growth rate down from 2 3 percent to about 1 3 percent he said the production curtailment has had the desired impact in narrowing the spread between west texas intermediate wti crude and western canada select wcs prices however what we re talking about is real gross domestic product gross domestic product is the value of all the goods and services we produce the real gdp strips off prices if you put in place an oil production curtailment you reduce the production in order to lose the crisis when you boost the prices but you cut the production you lower your real gdp because it doesn t capture price affects so ultimately the curtailment combined with lower oil prices will constrain investment in the energy patch that is going to lead to weaker economic growth advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content and an effect on housing the real estate market is directly a function of how the economy is doing and so i think we are going to see a weaker pace of construction but well above what we had in 2015 2016 said alexander i think prices have already started to dip but one thing that limits the impact of prices is what will be happening to listings as listings drop it will constrain new supply and constraining new supply will limit the impact on pricing i think we ll see single digit price declines in calgary this year reflected by a weaker economy and then in 2020 i think we ll see some price growth but again i think it will be in the low single digits article content share this article in your social network read next latest national stories

news national by staff reporter get latest news by email subscribe powered by mass protests proposed by the combined force of civil servants labour unions and the opposition mdc alliance have plunged president emmerson mnangagwa and his zanu pf party into panic amid fears the unfolding economic crisis could morph into a fully fledged uprising of november 2017 proportions political observers opined in interviews last week that this could have been the reason why the president cut short his leave zimbabwe is in the throes of a debilitating economic crisis that has sparked widespread labour unrest and general despondency in the populace that has been thrust into poverty and despair owing to the sudden loss of value of the country s surrogate currency the bond note workers salaries were recently devalued four fold by the tacit concession by authorities that the bond note is not equivalent to the united states dollar when the reserve bank of zimbabwe announced that the two currencies could no longer be housed in the same account the announcement immediately sent the bond note spiralling downslope to as much as 1 to 6 against the us dollar as attempts by finance minister mthuli ncube to claim the two still traded at par failed to convince the market prices of goods and services responded accordingly and soon basic commodities were priced four times higher than the previous us dollar rate and even products such as cement which used to cost 10 bond immediately shot up to over 30 bond or usd 10 the situation has not changed to date the workers soon became agitated beginning with doctors who demanded to be paid in us dollars followed by teachers and the rest of the civil service who are now demanding same the government has called a meeting tomorrow with representatives of all civil servants in the hope of stemming what could degenerate into a mass labour unrest which labour unions and the opposition mdc could capitalise on to stage mass protests that they have already planned despite the meeting called by the government tomorrow the zimbabwe teachers association zimta last night formally declared its members would not be reporting for duty when schools open on tuesday they cited the systematic erosion of their salaries sharp rise of prices of basic commodities and transport fares and the charging of many goods in us dollars zimta president richard gundane said government had failed to address any of their grievances and concerns despite previous engagements and discussions our members are unable to report for duty with effect from the 8th of january 2019 due to incapacitation gundane said to enable the teacher to report for work and to subsist we demand payment of salaries in us dollars doctors have been on strike for the past 36 days over similar demands while the zimbabwe congress of trade unions and the mdc have called for protests over the deteriorating economic situation in the country sources said the panicky mnangagwa government was now desperate to find ways to stop imminent unrest in the country as this would make it vulnerable considering the manner in which mnangagwa came into power through a military coup in november 2017 the sources said there were fears that low ranking security personnel feeling the pinch of the economic meltdown might subtly support the protests and render the security situation in the country volatile the government is now panicking there are threats from every corner from its workers demanding salaries in us dollars to industry where companies producing utility goods are demanding payment for goods in the greenback the source said mnangagwa has been projecting himself as a reformed person and it will be difficult for him to use brute force to deal with the protests the ghost of the august 1 shooting is still haunting him and he is desperate for ways to resolve the crisis zanu pf the source added was now desperate to blame mdc leader nelson chamisa who refused to recognise mnangagwa s leadership for the looming unrest saying it is his plot to make the country ungovernable mnangagwa was last week forced to abort his leave to work with his deputy vice president constantino chiwenga to resolve a strike by doctors which has gone beyond a month collapsing the public health sector in the country the striking doctors met first lady auxillia last friday but the meeting failed to bring a solution to the crisis that enters into its 37th day today mnangagwa s return to work came reportedly after a meeting of the joint operations committee largely made up of the security apparatus which recommended his immediate return to avert a situation that has become a security threat caused by the deteriorating situation in the country yesterday soldiers were reportedly manning major hospitals as the crisis in the health sector deepened following the decision by doctors last week to close even the emergency units to maintain pressure on government mnangagwa also fears that the protests could be politicised and force him out of power his spokesperson george charamba who was unreachable last night last week warned opposition parties against getting involved in the doctors strike charamba s warning came after chiwenga last week claimed the doctors strike was now pursuing a political agenda an allegation flatly rejected by the doctors just before the christmas holiday economist and former mdc legislator eddie cross implored the zanu pf leader to immediately resolve the country s economic crisis or risk a military action to topple him from power according to political observers and sources who spoke to the standard yesterday fear was the reason why government has called for a meeting with all labour unions and stakeholders tomorrow teachers had proposed to start their strike tomorrow and sources said tomorrow s meeting was meant to try to pacify the workers and avoid the strike which would likely have far reaching consequences on mnangagwa s rule local government minister july moyo who is the acting labour and social welfare minister together with several cabinet colleagues will meet all labour unions at the national social security authority building in harare tomorrow it is also that fear according to sources that has forced zanu pf youths to release a statement advising mnangagwa to flash out and fire government officials suspected of sabotaging his policies asked to comment on claims that zanu pf was in panic mode party spokesperson simon khaya moyo said i am not spokesperson of the opposition you can ask them they are the ones who are saying so but zanu pf youth league national commissar godfrey tsenengamu yesterday said the ruling party was only concerned that workers grievances were not being raised using proper means and channels he said the youths were opposed to rioting not demonstrations he warned workers to stay out of politics we admit there are economic challenges in the country but if workers decide to take the political route and manipulate the system for regime change it is our duty as zanu pf youths we have an obligation to defend our electoral victory tsenengamu said

pakistan is traversing minefields as it concludes agreements on investment balance of payments support and delayed payment oil deliveries with saudi arabia and the united arab emirates worth usd 13 billion that are likely to fawn growing distrust in its relations with neighbouring iran pakistani prime minister imran khan expects to next month sign a memorandum of understanding with saudi arabia on a framework for us 10 billion in saudi investments primarily in oil refining petrochemicals renewable energy and mining the signing would take place during a planned visit to pakistan by saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman the memorandum follows the kingdom s rewarding of mr khan for his attendance of a foreign investors summit in riyadh in october that was shunned by numerous ceos of western financial institutions tech entrepreneurs and media moguls as well as senior western government officials because of the killing of journalist jamal khashoggi in the saudi consulate in istanbul mr khan walked away from the summit with a us 3 billion deposit in pakistan s central bank as balance of payments support and a promise to defer up to us 3 billion in payments for oil imports for a year the united arab emirates is expected to conclude similar agreements with pakistan in the coming weeks perhaps the most sensitive investment is likely to be a plan by saudi national oil company aramco to build a refinery in the chinese backed baloch port of gwadar close to both pakistan s border with iran and the indian backed iranian 486 hectar port of chabahar both pakistan and saudi arabia are monitoring progress in chabahar with argus eyes a potential saudi investment in troubled balochistan s reko diq copper and gold mine would further enhance the kingdom s foothold in the strategic province as always the devil could be in the details of the pakistani saudi investment agreement haroon sharif the chairman of pakistan s board of investment cautioned that foreign investment would require a better law and order situation and ease of doing business opportunities pakistan s security situation has somewhat improved in the last year but the country continues to risk blacklisting by the financial action task force fatf an international anti money laundering and terrorism finance watchdog because of the pakistani military s selective support of militants and close ties between militants and political parties including mr khan s pakistan tehreek e insaf pti adding an additional layer of complexity is the fact that funds from the kingdom have been flowing into the coffers of ultra conservative anti shiite anti iranian sunni muslim madrassahs or religious seminars in balochistan it was unclear whether the funds originated with the saudi government or saudi nationals of baloch descent and members of the two million strong pakistani diaspora in the kingdom saudi arabia sees the pakistani region as a launching pad of a potential effort by the kingdom and or the united states to destabilize the islamic republic by stirring unrest among its ethnic minorities including the baluch while saudi arabia has put the building blocks in place for possible covert action it has to date given no indication that it intends to act on proposals to support irredentist action the flow of funds coincided with the publication in november 2017 of a study by the international institute for iranian studies formerly known as the arabian gulf centre for iranian studies a saudi government backed think tank that argued that chabahar posed a direct threat to the arab gulf states that called for immediate counter measures iran s revolutionary guards were the target of a rare suicide bombing in december in the port city that killed two people and wounded 40 others iranian officials including foreign minister mohammad javad zarif and revolutionary guards spokesman brigadier general ramadan sharif suggested without providing evidence that saudi arabia was complicit in the attack the attack underscores the anti regime sentiment boiling under the surface in provinces such as sistan and baluchestan and khuzestan as well as security vulnerabilities in chabahar and beyond said brian m perkins a risk management consultant and former us navy signals intelligence analyst khuzestan is iran s impoverished oil rich province that is home to the country s ethnic arab community while chabahar is located in the iranian province of sistan and baluchistan that boasts the country s highest unemployment rate saudi thinking about stoking unrest strokes with that of president donald j trump s national security advisor john bolton who before assuming office publicly advocated destabilization of iran mr bolton in a policy speech in cairo asserted this week that the united states had joined the iranian people in calling for freedom and accountability america s economic sanctions against the iranian regime are the strongest in history and will keep getting tougher until iran starts behaving like a normal country mr bolton was referring to harsh us sanctions imposed after mr trump last year withdrew the united states from a 2015 international agreement that curbed iran s nuclear program desperately in need of financial support and investment pakistan s agreements with saudi arabia and the uae come at a moment that pakistan iran relations are at a crossroads according to muhammad akbar notezai dawn newspaper s plugged in balochistan correspondent a far cry from four years ago when the pakistani parliament refused a saudi request that pakistani troops join the kingdom s ill fated military intervention in yemen iran now sees pakistan as a saudi ally in the kingdom s rivalry with iran similarly pakistan fears that chabahar will allow india to bypass pakistan in forging closer economic and political ties with iran as well as afghanistan and central asian nations pakistani analysts expect an estimated us 5 billion in afghan trade to flow through chabahar after india last month started handling the port s operations pakistan is further concerned that iran in response to the saudi funding that its sees as part of an anti iranian us saudi plot could step up support for baloch nationalists in a bid to raise the stakes for the south asian nation pakistan is also worried that deteriorating pakistani iranian relations offers india an opportunity to subvert the us 45 billion plus china pakistan economic corridor cpec a crown jewel of the people s republic s belt and road initiative in november the nationalist baloch liberation army claimed responsibility for an attack on the chinese consulate in karachi pakistan s commercial and industrial heartland writing in the pakistan security report 2018 published by the islamabad based pak institute for peace studies pips mr notezai noted that to many in pakistan such concerns were materialized with the arrest of kulbushan jadhav an indian spy in balochistan who had come through iran ever since pakistani intelligence agencies have been on extra alert on its border with iran the journalist warned that the more pakistan slips into the saudi orbit the more its relations with iran will worsen if their borders remain troubled anyone can fish in the troubled water this is what is already happening in the border region
when i began posting the cbb some twenty years ago i made a commitment to readers i ll call it as i see it and let the chips fall where they will over the years i made a further commitment to myself don t be concerned with reputation stay diligently focused on analytical integrity i attach this odd intro to issues 2019 recognizing this is a year where i could look quite foolish i believe global financial crisis is the paramount issue 2019 last year saw the bursting of a historic global bubble crisis dynamics commencing with the blow up of short vol strategies and attendant market instabilities crisis dynamics proceeded to engulf the global periphery argentina turkey em more generally and china receiving a transitory liquidity boost courtesy of the faltering periphery speculative bubbles at core u s securities markets succumbed to blow off excess crisis dynamics finally engulfed a vulnerable core during 2018 s tumultuous fourth quarter as we begin a new year rallying risk markets engender optimism the storm has passed it is believed especially with the fed s early winding down of rate normalization there s no reason why the great bull market can t be resuscitated and extended the u s economy remains reasonably strong while beijing has china s slowdown well under control a trade deal would reduce uncertainty creating a positive boost for markets and economies with markets stabilized the em boom can get back on track as always upside volatility reenergizes market bullishness i titled issues 2018 market structure i fully anticipate market structure to remain a key issue 2019 trend following strategies will continue to foment volatility and instability u s securities markets rallied throughout the summer of 2018 in the face of a deteriorating fundamental backdrop that rally surely fueled by etf flows and derivatives strategies exacerbated fragilities speculative flows fueling the upside destabilization eventually reversed course and market illiquidity soon followed yet short squeezes and the unwind of market hedges create the firepower for abrupt rallies and extreme shifts in market sentiment market illiquidity is a key issue 2019 its wildness lies in wait rallying risk markets create their own liquidity with speculative leverage and derivative strategies in particular generating self reinforcing liquidity recovering stock prices ensure bouts of optimism along with confidence that robust markets enjoy liquidity abundance problems arise with market downdrafts and de risking deleveraging dynamics rally induced optimism feeds unreasonable expectations and eventual disappointment crisis dynamics tend to be a process there s the manic phase followed by some type of shock there is at least a partial recovery and a return of optimism often bolstered by a dovish central bank response it s the second major leg down when things turn more serious for sentiment for market dynamics and illiquidity disappointment turns to disenchantment and eventually revulsion it s been a long time since market participants were tested by a prolonged grinding bear market the february 2018 short vol blowup was a harbinger of trouble to come i believe the january 3 2019 flash crash portends serious issues 2019 in global currency markets an 8 intraday move in the yen vs australian dollar exposed problematic liquidity dynamics last year the short vol market signal was initially dismissed then soon forgotten the recent currency market flash crash is an ominous development of potentially momentous significance our so called king dollar is indicating some vulnerability to begin the new year newfound fed dovishness has caught many traders too long the u s currency and short the yen canadian dollar renminbi and em currencies more generally a clash among a band of fundamentally weak currencies is a critical issue 2019 when the current currency market short squeeze runs its course i see a marketplace that s lost its bearings a new global currency regime of extraordinary uncertainty instability and volatility is an issue 2019 this unsettled new regime is not conducive to speculative leverage the u s dollar has serious fundamental issues trillion dollar fiscal deficits large structural current account deficits huge government corporate and household debt loads fragile securities markets a maladjusted bubble economy political dysfunction and potentially washington chaos and festering geopolitical risks the world s reserve currency is fundamentally unsound the dollar is also the nucleus for a financial apparatus financing much of the world s levered speculative holdings de risking deleveraging dynamics in 2018 saw waning liquidity and widening funding and hedging costs in the entangled world of dollar funding markets with the likes of goldman sachs and deutsche bank seeing cds prices rise significantly late in 2018 mounting systemic fragility would appear a serious issue 2019 china s currency has serious fundamental issues a vulnerable banking system approaching 40 tn of assets more than quadrupling since the crisis with trillions of potentially suspect loans a troubled shadow banking apparatus an historic housing bubble with an estimated 65 million vacant units a deeply maladjusted economic structure bubble economic and financial structures dependent upon ongoing loose financial conditions and rapid credit expansion huge financial and economic exposures to the emerging markets and the global economy more generally a population with significantly elevated expectations prone to disappointment and dissatisfaction and mounting geopolitical risks in short china s historic bubble is increasingly susceptible to a disorderly collapse hong kong s hang seng china h financial index dropped 18 in 2018 although china s banks outperformed the 28 fall in japan s topix bank index i would tend to see asian finance as especially vulnerable to the unfolding global bubble collapse waning confidence in the region s financial stability would portend acute currency market instability china s currency is especially vulnerable to capital flight and the imposition of draconian capital controls the big unknown is how much hot money and leverage has accumulated in chinese markets the indonesia rupiah remains vulnerable to tightening global finance i worry about india s banking system after years of bubble excess i have concerns for the region s financial institutions generally the stability of the perceived stable hong kong and singapore dollars is on the list of issues 2019 fragile asian finance has company italian banks sank 30 in 2018 slightly outperforming the 28 drop in european bank shares stoxx 600 italy s 10 year yields traded to 3 72 in late november before ending 2018 at 2 74 up 73bps in 18 italian hence european stability is an issue 2019 i believe a problematic crisis is likely to unfold in 2019 perhaps sparked by dislocation in italian debt markets and the resulting crisis of confidence in italy s fragile banking system serious de risking deleveraging in italian debt would surely see contagion in the vulnerable european periphery including greece spain and portugal italy s target2 balances liabilities to other eurozone central banks almost reached 500 billion in 2018 heightened social and political instability would appear a major issue 2019 not coincidental with the end of ecb liquidity creating operations draghi had kicked the can down the road markets economies politicians and protestors have about reached the can a crisis of confidence in europe would ensure problematic currency market instability such a scenario would portent difficulties for vulnerable developing eastern european markets and economies many economies would appear vulnerable to being locked out of global financing markets a full fledged financial crisis engulfing turkey cannot be ruled out last year saw significant currency weakness also in the russian ruble iceland krona hungarian forint and polish zloty i would see 2018 difficulties as a harbinger of much greater challenges ahead bubbles are mechanism of wealth redistribution and destruction this reality has been at the foundation of my ongoing deep worries for the consequences of history s greatest global bubble we ve witnessed the social angst a deeply divided country and waning confidence in u s institutions following the collapse of the mortgage finance bubble i fear that the bubble over the past decade has greatly increased the likelihood of geopolitical tensions and conflict aspects of this risk began to manifest in 2018 as fissures developed in the global bubble geopolitical conflict is a critical issue 2019 trade relations are clearly front and center going forward i don t believe we can disregard escalating risks of military confrontation bubbles inflate many things including expectations i worry that the protracted chinese bubble has so inflated expectations throughout china s large population with serious cracks in their bubble beijing will continue to craft a strategy of casting blame on the u s and the west the administration s hard line creates a convenient narrative trump and the u s are trying to hold back china s advancement and ascendency to global superpower status a faltering bubble and deteriorating situation in china present chinese leadership a not inconvenient time to confront the hostile u s the south china sea and taiwan could loom large as surprise flashpoint issues 2019 there are a number of potential geopolitical flashpoints without delving into detail i would say generally that geopolitical risks will continue to rise rapidly in the post bubble backdrop issues easily disregarded during the bubble expansion i e the middle east russia ukraine iran etc may in total become more pressing issues 2019 i can see a scenario where the u s is spending significantly more on national defense in the not too distant future chairman powell very worried about massive debt was an early 2019 headline i believe the u s treasury market in 2018 hinted at a momentous change in market dynamics and while a bout of risk off and a powerful short squeeze fueled a big year end rally there were times when the treasury market s traditional safe haven appeal seemed to have lost some luster the unfolding bursting bubble predicament turns even more problematic if ever treasury yields rise concurrently with faltering risk markets such a scenario seemed more realistic in 2018 with huge and expanding deficits as far as the eye can see the suspect dollar and mounting geopolitical tensions the potential for a disorderly rise in treasury yields is a potential surprise issue 2019 whether treasury yields surprise on the upside or fall further in an unfolding crisis backdrop u s corporate credit is a pressing issue 2019 thursday jan 10 ended a 40 day drought in junk bond issuance longest stretch since at least 1995 both high yield and investment grade funds suffered major redemptions in late 2018 exposing how abruptly financial conditions can tighten throughout corporate finance fueling liquidity abundance throughout the boom etf flows were exposed as a critical market risk flows for years have been dominated by trend following and performance chasing strategies on the upside the reversal of bullish speculative flows was joined in late 2018 by speculative shorting and hedging related selling liquidity abundance abruptly transformed into unmanageable selling pressure and acute illiquidity pernicious market structure was revealed and outside of short squeezes and fleeting bouts of optimism i believe putting the etf humpty dumpty back together will prove difficult the misperception of etf moneyness is being cracked wide open enormous leverage has accumulated throughout corporate credit over the past decade this portends negative surprises and challenges in the unfolding backdrop at this point i ll assume some type of trade agreement is cobbled together with the chinese this might provide near term support for the markets and global economy but i don t believe a trade agreement would fundamentally change the backdrop of faltering global financial and economic bubbles expect ongoing global pressure on leveraged speculation as an industry the hedge funds did not experience huge redemptions in 2018 i expect redemptions and fund closures to be a significant issue following the next bout of serious de risking deleveraging a similar dynamic should be expected for the etf complex late 2018 outflows were likely just a warmup for the type of destabilizing flows possible in a panic environment in my view an important interplay evolved during this protracted cycle between the etf complex and a booming derivatives marketplace reliable inflows and abundant liquidity in the etf universe created an advantageous backdrop for structuring and trading various derivatives strategies this seemingly symbiotic relationship has run its course the now highly uncertain etf flow backdrop translates into a potentially problematic liquidity dynamic for derivative related trading etf outflows pose risk to derivatives strategies while a derivatives induced market dislocation risks destroying investor faith in the liquidity and safety of etf passive investing the possibility of a 1987 style portfolio insurance debacle except on a grander global multi asset class scale is an issue 2019 the u s economy has vulnerabilities yet unsound finance is a predominant issue 2019 outside of possible dreadful geopolitical developments i would argue that the key major risk for 2019 is the seizing up of global markets unprecedented amounts of risks have accumulated across markets around the globe consider a particularly problematic scenario a major de risking deleveraging episode sparks upheaval and illiquidity across currencies equities and fixed income markets such a scenario might incite a crisis of confidence in major global financial institutions including derivatives markets and counterparties central bankers better not disappoint last week s dovish turn by chairman powell broke the bearish spell and reversed markets higher though this came weeks late in the eyes of most market participants we know that long periods of suppressed volatility can lead to the build up of risks and to a disruptive ending and the idea that monetary policy can ignore that and leave it to macroprudential tools just is not credible to me this prescient comment released friday is extracted from 2013 federal reserve transcripts governor powell at the time clearly had a firmer grasp of the risks associated with qe than chairman bernanke and future chair yellen it is my long held view that the fed and the other major central banks will see no alternative than to resort to qe when global markets seize up ten year treasury yields at 2 70 german bund yields at 22 bps and jgbs at zero don t seem inconsistent with this view it s been a decade or three of monetary disorder now come the consequences commencing with acute market and price instability i believe this instability will end in a serious and prolonged crisis there will be policy interventions of course but it will become increasingly clear that flawed monetary doctrine and policies are more the problem than the solution in an increasingly acrimonious world how closely will policymakers coordinate crisis responses will central bankers stick with whatever it takes how quickly will they react to the markets and with how much firepower uncertainty associated with monetary policymaking in a global crisis environment is an issue 2019 for the week the s p 500 jumped 2 5 up 3 6 y t d and the

concerns about whether the economy can continue expanding have gripped investors in recent weeks and spurred erratic swings in global markets such fears threaten to weigh on banks this year because their performance is closely tied to the health of the economy bank profits suffer when the economy stumbles and businesses are scared to borrow they become especially vulnerable when a recession hits and some customers aren t able to pay back loans whether a recession looms will be a key topic of discussion this week when jpmorgan chase jpm citigroup c bank of america bac wells fargo wfc goldman sachs gs and morgan stanley ms report earnings from the final three months of 2018 update citi reported earnings that topped forecasts but its revenues were lower than what wall street was expecting

about 9 last year one reason for worry has been the shrinking difference between short term and long term bond yields before almost every recent recession the so called yield curve has inverted meaning short term rates are higher than long term ones that indicates investors are not enthusiastic about long term growth the flattening yield curve affects the income banks collect from lending since banks pay interest on short term rates and lend at long term rates they make money off the difference when the banks report this week wall street will likely pay close attention to consumer and business loans analysts predict solid loan growth for last quarter but the segments will be keenly monitored as barometers of economic health steve biggar an analyst at argus research noted in a

another surge in commercial real estate that would encourage a lot of borrowing cannon said we see concerns about leveraged lending which is an area that has grown rapidly businesses already have high debt loads he added last quarter s market volatility could also lead to questions about the pace of mergers and acquisitions and public offerings activity in the capital markets can dwindle when they

watchers aren t exactly worried about their survival regulators have gone to great lengths since the 2008 financial crisis to ensure banks would be on solid footing in the event of another recession

increased by more than 3 trillion according to a november report from the federal reserve board of governors banks have also maintained solid capital levels to cushion any losses and have largely

by 2020 chinese consumers would be more relevant to the global economy than anyone except americans washington dc for most of the past decade the growing spending power of china s expanding middle class has fueled the global economy after the 2008 financial crisis i argued that the united states and china would need to swap places with the us saving more and consuming less and china doing the opposite until the past year that is largely what had been happening not so anymore last week apple published a letter to shareholders revising down its expected revenues for the first quarter of 2019 citing an economic slowdown in china which has become an increasingly important market for iphone mac and ipad sales though tech industry analysts are debating whether internal dynamics at apple might also explain the change the company s new guidance nonetheless adds to the evidence that chinese consumption is slowing a sustained decline in chinese consumption would be even more worrying than the current us china trade dispute given that us trade policies and other external influences should not have much effect on domestic chinese spending the problem may be more deeply rooted in china s economic model to understand what is at stake consider all that has changed just within the past decade at the end of 2010 domestic consumption accounted for around 35 6 percent of chinese gdp according to official chinese data that was remarkably low compared to most other economies not least the us where consumption accounted for almost 70 percent of gdp in nominal dollar terms china s domestic consumption thus was around 2 2 trillion or almost five times lower than that of the us 10 5 trillion yet china s high overall growth rate meant that chinese consumers could potentially play a much larger role with far reaching benefits for global brands such as apple bmw burberry ford and many others as of 2017 chinese consumption as a share of gdp had risen to 39 1 representing just over 5 trillion in nominal dollar terms that is an increase of almost 3 trillion in just seven years and though chinese consumer spending still lagged far behind that of the us 13 5 trillion in 2017 the gap has narrowed if china were to continue on the same trajectory in terms of nominal gdp growth and domestic consumption its consumer spending could increase by another 2 trillion by 2020 putting it at around half that of the us chinese consumers would be more relevant to the global economy than anyone except americans looking ahead to the 2021 2030 period an annual growth rate of eight percent compared to the 10 percent rate of the past decade and a gradual increase of consumption to 50 percent of gdp would translate into chinese consumer spending of 18 4 trillion per year by 2030 in this scenario chinese consumption would surpass that of the us in dollar terms the question at the start of 2019 then is what it will mean for the global economy if this scenario does not play out if apple s recent guidance points to an across the board indefinite reduction in chinese consumption will american consumers be able to serve as the sole engine of the global economy for yet another decade if not could any other country fill this role even partially the last 40 years have taught me never to write off the us it is possible that american consumers will keep plugging away one way or the other yet consumer spending is vulnerable to a number of factors including inflation higher borrowing costs and pressures on the us to increase savings besides the risk of relying too much on us consumers should be well known by now as we saw in 2008 when america sneezes the rest of the world catches a cold it is very unlikely that any other country could step in to drive consumption at least not in the next decade the larger developed economies are all experiencing slow growth and their consumer spending has never mattered much for the rest of the world anyway emerging economies such as india indonesia and nigeria certainly could make up for declining us or chinese consumption 20 years from now but none is in a position to match the growth of chinese consumption today or even over the course of the next decade for its part india s nominal gdp could exceed 3 trillion by 2020 which would make it the world s fifth largest economy but it will take far longer for indian consumers to match the spending power of their chinese counterparts can the chinese consumer be resurrected i am cautiously optimistic chinese policymakers will need to consider providing more direct fiscal support as well as reforming the hukou household registration system which currently denies rights to migrant workers from the country s rural areas with more economic security this significant cohort of the country s population will be more likely to save less and consume more to be sure these policies will place additional demands on the chinese leadership but without them we could all find ourselves worse off jim o neill a former chairman of goldman sachs asset management and a former uk treasury minister is chair of chatham house 2019 project syndicate www project syndicate org

passing day economists say while most of the 21 lapses in government spending since 1976 left barely a scratch on economic growth the length of this shutdown makes it harder to say just how bad the impact could get it s not a hard stretch to say that initially it s smaller and then it expands the pain starts to widen beth ann bovino chief us economist at s p global ratings told afp think of it as a butterfly effect with about a quarter of the federal workforce affected the shutdown is currently squeezing an estimated 1 2 billion a week out of the economy bovino said but that figure could grow if it drags on at the current rate within two weeks it will have cost america more than the 5 7 billion us president donald trump is demanding for a wall on the border with mexico the dispute with congress that led to the failure to pass funding for government operations following extended closures in 1995 and 2013 the us economy continued to grow while stock markets mainly went sideways and gdp growth lost in one quarter can rebound in the next as the government springs back to life and workers recoup lost salaries but some losses can never be recovered in myriad but often unseen

fallen victim to the budget impasse meanwhile tax refunds and borrower income verifications crucial to the mortgage industry were briefly up in the air with billions at stake the tentacles start to touch many avenues of life and that s a very sad thing bovino said us coast guard cutters their crews working without pay on monday began icebreaking at commercial ports in the frigid waters of great lakes near the canadian border so local steel mills can remain supplied with iron ore meanwhile farmers cannot collect aid payments designed to help ease the pain caused by trump s trade war with

for ordinary chinese buying property is a hedge against currency devaluation from credit expansion when china started its opening and reform in 1978 the balance of m2 the broadest measure of money supply was only 116 billion yuan by the end of last year m2 had reached 180 trillion yuan us 26 6 trillion more than 1 500 times the money supply 40 years ago but actually there is little chance that the housing bubble will burst given china s special economic and social model some analysts are even predicting the chinese economy will implode including a collapse in housing prices with or without external challenges such as the trade war with the united states it s fair to say china is facing a property market bubble in the sense that housing prices are far beyond people s affordability the price to income ratio in cities like beijing and shanghai is around 23 meaning the average household would have to work for more than two decades without spending to buy a home in tokyo and new york that ratio is much lower at about 13 that s why chinese have been eager to buy property since the housing marketisation of the late 1990s and especially after 2008 when the government introduced a huge stimulus plan to boost the slowing economy the rapid expansion of credit in china has been good for the younger generation it makes them much more optimistic than their parents but the older generation has seen a rapid dilution of their pensions and savings so if they want to leave something of value to their children housing again is the best choice since property is one of the few assets they can hold ownership rights to buying a home in a downtown area also means better access to infrastructure goods and services this is an important characteristic of china s social model that administrative departments are in charge of social resources distribution so an area s administrative centre is also its economic centre as well as its transport medical and education centres it s china s big government and small society approach but it is important to note that most social welfare offered via these administrative centres goes to the local property owners not to tenants that explains why the home price to income ratio is so high and the rent to sale ratio is so low even in the downtown areas of small cities in line with that allocation system economic resources are also distributed by the government through a debt driven investment model china s rapid economic development has been accompanied by a process of resource capitalisation through loans and debt and the main collateral is land and real estate so while higher housing prices provide more fees to the government through transfers of land use rights governments and their finance vehicles a special kind of state owned enterprise rely on high home prices to maximise the land value and when the debtors are mainly local governments and state owned enterprises credit expansion and inflation are inevitable these are after all the people making economic policies so it makes sense for them to reduce credit risk and repayment pressure by easing those policies it also makes it very difficult to carry out a severe tightening of macro policy in china so without changing the land ownership system or privatising state owned enterprises all of these factors work together in a closed loop higher home prices higher land value more investment capital higher development rate more credit supply higher returns on assets more people sharing paper wealth and higher home prices value judgments aside this system is sustainable when operating under certain conditions one condition is avoiding the risk of hyperinflation that comes from an overflow of liquidity but the real economic risk for china now is deflation because of the waste economy brought by over productivity and weak consumption meaning there is no shortage of consumer goods to support hyperinflation another condition is avoiding the risk of output not keeping up with demand and that is the real danger for china s economy but considering china s vast urbanisation process is still under way and there is still a huge need for materials like steel and cement investment demand itself will drive up output so it s safe to say that until the urbanisation drive ends property prices will fluctuate but we certainly aren t heading for a housing price crash any time soon zhang lin is a beijing based independent political economy commentator this article appeared in the south china morning post print edition as mainland property bubble isn t going to burst any time soon

and so it has begun i first sounded an early warning bell as early as 8 october 2018 in this space ill winds blow on mint road and most recently wrote about it on 17 december 2018 watching a tragedy unfold exactly a week after the resignation of urjit patel as governor of the reserve bank of india rbi since then newly appointed governor shaktikanta das a veteran bureaucrat and loyal lieutenant of the narendra modi government has wasted little time in making clear that it is back to business as usual as it was in the good old days cosy consultations with stakeholders such as the chiefs of public sector banks and vague promises of injecting more liquidity into the system as well as reversing rbi s tough stance on bad debts in the micro small and medium enterprises msme sector more recently rbi has paid out a hefty dividend to the government while assorted committees deliberate on the capital structure of the institution and the governance and management of rbi itself the message the spigots are being opened wide in the hope they may give a fillip to the economy in advance of elections if there were any grain of doubt anyone might have had on 11 december when das took charge that should now be erased the government has taken a wrecking ball to the de facto functional autonomy of the central bank and by the time his work is done rbi will be but a shadow of the formidable institution it had become under former governors raghuram rajan and urjit patel instead we are now headed toward latin american and african territory where the central bank will become in all but name a branch of the finance ministry or if you find that analogy too extreme for your comfort level we will at a minimum hark back to the bad old days of the previous bureaucrat turned governor duvvuri subbarao who tried to intervene during the taper tantrum of 2013 and made a complete hash of it what is now self evident is that de facto central bank independence in a political economy with generally weak institutions is not good enough rbi needs legal de jure autonomy and this will require a thorough revamp of the rbi act let us recall that the act dates back to 1934 in the depths of the great depression and under our former colonial rulers independence of the central bank was not a well understood concept at that time if it was understood at all it might be objected that central banks in other westminster democracies such as the united kingdom or canada are not as legally autonomous as say the us federal reserve system which is governed by an act of congress even us president donald j trump who has bent or has tried to bend other institutions out of shape has not been able to act on his wish or whim to fire jerome powell the chairperson of the federal reserve and has had to remain content with fuming on twitter as for central banks such as those in the uk and canada they operate within a system in which unwritten convention and accepted practice just about carry the weight of law thus in canada after the infamous sacking of james coyne the central bank chief by the conservative government of prime minister john diefenbaker in 1961 it was legally established that the central bank chief served at the pleasure of the government and could be removed by the minister of finance donald fleming in 1961 however after it was quickly realized how disastrous this move proved to be shaking the confidence of markets in the autonomy of the central bank no such attempt has been made since then though the statute governing the central bank remains unchanged this was true even when inflation hawk and arch monetarist john william crowe drove the interest rate and with it the unemployment rate into double digits thereby dooming the re election chances of the then conservative government in 1993 however prime minister brian mulroney never once attempted to intervene in crowe s monetary policy though he clearly realized the political cost much as a stoic former us president jimmy carter gave federal reserve chief paul volcker the green light to slay the evil of inflation knowing fully well it would imperil his re election chances in 1980 the notion that rbi needs greater autonomy is not just the view of inflation nutters but that of the international monetary fund imf the arbiter of the global monetary and financial system in the most recent review under the imf s financial sector assessment program fsap on 21 december 2017 the financial system stability assessment fssa for india observed that there was scope for further improvement most notably strengthening the rbi s de jure independence as well as its powers over public sector banks one shudders to think what the assessors would make of recent developments the overarching political economy problem in india as in most emerging economies is that no incumbent government has an incentive to strengthen institutions when there is short term political gain to be reaped by weakening and capturing them this is a bad equilibrium meanwhile advanced economies have converged on a good equilibrium where everyone sees it in their long term interests to keep institutions strong in the case of india as far as rbi is concerned expect us to go from bad to worse vivek dehejia is resident senior fellow at the idfc institute mumbai read vivek s mint columns at

what economy asked this lady manager last week pompously ethiopian resumed its flight to asmara pretty soon we ll have our navy back in assab teddy afro is down issu is up the country has a budget with a huge hole in it the emirates dished out a billion or two or three in handouts and investment washington dc the next stop for dr abye ahmed why worry the country continues to be euphoric non stop for the last three months i suppose one should only start worrying when the party is over fingers will be pointing at dr abye ethiopia s most popular and dynamic prime minister in decades if things go wrong particularly if the economy fails upon reflection dr abye s popularity rests on two legs his rhetoric about ethiopian unity and his idealistic promise of love and care for all the first leg is still looking fresh the second one well i ll let you reflect on it some people are beginning to sense uneasiness about the economy or the absence of direction of where the government is heading many remained skeptical about the privatization scheme sketched out so far aimed at revitalizing the economy is aa going to articulate something we haven t heard before is he going to propose a set of actions that have not already been tried in the way of revitalizing the small and medium enterprises we don t know what we know is that the way ahead is complicated the country is bankrupt and government is weakening money power and hopes for the future remain stuck somewhere so the question is should you buy ethiopia or look for new pastures anyway dear readers ethiopia has always been assessed in terms of its potential it has been this way for centuries there will be soon more discussions i hope on its potential discussions on the kind of economic system or arrangement it needs small forums are already popping up here and there political parties including those on the opposing sides those that still exist will hopefully do more analysis on what is needed where to look for capital investments that can diversify modernize and rejuvenate our economy coupled with an overhaul of the policy apparatus commensurate with those goals come to think of it there aren t many choices in terms of economic systems to choose from these days for over two decades ethiopia officially claimed to be a developmental state a government basically insulated from democratic debate and contestation on issues of economic decision making those in charge borrowed taxed stole and defrauded all in the name of developmental states using whatever legal or non legal means to bankrupt the country as a result the eprdf gave the development state notion a dreadful name and yet the traditional key goal of developmental state is the building of markets typically developmental states use trade policy public financing subsidies tax incentives and other industrial policies to build up their economies in particular their manufacturing sector the free market approach would have countries only exploit their current comparative advantage as if it was naturally determined and static condition whereas a developmental state would view comparative advantage as dynamic and changeable over time and to be manipulated in a long term process of constant industrial upgrading now there are many people arguing that the free market will fix it all and send us all into nirvana these folks ignore the critical role states play in not only making markets but also supporting technological development and innovation these free market critics of state intervention have long claimed that the private sector can do it all by itself if the state would just get out of the way they want to ignore that a satisfactory market economy capable of maintaining itself does not arise from our energetically doing nothing they don t want to acknowledge today s economy is an artistic construct requiring the existence of strong state authority yes dear readers the state has unique coordination and convening powers and ability to pool risk create markets and provide public goods that the private sector cannot undertake in fact the debate over the role of the state in development is largely settled as empirical analyses indicate adequately designed economic and political institutions have positive effects on growth and wealth many also believe the dispute about capitalism vs socialism have come to an end the current discussion is more about which kind of market economy ensures a positive economic and social development in a country the question in fact is how states can best carry out these functions or rather how states can establish humane and workable economic order ethiopia should therefore explore for an economic arrangement that would produce beneficial results for all our underlying philosophy should be based on building a competitive economy that i guarantees property rights ii ensures lowest price volatility low inflation to coordinate economic activity efficiently iii embraces open access to domestic and international markets iv ensures the consistency and stability of economic policy and v makes sure that not only consensus is realized by all people but that there will be mutual benefits from the implementation of institutions no we should not seek to centrally plan the economy or to let unrestricted free market go awry but to put in place a socially responsible political economy that in contrast to neoliberal ideas of free markets protects the individual and its environment from the sort of homogenization and strife that markets bring about remember there is no rocket science magical secret or something fishy in say south korea s development miracle and economic and political freedom some five decades back it is the outcome of an economic management system that has been put in place in tune with vision of the political leadership to let everybody cherish the taste of sustainable progress there is no reason we cannot repeat that feast today

and jobs act tcja the u s system had become extremely anti competitive thanks to a 35 percent rate that was far above the world average so reform was desperately needed that s the good news the bad news is that democrats in the house of representatives already are pushing for a big increase in the corporate rate rep john yarmuth the new house budget chairman said his chamber s budget blueprint will aim to claw back lost revenue by boosting the corporate tax rate from its current 21 percent to as high as 28 percent he anticipates the budget resolution will envision changes to the 2017 gop tax overhaul including raising the corporate tax rate above its current 21 percent we ll see how much revenue we can get out of it the rate was 35 percent before it was cut in the gop tax bill since republicans control the senate and trump is in the white house there s probably no short term risk of a higher corporate tax rate but such an initiative could be a major threat after the 2020 election so let s augment our collection of evidence showing why a higher rate would be a very bad idea we ll start with some analysis from the number crunchers at the tax foundation a corporate tax rate that is more in line with our competitors reduces the incentives for firms to realize their profits in lower tax jurisdictions and encourages companies to invest in the united states raising the corporate income tax rate would dismantle the most significant pro growth provision in the tax cuts and jobs act and carry significant economic consequences raising the corporate income tax rate would reduce economic growth and lead to a smaller capital stock lower wage growth and reduced employment raising the rate to 25 percent would reduce gdp by more than 220 billion and result in 175 700 fewer jobs here s the table showing the negative effect of a 22 percent rate and a 25 percent rate so a bit of extrapolation will give you an idea of how the economy will suffer with a 28 percent rate by the way since the adverse impact on wages is one of the main reasons to be against a higher corporate tax rate i ll also share this helpful flowchart from the article now let s look at some research from china which underscores the importance of low rates if we want more innovation here s the unique set of data that created an opportunity for the research in november 2001 china implemented a tax collection reform on all manufacturing firms established on or after january 2002 which switched the collection of corporate income taxes from the local tax bureau to the state tax bureau after the reform similar firms established before or after 2002 could pay very different effective tax rates because of the differences in the management and incentives of those two types of tax bureaus resulting in a reduction of effective corporate income tax rates by almost 10 among newly established firms the policy change created exogenous variations in the effective tax rate among similar firms established before versus after 2002 we can thus apply a regression discontinuity design rd and use the generated variation in the effective tax rate to identify the impact of taxes on firm innovation and here are the findings our analysis yields several interesting results first we show a strong and robust causal relationship between tax rate and firm innovation decreasing the effective tax rate by one standard deviation 0 01 increases the average number of patent application by a significant 5 7 see figure 2 for the graphical evidence the reform also stimulated r d expenditures and increased the skilled labour ratio by 14 second a lower tax rate also improves the quality of patents the impact of tax reform on patent applications mainly comes from its effect on invention and utility patents decreasing the effective tax rate by one standard deviation improves the probability of having an invention patent application by 4 4 and increases the number of utility patent applications by 4 7 don t forget that high personal tax rates also discourage innovation so it s a pick your poison menu here s a chart from the study showing the difference in patents between higher taxed firms and lower taxed firms last but not least let s review some of the findings from a study published by the national bureau of economic research we present new data on effective corporate income tax rates in 85 countries in 2004 in a cross section of countries our estimates of the effective corporate tax rate have a large adverse impact on aggregate investment fdi and entrepreneurial activity for example a 10 percent increase in the effective corporate tax rate reduces aggregate investment to gdp ratio by 2 percentage points corporate tax rates are also negatively correlated with growth and positively correlated with the size of the informal economy the results are robust to the inclusion of controls for other tax rates quality of tax administration security of property rights level of economic development regulation inflation and openness to trade and here s one of the many charts and tables in the study the bottom line is that a higher corporate tax rate will be bad for workers for the simple reason that less investment means lower productivity and lower productivity means lower wages p s it s also likely that house democrats will try to increase the top personal tax rate though hopefully they re not so crazy as to push for ocasio cortez s 70 percent rate
washington the nation s largest business organization has slammed socialism and far left policies that have become popular among members of democratic party u s chamber of commerce president and ceo thomas donohue raised concerns about the growing disregard of the free enterprise system failed ideas like socialism or government managed economies are steadily creeping into the political mainstream he said in his annual state of american business address on jan 10 here s all you need to know he continued when a centralized government tries to plan everything for everyone it provides inferior service for all even with its occasional flaws and excesses no one has ever devised a better system than free enterprise founded in 1912 the u s chamber of commerce represents the interests of more than 3 million businesses of all sizes the chamber advocates for pro business policies that create economic growth and jobs such as smart tax policy and regulatory relief its members range from mom and pop shops and local chambers to industry associations and large corporations i don t know about you but i m going to stick with the entrepreneurs the innovators and the dreamers donohue said donohue s remarks came in response to growing support for far left socialist ideas among democrats the suddenly prominent socialist alexandria ocasio cortez d n y for example drew a lot of attention recently for suggesting tax rates as high as 70 percent to fund the green new deal an ambitious new environmental agenda the freshly seated democratic congresswoman told cbs that she supported a progressive tax rate system where a lower income group pays a lower federal income tax rate but once you get to the tippy tops on your 10 millionth dollar sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 percent or 70 percent she said ocasio cortez also compared herself to presidents abraham lincoln and franklin d roosevelt during the interview it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country she said abraham lincoln made the radical decision to sign the emancipation proclamation franklin delano roosevelt made the radical decision to embark on establishing programs like social security if that s what radical means call me a radical threat to free enterprise according to critics the democratic party is moving further to the left supporting proposals like rolling back trump s tax cuts and more government regulations business leaders however have rejected this strong government approach which is anti free market they have welcomed the tax cuts and deregulation efforts of the trump administration business confidence and optimism have reached record high levels last year as a result of these pro business policies rising business optimism has also fueled job growth job openings surged to record high levels last year and the unemployment rate fell to 3 7 percent for the first time in nearly 50 years in 2012 the u s chamber of commerce called elizabeth warren who was then the democratic senate candidate a threat to free enterprise warren came under fire because of her opposition to the keystone oil pipeline her support for obamacare and her proposal to raise taxes on upper income earners new york city mayor bill de blasio has also received criticism from small business owners recently after proposing a plan to force employers with five or more workers to provide two weeks of paid vacation new york city also hiked its minimum wage for the third time in three years new york city s minimum wage is now at 15 an hour some economists however claim that government mandated pay hikes create pressure on business owners leading to increased prices of goods and job losses during his state of the city address de blasio also announced a new effort to protect renters going as far as seizing properties from landlords according to critics all these proposals represent a significant shift toward socialism and the centralization of power optimism is consistently high during his address donohue also talked about the economic outlook our own surveys find that optimism is consistently high he said business owners tell us they have been encouraged by stronger economic growth we have achieved a growth rate in the last year that many experts claimed was out of reach and it was driven in no small part by deregulation and tax reform the chamber is also confident in the u s economy s resilience and hence rejects any recession fears now there are some who seem determined to talk us into a downturn but rumblings of a recession just don t match up with reality donohue said even with all of the challenges in washington uncertainties in the world and fluctuations in the markets strong economic conditions are expected to hold steady for the foreseeable future donohue laid out the business community s top policy priorities for 2019 tackling workforce challenges such as the skills gap the lack of needed skills among the workforce was labeled by donohue as a key priority for 2019 he also called on the president and congress to fix the country s broken immigration system
there will be no shortage of potential catalysts to move markets in the short term into its next phase opportunity for both upside and downside exists though given the one way run experienced on wall street perhaps it should be judged that the risk is skewed slightly to the downside for now 1 global stocks global equities will be forced to prove their mettle this week price action suggests that for many equity indices the market is ambling at a cross road the macro economic challenges moving markets in general haven t been resolved that remained true during last week s trade which saw global stocks move higher in general the difference this week is there are more numerous and higher impact risk events that could make or break the stock market s recovery wall street s winning run came to an end on friday as indexes edged lower nevertheless the asx is set to start on a positive footing this morning with futures indicating a 15 point jump at the open 2 us market s cross roads the will of the bulls was under scrutiny in the latter part of last week the lingering question has yet to be answered are we experiencing a recovery or will this be a faded rally the s p500 couldn t manage to break the big psychological resistance level of 2600 the bulls appeared to simply stall on friday with the us market according to the s p500 closing a very narrow 0 01 per cent lower friday s trade amounted to the only negative session for the major us stock index for the week the upside momentum is apparently waning for us equities the vix is lower it must be stated so fear is diminishing in the market but perhaps confidence is still rattled somewhat by december s market rout 3 reporting season looming a decision to push the market higher or let the recent rally fade must be imminent short activity according to ig s data is gradually building in us indices there will be no room to hide shortly as traders prepare for the kick off of reporting season this week in total earnings growth is increasingly expected to slow by more than first assumed the overriding concern in markets presently is given the weaker macro economic outlook whether the growth expectations of us corporates will diminish in turn the first week of the reporting season is dominated by bank earnings fittingly enough too given its the banks that could prove the canary in the coal mine for any fundamental problems in the market and the us economy at large 4 asx200 once again the asx will likely trade in the slip stream of us stocks this week spi futures are indicating a 15 point jump at today s open according to the last traded price on that instrument like us equities the conviction of the bulls in the asx on friday demonstrated signs of diminishing the 5800 level is for the asx200 what is 2600 is for the s p500 a significant psychological barrier that is coming to represent the difference between recovery and a fading rally
apex council chairperson cecilia alexander says the civil servants umbrella body will intensify pressure on government to hike salaries to a minimum of 1 733 for the lowest paid worker she said as long as government failed to correct price distortions where prices of goods are rising daily civil servants would continue with their demands to be paid in united states dollars apex council chairperson cecilia alexander says the civil servants umbrella body will intensify pressure on government to hike salaries to a minimum of 1 733 for the lowest paid worker she said as long as government failed to correct price distortions where prices of goods are rising daily civil servants would continue with their demands to be paid in united states dollars the standard senior reporter veneranda langa vl last week spoke to alexander ca on developments in salary negotiations and other issues to do with civil servants conditions of service below are excerpts of the interview vl can you give us the current update of what is happening pertaining to salary negotiations for civil servants ca the meetings that were held last week with government yielded nothing and were below our expectations and demands the friday january 11 2019 meeting was declared a nullity because it yielded no results at all and the meeting was adjourned after no conclusion was reached the government team said they wanted to go back to their principals to do further consultations however what is worrying us civil servants is their offer which when you calculate it means that it will see the lowest paid civil servants getting an increment of around 28 to 41 and it is very disturbing vl but what was your justification for demanding a wage increment of 1 733 ca even that increment of 1 733 is far less than what is needed because of runaway inflation and price distortions everyone who lives in zimbabwe knows and understands what i am talking of it is difficult to live now especially for civil servants vl civil servants are said to have rejected a 160 million salary deal giving an impression that it was the attractive offer what is your comment on that assertion and how much is actually needed by civil servants right now to cushion them from the high cost of living ca if you look at that amount as a quantum it sounds as if it is a lot of money however that money is meant to cater for the whole civil service which includes the army police health sector education judiciary and others the effective date for the salary increments was supposed to be the 1st of april up to december 2019 and if you work it out it means that the lowest paid civil servants will only get a 20 to 41 increment that does not work because prices of goods services and other commodities are very high and that pay rise is not commensurate with what is happening on the ground it is not our fault that there are price distortions in the country government needs to play their part and act on prices as long as they do not act on them then we will continue with our demands because the lowest paid civil servant needs to be cushioned from the high cost of living actually the amount that we want as an increment is 3 000 because of the rising prices that are triggering inflation we even indicated that we want to be paid in united states dollars if they pay us in us we will say to them that they can continue paying us the 400 to 700 that they are paying us right now we receive cashless rtgs payments yet everything has gone up even as we speak right now there is a lot of indiscipline in pricing of goods in the market and nobody is correcting the situation we civil servants cannot subsidise government we are doing our duties as workers and they should play their part and give us our wages vl what happened to the other non monetary benefits for civil servants that have been talked about like stands vehicle loans and duty free importation of vehicles ca government did give us a rundown of other initiatives they wanted to explore as incentives for civil servants but at present we are not very much concerned about the non monetary incentives we think that the pertinent issue right now is to cushion us against this high cost of living and restoring our lost incomes we cannot be talking of housing and vehicle benefits which are long term benefits when the first thing that a person needs is to eat go to work and deliver services they tried to bring that up during the negotiations but we said we wanted to deal with the more pressing issues of salary increments which are short term we do not want to say that government has been bad throughout but that in some instances they have tried to implement some incentives through funding support from nssa vl during these national joint negotiating council meetings would you say government is negotiating in good faith ca i would not want to be judgemental on that but i would like to point out that they are not serious about the plight of civil servants they do note that everything has gone up right now and that civil servants wages must go up we cannot be expected to subsidise the system which they are just leaving uncorrected we cannot do that they need to fix the economy and prices united states dollar wages are the way to go vl what is the current state of civil servants and in your response please also take into cognisance those civil servants in rural areas ca right now most civil servants are failing to even send their children to school i do not know where the employer thinks civil servants will get money to afford goods and services whose prices have escalated workers are even failing to report to work because of high transport charges that have gone up by 300 we appreciate that they have already informed us of civil servants early pay dates but many of them are saddled with debts and are struggling even the buses that are supposed to ferry civil servants to work cannot transport them all some of these buses are broken down and are no longer plying some routes civil servants cannot afford basic things like bath soap and clothes most of them now resort to borrowing money for bus fare to work vl in their conditions of services do they get adequate equipment protective clothing or tools of trade ca those are important but i would not want to dwell much on that or try to portray a picture like everything that government is doing for civil servants is wrong right now the main issue that we are seized with is salary increments vl do you think that a nationwide strike for civil servants is the way to go ca if government fails to give us our demands we are saying that as civil servants we cannot continue to subsidise the employer and the system it is not proper as civil servants we are providing quality services and implementing government policies but we also expect that government should meet their part of the bargain and pay us respectable wages we are saying that if government fails to make a decision on that then we are going on strike
the early january recovery across key commodities extended into a second week with the bloomberg commodity index rallying by more than 4 per cent since touching a near three year low on the first trading day of year from an historical perspective we have often found that the initial direction financial markets take at the beginning of a new calendar year can end up being the wrong one to avoid a turnaround the market will be closely watching the current trade negotiations and whether china the us and europe manage to steer away from a looming economic slowdown back to the current market it has been the combination of renewed trade optimism the us federal open market committee signalling its willingness to hold back on further rate hikes combined with a weaker dollar that have all helped support a major risk on rally from stocks to high yield corporate bonds and commodities we find that the recovery has been broad based and primarily led by a strong recovery in crude oil the safe haven asset of gold which rallied strongly during december has despite the recovering sentiment elsewhere managed to hold onto its gains perhaps a sign that investors while returning to riskier assets are still buying protection against the risk of renewed weakness related to the continued shaky outlook for global economic growth the grains sector found support from the prospect of renewed chinese buying of agricultural products for soybeans however the prospect of a bumper south american harvest hitting the market over the coming weeks could mean that a potential deal between china and the us may arrive too late to ensure a meaningful reduction in us stockpiles and with that a recovery in the price soft commodities especially coffee and not least sugar recovered strongly on a combination of a stronger brazilian real and specifically for sugar the prospect of increased cane based ethanol demand for fuel continues its recovery copper while still range bound headed for its biggest weekly gain in two months on a combination of trade optimism supportive chinese economic policies such as the recent announcement of a 1 per cent cut in the reserve requirement ratio rrr and not least the chinese renminbi the cny has rallied to an almost six month high at 6 74 against the dollar and in the process moved firmly away from the critical 7 dollar level which attracted a great deal of nervous attention back in q4 after finding support at 50 barrel last month brent crude oil has swiftly returned to the november to december consolidation area between 57 50 b and 64 b just like all other assets it s the hopes of a deal between the us and china on trade which could reduce worries about the strength of demand going forward adding to this the weaker dollar and not least ongoing production cuts from the opec group which should further reduce supply over the coming months a trade deal between the us and china however is likely to slow but unlikely to reverse the deterioration seen recently in forward looking economic data from the us to europe and china on that basis the upside at this stage may be limited and it could lead to slowing upside momentum as we approach the upper area of the above mentioned consolidation zone for brent at 64 b and wti at 55 b please note that due to the us government shutdown the cftc has not issued any commitments of traders reports since the week of december 18 the cot report provides an important weekly insight into the size and direction of positions held by hedge funds across key futures markets from currencies to bonds and not least commodities the ice futures europe exchange however continues as normal with brent crude and gas oil data still being published in the week to december 31 when brent touched 50 b hedge funds cut bullish brent crude oil bets by 10 000 lots to 152 000 lots a 70 per cent reduction since october when the sell off began the recovery across riskier assets failed to deliver a blow to gold which after reaching 1 300 oz and after rallying by more than 100 dollars since november was overdue a correction however despite surging stocks and rising bond yields gold continued to attract demand with buyers on several days emerging ahead of 1 280 oz the recent dollar weakness not least against the cny has provided a bulwark against the negative impact of surging stocks and rising bond yields a potential us china trade deal may give global risk sentiment a further boost but with global growth momentum slowing investors remain cautious and still on the lookout for ways to protect themselves against renewed weakness on that basis and with the fed on pause amid increased economy and policy uncertainty we maintain a bullish outlook for gold as noted due to the us government shutdown data covering speculative positions held by hedge funds has not been available since december 18 during this time however we have seen a continued rise of holdings in gold backed etfs during the past week total holdings compiled by bloomberg climbed to 2 234 metric tonnes just 5 5 tonnes shy of the recent peak from last may which was the highest in more than five years

biological researcher he jiankui right attends the second international summit on human genome editing at the university of hong kong on november 28 2018 in hong kong china photo by zhang wei china news service vcg via getty images the youtube video began with a young chinese man in a light blue shirt seated in what appeared to be a biology lab speaking exuberantly into the camera in slow but clear english two beautiful little chinese girls lulu and nana came crying into this world as healthy as any other babies a few weeks ago it could have been an excited new father sharing the joy of birth but as the video would soon reveal lulu and nana are not any other babies they are the world s first genetically edited humans born from fertilized eggs modified with crispr cas9 technology at least that is what the man in the video and at the center of a storm of controversy the chinese scientist he jiankui who led the experiment claims the reactions of the scientific community he s employers the chinese government and the general public have not by any means matched the positive tone of he s video since he announced his genetic experiment on november 26 criticism has been swift strong and nearly universal many scientific observers say he used poorly understood technology and used it shoddily to experiment on and create real human beings with unforeseeable consequences he may also have relied on secrecy and lies to carry out his reckless plan the china born us trained he conducted his experiment in his birth country where he s lived and worked since returning from the united states in 2012 as a chinese scientist now working in america i have raised serious concerns about the dangers of china s techno nationalistic ambitions and the country s poor record in scientific ethics a lot more information about he and his experiment have been revealed since news of it first broke what i ve learned only increased my concerns about techno nationalism and lack of attention to ethics in biotechnology research he and i graduated from the same chinese university three years apart we both went on to graduate school in the united states his family and mine came from neighboring provinces in china i saw familiar traits in the path he s taken and felt that his story is one i could at least attempt to understand as i looked into the history of he s life and career the institutions he has interacted with and the conditions he exploited to advance his work the story that emerges is more elizabeth holmes than dr frankenstein it is a story in which high tech ambition meets capitalism with chinese characteristics and the poor village boy pursued both his ambition and the capital required to reach it with shrewdness and zest apparently trampling ethical boundaries along the way in a system that allowed him to trample away it s also a story that could only happen in shenzhen china in the year of 2018 though it started decades earlier and hundreds of miles away provincial beginnings he jiankui was born in 1984 in a small village of farmers and fishermen in central hunan province hunan or south of the lake is located in the middle stretch of the yangtze river and dotted with mountains and waterways my family came from the nearby province of hubei or north of the lake though by the time my parents met they had migrated east to anhui where i was born and raised he s hometown of xinhua is one of the poorest villages in china by the time he started elementary school in 1990 the annual income per capita in xinhua was barely 100 both of he s parents worked in the fields i picked off leeches in my legs every day in the summer said he in a video years later despite the poor conditions he excelled academically earning top grades from elementary school to high school not much had changed in xinhua since he s childhood by the turn of the century the annual income in an average farming family there had doubled but that made it a still bleak 200 per person however 400 miles to the south on china s coast opposite hong kong an economic transformation was taking place that would have profound implications for the region the rest of china and he s life as well before the chinese government designated shenzhen as one of the country s first special economic zones in 1980 the small fishing village on the edge of guangdong province was not much different from xinhua unshackled from years of a planned economy and political hurdles the entrepreneurial and hardworking people of shenzhen turned their world upside down both figuratively and literally shenzhen speed entered the chinese lexicon originally referring to the construction of one story of a building in three days but generalized to symbolize rapid development the coastal city s proximity to the global financial hub of hong kong then still a british colony was a unique advantage by the time he was born shenzhen was already a booming city with modern housing affluent residents and a fledgling tech industry impressing china s then paramount leader deng xiaoping when he visited the city in 1984 among the countless companies to emerge from shenzhen were huawei founded in 1987 and tencent established in 1998 the two would go on to become the world s largest telecom equipment manufacturer and the world s largest gaming and social media company by market value respectively recently huawei s chief financial officer was arrested in canada on an american warrant related to allegations of fraud in relation to us sanctions on iran in the neighboring province of fujian also on china s southern coast another group of villagers was finding its way to prosperity in the eastern village of putian chen deliang a middle school dropout turned street performer obtained a medical license through remote classes by postal mail and earned his first pot of gold from a home remedy for scabies an itchy skin infection building on their initial success chen and his disciples forayed into treating sexually transmitted diseases and infertility exploiting the country s shortage of medical resources lax regulatory system and public stigma about the conditions with aggressive advertising and a clan mentality as their calling cards the putian clique quickly spread across china incentivized by lucrative contracts many public hospitals leased offices to medical practitioners from the putian clique lending the barefoot doctors a cloak of credibility the putian clique met its first major setback in 1998 the exposure of a variety of medical frauds led to a nationwide crackdown and the government soon banned the type of private partnership at public hospitals that putian ers relied on not easily defeated the resourceful putian businesspeople came up with an alternative path if they could no longer work at public hospitals they d just open private ones a string of favorable government policies toward private hospitals came at just the right time despite numerous scandals and much controversy the putian clique of private hospitals popped up all over china continuing their specialization in medical needs too embarrassing for treatment at formal hospitals according to the new york times the putian system now includes eight of 10 private hospitals in china some 8 000 facilities in all while the village of putian is a peculiar case it was not uncommon in 1990s china for an entire village economy to be centered around one commodity and a fanatic race to fortune in many villages in the northern henan province some 900 miles up the coast from shenzhen the product sold was plasma obtained from human blood in the heyday of the plasma industry the guardian has reported a liter went for about eight dollars and a healthy villager could sell up to three times a week earning in a month what one would otherwise make in a year the government abruptly shut down the whole business in 1995 and in a few short years the scent of iron from red blood cells that permeated the villages had turned into the smell of death as villager after villager succumbed to a mysterious and agonizing illness after years of intrepid work by some brave individuals it was eventually revealed that unsanitary equipment and procedures used in plasma collection had infected an estimated one million people with hiv the government kept the business going for several months after gaining knowledge of the situation never informed the exposed population even after shutting down the industry and tried very hard to keep the whole thing under wraps in some villages up to 40 percent of the population was infected with hiv as these types of transformations were taking place across the vast land of china a teenage he jiankui was studying hard at the best high school in his impoverished hometown hoping to score well in the country s notoriously brutal gaokao or college entrance exam for a child from inland china with little in the way of financial resources or political connections academic excellence was the only way out he could not possibly have known then that less than two decades later his life and career would become intertwined with capital from shenzhen a hospital from the putian clique and the story of aids villages in henan the american dream is alive in china in the late summer of 2002 he jiankui arrived at the university of science and technology of china ustc as a college freshman founded in beijing in 1958 but forced to move to the southern city of hefei at the height of the cultural revolution ustc is known as the caltech of china for its small size and intense focus on science and engineering it is one of the most selective universities in china despite scoring high marks on the gaokao he did not get into his first choice for a field of study physics but was admitted to the department of precision machinery and precision instrumentation the president of ustc at the time was the esteemed chemist zhu qingshi the independent minded zhu famously resisted the wave of enrollment expansion that swept chinese universities in the early aughts and spoke critically against the metrics of university evaluation in china that put more emphasis on the appearance of a campus than the quality of its education zhu attributed ustc s resistance to bureaucratic pressure to two factors e have the confidence and we have a spine ustc takes pride in its academic rigor complemented with a degree of flexibility rare at chinese universities students are free to change their majors after their first year and in the fall of 2003 he transferred to the department of modern physics i graduated from ustc s class of 2009 where i also majored in physics according to he s classmates and university records of its top honors where he is not listed he was a good student at ustc but not exceptional this appears to contradict his father s account in chinese media where he always earned first place from elementary school to graduate school never once in second place after he started university every time he came back to the village everyone wanted to meet him and hear his tips for good grades the senior he proudly told reporters at beijing news with the extreme disparity in educational opportunities in china only a handful of the best students from he s hometown or mine have a shot at a place like ustc i understand firsthand the social pressure a community places on its academic celebrities and how the weight of expectation can be overwhelming for a young student around 30 percent of ustc graduates go on to earn postgraduate degrees overseas mostly in the united states which accounts for the university nickname united states training center after graduating from ustc with a degree in physics and a thesis on the theory of quantum state transfer he arrived at rice university in houston in the fall of 2006 to pursue his doctorate in physics three years later i would find myself crossing the oceans to study for my phd at the university of chicago it was at rice that he made the switch to bioengineering a move he later described as out of concerns for future employment opportunities and the pressure to survive according to he the golden age of physics had passed but the field of biology is blossoming as a particle physicist i do not agree with he s categorization of my profession but his arguments sound eerily familiar in my first years in the united states many well meaning people including members of my family tried to persuade me to study biology for better employment prospects he s appetite for publicity was already evident during his time at rice the southern chinese daily news a houston based chinese language newspaper devoted significant space to a report on his wedding in 2010 under this headline with outstanding morals excellent academics and infinite potential a union for life complete with both good looks and scholarly talent in a public post on facebook he excitedly shared the press clip asking friends to help him collect some physical copies so he could mail them back home to his parents i heard other papers reported it too he wrote one commenter joked in disbelief how much did you pay for this he earned his doctorate at the end of 2010 and moved to stanford for postdoctoral work around the same time he started a blog on sciencenet cn a chinese platform for science bloggers in a post from march 2011 he made an announcement per invitation from lambert academic publishing my new book modularity the principle of evolution in complex systems is published today the online magazine slate has described lambert academic publishing lap as a content mill that churns out titles with little apparent attention to selection or editing i am no stranger to invitation from lap myself having received numerous emails from its representatives requesting to republish my papers or doctoral thesis a book from lap won t carry much water in serious academic circles but in the private sector and especially in china given the language barrier it might just woo some investors in 2011 while still in the united states he received an academic award from the chinese government the chinese government award for outstanding self financed students abroad which comes with a check of between 6 000 and 10 000 was established in 2003 with the explicit purpose of encouraging chinese students overseas to return to china for work or serve the country abroad in various ways according to its official website the selection involves a highly politicized process the first round of which is conducted by the chinese embassy in participating countries and the local consulates the year prior he served as president of the chinese student and scholars association cssa at rice an organization that receives funding from and organizes activities with the chinese consulate in houston he set his eyes on returning to china but when he went he would not be returning only as a scientist at stanford he worked in the lab of professor stephen quake a pioneer in single molecule biophysics and gene sequencing quake is also a successful inventor and tech entrepreneur with more than 10 companies to his name they were valued at over a billion dollars at their peak witnessing quake s success and the startup culture at stanford was transformative for he and a city 6 000 miles away was creating the perfect environment for him to realize his startup dreams in 2007 when he was still pursuing his doctorate at rice shenzhen was in its ninth straight year as the fourth richest chinese city by gross domestic product while over half of the city s wealth came from its high tech industry the coastal metropolis struggled with a lack of good universities so the city government decided to bring shenzhen speed to higher education in a bold move against a typically slow and bureaucratic process southern university of science and technology sustech was created almost overnight admitting its first class of students in 2011 zhu qingshi who had just finished a decade long tenure as president of ustc became sustech s founding president his innovative spirit and penchant for reform combined with his rich experience and academic credentials made zhu the ideal person to lead the new university zhu brought to sustech many of the philosophies he practiced at ustc small classrooms a flexible curriculum and abundant research opportunities additionally sustech embraced the enterprising spirit of shenzhen encouraging its faculty to commercialize their research and start their own businesses zhu s successor at sustech was even more explicit y model for sustech is stanford stanford was largely responsible for creating silicon valley and its wealth for shenzhen and sustech the situation was different the city was flush with cash but the university was still largely empty could the best money buy the best talent in 2010 the government of shenzhen launched the peacock plan with tax exempt cash rewards of up to 200 000 and research funds in the millions the peacock plan hopes to attract high level overseas talent to shenzhen zhu himself crisscrossed north america on recruiting tours and at one of the stops he met he jiankui in december 2011 he posted an ad on his blog the he jiankui lab at sustech is searching for postdoctoral researchers he described his future workplace as the he jiankui michael deem joint lab with a focus on genome sequencing deem a physics and bioengineering professor was he s doctoral advisor at rice the professor entrepreneur one of the first things the 28 year old he did after moving to shenzhen in 2012 was to register a company he named it hanhai in chinese likely in a nod to his alma mater ustc s electronic bulletin board is called hanhai xingyun the vastness of the ocean the brilliance of the stars the english name for he s new company is less poetic direct genomics in its pursuit of making china a science and technology superpower the chinese government has made indigenous innovation one of its highest priorities the path from made in china to invented in china relies heavily on chinese capital to make what used to be foreign chinese private and public funding are used not only to recruit foreign trained talent but also to purchase foreign intellectual property he jiankui and direct genomics did both a decade after the completion of the human genome project in 2003 the technology of genome sequencing had matured moving out of research labs into the commercial market by sequencing their genomes people could suddenly learn a lot about themselves from likely ancestral lineage to propensity to suffer from certain diseases chinese companies were eager to get a share of the emerging market in the fall of 2012 the chinese genomics giant bgi shenzhen purchased the silicon valley based dna sequencing firm complete genomics for a whopping 117 million which was described as a fire sale price given the amount that had been invested in developing the company s technology still he and his early investors had nowhere near that kind of cash but they had a unique advantage the us based sequencing firm helicos biosciences had just gone bankrupt and direct genomics was able to license its technology for a bargain from caltech helicos was founded by stephen quake when he was a professor at caltech in 2004 before quake moved to stanford and later supervised he s postdoctoral research helicos went out of business for good reason according to bio itworld com he company sold only around a dozen sequencers in the brief period from 2008 to 2010 when its heliscope instruments were on the market its machines were cumbersome and difficult to mass produce the process they used was costly and the results achieved were not accurate enough for research purposes the early years of direct genomics were difficult the startup had trouble paying its small staff and nearly collapsed the setbacks did not stop he from dreaming big or from seeking publicity for himself and his work during the bird flu outbreak in the spring of 2013 the journalist mara hvistendahl then china correspondent for science magazine received urgent email from a young associate professor at sustech he jiankui told hvistendahl that his team had been working day and night to sequence the bird flu virus h7n9 and wanted to have their manuscript published in science or other journals as soon as possible at first hvistendahl thought he had mistaken her as a journal editor a few days later south china morning post scmp ran an article reporting on he s claims of a rapidly mutating flu virus he was the only person cited in the scmp piece and the study he was so eager for the world to see was never published in a peer reviewed journal the public record shows only two versions of a draft uploaded to arxiv a preprint repository rarely used by biologists the two drafts uploaded two days apart included conflicting claims about the number of mutations in the virus the first version pointed to a supplemental fig 18 on the number of mutations but such a figure was nowhere to be found in the draft the second version did not refer to a corresponding figure for its claim of mutations it s unclear how scmp picked up the study direct genomics finally had a breakthrough in 2015 with the announcement of genocare described as the world s first single molecule genome sequencer that is engineered exclusively for the clinic by focusing on clinical use instead of scientific research genocare seeks to bypass some of helicos s difficulties in whole genome sequencing since it only needs to target a narrow subset of genome for medical diagnosis the repackaging of genocare to be a fraction of the size of helicos machines was an engineering feat but at the heart it still deploys helicos technology and suffers from the same problems bio itworld com said for one genocare and helicos machines could only read genomes in small fragments of about 30 base pairs stitching the pieces together to get a bigger picture of a genome is computationally intensive and can obscure important information technical challenges aside he s genocare platform does promise to perform genome sequencing faster and cheaper lowering the price by an order of magnitude to the hundred dollar range an attractive feature for the clinical market more important direct genomics has the unique advantage none of its us or european competitors could dream of support from the chinese government the re engineered helicos machine is completely indigenous ip and the most accurate in the world according to the chinese ministry of science and technology in the fall of 2017 china central television ran a lengthy segment on he and his company as part of a special feature to welcome the 19th party congress the most recent gathering of the highest leadership of the chinese communist party held once every five years reemphasized party control and enshrined xi jinping thought into the party charter making xi the most powerful chinese leader since mao in the elaborately produced video a triumphant he declared to the camera yes it s me he jiankui i did it with publicity came funding direct genomics completed another round of fundraising in the spring of 2018 collecting over 30 million in investment the boy from xinhua village now controls at least five different companies the best known is direct genomics the largest by registered capital is called shenzhen sustech biotech company founded in 2016 he jiankui is its largest shareholder at 45 5 percent the city of shenzhen owns 30 percent and sustech claims the rest two little girls the scientist he jiankui from shenzhen china announced that a pair of gene edited babies named lulu and nana were born in china this november both healthy so began an article from the people s daily online the chinese government s official mouthpiece the article went on to state the significance of the news these are the world s first genome edited babies who are immune to hiv this also means china has achieved a historic breakthrough in applying gene editing to the prevention of disease the laudatory piece was posted on the morning of november 26 beijing time hours earlier mit technology review had broken the news followed by a report from ap with more details about the birth of the girls the revelation was instantly met with fierce criticism from scientists ethicists and the general public worldwide by the time the people s daily article appeared the historic breakthrough was already a global scandal and the article was quickly deleted invented in the early 2010s crispr cas9 technology commonly referred to merely as crispr an acronym for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats is a powerful tool adapted from bacterial defense systems to slice and modify genomes the revolutionary technology quickly became popular for its precision low cost and simplicity of use he jiankui immediately set his sight on human genome editing when he branched into the field certain defects in the human genome lead to serious health challenges on the other hand some segments in a healthy human genome are connected with gateways for pathogens to enter the body the ccr5 gene encodes that is directs the body to produce a protein on the surface of t cells key pieces in the human immune system that protein can be used as a gateway for the human immunodeficiency virus hiv to enter a cell a natural mutation in the ccr5 gene ccr5 delta32 closes off the door to certain types of hiv but the mutation does not convey complete immunity and it weakens the immune system against other viruses including west nile virus and the flu the ccr5 delta32 mutation occurs in about 10 percent of northern europeans but rarely in asians regardless he claimed that he edited the normal ccr5 genes in lulu and nana during in vitro fertilization in the name of hiv prevention at the second international summit on human genome editing in hong kong where he presented results the day after his youtube announcement about lulu and nana the young scientist stated that i personally experience with sic some people in aids where 30 percent of a village people are infected an apparent reference to the aids villages in henan in the 1990s the tragedy of 20 years ago however was not caused by genetic defects in the population it was the result of the distribution of tainted blood a poor medical practice driven by greed and allowed by a corrupt government that cared more about its image than the health of its citizens at the gene editing summit and in his videos he has repeatedly talked about the stigma around hiv in chinese society as justification for his work despite its own culpability in the spread of the virus the chinese government has repeatedly used the public s fear of the incurable disease to promote its agenda in the 1980s and 90s aids was painted as a product of the west resulting from the decadent lifestyles in capitalist societies in recent years hiv is connected with homosexuality and promiscuous behavior in state propaganda as the chinese government desperately tries to make the people marry early and have more children to mitigate the severe demographic crisis resulting from decades of misguided one child policy based on data he presented at the gene editing summit his procedure changed the genes in lulu and nana but did not create the ccr5 delta32 mutation in either child it s unclear if the babies will be immune to hiv and the consequences of the mutations he introduced are unknown said sean ryder professor of biochemistry and molecular pharmacology at the university of massachusetts medical school ryder described he s experiment as misguided both scientifically and ethically it is my fervent hope that lulu and nana will lead long healthy lives ryder wrote in an email to me the best outcome is that the babies are unaffected by the procedures of the he lab worse outcomes are possible i feel proud he said at the gene editing summit claiming that his work had given the father of lulu and nana who never thought he could be a father because of his hiv infection new hope and purpose in life in chinese culture sons are expected to carry on the family line without mentioning existing safe and effective means for hiv positive men to have hiv free children he used the social pressure and individual desire of fatherhood as further justification for his work in his youtube videos he frequently notes that he is a father of two girls as if having offspring is by itself proof of morality if this was going to be your baby would you have gone ahead with this he was asked after his presentation at the gene editing summit if it was my baby with the same situation yes i would try first who knew china central television ran a lengthy report on he jiankui in response to the news of the gene edited babies in stark contrast with the broadcast that heaped praise on direct genomics a year earlier in this case serious faced anchors asked in a scolding tone generally reserved for major criminals shouldn t he jiankui recognize the serious consequences of his actions many former supporters appear to be disassociating themselves from the once rising star sustech updated he s homepage after the shocker on november 26 adding nonpaid leave next to the associate professor s name the university locked up he s office and released a statement claiming everything related to the experiment was conducted off campus and without the university s knowledge still according to sustech he s leave started before the scandal involving the gene edited babies in february 2018 and extends for three years in an interview published in march long before the scandal became public he said the university granted him a two year unpaid leave to focus on his business endeavors during which he would be relieved of teaching and administrative duties but could keep conducting research at his lab and recruiting new students it appears that he has recruited at least one new member of his lab the embryologist qin jinzhou is a research fellow at the luohu district people s hospital in shenzhen he reportedly became a full time visiting scientist at he s lab starting in january 2018 qin received his phd from the college of animal science and technology at china s northwest agriculture and forestry university through a joint program with the university of arizona where he specialized in animal reproduction he s lab uploaded a total of five videos on its gene editing experiment the only video providing technical details featured qin instead of talking about genome editing qin described at length why he chose to go gloveless when working he had a better sense of touch without the extra layer of fabric and the warmth from his palms could keep the embryos at a more desirable temperature according to gaetan burgio group leader in genetics of host pathogens interactions and genome editing at australian national university gloves are a basic necessity to avoid contaminating the genome under study and to protect the scientist from potential pathogens like hiv in the test materials qin was listed as the applicant on the experiment s entry in the chinese clinical trial registry the application was created on november 8 2018 as a retrospective registration it was updated on november 30 four days after the announcement of the genetically altered babies the update said the application had been rejected due to inability to provide original data for verification in chinese he jiankui is listed on the registration as the study leader and the source of funding is shenzhen science and technology innovation free exploration project at the gene editing summit he said that he used some of his research funding in early stages of the experiment and covered the rest with his personal finances many university institutional review boards in the united states would consider such use of a researcher s personal funds a serious conflict of interest the registration lists shenzhen harmonicare women and children s hospital as the location of the experiment complete with an ethics committee approval form from march 2017 that form bears seven signatures the hospital has denied knowledge of and involvement in the experiment and claims the signatures were forged shenzhen harmonicare as it turns out belongs to the widely criticized putian clique of private hospitals in recent years many putian hospitals have been whitewashing and upgrading their images by hiring professional staff and purchasing modern equipment in addition to their traditional focus on sexually transmitted diseases and infertility these newer establishments have branched into plastic surgery and advanced medicine allegedly powered by cutting edge technology but serious incidents have battered these attempted image makeovers including the high profile death of a college student in 2016 after he received a discredited form of immunotherapy at a putian hospital in beijing shenzhen harmonicare and he are hardly strangers in 2015 the hospital s parent company the harmonicare group established a strategic collaboration agreement with he s direct genomics to establish and implement advanced genome testing in addition to the ties between harmonicare and he are those related to lin zhitong a former director at he s direct genomics lin is an administrator at shenzhen harmonicare and chief executive of the medical division for amer international group a privately owned conglomerate headquartered in shenzhen amer group donated 15 million to sustech in 2014 the largest donation in the university s short history the sustech amer fund was set up to support the commercialization of technology from sustech researchers direct genomics of which he is the founder and chairman released a statement late in november saying it has never developed or participated in genome editing and everything at the company from production to management is normal at the moment a representative from the company told reporters that its employees only learned about the gene edited babies from the news according to a business plan allegedly from direct genomics in a now deleted report by china business journal the company operates a research institute that focuses on four areas three of which concern gene sequencing and the fourth gene editing its sequencing equipment has yet to receive licensing for medical use but the company is optimistic in its pitch to investors projecting 400 million in sales by 2021 from sustech to chinese authorities from the hospital to he s own companies many parties connected in some way with he have claimed he kept them in the dark about his human experiment on the other hand he clearly has discussed his ideas and presented some work in progress with a number of colleagues in the united states over the past few years some of whom tried to dissuade him on ethical grounds who knew exactly what when remains a mystery that he was able to forge ahead even though american colleagues knew or strongly suspected what he was doing however means that he s human genetic editing experiment is not just an individual mistake it also represents a systemic failure it is unclear how much the parents of lulu and nana or the total of seven couples who allegedly took part in the experiment understood about what they had signed up for as reported by lifeweek magazine in china in march of 2017 he approached the largest aids assistance nonprofit group in china for help recruiting couples in which the man is hiv positive and the woman is not according to lifeweek the advertisement claimed to provide free sperm washing to remove hiv from it and an in vitro fertilization ivf procedure to ensure that only washed sperm could fertilize an egg tens of millions of people in china suffer from infertility but fertility clinics remain rare and the ivf process is prohibitively expensive for most chinese families sperm washing could add another 20 000 to the 16 000 bill for a regular ivf procedure the tantalizing promise of getting both procedures for free soon attracted more than 200 couples according to lifeweek the couples were only told that gene editing would be used somehow in the process after they signed up and passed the initial selection he jiankui released the informed consent forms for the participants in his experiment provided only in english on his lab s website as the process went one of his researchers first spoke with the couples about the details on the forms and then he himself talked with each couple for an hour and 10 minutes he said at the gene editing summit while it is not unusual for a researcher to personally handle the process of gaining consent from study subjects he s many companies and business deals related to genomic research and experimentation and his own financing of the lulu and nana experiment raise potentially serious conflict of interest questions since his last public appearance at the gene editing summit in hong kong he had reportedly been missing according to multiple news outlets even sparking rumors of house arrest his silence was briefly broken when the troubled scientist responded to an email from the harvard crimson i will publish my paper and this question will be answered in my paper he wrote when asked by the student newspaper to respond to critiques of his work stat a news website focused on biotech and life sciences reported on december 10 that another paper of he s on human genome editing was recently rejected over concerns about both its ethics and its scientific validity the rejected paper titled targeted pcsk9 genome editing in embryos by crispr cas9 system focused on a different gene from ccr5 for editing according to its first page as revealed by stat it has an author list of 15 individuals with 11 different institute affiliations among the authors on the rejected paper was michael deem he s doctoral advisor at rice deem owns shares in and is on the scientific advisory board of two of he s companies in ap s initial story on november 26 deem was quoted as saying he met the parents and was there for the informed consent of the parents rice university has opened a full investigation into deem s actions on december 13 deem s lawyers released a statement michael does not do human research and he did not do human research on this project the houston chronicle reported after such knowledge i want to remind everyone that we should do this slow and with caution because a single case of failure may kill the entire field a scientist said concluding his talk on human genome editing at cold spring harbor laboratory in new york the projector behind him showed a photo of jesse gelsinger the first casualty of gene therapy who had died in a us experiment in 1999 but this presentation came in summer of 2017 the speaker was he jiankui who had started recruiting hiv positive couples for his gene editing experiment months earlier i spoke with several of he s former classmates and teachers at ustc while reporting this story as well as many scientists in and out of china the response to he s actions was all but uniform shock and criticism predominated some expressed concerns that one individual s reckless behavior would cast all chinese scientists in a negative light a few worried that biology departments in the united states might hesitate to admit chinese students in the future is china the wild east of bioethics with its first ethics committee established by the ministry of health in 1998 the history of modern bioethics in china is short and its record is tainted with fraud corruption and mad scientists this has little to do with chinese tradition itself and the racialized lens through which ethics in china sometimes has been presented is a dangerous and misleading one daoism explicitly discourages human interference in the natural order one who would control it would ruin it one who would grasp it would lose it said laozi in daode jing the fundamental text of daoism while confucianism is more accepting of medical interventions it should not be done for reasons of vanity or productivity and it certainly should not be done for profit sam crane chair of asian studies at williams college and a specialist on ancient chinese philosophy explained to me in an interview a conventional confucian approach would in fact be far stricter than a modern european one in its treatment of the human body which the confucian tradition sees as part of an unbroken and sacred lineage confucius taught his disciples that one s body hair and skin are bestowed from the parents so one dares not harm them and that is the foundation of filial piety genome editing would be positively blasphemous he s experiment was not inspired by traditional chinese culture but rather facilitated by contemporary chinese politics while some reports are calling he jiankui china s frankenstein his motivation seems to have been not so much obsession with nature s wonders but with the pursuit of fame and fortune it is fair and necessary to criticize he s actions it would be a great missed opportunity however if all responsibility was placed on and all punishment directed at an individual without serious reflection on the systemic weaknesses and institutional failures that created and enabled him he s scientific career and personal wealth were not built just on solid work but also on the publicity he sought often with assistance from state propaganda organs and the manipulation of less reputable media for his human gene editing experiment he produced elaborate video announcements their release timed to coincide with the gene editing summit in hong kong and the publication of an ethics paper co written with his in house pr strategist some rules from which he did not follow before he s house of cards came tumbling down one could catch glimpses of a carefully orchestrated pr campaign that included those claims in the chinese state press about a historic breakthrough the chinese government sees science and technology as tools of national greatness and advancements in them as matters of national pride the country s lack of nobel laureates has created a national obsession with the swedish award noting this sore point in the chinese psyche he concluded the ethics approval application for his gene editing experiment with this note will surpass the invention of in vitro fertilization which was awarded the nobel prize in 2010 the number of nobel medals is a poor metric by which to measure a country s scientific prowess but china s cumbersome bureaucracy and authoritarian politics combined with its recent history of dire poverty and brutal persecution of scientists have severely weakened its education and research sectors hampering their progress in an effort to catch up as quickly as possible the chinese government has used its economic might to aggressively pursue personnel and technology from overseas often at a cost of reforming its own system and nurturing domestic talent the overemphasis on speed and over reliance on overseas returnees to fulfill china s techno nationalistic ambitions have created what seems to me a toxic culture ripe with scandal and fraud china has been eager for example to develop its domestic semiconductor industry and no longer be dependent on us technology sensing a lucrative opportunity a group of researchers in shanghai led by another us trained chinese scientist purchased microchips from us companies scratched off their logos and claimed the designs as their own the scam went on for years earning lush funding and state honors before it was finally exposed a diploma or academic title from the united states carries a certain aura in chinese academic and business circles often shielding the person s work from proper scrutiny he jiankui notes on his sustech business card his phd from rice and postdoctoral experience at stanford it s too early to tell if he is indeed the amoral mastermind who deceived everybody even if others connected to him were all in the dark as they have claimed he s gene editing experiment would constitute a serious case of regulatory failure in the world s most powerful surveillance state when every chinese person is under intense monitoring for the slightest hint of political disobedience what the chinese government chooses to look away from speaks volumes about its own priorities and ethics there is a communist party branch at every school and every hospital but an ethics committee is optional at such institutions and the committees that do exist are often reduced to rubber stamps sometimes rules and regulations exist on paper such as a 2003 guideline from the ministry of health that forbids gene editing of the human germline for reproductive purposes but it is unclear how they should be enforced from the tragedy of the aids villages to the rise of the putian hospitals the medical industry in china is filled with scandals and the needy and vulnerable often are the least protected and the most exploited for decades the chinese government has conducted massive social engineering campaigns to control and improve its population in its three and a half decade run the one child policy was carried out with hundreds of millions of forced abortions and forced sterilizations now the government is encouraging the right kind of urban well educated women to marry early and have more children while furthering birth restrictions on some ethnic minorities and couples with major illnesses these policies and their brutal enforcement have distorted public conception of personal autonomy and reproductive rights hollowing out the foundation for bioethics in china in recent years biotechnology has also become a powerful tool in the chinese surveillance state the chinese government has turned its northwestern region of xinjiang into a 21st century police state in addition to image and voice based surveillance the government has carried out mass collection of biometric data under the guise of mandatory health checkups when big brother has essentially free access to data collected by big tech consumer privacy becomes another major concern from huawei to tencent the crown jewels in the shenzhen tech industry are also important tools the chinese government uses to monitor its citizens and extend influence overseas how might genome data processed by he s companies or other biotech firms in china be used by third parties including the chinese government this is an essential question that must be included in the discussion on the future of genetics in china or elsewhere when a scientist goes rogue as apparently is the case with he jiankui and his gene editing experiment or when a government fails its people as with the chinese government s attempted cover up of the aids villages the public s trust in institutions and expertise is weakened he s experiment has particular significance because of the technology used and its implications for all of humanity his reckless actions exposed not only loopholes in the chinese regulatory system but also limitations in the global scientific community s ability to self regulate in the aftermath of he s shocking experiment the world health organization announced that it is creating a working group to study and develop agreed norms and standards for the governance of human gene editing biothreats recognize no human borders transparency and universal rules are required to establish a global bioethics framework in which every actor is at the table and held to the same standards i grew up in a small farming family i will never forget my roots he jiankui said in one of his youtube videos according to he s father his busy son has had little time to visit his hometown but has supported his family financially providing generous monthly allowances to his parents more than a 150 000 to his older brother for a new house and car and an offer to build another new residence for his parents a large one like a mansion in ancient china he s hometown of hunan and my hometown of hubei both belonged to the kingdom of chu the chu people worshipped the sun and a mystical bird called feng huang the chinese phoenix in modern chinese vernacular the phrase feng huang nan or phoenix man is used to describe someone who rose from humble beginnings to wealth and power from the village of xinhua to

washington the partial shutdown of the us government has begun to make it harder to assess the health of the economy by delaying or distorting key reports on growth spending and hiring government data on home construction and retail sales for example won t be released next week because staffers who compile those reports have been furloughed the retail sales report provides a snapshot of consumer spending which fuels more than two thirds of the economy with macy s and kohl s having said thursday that their holiday sales were weaker than expected a broader gauge of retail spending would have provided important clarity in addition the next report on the economy s overall growth set for jan 30 won t be released if the shutdown remains in effect even if the government has fully reopened by then federal workers won t likely have had enough time to produce the scheduled report on the nation s gross domestic product not all agencies are closed congress approved funding last year for the labour department so the government s next monthly jobs report will be released as scheduled on feb 1 but it s unclear how long the department will be able to issue jobs reports the most closely watched barometer of the economy after that though the economy remains healthy in most respects there are rising concerns that growth could slow or even stall in coming months the trade war between the united states and china which has helped depress global growth is likely slowing business investment the stimulus from the trump administration s tax cuts is expected to fade and borrowing costs have risen since the federal reserve raised short term interest rates four times last year before rebounding this week stock markets had plummeted roughly 16 per cent from their peak oct 2 many economists increasingly see the shutdown should it persist as a drag on the economy michael feroli of j p morgan has downgraded his forecast for growth in the first three months of 2019 because of the shutdown he now expects the economy to grow at a 2pc annual rate down from his previous estimate of 2 25pc the shutdown is costing the economy about 1 2 billion a week according to standard poor s some of that loss will be regained after federal workers eventually receive back pay for the time they missed but many government contractors won t be made whole and lost business such as scheduled hotel stays from trips to national parks that won t be taken may not be made up fed officials are now stressing their flexibility on rate hikes emphasising that they will be patient and their policy data dependent by this the fed means that the government s latest readings on hiring inflation and growth will factor heavily in its rate decisions yet much of that data will now be unavailable to the fed or anyone else for us one of the biggest effects of the shutdown has been around data raphael bostic president of the fed s atlanta regional bank said wednesday we re worrying about that even some reports that are released on schedule are likely to be distorted by the shutdown for example the january jobs report may show an artificially high unemployment rate and low employment figure that s because up to 380 000 federal employees who aren t working or being paid during the shutdown but who will return to work afterward could be counted as unemployed for january if so that would raise the unemployment rate by 0 2 percentage point estimated ben herzon an economist at macroeconomic advisers a forecasting firm and the monthly job count could decline by 380 000 if the shutdown continues through the end of january herzon said that could push the monthly job figure into negative territory if all the federal workers eventually receive back pay as occurred after previous shutdowns then the january jobs report would later be revised to restore those 380 000 jobs according to the labour department s bureau of labour statistics future jobs reports could be jeopardised too if the government remains shut down the census bureau conducts the monthly surveys that the bls uses to calculate the unemployment rate census is part of the commerce department which remains closed during the shutdown the bls wouldn t say whether data collection will continue beyond january if the shutdown continues a business journalists organisation on friday urged all parties to end the shutdown saying it is deeply troubled by delays in release of the economic reports timely access to data about the united states economy is critical to decision making by our nation s businesses and consumers the society for advancing business editing and writing said in a statement the continued partial shutdown is disrupting the vital flow of information some economic reports have already been missed they include a monthly report on factory orders that was scheduled for monday that report typically provides insights into how much us companies are spending on large equipment inflation data will also be affected the consumer price index was released friday morning as scheduled because it was prepared by the labour depart ment but the fed s preferred inflation gauge is published by commerce s bureau of economic analysis which is closed published in dawn january 13th 2019
there will be no shortage of potential catalysts to move markets in the short term into its next phase opportunity for both upside and downside exists though given the one way run experienced on wall street perhaps it should be judged that the risk is skewed slightly to the downside for now 1 global stocks global equities will be forced to prove their mettle this week price action suggests that for many equity indices the market is ambling at a cross road the macro economic challenges moving markets in general haven t been resolved that remained true during last week s trade which saw global stocks move higher in general the difference this week is there are more numerous and higher impact risk events that could make or break the stock market s recovery wall street s winning run came to an end on friday as indexes edged lower nevertheless the asx is set to start on a positive footing this morning with futures indicating a 15 point jump at the open 2 us market s cross roads the will of the bulls was under scrutiny in the latter part of last week the lingering question has yet to be answered are we experiencing a recovery or will this be a faded rally the s p500 couldn t manage to break the big psychological resistance level of 2600 the bulls appeared to simply stall on friday with the us market according to the s p500 closing a very narrow 0 01 per cent lower friday s trade amounted to the only negative session for the major us stock index for the week the upside momentum is apparently waning for us equities the vix is lower it must be stated so fear is diminishing in the market but perhaps confidence is still rattled somewhat by december s market rout 3 reporting season looming a decision to push the market higher or let the recent rally fade must be imminent short activity according to ig s data is gradually building in us indices there will be no room to hide shortly as traders prepare for the kick off of reporting season this week in total earnings growth is increasingly expected to slow by more than first assumed the overriding concern in markets presently is given the weaker macro economic outlook whether the growth expectations of us corporates will diminish in turn the first week of the reporting season is dominated by bank earnings fittingly enough too given its the banks that could prove the canary in the coal mine for any fundamental problems in the market and the us economy at large 4 asx200 once again the asx will likely trade in the slip stream of us stocks this week spi futures are indicating a 15 point jump at today s open according to the last traded price on that instrument like us equities the conviction of the bulls in the asx on friday demonstrated signs of diminishing the 5800 level is for the asx200 what is 2600 is for the s p500 a significant psychological barrier that is coming to represent the difference between recovery and a fading rally
president donald trump has long been keen to defend workers from the carnage of bad trade deals to that end president tramp signed on 8 march 2018 an order that imposes tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from all foreign countries while carving out an exception for canada and mexico for now while north america free trade agreement nafta negotiations are under way president tramp joined by steel and aluminum workers signed a companion proclamation one on steel and one on aluminum institution a tariff of 25 on steel and 10 on aluminum imports president trump a lso threatened the european union eu with trade barriers on automobiles and could take even more measures on intellectual property rights and technology goods it is more plausible than not that this is the beginning of a costly tit for tat whereby united states trade protection will be countered by others the eu for example warned the united states not to take such measures to this effect eu trade ministers agreed at a meeting on 27 february 2018 that they would respond with counter measures if the united states brings in import tariffs on steel and aluminum matthias machning german deputy economy minister stated that the introduction of tariffs on steel and aluminum by the united states is incompatible with the world trade organization wto rules and unjustifiable on national security grounds the bad news is that a fully fledged trade war would create serious economic damage recent estimations by ralph ossa from the university of chicago indicate that a global trade war resulting in a rise in trade barriers for all countries would slash real incomes by an average 3 4 at the global level this would correspond to a loss of almost one full year of growth efforts ralph ossa argued that president trump s such move is surprising in that it will negatively impact the united states economy although the extent of harm would be limited to the loss of jobs in the user industries of the protected sector according to ralph ossa this can be illustrated with the case of the united states steel safeguard tariffs between march 2002 and december 2003 back in 2002 mounting competitive pressures on the steel industry led president george w bush to impose safeguard tariffs ranging between 8 and 30 on ten steel product groups with a total of 272 tariff lines steel imports from nafta countries from other preferential trade agreement parties jordan and israel and from 100 developing countries were exempted moreover around 1 000 firm specific exemptions were granted by the united states trade representative at the time dr agnieszka gehringer a senior research analyst at the flossbach von storch research institute stated that as a result of trade restrictions united states imports of steel products declined by 5 between 2002 and 2003 bringing the steel industry s trade deficit down by 28 however immediately after the protection ended import growth rebounded and contributed to a rapid widening of the industry s trade deficit above the levels from pre protectionist era the protection of the steel industry produced negative spillover effects to other parts of the united states economy steel is a key input in several industries among others manufacture of basic metals manufacture of fabricated metal products manufacture of electrical equipment and manufacture of machinery and equipment not elsewhere classified taken together the steel using industries generated in 2001 far more value added than did the steel industry itself and employed 57 workers for every employee in the steel industry according to dr agnieszka gehringer nine wto members brazil china chinese taipei the eu japan korea new zealand norway and switzerland opposed the safeguard measures in the wto it was found that the safeguards violated wto rules by failing to show a causal link between increased imports and serious injury on the united states side also the united states government did not provide comprehensive and appropriate evidence of unforeseen developments of steel imports explaining their increase due to the continuation of non compliance of the united states with the wto ruling the eu was authorized to raise retaliatory tariffs on united states goods it targeted among others citrus fruits and textiles with the aim to build up internal opposition to the united states protectionism among various united states industries safeguard measures on steel were eventually terminated by the united states in december 2003 dr agnieszka gehringer further noted that there should be no doubt that unfair trading practices undermine the harmonious functioning of the global trading order but the wto s dispute resolution has exactly the aim to assist discordant trading partners in a peaceful resolution of trade tensions as a matter of fact the united states enjoys an above average success rate in disputes that have been decided at the wto since its foundation in 1995 at the same time some wto rules might be indeed outdated and could be renegotiated to better reflect the changing nature of trade today finally as ralph ossa said the lack of an investment treaty between the united states and china adds considerable fuel to the flames after all if such an investment treaty existed it would assure fair access to reciprocal markets for multinationals it is obvious that president donald trump s protectionist measures and pledges will cause a tit for tat trade conflict or at least elements thereof smaller muscle flexing with respect to single industries would probably not harm the overall economic picture however a fully fledged trade war would be detrimental to both the united states and its trading partners steve halle of birmingham university stated that the current trump administration s strategy reflects a false diagnosis of the underlying problem of chronic current account deficits registered by the united states as long as united states excess consumption is financed by savings from abroad there is no economic reason for current account deficits to improve protectionism only reallocates the deficits among sectors equally significant steve halle noted under the twin deficit scenario these trade deficit could get even worse should the recent major tax cuts significantly worsen the outlook for the united states fiscal balance with regard to protectionism and trade wars president donald trump should heed the warning of his illustrious predecessor thomas jefferson that the most successful war seldom pays for its losses
news national by staff reporter apex council chairperson cecilia alexander says the civil servants umbrella body will intensify pressure on government to hike salaries to a minimum of 1 733 for the lowest paid worker she said as long as government failed to correct price distortions where prices of goods are rising daily civil servants would continue with their demands to be paid in united states dollars the standard senior reporter veneranda langa vl last week spoke to alexander ca on developments in salary negotiations and other issues to do with civil servants conditions of service below are excerpts of the interview vl can you give us the current update of what is happening pertaining to salary negotiations for civil servants ca the meetings that were held last week with government yielded nothing and were below our expectations and demands the friday january 11 2019 meeting was declared a nullity because it yielded no results at all and the meeting was adjourned after no conclusion was reached the government team said they wanted to go back to their principals to do further consultations however what is worrying us civil servants is their offer which when you calculate it means that it will see the lowest paid civil servants getting an increment of around 28 to 41 and it is very disturbing vl but what was your justification for demanding a wage increment of 1 733 ca even that increment of 1 733 is far less than what is needed because of runaway inflation and price distortions everyone who lives in zimbabwe knows and understands what i am talking of it is difficult to live now especially for civil servants vl civil servants are said to have rejected a 160 million salary deal giving an impression that it was the attractive offer what is your comment on that assertion and how much is actually needed by civil servants right now to cushion them from the high cost of living ca if you look at that amount as a quantum it sounds as if it is a lot of money however that money is meant to cater for the whole civil service which includes the army police health sector education judiciary and others the effective date for the salary increments was supposed to be the 1st of april up to december 2019 and if you work it out it means that the lowest paid civil servants will only get a 20 to 41 increment that does not work because prices of goods services and other commodities are very high and that pay rise is not commensurate with what is happening on the ground it is not our fault that there are price distortions in the country government needs to play their part and act on prices as long as they do not act on them then we will continue with our demands because the lowest paid civil servant needs to be cushioned from the high cost of living actually the amount that we want as an increment is 3 000 because of the rising prices that are triggering inflation we even indicated that we want to be paid in united states dollars if they pay us in us we will say to them that they can continue paying us the 400 to 700 that they are paying us right now we receive cashless rtgs payments yet everything has gone up even as we speak right now there is a lot of indiscipline in pricing of goods in the market and nobody is correcting the situation we civil servants cannot subsidise government we are doing our duties as workers and they should play their part and give us our wages vl what happened to the other non monetary benefits for civil servants that have been talked about like stands vehicle loans and duty free importation of vehicles ca government did give us a rundown of other initiatives they wanted to explore as incentives for civil servants but at present we are not very much concerned about the non monetary incentives we think that the pertinent issue right now is to cushion us against this high cost of living and restoring our lost incomes we cannot be talking of housing and vehicle benefits which are long term benefits when the first thing that a person needs is to eat go to work and deliver services they tried to bring that up during the negotiations but we said we wanted to deal with the more pressing issues of salary increments which are short term we do not want to say that government has been bad throughout but that in some instances they have tried to implement some incentives through funding support from nssa vl during these national joint negotiating council meetings would you say government is negotiating in good faith ca i would not want to be judgemental on that but i would like to point out that they are not serious about the plight of civil servants they do note that everything has gone up right now and that civil servants wages must go up we cannot be expected to subsidise the system which they are just leaving uncorrected we cannot do that they need to fix the economy and prices united states dollar wages are the way to go vl what is the current state of civil servants and in your response please also take into cognisance those civil servants in rural areas ca right now most civil servants are failing to even send their children to school i do not know where the employer thinks civil servants will get money to afford goods and services whose prices have escalated workers are even failing to report to work because of high transport charges that have gone up by 300 we appreciate that they have already informed us of civil servants early pay dates but many of them are saddled with debts and are struggling even the buses that are supposed to ferry civil servants to work cannot transport them all some of these buses are broken down and are no longer plying some routes civil servants cannot afford basic things like bath soap and clothes most of them now resort to borrowing money for bus fare to work vl in their conditions of services do they get adequate equipment protective clothing or tools of trade ca those are important but i would not want to dwell much on that or try to portray a picture like everything that government is doing for civil servants is wrong right now the main issue that we are seized with is salary increments vl do you think that a nationwide strike for civil servants is the way to go ca if government fails to give us our demands we are saying that as civil servants we cannot continue to subsidise the employer and the system it is not proper as civil servants we are providing quality services and implementing government policies but we also expect that government should meet their part of the bargain and pay us respectable wages we are saying that if government fails to make a decision on that then we are going on strike
the ambition of china hawks in the trump administration is to maintain american dominance by halting china s economic rise it s strange that president xi jinping appears to be working toward the same end the risk for any economy approaching china s level of development is that it gets ensnared in the middle income trap once the low hanging fruit of urbanization and industrialization have been plucked countries tend to get stuck in second gear latin america the former soviet union and the largest middle eastern countries have never managed to close the gap with the u s europe and japan that opened up a century ago

this article is more than 5 years old associated press with an education income share agreement isa someone agrees to pay the costs of education for someone else and in return the student agrees to pay a fixed percentage of future earnings instead of a set loan amount isas are usually capped both in length of obligation and the total amount of repayment they can be risky on both sides if the student and prospective wage earner lands a highly compensated job they can end up paying much more than had they taken out a regular even private student loan but if the student doesn t land a premium job the initial funder can lose out the idea has been around for some time in various forms as forbes contributor nick morrison notes for example britain has had an income percentage loan payment program since 1998 and the u s has had a similar income based repayment scheme for a few years now different but similar ideas isas have resurfaced very recently due to some high profile press coverage of lambda school an online for profit organization teaching coding and related technology skills lambda offers isas according to the reporting in forbes students can either pay 20 000 in tuition up front or opt to pay zero in exchange for signing an i s a which obligates them to pay 17 of the salary they earn from a job that pays at least 50 000 annually for two years at places such as lambda with an implied pipeline between specific skills and speculative jobs using those skills isas may make sense there the education functions much more like outsourced job training and depending on a student s situation using an isa may be better than taking a private flat rate loan or ponying up cash still isas are available at some traditional colleges too there isas are much more problematic criticisms of isas have frequently likened them to indentured servitude wherein someone is required to pay off debt through future labor that s not wrong but it misses the threat instead or perhaps additionally isas present a real problem in higher education for two reasons first isas blindly reinforce the false linkage between a college education and a career not everyone goes to college to get a good job and salary is not the best way or the only way to measure an education or much else for that matter second isas place a self interested speculative hand on the scale of important education and career decision making and that s a major problem because isas are privately funded by investors and speculators they are designed to be profitable as a result isas are offered based on the academic choices that investors think will make them the most profit at purdue university for example one of the first colleges to offer isas they offer a handy calculator where students can estimate isa obligations and options study automation robotics engineering technology at purdue and they can get you an isa for up to 22 000 where you ll pay one of their lowest offered repayment rates 7 3 of your qualified salary for the shortest amount of time 96 months study elementary education though and you can only get 15 000 for which you ll pay a higher percentage of your income 7 45 and for a longer time 116 months it s easy to see the formula at play here the lower your expected salary the higher your expected repayment percentage will be and for longer and for less initial loaned money if that was tax policy it would rightly be described as regressive and it s not as if the high end earner is getting a deal with an isa if an engineer gets a job with an average salary of 75 000 over the 96 repayment months they d pay 43 800 for that 22 000 loan calculated based on gross earnings that s a 99 cumulative interest rate what s most troubling is that those financing isas aren t doing this to boost social or economic value or out of benevolence for what s best for the student they are profit seeking using future employment and education choices of young people to gamble that feels smarmy because it is and it s also filled with opportunities to exploit backdoor prejudices and inequities it s well proven that you re more likely to have a higher salary if you graduate from a more selective college are white and come from an affluent family criteria which correlate already and if you re a private investor looking to maximize your investment those are exactly the students you d bet on the educations you d step up to finance the isa faq at purdue already says flatly that if a student has had a collection or credit action taken against them that is paid or unpaid their application will not be approved oh and that a student s current and anticipated financial obligations at a reasonable threshold in other words isas are already harder to get for students who are under the most financial stress and anyone can guess what economic class race and academic status those students are likely to be and because the isa loan speculators make more money from high earners it s not too far of a stretch to see a future in which they simply stop offering isa agreements for some majors or at some schools rich and pre med at harvard let s make a deal that involves you paying nothing right now poor behind on your bills and studying gender studies at bethune cookman sorry that s a bad bet not interested find another way to pay for your education and what happens when those speculative investment decisions influence student educational choices since isas are stalking horses for the labor market some will say that s a good idea that we should not subsidize programs that lack high end financial rewards but academia has seldom if ever outsourced the value of learning to hiring managers instead colleges and professors and students have found value in multiple and diverse endeavors of enlightenment we ve financed and underwritten people because they are credibly studying not based on what they are studying that remains the right approach college leaders should always be suspicious of profit seekers offering gifts in the case of isas instruments that can distort academic and career decision making while offering more choice to those who are already best situated at a very high cost no less college leaders should decline outright if isas are so great schools should finance them directly so any profits accrue to future teaching and learning not investment funds and the terms should be far more reasonable and applied equally to all students in all areas of study just as federal grants and loans are now
washington gov jay inslee of washington staked the future of his environmental policy on something activists had advocated for decades a first of its kind statewide fee on carbon pollution but in one of the greenest states in the country in a historic midterm year for democrats and amid a spate of new reports warning of climate catastrophe his efforts to put a price on carbon failed badly undaunted inslee is looking to carry the lessons learned from a long career of incremental wins and heartbreaking losses on climate policy to the national stage as a possible presidential contender i learned one of the key talents is persistence he told nbc news in an interview climate change is not going away and neither are we as a generation of young activists led by new voices like rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y rise to the forefront they may want to pull up a seat next to the 67 year old governor and hear his stories more than a decade before this year s rallies for a green new deal a plan to spend big on a rapid transition to renewable energy inslee in speeches op eds and a book was calling for a moonshot federal project modeled on the apollo space program to slash emissions as a member of congress he helped advance a landmark cap and trade bill which failed in the senate and he loaded president barack obama s stimulus with 90 billion in green initiatives which passed as governor he s led a multipronged effort to boost electric vehicles and support research into clean technology his potential entry into the wide open 2020 democratic primary contest with a climate focused campaign comes amid an intense debate over how to marry environmental sustainability with political sustainability a question he s grappled with like few others he believes the fate of the world depends on getting the answer right that s what s at stake here inslee said a fundamental continuation of life and civilization as we ve become accustomed to the fight for a carbon fee over a period of several years inslee and activists tried repeatedly to enact a fee on carbon emissions via legislation and ballot initiatives an idea long backed by economists as a way to nudge consumers toward clean energy in interviews participants in the efforts described a series of well intentioned plans brought down by opposition from industry groups that spent tens of millions of dollars infighting among activists and skepticism among voters the initial attempt began outside the inslee administration in 2016 when a group called carbon wa led a campaign for a ballot measure initiative 732 that would have taxed carbon emissions and use the revenue to cut taxes elsewhere supporters emphasized its political appeal there is at least some support for the concept of a revenue neutral carbon tax in conservative circles since it doesn t entail an overall tax hike and carbon wa earned backing from three republican state senators but the proposal also failed to garner support on the left where activists favored using the additional revenue on investments to cut further emissions and to finance related green jobs in low income communities the national sierra club opposed 732 even as it acknowledged dissension among its members over the decision inslee opposed it too in part over concerns that the revenue projections were off with the environmental community split the measure garnered just 40 percent of the vote and lost every county outside of seattle politically both approaches are challenging said yoram bauman an economist who led the carbon wa campaign and now works on energy policy in utah referring to courting republicans with new tax cuts and uniting the left by putting the money into its priorities it s very difficult to tell a story about how the democrats take over the world but it s also difficult to tell a story about how you get enough republicans and democrats on board with some kind of centrist climate policy in 2018 inslee and his allies looked to improve on the idea with a new plan to enact a carbon fee and use it to fund a variety of clean energy projects they built a coalition of labor unions environmentalists racial justice groups faith organizations and businesses to promote it the investment side was especially important inslee said because his administration estimated about 90 percent of his proposal s carbon reductions came from its various green programs rather than changes in consumer behavior due to higher energy prices but he still saw the carbon fee as a signal to inspire businesses and consumers to move to a less carbon intensive product that could provide a foundation for future policy despite inslee s support a bill to enact his plan stalled in the narrowly democratic controlled state senate that left a direct appeal to voters as a last resort another ballot measure initiative 1631 which would create a carbon fee was born inslee backs down with a larger coalition however came a larger response from affected industries led by oil companies opponents spent a state record 31 million to defeat initiative 1631 last year about double the amount spent by supporters who had their own backup from billionaires michael bloomberg and bill gates the no campaign pointed to higher energy costs for consumers but in a move that could be a preview of future fights on the national level the opponents message focused heavily on splitting the left with accusations that 1631 exempted too many polluters and would not fund effective programs voters rejected i 1631 because they understood it was a flawed initiative that would have significant economic impacts on the state s economy while doing very little to meet carbon reduction goals in the state said catherine reheis boyd president of the western states petroleum association which helped spearhead opposition to the plan a supporter of initiative 1631 holds a sign referencing the nisqually indian tribe on oct 17 2018 during a rally supporting i 1631 a november ballot measure in washington state that would charge a fee on carbon emissions from fossil fuels ted s warren ap file the attacks were effective even as democrats made gains in the legislature with environmentalist candidates the initiative failed and improved only modestly on its 2016 predecessor with 43 percent of the vote inslee has since backed off a carbon fee for now at the state level instead focusing on a package of renewable energy investments financed by other means and he s grown skeptical as to whether democrats should pursue a similar policy nationally if it distracts from other green priorities you can get enormous benefit without perhaps a carbon pricing system he said that should not totally take it out of consideration but there s many many ways to skin this cat state sen reuven carlyle a democrat who has quarterbacked inslee s climate agenda in the legislature said he still believes lawmakers need to put a price on carbon someday but with voters unconvinced it s better to bring emissions down elsewhere carlyle said we need to go back to the drawing board and respect the will of the voters he said democrats listen up in many ways the emerging national picture on climate policy looks similar to what inslee has faced heading into the presidential campaign there s a burst of grassroots energy around the green new deal but it faces competition from similarly ambitious democratic proposals on health care education taxes and more inslee hasn t ignored those items he just proposed a new public health care option in his state but he has a message democratic voters might not hear from the party s presidential candidates if you re going to tackle climate change the rest may have to wait when you want college education for your kids when you want better health care when you want net neutrality when you want all of those things but your house is on fire and it s burning down you ve got to put the fire out first and get your family out of the house he said that s the type of prioritization we have to make if we are going to succeed in rescuing our country from this existential threat he added diver kim thomas holds a yes on 1631 sign as she dives in a large aquarium display at the seattle aquarium during an event to announce the endorsement of initiative 1631 by the aquarium and the woodland park zoo on oct 25 2018 in seattle ted s warren ap with an uncertain policy path forward national democrats are facing debates much like the ones environmentalists faced in washington state young activists in groups like the sunrise movement are focused on a massive jobs program to help transition the economy away from fossil fuels but some democrats are also pursuing a revenue neutral carbon tax with gop support before he left the senate this month jeff flake of arizona signed onto a carbon tax with sen chris coons d del having just faced a voter backlash of his own though inslee has grown wary of a national plan that leans strongly on a carbon tax to slash emissions to actually get carbon savings you need to jack up the price so high that it becomes politically untenable he said the better option in his eyes is to look to taxes on the wealthy to fund a green new deal reversing portions of the trump tax cuts could provide an easier source of financing he said but if that doesn t fly either then it s on to the next plan and the one after that if there s one message the battle scarred governor has for young voters and democratic presidential hopefuls it s not to give up when things go sour as churchill said victory is the only option because without victory there is no survival inslee said
reuters with the conclusion of the first round of negotiations yesterday in beijing the way ahead for the united states and china to avoid a full scale tariff war has become clear with fifty days remaining before the march 1 end of the truce trump and xi announced to prevent u s tariffs increasing from 10 to 25 percent on 200 billion of chinese imports negotiations are likely to continue until the deadline but before march 1 trump will declare victory in this phase of the trade war extending the truce for another six months in which a second phase of negotiations will address even more contentious issues each december the ceo and his team set objectives for the year to come like the leadership of apple or amazon they assess the headwinds including signs of slowdown in the chinese economy projections of flagging global economic growth and uncertainties about the trade war on that basis they make decisions about how they are going to deliver the growth they have promised shareholders in china s case 6 5 percent on december 18 celebrating the fortieth anniversary of china s opening to the world xi reminded his 1 4 billion fellow citizens shareholders that over those four decades their party led government has delivered economic growth of 10 percent a year but his speech also struck an odd note when he declared boldly that there is no great master who can dictate to the chinese people my response was say what the most frequent question beijing policymakers asked me is whether the current u s government can take yes for an answer in current negotiations lighthizer has the lead the chinese have studied his successful negotiation of the new nafta mere months ago they see the differences between the old nafta and the new agreement as plus or minus 10 to 15 percent chinese negotiators have dissected the white house summary of what trump and xi agreed to at the g20 meeting when announcing the truce it promised to shrink the bilateral trade deficit reduce chinese non tariff barriers provide american companies a larger share in key chinese markets and constrain theft and forced transfer of intellectual property but on the much more difficult issue of industrial policy and the role of the government in the chinese economy it was instructively silent thus before march 1 expect trump to declare a triumph in a great trade deal that will feature china s purchase of more than a trillion dollars of additional u s products in addition to purchases of additional u s gas oil and agricultural produces expect the agreement to include targets for increases in american companies share of banking insurance and equity markets since american producers account for 6 percent of china s current gas imports 3 percent of its oil imports and 14 percent of its agricultural imports and chinese companies control 98 percent of its banking market 95 percent of the equity business and 91 percent of insurance all this should not be that hard phase two of the negotiations will then struggle with the more difficult issues of protection of intellectual property and industrial policy yogi berra cautioned against making predictions especially about the future nonetheless if placing my bet today i make the odds of a great deal as more likely than not

los angeles teachers who are about to go on strike put forward a central demand for education funding during a rally downtown in december the message has been clear for months from the president of the los angeles teachers union not only does the l a unified school district have no deficit it has a huge reserve more than large enough to meet the union s demands for higher wages smaller classes and schools staffed every day with the supportive services they need that s partly true the district hasn t recently had deficits but alex caputo pearl is ignoring future projections l a schools supt austin beutner has seemed just as certain when he declares the district on the brink of insolvency advertisement that could be true but if it is why is the district able to offer any pay raises in the intense dispute between los angeles unified and united teachers los angeles hyperbole passion and spin have often trumped fairness moderation and neutrality that s been especially the case in the tense immediate run up to a teachers strike that is set to begin monday in the nation s second largest school system after the district made a new offer friday which the union quickly rejected no further negotiations were scheduled for the weekend meanwhile 31 000 union members readied to walk picket lines as the district scrambled to keep schools open with substitutes reassigned office workers and skeletal staff for the teachers this strike is about more than money they are concerned about the direction of education and their place in it but money remains central what can the district afford to do and within those parameters what are district leaders willing to do it hasn t helped that the dispute has gotten personal with the union attacking beutner s motives and beutner taking actions that have angered union leaders each side has made questionable assertions and offered misleading interpretations of what the other side has said deficit or surplus the union says the district can afford to pay for much more it points to last year s ending reserve of nearly 2 billion the largest in district history the school system points to projections that show potential insolvency in three years advertisement both sides have data to back them up the union is correct in that for the better part of a decade school district officials have talked of an approaching fiscal cliff about three years out that has never been reached in fact the district s ending balance has increased over the last several years that would not be possible if the district was spending more than it was taking in but the district is not lying about sobering projections whether or not they come to pass potential future problems come from several sources one is sharply increasing required payments into the california state teachers retirement system which pays for the pensions of retired teachers across the state these accelerated payments to keep the fund solvent are causing a financial strain on all school systems without some form of relief school systems soon will be paying into this fund about 1 of every 4 dollars they receive gov gavin newsom s budget may provide short term relief because it takes some burden off school systems on pension payments l a unified has not yet been able to calculate how this assistance could alter the gloomy budget forecasts l a unified also faces rapidly rising costs for retiree health benefits such benefits are a rare perk and accountants recently scored them over time at a cost of about 250 000 per employee unfortunately the school system has not set aside money to pay for the benefits this problem will gradually subside on its own because the qualification rules for lifetime benefits as they are called have become extremely stringent but for the next 10 to 15 years these expenses could hobble l a unified s ability to cover some services to students and to pay its current employees competitive wages advertisement the district also has had trouble cutting spending as its financial base enrollment has shrunk this drop in students has been caused by population trends and the growth of charter schools which like restaurants can open without considering the limits of the customer base in this case students in spite of these factors the reserves left over at the end of the year have grown larger in recent times finally reaching nearly 2 billion the figure highlighted by caputo pearl analysts have cited three reasons first state tax revenue has come in higher than projected that was the case again this year score one point for the union second new money from a revised state funding formula also came in faster than anticipated the goal is to provide extra help for targeted students those from low income families those learning english and those in the foster care system l a unified has lots of these students and lastly the district has indeed been putting money aside but is that hoarding as the union calls it thrifty or tightfisted advertisement a large portion of the money in the reserve is set aside for future employee salary increases that the district has already offered or agreed to including 175 million to non teaching employees and 303 million to cover the 6 raise currently being offered to teachers if teachers get more than 6 many other employees also will qualify for more under a me too clause in their contracts the largest chunk 680 million is being held back because the district has concluded that starting this year or next it will spend much more than it takes in if that s the case this money would be used to delay but not prevent the district from going bankrupt union leaders say the district could spend this money now and don t believe the projections of future deficit spending the district s analysis however has been endorsed by outside experts as well as the los angeles county office of education which has the legal responsibility for tracking the financial health of l a county school systems the union challenges the independence of these outside analyses that challenge would have more credence if the union could offer an independent analysis that reaches different conclusions it hasn t still the record of the county education office has been imperfect in spotting problems and preventing districts from getting into financial trouble advertisement the county analysis also will probably be conservative because that s the prudent course from an accounting standpoint that means the county is unlikely to accept an optimistic prediction of future state funding until that money is in the bank it s also not going to factor in the possibility that legislators could provide more money or that state or local voters could approve pending ballot initiatives that would increase taxes to better fund schools such tax measures will be appearing on ballots in 2020 some conservatism might be called for the state has enjoyed about a decade of economic growth many economists say that in such situations a recession which would shrink state revenue for a time is almost inevitable score one for the district budgets within budgets and yet these outside financial reviews don t typically look at all the budgets within the school system s budget the district could in fact stash money in smaller accounts that are never reviewed by analysts such actions are an almost natural outgrowth of collective bargaining no employer wants to show all its cards and thus lose leverage in negotiations l a unified has absolutely hidden money in the past that it eventually applied to salary negotiations according to former district officials even within the district s publicly posted numbers there is wiggle room beneath the surface for example the district lists 284 million as discretionary funds spent by principals at school sites each line item in this category is a story of its own some of this spending would seem essential even to utla some would be of debatable importance even to l a unified whatever the case this discretionary money mostly pays for staffing and it s possible that if money is moved around some union members could lose work so that other union members could get more work or perhaps higher pay advertisement also one key desire of the union is to win teachers and parents more authority at schools if schools lose their discretionary funds such involvement could be severely undermined that being said additional money for a union settlement will probably come from this fund more available money can be found in the 303 million that is committed to students most in need as required by law this line item refers to money that the district has committed to spend on behalf of those students specially targeted for help by the state those from low income families those learning english and those in the foster care system here the district hopes to pull off a two for one it hopes to use some of this money to satisfy the union s demands while also still serving these students it could do so by hiring more teachers and lowering the size of classes in schools that serve the most needy students this approach was in use in the revised contract proposals l a unified made last week advocates for these students are worried about this strategy they fear the needs of students could become secondary to the imperatives of a contract settlement advertisement all about money beutner says the union s demands would cost 3 billion that s debatable partly because the union has not responded to the district with specifics on how much smaller it is asking for classes to be the union s position so far is to demand the elimination of a contract clause that gives the district broad authority over class sizes many teachers would gladly accept smaller raises in exchange for better working conditions and better learning environment for students but most issues come back to money everyone wants smaller class sizes teachers parents students but meaningful class size reduction is one of the most expensive reforms in education it s rarely been done anywhere except in pricey private schools that often pay teachers small salaries howard blume latimes com twitter howardblume
photo taken on jan 12 2019 shows the white house and a stop sign in washington d c the united states the u s government shutdown which affected a quarter of federal agencies stretched into the 22nd day on saturday eclipsing all the previous 20 such closures to become the longest in the country s modern history xinhua liu jie the u s government shutdown which affected a quarter of federal agencies stretched into the 22nd day on saturday eclipsing all the previous 20 such closures to become the longest in the country s modern history the shuttering stemmed from a budget standoff in which president donald trump requested 5 7 billion u s dollars for building a wall along the u s mexico border but congressional democrats rejected his demand pay day without pay this week some 800 000 government employees for the first time missed their paychecks this is really an inflection point a furloughed employee of the u s department of homeland security told xinhua earlier this week he joined hundreds of people like him at a rally north of the white house to urge an end to the shutdown people are not getting their paychecks and the hardship is really going to set in for many of the families he said on the condition of anonymity i just want to say that american federal workers are ready to work and they shouldn t be caught in the middle there have been similar protests across the united states employees of u s transportation security administration at atlanta state of georgia protested this week over having to work without being paid in the state of florida miami international airport closed one terminal for parts of the weekend since security screeners have called in sick twice the normal rate u s air controllers found a jarring 0 00 at the net pay section in the wage information earlier this week the national air traffic controllers association sued the trump administration friday saying the government unlawfully deprived thousands of its members of pay without due process more and more government services are affected christopher galdieri assistant professor at saint anselm college said the longer the shutdown goes on the more uncharted territory we get into stalemate over border wall since the shutdown starting dec 22 the white house and the congressional democratic leadership have held several rounds of negotiations over border security and wall funding but all ended in failure in a tweet saturday trump again declared there is a massive humanitarian crisis at the u s mexico border he has insisted that a wall or a steel barrier is essential to border security and keeping out criminals gangs human traffickers and drugs without it our country cannot be safe he tweeted earlier this week the democrats led by house speaker nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer view trump s border wall as expensive ineffective and immoral and call the proposal a political theater they prefer the use of technology like drones and sensors in strengthening border security with democrats showing no signs of bending trump has repeatedly floated the idea of declaring a national emergency a legally mandated executive power of a u s president such a declaration would enable trump to bypass congressional approval and build the wall with pentagon s allocated money galdieri said an emergency declaration would be the bizarre path out of the ongoing stalemate and it would set up a lengthy court fight with no guarantee of winning i don t even know if the president wants the wall i think he just wants a debate on the wall and he s having some difficulty with it pelosi said building a border wall against mexico was trump s signature campaign promise when running for president in 2016 it is also at the core of his tough immigration policy that not only has appealed to his electoral base but also is viewed by experts as a key political leverage for his re election in 2020 that is the heart of his campaign that is why the base loves him political analyst fareed zakaria said in an appearance on cnn on friday a latest cbs news yougov poll showed only 35 percent of those polled approve of trump s handling of the government shutdown and a majority disapprove only 33 percent approve of the democrats while relatively more people are unsure growing negative consequences the shutdown is increasingly morphing into something more than a political drama as the damage on economy becomes ever more evident white house estimates that the shutdown will likely reduce quarterly u s gross domestic product by 0 1 percent every two weeks that it continues based on that the center for american progress a washington think tank predicted that the biweekly loss in economic output would be 5 billion dollars or 15 million dollars per hour the u s chamber of commerce a lobbying group for business interests published an open letter on its website saying the adverse consequences of the shutdown are wide and growing it said small businesses companies filing initial public offerings ipos manufacturers and brewers awaiting sales approvals processing of imports tariff exclusion requests mortgage approvals as well as grants contracts and payments for goods and services that have already been provided are all delayed with each passing day the situation will only get worse during the week ending friday no ipo priced on the nasdaq stock market as expected no ipos priced this past week and thanks to the government shutdown no ipos launched roadshows either nasdaq said on its website u s federal reserve chairman jerome powell said at the economic club of washington that a prolonged shutdown could harm the u s economy and make it more difficult for the fed to assess the state of the economy if we have an extended shutdown i do think that would show up in the data pretty clearly powell said if the shutdown lasts through january the u s department of commerce won t be able to release key data on economic growth consumer spending and personal income we would have a less clear picture into the economy if it were to go on much longer said powell fitch ratings has warned of a possible downgrading of the u s triple a credit rating if this shutdown continues to march 1 and the debt ceiling becomes a problem several months later we may need to start thinking about the policy framework the inability to pass a budget and whether all of that is consistent with triple a james mccormack fitch s global head of sovereign ratings told an event in london on wednesday
by benjy sarlin with nbc news politics washington gov jay inslee who is weighing a 2020 run is rethinking the carbon tax approach to saving the planet he believes his party should too advertisement washington gov jay inslee of washington staked the future of his environmental policy on something activists had advocated for decades a first of its kind statewide fee on carbon pollution but in one of the greenest states in the country in a historic midterm year for democrats and amid a spate of new reports warning of climate catastrophe his efforts to put a price on carbon failed badly undaunted inslee is looking to carry the lessons learned from a long career of incremental wins and heartbreaking losses on climate policy to the national stage as a possible presidential contender i learned one of the key talents is persistence he told nbc news in an interview climate change is not going away and neither are we as a generation of young activists led by new voices like rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y rise to the forefront they may want to pull up a seat next to the 67 year old governor and hear his stories more than a decade before this year s rallies for a green new deal a plan to spend big on a rapid transition to renewable energy inslee in speeches op eds and a book was calling for a moonshot federal project modeled on the apollo space program to slash emissions as a member of congress he helped advance a landmark cap and trade bill which failed in the senate and he loaded president barack obama s stimulus with 90 billion in green initiatives which passed as governor he s led a multipronged effort to boost electric vehicles and support research into clean technology his potential entry into the wide open 2020 democratic primary contest with a climate focused campaign comes amid an intense debate over how to marry environmental sustainability with political sustainability a question he s grappled with like few others he believes the fate of the world depends on getting the answer right that s what s at stake here inslee said a fundamental continuation of life and civilization as we ve become accustomed to the fight for a carbon fee over a period of several years inslee and activists tried repeatedly to enact a fee on carbon emissions via legislation and ballot initiatives an idea long backed by economists as a way to nudge consumers toward clean energy in interviews participants in the efforts described a series of well intentioned plans brought down by opposition from industry groups that spent tens of millions of dollars infighting among activists and skepticism among voters the initial attempt began outside the inslee administration in 2016 when a group called carbon wa led a campaign for a ballot measure initiative 732 that would have taxed carbon emissions and use the revenue to cut taxes elsewhere supporters emphasized its political appeal there is at least some support for the concept of a revenue neutral carbon tax in conservative circles since it doesn t entail an overall tax hike and carbon wa earned backing from three republican state senators but the proposal also failed to garner support on the left where activists favored using the additional revenue on investments to cut further emissions and to finance related green jobs in low income communities the national sierra club opposed 732 even as it acknowledged dissension among its members over the decision inslee opposed it too in part over concerns that the revenue projections were off with the environmental community split the measure garnered just 40 percent of the vote and lost every county outside of seattle politically both approaches are challenging said yoram bauman an economist who led the carbon wa campaign and now works on energy policy in utah referring to courting republicans with new tax cuts and uniting the left by putting the money into its priorities it s very difficult to tell a story about how the democrats take over the world but it s also difficult to tell a story about how you get enough republicans and democrats on board with some kind of centrist climate policy in 2018 inslee and his allies looked to improve on the idea with a new plan to enact a carbon fee and use it to fund a variety of clean energy projects they built a coalition of labor unions environmentalists racial justice groups faith organizations and businesses to promote it the investment side was especially important inslee said because his administration estimated about 90 percent of his proposal s carbon reductions came from its various green programs rather than changes in consumer behavior due to higher energy prices but he still saw the carbon fee as a signal to inspire businesses and consumers to move to a less carbon intensive product that could provide a foundation for future policy advertisement despite inslee s support a bill to enact his plan stalled in the narrowly democratic controlled state senate that left a direct appeal to voters as a last resort another ballot measure initiative 1631 which would create a carbon fee was born inslee backs down with a larger coalition however came a larger response from affected industries led by oil companies opponents spent a state record 31 million to defeat initiative 1631 last year about double the amount spent by supporters who had their own backup from billionaires michael bloomberg and bill gates the no campaign pointed to higher energy costs for consumers but in a move that could be a preview of future fights on the national level the opponents message focused heavily on splitting the left with accusations that 1631 exempted too many polluters and would not fund effective programs voters rejected i 1631 because they understood it was a flawed initiative that would have significant economic impacts on the state s economy while doing very little to meet carbon reduction goals in the state said catherine reheis boyd president of the western states petroleum association which helped spearhead opposition to the plan a supporter of initiative 1631 holds a sign referencing the nisqually indian tribe on oct 17 2018 during a rally supporting i 1631 a november ballot measure in washington state that would charge a fee on carbon emissions from fossil fuels ted s warren the attacks were effective even as democrats made gains in the legislature with environmentalist candidates the initiative failed and improved only modestly on its 2016 predecessor with 43 percent of the vote advertisement inslee has since backed off a carbon fee for now at the state level instead focusing on a package of renewable energy investments financed by other means and he s grown skeptical as to whether democrats should pursue a similar policy nationally if it distracts from other green priorities you can get enormous benefit without perhaps a carbon pricing system he said that should not totally take it out of consideration but there s many many ways to skin this cat state sen reuven carlyle a democrat who has quarterbacked inslee s climate agenda in the legislature said he still believes lawmakers need to put a price on carbon someday but with voters unconvinced it s better to bring emissions down elsewhere carlyle said we need to go back to the drawing board and respect the will of the voters he said democrats listen up in many ways the emerging national picture on climate policy looks similar to what inslee has faced advertisement heading into the presidential campaign there s a burst of grassroots energy around the green new deal but it faces competition from similarly ambitious democratic proposals on health care education taxes and more inslee hasn t ignored those items he just proposed a new public health care option in his state but he has a message democratic voters might not hear from the party s presidential candidates if you re going to tackle climate change the rest may have to wait when you want college education for your kids when you want better health care when you want net neutrality when you want all of those things but your house is on fire and it s burning down you ve got to put the fire out first and get your family out of the house he said that s the type of prioritization we have to make if we are going to succeed in rescuing our country from this existential threat he added diver kim thomas holds a yes on 1631 sign as she dives in a large aquarium display at the seattle aquarium during an event to announce the endorsement of initiative 1631 by the aquarium and the woodland park zoo on oct 25 2018 in seattle ted s warren with an uncertain policy path forward national democrats are facing debates much like the ones environmentalists faced in washington state advertisement young activists in groups like the sunrise movement are focused on a massive jobs program to help transition the economy away from fossil fuels but some democrats are also pursuing a revenue neutral carbon tax with gop support before he left the senate this month jeff flake of arizona signed onto a carbon tax with sen chris coons d del having just faced a voter backlash of his own though inslee has grown wary of a national plan that leans strongly on a carbon tax to slash emissions to actually get carbon savings you need to jack up the price so high that it becomes politically untenable he said the better option in his eyes is to look to taxes on the wealthy to fund a green new deal reversing portions of the trump tax cuts could provide an easier source of financing he said but if that doesn t fly either then it s on to the next plan and the one after that if there s one message the battle scarred governor has for young voters and democratic presidential hopefuls it s not to give up when things go sour advertisement as churchill said victory is the only option because without victory there is no survival inslee said
tns as the government shutdown grinds into its third week more than 800 000 federal employees and 4 1 million federal contractors are caught in the crosshairs federal workers will go without paychecks beginning january 11 some of these unpaid employees are nervous about their finances particularly being able to make their monthly rent or mortgage payment on time that s not surprising considering a recent bankrate com survey found that 23 percent of americans have no emergency savings in the bank before we cover what specific lenders are doing for these federal employees here s some advice for anyone who is having trouble paying their basic bills steps to take if you re at risk of falling behind on mortgage or rent if you don t have any emergency savings or enough of a cushion to get by here are other options to consider to keep the roof over your head talk to your landlord or lender asap don t wait until you re behind on payments lenders may work with you to waive late fees set up a repayment plan or offer loan forbearance the key is to explain the situation says jeff cronrod a founder and board member of the american apartment owners association one of the nation s largest residential landlord associations in the u s representing 100 000 property owners not all landlords are rich they rely on those rent payments to cover their mortgages and property costs cronrod says they understand this situation isn t the tenants fault cut all unnecessary spending and talk to your creditors account for every dollar going out look at canceling subscription services recurring home maintenance services and vacation travel at least until the shutdown or your own cash crunch is over learn about other ways to cut back on spending and how to create a budget additionally monitor account balances and if necessary pay only the minimum on credit balances until your income is restored says mark hamrick bankrate com senior economic analyst the office of personnel management posted sample letters on its website that impacted employees can use to ask creditors for leniency on bill deadlines call and speak with creditors such as auto loan providers or utilities to see if they have flexibility on payments for temporary hardship cases hamrick says while they will not likely forgive the debt some creditors might be willing to allow a delay in payment you ll still owe the money but it might not be owed immediately and that can improve near term cash flow to pay for immediate basic needs such as rent or mortgage hamrick adds explore short term low interest direct deposit loans some institutions are offering furlough loans for clients who have their paychecks deposited directly into a checking or savings account these loans don t require credit checks and are often for a limited amount at a low interest rate contact your bank or credit union directly to inquire whether this is an option tap an open home equity line of credit or heloc if you already have a heloc and are still in the draw period you could pull out cash from your available line to make your mortgage payment the average interest rate for a heloc is 6 52 percent and 5 88 percent for a home equity loan according to bankrate com data that s much lower than the average interest rate on credit cards at 17 percent or more be cautious about using credit cards or borrowing from retirement and 401 k accounts if you ve exhausted all other options paying for your rent mortgage or other bills with a credit card can get you by if it s an accepted form of payment however you don t want to rely too heavily on credit cards because you ll pay much higher interest rates than other forms of borrowing making credit cards harder to pay off as interest piles on you may need to turn to your long term savings and investments for emergency cash however you should do so with extreme care roth ira holders may withdraw their own contributions not earnings without tax or penalty but traditional ira holders will pay income taxes and a 10 percent penalty on the taxable amount if you re under age 59 the irs reports that 401 k holders can borrow up to half of their account balance a maximum of 50 000 tax free but funds must be repaid within five years in most cases the catch is that you have to stay with your current employer for the duration if you lose your job you ll have 30 60 days to repay the loan or face penalties since these options can severely disrupt your retirement plans consider them as a last resort before pulling funds from any long term investment read the fine print

large caps ended a five day rally small caps posted sixth day pf gains oil ended nine day advance longest in nine years general motors nyse bucks soft guidance trend sectors suggest confusion the five day rally of us large cap indices the and came to a halt on friday though the small cap posted its sixth straight advance energy stocks tracked prices lower ending nine days of gains the longest winning streak for the sector in nine years the possibility of strength among automobile manufacturers after an from general motors nyse catapulted the stock higher on friday offered investors some hope after last quarter s across the board softer guidance which extended into apple s recent announcement of an in the current quarter however mounting concerns over the now longest government shutdown in history offset what investors may have considered a bottom for company outlooks no logic to friday s s p 500 sector advancers and decliners the s p 500 index slipped by 0 01 percent ahead of the weekend with sectors split between red and green however there didn t seem to be a logical delineation among the winners and losers shares led the losses 0 59 that makes sense since tumbled below 52 a barrel on friday otherwise there wasn t the classic divergence between cyclical and defensive sectors for example defensive sector was up 0 29 while fell 0 37 on the other side of the spectrum cyclical sector was up 0 25 while 0 5 was down another structural anomaly occurred between financials 0 25 and 0 19 both of which gained almost equally however financial shares tend to rise when the outlook for higher interest rate increases while real estate stocks typically fall with higher borrowing costs and relatively lower property income relative to higher fixed income yields in other words the negative correlation between the two sectors broke down on friday another market structure breakdown both cyclical 0 1 and defensive consumer staples 0 29 were up a side note it s interesting that 0 4 percent was among the bigger laggards even as the president of the united states has consistently said he will not give up on his border wall the biggest item among his campaign promises one would expect that shares of materials companies would rise in anticipation of the added business after all thus far president donald trump has shown that he s willing to go the distance for his promises including the historic tax cut the trade war and the border wall itself as he faces off democrats into the longest government shut down ever also while he seemed to take a step back from calling a national emergency about the matter he continues threatening to take advantage of his executive privilege which once again would benefit materials could it be markets aren t convinced a 5b allocation for trump s border wall is imminent on the other hand shares 0 33 may have gotten a boost from newly inaugurated california governor gavin newsom who among other democratic lawmakers at the state and city level have proposed increased spending on healthcare among other items of course given that california is the country s most populous state this may have helped boost the sector all sectors green on weekly basis for the week the spx advanced 2 54 percent a third straight week of gains bringing the total upside to 7 43 for the first time since august all sectors were in the green however there s something to be learned about investor sentiment from how much they were willing to risk on various sectors real estate 4 outperformed as one would expect after the outlook for a of interest rate hikes became apparent financials 1 accordingly made a much small advance cyclical sectors 4 17 consumer discretionary 3 72 performed better defensive sectors consumer staples 0 72 and utilities 0 87 underperformed why then did consumer discretionary 3 72 a sector that includes luxury purveyors end up among the top performers as well materials 1 93 were among the worst performers is this yet another signal investors may ultimately believe trump will cave on this signature campaign promise the dow was down 0 02 on friday but gained 2 4 on the week for a third straight week of increases totaling 6 91 since the december bottom the nasdaq composite s five day rally also ended with the tech heavy index falling 0 21 on the final day of trade it gained 3 45 for the third consecutive week with a combined total of 10 08 across that timeframe the russell 2000 0 13 is the only major us index that continued its advance on friday for a sixth day it gained 4 83 for the week and 12 02 for the three week rally since the december bottom the russell is also facing the resistance of a completed h s top but the big mystery is why the small cap index has been outperforming the other major us indices on a myriad of time frames it should have been hit hard by the enduring us sino trade talks is it a vote of no confidence by investors regarding the outcome of talks or are they not nearly as concerned about tariffs as the media and economists keep saying the truth is we don t actually know as for the s p 500 s friday performance is the sector disorientation temporary could it be a symptom of increased not necessarily indicating anything other than haphazard profit taking or is it a classic case of lack of leadership as what could be the last rally within the bull market ebbs after the s p 500 reached the 200 week ma above the long term uptrend line since the 2009 bottom we forecast another a return move toward the neckline of the massive h s top that spans all of last year this coming week might be the test will the 2 700 level hold as a resistance if so we can expect another selloff breaking the 20 percent bear market threshold taking on the 200 week ma and the long term uptrend line however if the government shutdown and the trade dispute are resolved along with the more dovish fed we might see a h s failure this could act as a catapult as market dynamics reverse taking on the september record peak our money is on the preponderance of technical evidence that the market will turn lower oil completed a nine day rally despite the us dropping last week as well as the longest stretch of us sino talks since the trade war began perhaps the ongoing us government shutdown began to wear on traders or perhaps they simply considered it a good time to take profits subsequent to all the headlines which focused on it being the longest rally for the commodity in almost a decade technically we can see that the price found increasing demand as it reached dual support the june 2017 trough and an uptrend line in place since august 2016 and the supply increase which pushed it below the 200 week ma a close above the 200 week ma would bolster confidence that the rebound could turn into a sustainable rally while a fall below the 42 support since june 2017 will likely mean continued selloffs the week ahead monday 2 00 china tentative and december seems to worsen as imports are expected to rise to 5 5 from 3 yoy while exports are seen to fall to 3 from 5 yoy 9 00 us tentative perhaps investors will get some clarity after powell s
