cogwriter jim rickards reported the following dollar dominance under multiple converging threats for years currency analysts have looked for signs of an international monetary reset that would diminish the dollar s role as the leading reserve currency and replace it with a substitute agreed upon at some bretton woods style monetary conference that push has been accelerated by washington s use of the dollar as a weapon of financial warfare including the application of sanctions the u s uses the dollar strategically to reward friends and punish enemies the use of the dollar as a weapon is not limited to trade wars and currency wars although the dollar is used tactically in those disputes the dollar is much more powerful than that the dollar can be used for regime change by creating hyperinflation bank runs and domestic dissent in countries targeted by the u s the u s can depose the governments of its adversaries or at least blunt their policies without firing a shot but for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction as the u s wields the dollar weapon more frequently the rest of the world works harder to shun the dollar completely i ve been warning for years about efforts of nations like russia and china to escape what they call dollar hegemony and create a new financial system that does not depend on the dollar and helps them get out from under dollar based economic sanctions europe has also shown signs that it wants to escape dollar hegemony for example german foreign minister heiko maas has called for a new eu based payments system independent of the u s and swift society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication that would not involve dollar payments another challenger to the dollar is the imf s special drawing rights or sdrs in a financial crisis the replacement of the dollar could happen almost overnight 04 16 19 let me also add that the us is heavily indebted which will also ultimately lead to its collapse cf habakkuk 2 6 8 there are various prophetic threats against the usa which will converge against it dollar see also who is the king of the west and usa in prophecy the strongest fortresses the usa s use of the dollar as a weapon has a cost those who think that donald trump s sanctions and threats of sanctions are not undermining the us dollar are in error here are some other comments relating to international efforts related to the usa s weaponizing of its dollar 19 april 2019 russian foreign minister sergei lavrov stated on friday at an international investment council session that washington is undermining the status of the us dollar in the long term by abusing it in the short term we see direct abuse of the us dollar s status and in the long term this of course will have a negative effect on the currency because everyone understands how unreliable it is the minister said adding that the us stance has resulted in billions in economic losses on the global markets due to the instability of the dollar at the same time the minister criticised sanctions against the country our foreign policy however aims to provide the most favourable conditions for cooperation with foreign partners on a mutually beneficial basis and in all geographical areas in short this cooperation is hindered by the illegitimate unilateral sanctions bypassing the un security council which have been imposed mostly on far fetched highly likely based pretexts he concluded earlier this year the russian central bank stockpiled a considerable amount of gold and cut its dollar foreign exchange reserves from a whopping 46 percent in 2017 to 22 percent this march the changes came after the russian government s press service last october announced that the authorities were working on a plan to reduce the economy s dependence on the dollar convinced of an existential threat from competitors america is weaponizing the dollar to preserve its global economic and geopolitical position while the u s accounts for about 20 percent of the world s economic output more than half of all global currency reserves and trade is in dollars when combined with access it gained to data from swift the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication s global messaging system the u s exerts unprecedented control over global economic activity sanctions target persons entities organizations a regime or an entire country secondary curbs restrict foreign corporations financial institutions and individuals from doing business with sanctioned entities any dollar payment flowing through a u s bank or the american payments system provides the necessary nexus for the u s to prosecute the offender or act against its american assets this gives the nation extraterritorial reach over non americans trading with or financing a sanctioned party china russia and increasingly europe want an alternative reserve currency system the problem is that immediate replacement of the dollar is difficult i recently came across an article published on mintpress news it was written by whitney webb is who is a staff writer for mintpress news and has contributed to several other independent alternative outlets her work has appeared on sites such as global research the ron paul institute and 21st century wire among others she also makes guest appearances to discuss politics on radio and television she currently lives with her family in southern chile in her article she references a leaked military manual on unconventional warfare that was recently highlighted by wikileaks the u s army states that major global financial institutions such as the world bank international monetary fund imf and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd are used as unconventional financial weapons in times of conflict up to and including large scale general war as well as in leveraging the policies and cooperation of state governments she put it so well below that we have posted it below the document officially titled field manual fm 3 05 130 army special operations forces unconventional warfare and originally written in september 2008 was recently highlighted by wikileaks on twitter in light of recent events in venezuela as well as the years long u s led economic siege of that country through sanctions and other means of economic warfare though the document has generated new interest in recent days it had originally been released by wikileaks in december 2008 and has been described as the military s regime change handbook wikileaks recent tweets on the subject drew attention to a single section of the 248 page long document titled financial instrument of u s national power and unconventional warfare this section in particular notes that the u s government applies unilateral and indirect financial power through persuasive influence to international and domestic financial institutions regarding availability and terms of loans grants or other financial assistance to foreign state and nonstate actors and specifically names the world bank imf and the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd as well as the bank for international settlements bis as u s diplomatic financial venues to accomplish such goals the manual also touts the state manipulation of tax and interest rates along with other legal and bureaucratic measures to open modify or close financial flows and further states that the u s treasury s office of foreign assets control ofac which oversees u s sanctions on other nations like venezuela has a long history of conducting economic warfare valuable to any arsof uw campaign this section of the manual goes on to note that these financial weapons can be used by the u s military to create financial incentives or disincentives to persuade adversaries allies and surrogates to modify their behavior at the theater strategic operational and tactical levels and that such unconventional warfare campaigns are highly coordinated with the state department and the intelligence community in determining which elements of the human terrain in uwoa are most susceptible to financial engagement the role of these independent international financial institutions as extensions of u s imperial power is elaborated elsewhere in the manual and several of these institutions are described in detail in an appendix to the manual titled the financial instrument of national power notably the world bank and the imf are listed as both financial instruments and diplomatic instruments of u s national power as well as integral parts of what the manual calls the current global governance system the frequently expressed reasoning for their gold policies is russia and china are locked in a financial war with their largest debtor this is not the underlying reason these nations have chosen gold as an expression of their dislike of america s weaponization of her monetary policies they know the difference between unbacked fiat currencies and sound money which has been chosen by people ever since they began to use a separate commodity to intermediate in transactions however it is true the americans have weaponised the dollar bringing an urgency to china s and russia s deployment of gold us dollars have been the world s reserve currency for the last forty eight years and america which pays for everything in costless newly issued dollars now says it wants a better trade deal it obviously assumes the dollar s supremacy is unchallengeable and in their need for dollars china and other exporters to america will be forced to comply let s pick this apart the us government pays for everything in a currency which it issues at will new dollars only gain value once they are in circulation but the cost of production is zero stealing their circulatory value from previously existing currency so far the foreigners have been successfully conned though questions are beginning to be asked inevitably the corruption emanating from the issuance at will of costless fiat currency leads to a deteriorating political morality 04 11 19 many are realizing that russia world largest nation in terms of area china world s most populous nation and europe with the combined eu having the world s largest economy want to stop us dollar dominance foreigners will one day rise up against the usa daniel 11 39 habakkuk 2 6 8 the continuing church of god has put together the following video on our bible news prophecy youtube channel 15 19 the us dollar has been the world s primary reserve currency for decades is this about to change what is going on with the chinese yuan and oil and gold what do the brics nations want what did venezuela do do the europeans want to dislodge the us dollar as the world s primary reserve currency does us debt play any role does the bible tell us what will happen to the usa and its dollar what happens if the usa loses its status will gold outlast the us dollar dr thiel addresses those issues and more here is a link to our video us dollar being challenged by gold petro yuan the reality is that the world will one day dump us dollars it will happen though it will take some time but many are working on it now the more final drop basically could happen with a combination of multi national cooperation of which we are seeing more of against the usa dollar natural and or human made disasters impacting the usa and increasing usa debt which keeps happening see state of the indebted union partially because of the debt and the use of other assets internationally the continuing church of god ccog put together the following video on our bible news prophecy youtube channel here is a link to the sermonette video financial reset by 2022 as far as sanctions go here is a video on our bible news prophecy youtube channel related to the sanctions matter here is a link to our video us sanctions and tariffs leading to new world order us sanctions and trade policies are factors that will lead to the loss of the usa dollar as the world s premier reserve currency the usa benefits in many ways by having the world s predominant reserve currency as i warned prior to donald trump s inauguration there will be many unintended consequences to some of his policies and statements the days of the us dollar s dominance are numbered us sanctions and tariffs are helping lead to its demise this status for the usa will not continue do not think that the usa will continue to be number 1 the usa will ultimately be eliminated according to biblical prophecies e g daniel 11 39 isaiah 10 5 11 and financial reasons will be part of why cf habakkuk 2 6 8 there is a cost to usa sanctions and financial bullying tactics they are pushing the gentile nations to come up with something that the usa will not like one day the usa dollar will be worth no more than the scrap value of the cotton paper it is printed on de dollarization will happen in the future not only is that consistent with various biblical prophecies many nations are currently working to make this happen
welcome to this week s market wrap podcast i m mike gleason coming up the one and only marc faber joins me for a tremendous conversation on debt the global economy and the future of the dollar marc tells us how much he believes the average investor should have in gold and silver right now and reveals which precious metal he favors most going forward don t miss a must hear interview with marc faber dr doom coming up after this week s market update well the gold market finally broke away from the 1 300 level where it had been ranging for several weeks unfortunately for the bulls it broke to the downside gold hit a slight new low for the year on thursday with the markets closed today for good friday the gold spot price will end the week at 1 276 per ounce registering a 1 2 weekly decline although gold is showing some technical weakness it is not seeing a massive liquidation in the futures markets however the embattled government of venezuela did dump another 9 tons of its dwindling gold reserves onto the market apparently venezuelan officials found a viable way to skirt economic sanctions on their gold after billions of dollars worth of the yellow metal was frozen by the global banking system at the behest of the united states government in executing the latest sale of gold the venezuelans likely received some assistance from the russian government which continues to add to its gold reserves at a breakneck pace steady central bank demand for hard money in russia china and elsewhere in the far east could put a floor underneath the gold price not far from current levels turning to the white metals they are all outperforming this week the silver market will close the week essentially unchanged at 15 07 an ounce platinum is up 1 3 to trade at 907 and finally palladium rallied 3 2 this week and now trades at 1 432 well it s not just foreign regimes that are being targeted for punishment by the u s but also investigative journalists wikileaks founder julian assange now awaits likely extradition to the united states for his alleged role in hacking into secret u s government files over the years assange made many enemies in the deep state first by exposing apparent war crimes in iraq and afghanistan for a while wikileaks was viewed favorably by many on the left but when it published damning emails ahead of the 2016 election that implicated hillary clinton and the democratic national committee in scandals liberals suddenly became livid many republicans learned to love wikileaks donald trump himself praised wikileaks repeatedly on the campaign trail as the damaging leaks helped sink clinton s poll numbers now though president trump is disclaiming any support for wikileaks or julian assange as his administration prepares to prosecute him the mainstream media are normally hyper critical of any action the administration takes but assange has made plenty of enemies in the press and few journalists will be willing to take the reputational risk of coming to his defense many journalists are understandably embarrassed that wikileaks came to the scene as a more credible source than establishment outlets with much larger budgets but less guts or integrity in the trump era virtually all the major media companies have repeatedly pushed fake news whether for partisan political reasons or out of desperation for ratings what wikileaks reports is very real and often very damaging to powerful people whose secrets get exposed an argument can certainly be made that journalists have a responsibility to withhold information that poses serious national security risks perhaps in some cases assange went too far in his pursuit of radical transparency but a strong case can also be made that our political and financial systems should be subjected to more rather than less sunlight for example there is no valid national security reason why the people in charge of our monetary system need to operate in secrecy when the federal reserve moved secretly following the 2008 credit crisis to bail out financial institutions including some foreign entities the american people were left in the dark they had no opportunity to weigh in on whether there were better uses for the trillions of dollars conjured up by the fed federal reserve officials continue to actively resist a full audit of the central bank s books despite broad public support for greater transparency a full audit of the government s gold reserves at fort knox and west point hasn t been conducted in decades maybe the government has nothing to hide maybe the people who raise doubts about whether the gold is all there whether it s all real or whether it s been leased out are just a bunch of kooks but there is nothing kooky about demanding government bureaucrats verify the gold assets on their books rather than just take their word for it that s why we re pleased to be able to break some news on the podcast today congressman alex mooney will be introducing new federal legislation in the coming days which would require the first true audit of america s gold reserves in over 65 years contrary to the public comments of central bankers in the west gold is an extremely vital asset the whole point of gold reserves whether held by a government or by an individual is that their value doesn t depend on anyone else s word but when gold assets get tangled up in the banking system or are entrusted to a secretive central bank or a corrupt deep state trust and counterparty risk issues enter the equation the lesson for precious metals investors is to insist on transparency only buy from dealers who are transparent about pricing shipping insurance and customer service and if you choose to store your bullion with a third party make sure it is transparent about its security measures and its audits make sure it is transparent about whether your coins and bars will ever be co mingled with the assets of other clients or of the company to avoid this type of risk insist on fully segregated storage at a vault set up for this purpose one such vaulting option is through money metals depository it is located in a depository building custom built to money metals specifications including thick steel and hardened concrete money metals depository uses only top of the line ul class 3 vaults protected by 24 hour monitoring and the latest security protocols all contents are fully insured by lloyd s of london and audited both internally and externally on an ongoing basis if you need storage for any portion of your metals stockpile just call us at 1 800 800 1865 or visit moneymetals com depository to get started and despite the market holiday money metals offices are open today well now without further delay let s get right to this week s exclusive interview mike gleason it is my privilege now to be joined by a man who needs little introduction marc faber editor and publisher of the gloom boom and doom report dr faber has been a long time guest on financial shows throughout the world and is a well known austrian school economist and investment advisor and it s a tremendous honor to have him back on with us today dr faber thank you so much for joining us again and how are you dr marc faber fine and that it s a pleasure for me to participate in this interview mike gleason well marc we ll start out today with everyone s favorite topic that being fed policy and what s happening there because it continues to be such a key driver for everything much to our dismay the markets have been so addicted to fed stimulus and cheat money since the great recession a decade ago so is it possible that they can withdraw this stimulus or did we just learn over the last few months going back to say november and december when we saw the equity market suffer dramatically over the idea of the fed moving forward with those three to four planned rate hikes for 2019 after which the fed has reversed course and completely backed off on any rate hikes this year are we just looking at never ending stimulus from the central banks now marc what are you thinking as you ve watched the events unfold over the last few months with respect to monetary policy and this apparent sea change dr marc faber well it s a complex issue it s particularly complex at the present time because the global central banks i mean the major central banks they can argue well there is little inflation in the system and so we can continue to print money or to purchase assets which either way is true there is little consumer price inflation partly because the economy of ordinary people is not particularly good we have a split economy the economy of the well to do or extremely well to do people is doing well and the economy of the ordinary people in europe in japan in the u s is not doing well and so there is little inflationary pressure but there is a lot of inflation or has been a lot of inflation in asset prices stocks are at highs in the u s essentially not the oil industries but several industries and we have now 10 trillion dollar worth s of bonds in the world that have negative interest rates it s in some kind of a bubble or a big bubble and so we have this asset inflation and in my view the central banks and the policy makers they realize that if the asset bubble really breaks if the stock market drops 20 if home prices drop 20 if bond prices go down 20 or so the whole world is in a depression so i think that when they started actually in 2008 with qe1 in december 2008 and i was asked at the time how do you think it will end i said they just started qe unlimited i think they will continue to print money until the system breaks and that can take another few years but i think yeah it s likely if you were to look at the political landscape you have on the one end the republicans at the present time under the leadership of mr trump he wants to spend on defense and on his wall and on all kinds of things and the democrats they also want to spend on all kinds of things so you can be sure that the deficit in the u s will remain around a trillion dollars a year for the foreseeable future and in my view it s more likely that this deficit will go up and possibly quite substantially so the money printing in my view will continue now could you have qe and at the same time the fed raising interest rates that is a possibility but in the current environment where the economy has been slowing down i think they will rather do nothing especially also under the pressure from the white house which essentially accuses or tells the world that if the fed hadn t raised interest rates the stock market would be much higher so i think they will not increase rates further i think they will not cut the rates as trump and kudlow would suggest to simply show them that they re independent and that they don t need mr trump and mr kudlow to tell them what to do mike gleason despite what the fed has been doing we are still seeing a strong dollar because the fed has been a bit more hawkish than the ecb and the boj the bank of japan and other major central banks throughout the world do you see this reversing at some point we know trump doesn t want a strong dollar so how do you see things playing out in the currency markets because for the most part gold if we relate it to gold is going to trade off the u s dollar in many respects as long we see strength in the dollar it s likely going to be difficult for gold to really catch fire give us your comments on the dollar and what you see ahead for the greenback dr marc faber well i think the dollar is strong because many investors argue that the economy in the u s is either better conditioned than european economies who knows but one reason the dollar has been strong is you have all these negative interest rates in europe in germany the 10 year yield is now negative and in japan as well in switzerland as well and in spain you have interest rates on the 10 year government bonds of 1 whereas in the u s it s 2 58 so i could argue it s logical that if you get more than twice as much interest in u s treasuries than in spanish bonds and you re an insurance company in europe or sovereign fund in the world you rather buy u s treasuries than spanish bonds i think it s quite logical so i think that has supported the dollar but i personally i think the dollar should in due course weaken and as the dollar weakens it could also trigger weakness in the stock market mike gleason as usual when you re a guest on our podcast we like to get your take on what s happening globally in particular we are interested in what you expect from asia there seems to always be talk in the u s media about china slowing down perhaps the tariffs are having an impact however the u s trade deficit doesn t appear to be budging very much what are you expecting with regards to the possibility of recession in china and where do you see the global economy headed in the near term dr marc faber well as you know the chinese had all this excessive credit growth now you could argue well they have this excessive credit growth because they have also a very high propensity or rate of capital spending to build apartment buildings and bridges and roads and the whole infrastructure this is very costly and so the borrowings are very high but whether china will go into recession or not is a question also can in china some sectors be in a recession like car sales are down this year and other sectors continue to expand it s a huge country it s actually almost a continent with 1 3 billion people so different sectors will perform differently but since i live in asia my observation is that there has been a slowdown in economic activity we re not in a recession but we re in a very low growth phase there s very little growth at the present time and if there is growth it is because of borrowings but that is also the case in the u s without a trillion dollar deficit and the debt build up student loans and car loans and everything and credit card loans the u s economy wouldn t be growing either mike gleason we saw back in i believe it was late summer 2015 when the chinese economy really hit the skids there temporarily and it almost started a massive global panic there in the equities markets is china still a key linchpin when it comes to how they re doing so goes the world to some respect and do you see maybe some doom coming down the road for china that could find itself manifesting in other economies and other markets dr marc faber well china consumes approximately 50 of all industrial commodities in the world so if there is a recession in the manufacturing sector in china yeah of course the world feels it or if there is less demand for smart phones in china and also i have to mention here that india has also become a large market so if there s less demand for these toys or for these very sophisticated mobile phones then obviously the world feels it because it affects taiwan and south korea and in turn it affects american semiconductor companies and so forth and so on so it goes through like a bush fire and if china travels less if there are less international travelers then you re talking about 140 million chinese and if they drop by 10 then it s 14 million chinese that will no longer travel and that every market will feel so they have a huge impact on the global economy undoubtedly mike gleason marc how about this move towards socialism that we re seeing whether we re talking about monetary policy or when we look at the landscape of the democrat presidential candidates who will challenge trump in next year s election here in the u s what do you make of this movement that does seem to be gaining steam in many respects throughout the world and how might this impact financial markets and investment opportunities in your view dr marc faber well i just wrote an essay about monetary inflation and the social impact of monetary inflation because depending how the monetary inflation works through the system in the case of hyperinflation germany in 1922 1923 the middle class was essentially eliminated they lost basically most of their savings one way or another but the rich people made a lot of money and i m comparing it to the current time where the middle class hasn t lost money per se but because the rich people became so rich the middle class has kind of been pushed down relative to the super rich people that creates then an unfriendly environment the people that vote they don t understand a lot but it s very easy for a politician to go to people and say you know why you re not doing well it s because of jeff bezos he s got so much money and because of warren buffet he s got so much money and bill gates and so forth and because of these hedge fund managers they don t pay any tax or they don t pay much tax which is actually true the corporate world in america pays very little tax compared to individuals if you look at the composition of tax revenues by the government the bulk is paid by individuals not by the corporate sector and so through destroying wealth and income inequalities the mood is in favor of taking money away from the wealthy people and distributing money to the ordinary people and then they see the ordinary people how much is being spent on defense in the case of the u s close to 750 billion dollars a year and a lot of it is not accounted for and they say well this money shouldn t be spent on defense it should be spent on social programs and so forth and so on so the mood towards socialism especially we have surveys that showed the millennials about 60 of the millennials they are in favor of more government interventions mike gleason yeah definitely something we ll be keeping an eye on here over the next year or so especially as we get close to the election season we ll see what happens there well marc as we begin to wrap up here give us some more of your thoughts on the precious metals for instance do you see better value in one of the pms over the others perhaps and given everything that we ve been talking about here today with all of the debt in the system and the potential of never ending stimulus and perpetual money printing do you envision it being a strong environment for the metals moving forward and basically how do you see the sector performing overall say this year and next and then what will it take for them to sustain a rally to the upside finally dr marc faber well the one thing i want to say that everybody who lived through the monetary inflation of germany which ended up in kind of a hyperinflation but i just want to explain in the case of germany the hyperinflation was also made possible because the other countries didn t inflate and so the mark depreciated against the foreign currencies which then added to inflationary pressures in the present state of monetary policy around the world because everybody prints money currencies don t collapse against each other with very few exceptions like the turkish lira and the argentine peso and so forth but basically the major currencies they trade against each other so where will the collapse of the currencies come from in my opinion they ll all collapse against precious metals and it is conceivable and this is something we just don t know it is conceivable that they ll also collapse against some cryptocurrencies now i think there is a chance we re not sure this is a kind of a theory it is conceivable that bitcoin becomes the standard the gold standard of cryptos but i m not sure all i want to say investors in an environment such as we have of money printing they need to diversify they need to own some equities we don t know whether these monetary inflations will end up with a deflationary bust in which case you may want to own some u s treasuries or it could lead to high inflation consumer price inflation in which case you want to own maybe a farm or some properties overseas or you may wish to own some precious metals i think in any scenario you should own some precious metals or the question is should you own 3 of your money in precious metals or 90 that everybody has to decide for himself i recommend about 20 25 of your assets in precious metals and as to the question which one is likely to perform best i think platinum is the cheapest at the present time of the precious metals and i think it has actually a favorable outlook i think there will be a supply shortage and that the price could significantly outperform gold and silver mike gleason yeah we agree lots of geopolitical dynamics involved in platinum there and that s going to be an interesting market to follow dr marc faber yes exactly mike gleason well dr faber thanks so much for your time and for staying up late with us there in thailand it was certainly real joy to have you back on and get your insights on the state of things and before we let you go

joko widodo popularly known as jokowi was just re elected for a second five year term as president of indonesia according to a quick count conducted by the center for strategic and international studies defeating prabowo subianto his presidential challenger for a second time the election although not without scandal was a relatively peaceful affair further solidifying indonesia s young democracy but did show a swing toward islamic conservatism in indonesia fake news also spread on social media with some hoaxes but was rife on both sides of the political divide although subianto is contesting the result all reliable polling shows that jokowi has won around 55 percent of the vote official results are not expected for some weeks however the election was a battle over the economy with millennials and the middle class having the decisive vote in the election jokowi s man of the people image propelled him to the presidency once again on a platform agenda of economic and social welfare success stories with a vision to continue his reformist and infrastructure building agenda jokowi s successes in running the economy in his first term were notable where he tackled fiscal deficits and ballooning energy subsidies and returned indonesia to a full investment grade rating for the first time in two decades indonesia also became southeast asia s only trillion dollar economy during jokowi s first term his success in capping the price of staple goods generating jobs and building new infrastructure paid off and the indonesian electorate rewarded him for it his shrewd choice of an islamic clergyman ma ruf amin as his vice president also helped jokowi address any questions around his islamic credentials the economic implications to a large extent the re election of president jokowi is validation of his policies indonesians have been impressed with his focus on infrastructure development and heavy spending on social programs like health and education cards which grant access to these basic services to indonesia s poor education will be another key factor where the government will likely focus on more effective and targeted spending to keep his popularity high spending on infrastructure across the nation as well as government funded social programs is set to continue for the economy this will mean a continued over reliance on state owned enterprises which may soon see the establishment of a super holding company to oversee the operations of all state owned enterprises which are currently crowding out private investment coupled with aggressive tax collection efforts to fund infrastructure and social spending from the government the renationalizing of most of indonesia s natural resources will also likely continue as well as the government taking short term protectionist moves to regulate energy prices in terms of economic focus the hard and soft approach is still very much part of jokowi s economic strategy the hard approach will focus on building infrastructure and the soft approach will focus on further streamlining regulations and improving education and skills there is also a breakdown in infrastructure spending beyond the obvious as well as big infrastructure projects such as new roads airports and railways smaller infrastructure projects such as sanitation clean water irrigation and waste management are also in focus on the financial level the government will work to keep inflation steady keep fiscal health strong by increasing state revenue through aggressive tax collection and reduce unproductive state expenditure the central bank has been focused on keeping the economy stable increasing interest rates six times last year in response to u s federal reserve rate hikes which was something admirable before an election year economic stability is likely to continue under the bank s current leadership unfinished business the policy gaps jokowi came to office with an ambitious economic and social agenda five years ago he famously wanted to push indonesia s economy forward aiming for a 7 percent growth target that growth target was not realized during his first term with the economy growing at around 5 percent this was in some part due to global economic circumstances such as global economic uncertainty a slowdown in europe and china and a trade war between the united states and much of asia plus a commodities slump while indonesia is on track to become a 2 trillion economy in the next five years and a top 10 economy by 2030 or earlier jokowi still has his work cut out to move indonesia from emerging market to developed country status millions of indonesians still live on less than a dollar a day growth has been rapid but not rapid enough in a country of 260 million people with many young people finding it hard to get work in part because they lack the basic vocational and practical skills to secure employment jokowi has pledged during the presidential campaign to create 100 million jobs in the next five years boost spending on education and refocus from infrastructure to human capital development furthermore jokowi has made progress in bureaucratic reform in some areas such as tax collection and business permits but indonesia still suffers from stiflingly complicated regulations and red tape over areas such as land permits and suffers from endemic corruption indonesia s negative investment list also means that not all sectors of the economy are accessible to foreign investors this will be part of jokowi s bureaucratic reform agenda in his second term where he will continue to aim to increase the ease of doing business in indonesia indonesia currently ranks 73rd globally according to the world bank annual ratings moreover local and national regulations often overlap making it difficult for companies to maneuver through a quagmire of bureaucracy the erratic regulatory environment and a failure to tackle bureaucratic and legal reform during this his first term plus poor legal certainty and ideological economic nationalism has also meant a continuation of indonesia s weak competitiveness in its investment climate and limited growth jokowi has made significant progress with infrastructure development the jakarta mass rapid transit mrt system is now up and running as of april this year which is a huge symbol of success but indonesia s perennial problem with poor infrastructure across the largest archipelagic nation in the world with 17 000 islands remains a lot more still needs to be done the world bank estimates that indonesia still has an infrastructure deficit of 1 5 trillion despite a 327 billion program to construct new airports highways and ports much more needs to be done to improve and build the infrastructure that indonesia needs to connect the archipelago and improve woeful logistics improvements in infrastructure also correlate directly with higher economic growth on a macroeconomic level jokowi has also so far failed to develop indonesia as a manufacturing hub despite its huge labor force he pledged during the latest presidential campaign to transform indonesia into a manufacturing powerhouse as part of the fourth industrial revolution this was also one of jokowi s policy goals five years ago indonesia s labor laws have not seen much change over that time which is one reason for the stagnation in manufacturing and the failure to attract foreign direct investment into the sector it is expensive to hire and fire workers in indonesia due to clauses that ensure generous severance payments and permanent contracts it is still therefore cheaper to set up manufacturing operations in other southeast asian countries such as vietnam the failure to attract investment and boost manufacturing has been another reason why growth targets have not been realized what the government expects from business jokowi has been welcoming and supportive of business throughout his first term within the context and constraints of indonesia s transactional politics and nationalist sentiment the president is particularly keen on companies that can innovate and invest in indonesia to develop more skilled jobs he also is very supportive of companies who want to support and help indonesia develop its infrastructure from toll roads to ports airports and energy with manufacturing now in focus businesses that can contribute to this sector will also be welcomed with open arms by the government more generally companies will continue to be encouraged and legally mandated to give back to the local communities where they work through corporate social responsibility programs companies that can link in to the president s policy goals will likely be looked on favorably by the government and therefore have more leverage when they face business challenges the overall outlook in summary indonesia can expect much of the same in terms of economic policy under jokowi he won popularity for his handling of the economy during this first term and therefore the basic strategy is set to continue heavy spending on infrastructure and social programs especially education and a continued push to reform indonesia s sclerotic bureaucracy and regulations it remains to be seen how ambitious jokowi will be in the desperate need to reform indonesia s labor laws if he is to realize his plans to transform indonesia into a manufacturing hub there will be serious push back from unions on this overall though the future for indonesia s economy looks bright the question is not if indonesia will realize its economic potential but when edward parker is a contributor to the diplomat based in jakarta indonesia he can be followed on twitter edinindo

kuala lumpur the ringgit was higher against the us dollar in early trading today on improving market sentiment towards the local note due to the higher global oil price at 9 06 am the local unit was traded at 4 1380 1430 against the greenback from 4 1400 1450 at yesterday s close a dealer said buying demand for the ringgit increased as oil futures edged up with brent crude futures settled up 35 cents to us 71 97 a barrel and us west texas intermediate wti crude futures rose 24 cents to us 64 00 a barrel this is perceived to be good for the country s oil and gas revenue furthermore the ringgit was also higher due to bargain hunting activities after it closed at a nearly three month low against the us dollar on wednesday following the possible downgrade of malaysian bonds by the global index provider ftse russell he said however he said some investors were confident that the government would not let the potential downgrade by ftse russell and the norwegian sovereign wealth fund s pullout from malaysia s government bonds affect the country s economic growth meanwhile the ringgit also traded higher against other major currencies it rose against the singapore dollar to 3 0525 0567 from 3 0535 0584 at the close yesterday and was higher against the japanese yen at 3 6963 7011 from 3 6991 6039 the ringgit also appreciated against the british pound to 5 3761 3830 from 5 3853 3935 and improved against the euro at 4 6507 6567 from 4 6579 6640 previously bernama stephen innes managing partner and head of trading at spi asset management says the ringgit is ailing from the knock on effect of the norway sovereign wealth fund trimming emerging market debt and the ftse russell exclusion announcement however innes believes it is unlikely for one of the big three rating agencies to follow suit which is a silver lining for the currency indeed there s blood on the street but these levels should look attractive with china credit expansion underway infrastructure spending picking up and of course the us china trade deal potentially getting tabled as early as may he added
mauricio macri the businessman turned politician about to complete his first term as argentina s president is up for reelection later this year but the economy is in shambles the austerity policies his administration has implemented have given the lie to his coalition cambiemos s 2015 campaign promise to reach poverty zero the administration hasn t even managed to bring down inflation something macri repeatedly said would be super easy to achieve instead argentina has become a sort of vassal of the international monetary fund imf after reviewing the country s economic performance the organization recently allowed the government to access an additional 10 87 billion and christine lagarde the imf s chairwoman said last week that it would be foolish for any candidate or their supporters to turn their back on macri s plans largarde also said that the imf strongly support the authorities efforts to mitigate the social impact of the imf s policies including the recently announced increases in social spending which macri desperately needs to placate the electorate on the eve of his reelection campaign but while the imf s support is good news for the government it didn t stop argentina s peso from dropping to a record low against the us dollar last week 44 90 last year the currency was among the worst performing on earth something that could certainly be repeated in 2019 along with a weak currency production consumption employment and wages have all fallen this has neither halted inflation consumer price inflation last year was 47 6 percent the highest in twenty seven years nor made macri reconsider his economic program it s no mystery why cambiemos believes austerity is not just a remedy to domestic issues but an essential means of integrating the country into the machinery of global capitalism reestablishing ties with the imf allows macri to both reconnect with ruling economic hubs and introduce a powerful external actor that can help discipline political and popular demands in the country by loading the country up with debt and push through his neoliberal program but by doing so a government that touted itself as the best team in the last fifty years has placed the country on the verge of economic disaster privileging the interests of the most internationalized and concentrated sectors of the economy at the expense of the majority of the country the financial sector agribusiness energy companies and mining corporations have received the lion s share of macri s upward redistribution as grupo los grobo ceo gustavo grobocopatel put it in a recent interview the company is paying much more in taxes but they do it very happily a 400 percent devaluation of the currency since 2015 has something to do with his cheerfulness as does the dubiousness of his claim about a higher tax bill with few exceptions mr macri has cut taxes for big businesses waiting he insisted for torrential inversions that never arrived since then the government has only managed to depress salaries and raise fuel and household costs electricity prices jumped between 1 053 percent and 2 388 percent from october 2015 to october 2018 gas for households increased between 462 percent and 1 353 percent and water prices went up by 832 percent in just three years macri s monetary policies prompted argentina to sign a 56 3 billion financing deal with the imf the most extensive rescue package in the organization s history argentina is now the most indebted country in latin america with a debt that rose to 77 4 percent of gdp in 2018 it hasn t taken long for the consequences of these policies to bleed like an open wound poverty has grown 6 3 percentage points or 2 7 million people in the last year alone reaching 32 percent of the population unemployment is close to double digits and higher for women and young people 21 5 percent for women between fourteen and twenty nine years old and 17 3 percent for men in the same cohort while industry has been destroying employment with no end in sight last month volkswagen argentina announced a rotating furlough plan for three hundred workers at its pacheco plant following similar moves at other terminals last year peugeot dismissed one thousand operators at its el palomar plant and honda did the same with seven hundred workers another example is renault which halted production at its plant in córdoba for a week this month affecting 1 500 employees and has not yet announced whether it will repeat the measure fate the tire company is in the same situation and workers say the company is preparing 450 dismissals according to official figures the number of registered industrial workers was 92 800 less than in november 2015 in its industry report adefa argentina s automotive factory association reported that wholesale sales fell 58 8 percent between february 2018 and 2019 a similarly dire picture can be seen in other economic sectors meanwhile businesses and the state are working to liquidate past labor victories and protective legislation for example a cambiemos governor in the northwest province of jujuy okayed child labor in the tobacco industry and schemes tying wages to productivity have increased in recent years with sometimes fatal consequences port workers teachers doctors nurses and other state workers are also feeling the heat as is the scientific community which is steadily losing funding and human resources the catastrophe may not be easy to grasp from washington or argentina s executive mansion casa rosada but it is readily apparent on the ground the legacy of mr macri there is an ongoing debate about how to characterize mr macri s economic experiment considering both the massive transfer of resources towards the wealthy and his stated aims of fighting corruption and restoring normality more recently macri s intimate relations with donald trump s administration and abundant propaganda about combating drug trafficking have blanketed the news interspersed with tales of illegal espionage all this but especially his agenda to bring normality into urban territories is being used to militarize the country in an attempt to repressively manage the mounting social anger again the scale of mr macri s problems should not be confused with unforeseen or unwanted results the fall in real wages and the regressive redistribution of wealth were always part of his project a project that faces difficulties due to the loss of legitimacy and the lack of economic growth that could subordinate sectors affected by cuts and austerity without such resources macri and lagarde will try to convince voters that the country is on the path to prosperity in the absence of any concrete evidence at the same time cambiemos will not for the first time in argentine history use the external debt as a disciplinary tool exhorting the population to go along with social spending cuts because there is no alternative while targeting those resisting as malicious and damaging to the country despite macri s heavy hand social unrest a constant since 2016 is growing the feminist green tide human rights organizations and some sections of the workers movements are all quite active with the latter now calling for a fifth national strike on april 30 other more spontaneous eruptions have also emerged placing additional constraints on the government macri has been unable to pass his regressive labor pension and electoral reforms if something other than a dramatic economic recession can be counted as macri s legacy it is his capacity to reconnect a neoliberal right and traditional center right politics both strongly influenced by anti peronist sentiment macri says it is him or the past but he has nothing to offer other than a dramatic repetition of the recipes that led argentina to severe crises not so long ago and that s far from what the vast majority in the country needs this piece was originally published in jacobin luciana zorzoli is a research associate at soas university of london and a conicet postdoctoral fellow at idihcs university of la plata her research interests include industrial relations and economic

prices were 2 6 higher marking eighth consecutive quarter of higher sequential pricing in addition we passed on modest amount of business this quarter as we prioritize margin recovery finally net sales were negatively impacted by significant unfavorable currency translation of more than 4 or about 160 million we expect unfavorable currency translation to continue into the second quarter and be in the range of 130 million to 150 million looking at some business trends for the first quarter in our performance coatings reporting segment aerospace coatings had its fourth consecutive quarter a double digit percentage sales volume growth led by above industry performance in all major regions in our automotive refinish business we continue to see flat industry demand in developed regions as an example in the us automotive collision claims were down 1 in the quarter our refinish business began the integration of the sem acquisition which is off to a great start and delivering above segment margins and we are beginning the process of expand their geographic commercial scope we were pleased that the architectural coatings emea sales volumes increased for the second consecutive quarter combination of positive sales volumes and higher selling prices supported by mid single digit per percentage net sales growth in the quarter importantly all major sub regions were higher as we discussed in the past this business and this region deliver high incremental margins on increased volumes as we do not need to add any additional cost to support the growth advertisement advertisement our sales volumes in the mexican ppg comex business were slightly lower year over year driven by the timing of easter holiday promotion which will occur in the second quarter paint sales in latin america are historically higher in the weeks leading up to this holiday we expect stronger sales volumes in the ppg comex business in the second quarter during the quarter we opened 25 new stores in mexico and central america sales volumes in architectural coatings americas and asia pacific decreased due to lower net diy sales of about 60 million stemming from the prior year customer assortment changes we did have positive year over year sales growth at our other two key diy customers for the quarter same store company owned sales growth in the us and canada was up by low single digit percentage impacted by soft market demand for most of the quarter protective marine coatings continued to deliver excellent sales volume growth of more than 10 for the quarter in our industrial coatings reporting segment sales volumes were adversely impacted by our soft industrial activity in most of the major regions of the world automotive bills were significantly lower in china and europe in aggregate our automotive sales volumes were lower by a half or by high single digit percentage consistent with global industry build rates the automotive oem business made good progress in implementing selling price increases realizing sequentially higher price in each major region of the world softer global industrial production activity also impacted our general industrial coatings business most notably in the coil and general finishes segment as expected our packaging coatings sales volumes decreased modestly in comparison to strong above market growth in the prior year driven by customer adoption to our innovel interior can coatings products from an earnings perspective our first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of 1 38 was slightly below the prior year quarter our earnings were negatively impacted by about 20 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation as i mentioned earlier excluding this impact our adjusted earnings per diluted share were modestly higher than prior year during the quarter we continue to be impacted by raw material inflation which was nearly all carried forward inflation from 2018 this was our 10th consecutive quarter of raw material inflation in addition we encouraged logistics and wage inflation in the quarter recent increases in crude oil prices and some supply disruptions in china and texas could affect our input costs unfavorably in the next quarter advertisement advertisement selling price increases 2 6 with comparable contributions from both of our operating business reporting segments in addition we made excellent progress on our business restructuring actions delivering more than 20 million in cost savings during the quarter pacing with our targeted savings our effective tax rate was about 24 in the first quarter which is higher than the 21 rate in the first quarter of 2018 the increase mostly relates to recognize the non recurring favorable discrete items in the prior year first quarter we are still anticipating a full year 2019 tax rate between 23 to 25 as we look ahead we expect global economic activity to remain subdued in the second quarter we anticipate improvement as the year progresses global automotive production is expected to decline in second quarter compared to the second quarter 2018 and general industrial demand is likely to be modest and uneven by end market and region in the second quarter positive developments around regional and country trade disputes could spark a return to higher industrial activity in the second half of 2018 specific to our business we believe that more stable interest rates in the us will help drive modest growth in the us housing market and also favorably impact automotive oem sales for the second quarter we expect us industry automotive bills to be flat our us architectural business sales volumes will be down about 60 million due to unfavorable customer assortment change this will be the final quarter for this impact in latin america we anticipate higher sales volumes from normal seasonal demands in the ppg comex business growth rates in asia are expected to remain soft with some modest improvements compared to the first quarter we expect our sales volumes in the automotive oem business to be stronger in the second half of the year based on recently implemented stimulus and easier comparisons to the prior year advertisement advertisement overall economic growth in europe is expected to remain weak with no clear catalysts we expect sales volumes in our automotive oem business to be lower than prior year and similar to the first quarter as decreases in industry production bills are expected to continue in the second quarter the delay of brexit would probably continue to lead to higher levels of uncertainty and could impact consumer confidence and overall demand we expect our regional architectural coatings business to produce favorable sales volumes in the second quarter we will continue to manage all elements of our business within our control to ensure that we remain competitive regardless of economic conditions in addition the execution of our restructuring programs will carry on and we expect about 20 million of additional incremental savings to be realized in the second quarter as mentioned in our earnings press release we continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment and we will be prepared to implement further cost reduction actions if necessary we provided eps guidance specific to the second quarter of 2019 this guidance is 1 76 to 1 86 which includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0 05 to 0 07 per share we remain fully committed to delivering on the full year targets we announced in january for 2019 a 3 to 5 sales growth and 7 to 10 of adjusted eps growth both excluding foreign currency translation our focus on cash generation continues in the first quarter our cash flow from operations was a net use of cash this is consistent with our normal seasonal pattern of using cash in the first quarter to prepare for a higher sales activity in the second quarter in addition this year we intentionally built inventories due to our preparation around brexit and anticipation of a second quarter erp conversion in our us automotive refinish business this erp conversion is a last major conversion for all of our us and canadian businesses with all the previous us coatings businesses successfully converting over the past two years in addition the recent sem and whitford acquisition added to our working capital our goal for full year remains to reduce working capital as a percentage of sales compared to 2018 we completed the whitford acquisition in the first quarter and just recently announced the completion of the hemmelrath acquisition the three recently announced and completed acquisitions including sem will add about 400 million in annualized revenue provided with a broader range of products and technology to grow our business advertisement advertisement accretive earnings acquisitions continue to be our cash deployment preference and our acquisition pipeline remains active in addition to acquisitions we continue to invest organically in our business capital expenditure is expected to be about 3 of sales in 2019 and we continue to invest in research and development at similar levels as we have done historically we ended the first quarter with more than 800 million of cash and short term investments and we continue to have significant financial flexibility finally

help us deliver these objectives each and every day this concludes our prepared remarks once again we appreciate your interest in ppg and now andrea would you please open the line for questions questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question will come from kevin mccarthy of vertical research partners please go ahead advertisement advertisement kevin william mccarthy vertical research partners analyst yes good morning michael i was wondering if you could expand upon your outlook for china in the release you indicated that you are cautiously optimistic and expect a better back half of the year just wondering how much of that is predicated on a trade deal or are you starting to see stimulus related benefits any color there would be helpful michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer kevin as you know the 13th national people s conference took place in the first quarter the vat for coatings was dropped from 16 to 13 the vat for cars was dropped from 10 to 9 the social insurance contributions were reduced so there s a lot of what i would say i don t know total stimulus is the right word but there s a lot of influence in the marketplace to lead to better performance as you now we do see automotive numbers in real time and so we re optimistic that the second half of the year is going to be better than the first half and we do have insight into like i said previously 90 days we have a fair amount of confidence 60 days 30 days we have high confidence so we re starting to see the early signs of that advertisement advertisement kevin william mccarthy vertical research partners analyst okay that s helpful and then state side what is your outlook for us architectural and perhaps you could touch on the subjects of whether weather was an impact at all in your first quarter and what you re seeing in terms of the macro indicators for architectural coatings demand in the us michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well ok no as you know reported the last january and february around but as we always tell our operating teams we have to be able to function because somewhere else in the world you get good weather always have a different put and take on that so we re not going to point to that we do see our customers have good backlogs we do have a slightly different mix and maybe some of our competitors as far as our stores but overall we still think this is a very good market and we re anticipating favorable comps going forward kevin william mccarthy vertical research partners analyst thanks very much operator our next question comes from michael sison of keybanc please go ahead michael joseph sison keybanc capital markets inc analyst hi guys nice quarter michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thanks mike michael joseph sison keybanc capital markets inc analyst in terms of the second half of the year you talked about maintaining your outlook for sales growth ex currency so can you maybe walk us through by some of the sub businesses what type of growth you re going to see in the second half to sort of hit that full year number michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well mike if you look at the various pieces let s start with aerospace we re going to continue to see very very good growth in that business the underlying trends are very nice so whether it s the build rates whether it s the military however you want to frame it in aerospace is going to have a very solid quarter and back half of the year refinish we had a lighter comp numbers in the third and fourth quarter of last year so we re going to be comping against a little bit easier pmc as you saw in the first quarter up double digits we continue to see a recovery in that segment marine bouncing off the bottom strong protective sales in that segment so i would tell you that we have a lot of confidence in that and probably the most encouraging one is architectural europe we tried to kind of lead you to this conclusion in prior calls we were the first ones to raise price in europe we raised it significantly so last year we were given up share preferentially to get prices up now our competitors are out they are raising price so that business that it s historically been ours it s been flowing back to us we had a very good quarter in the first quarter we anticipate that trend line continuing the second quarter as well as the back half of the year comex and our team is just doing a phenomenal job in mexico central america so i would tell you that that s we re getting price there we re having customers trade up ever since we found comex we ve brought higher value added products in there that s been a positive automotive oem is a little bit of a wildcard we see the us is relatively stable 16 7 16 8 ph somewhere in that range europe kind of ticking down marginally but eventually they re going to have all these diesel things behind them and it s a solid market so we anticipate a better second half of the year and then when you think about asia similar what i said earlier we have very soft comps to compare again third and fourth quarters so that will be better general industrial more the same we see the stimulus having a little more positive impact so i think there s a lot of things we would point to that gives us this confidence michael joseph sison keybanc capital markets inc analyst great and then just a quick follow up on 2q earnings outlook the year over year decline eps is larger than basically flattish in the first quarter so are some of the headwinds more daunting in 2q than they were in 1q because it seems like maybe it should be less but i m just curious on your thoughts there vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer hi michael this is vince just a couple key items to put forward one the customer assortment change that michael talked about earlier that actually was announced last year march 1 once that was announced in 2018 we took out most of the support costs before we got to q2 while we had a full sell in q2 we would take our pay with that customer in q2 so they took a full allotment without the support costs so that assortment is a bit more penal in 2019 we did have obviously a strong automotive market last year in q2 we didn t see erosion in the auto market until q3 q2 is typically a higher seasonal quarter so bigger impact than q1 and then finally in q2 last year if you look at our corporate line we started to make adjustments to our incentive compensation on our corporate line i think our corporate line was in the mid 20s 20 million range last year and we gave a lot projection in the release it ll be almost double that in q2 of this year so those are three of the primary factors that put this a little bit different in q1 michael joseph sison keybanc capital markets inc analyst okay great thank you michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thanks mike operator our next question comes from ghansham panjabi of robert w baird please go ahead ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst thank you good afternoon everyone michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer good afternoon ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst i guess first off on auto refinish in europe and some of the weakness you called out michael in your prepared comments on i know you touched on a pre buy in europe the benefit of 4q but how would you characterize overall market conditions in the region specific to auto refinish michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer i mean the market over there is not that much different in the us you have a slightly softer less collisions down 1 or 2 slightly more totals but overall we re still gaining the shops over there so that s the positive prices we ve been able to successfully raise price over there so i don t see the trends in europe any different than i do anywhere else now obviously sequentially second quarter will be better than first quarter for refinish europe because of the timing of the price increase but i m not concerned at all about our refinish sales volumes ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst okay and then just sticking with europe and architectural emea last couple of quarters have been positive they are smaller quarters on a relative basis i know you mentioned the pricing dynamics and sounds like just some reversion from a market regained perspective but taken that in context with what you said michael in terms of just european macro and brexit what do you think though was reasonable to expect for the market itself to grow in 2019 there kevin william mccarthy vertical research partners analyst well we still have the same kind of perspective is that it s going to be a low growth market let s call it 0 to 2 but i think what we re mostly excited about is the share that s flowing back to us and i think the fact that we do see a number of countries especially eastern europe which we always view as a good sign when eastern europe is doing well that s a very good market for us they re having some strong numbers and probably a little bit of a surprise to us is uk and ireland they ve outperformed our expectations we thought with brexit it would be a much slower market but surprisingly we continued to grow nicely in that market ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst terrific thank you so much operator our next question comes from john roberts of ubs please go ahead john ezekiel e roberts ubs investment bank analyst thanks first a short one and then i have a question on raw materials but do you think you ll have the portfolio reviewed by the outside consultants done in time for your investor day in early june or do you think it s going to take until the end of the quarter vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer john we re looking to test something by the end of the quarter john ezekiel e roberts ubs investment bank analyst okay and then is the potential raw material disruption in texas related to the tank farm fire that occurred in the shipping terminals or is it something else and how do we think about the volatility in oil prices some of your raw materials like solvents follow oil quickly some are lot more slowly so they probably didn t change much in the quarter and then customers often look at oil as kind of a leading indicator of price i don t know if you had maybe more push back on price early in the quarter and now you might have some tailwind here with the oil coming back up michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah john the fire in texas didn t impact anything we buy but what it does impacted the access to the other products are in that terminal so that s been the challenge so we regard that as a one quarter disruption as far as oil remember we have a i always like to say we have like nine different buckets of raw materials you got half of them up and half of them down one of them flat oil will impact solvents but most of our other raw materials are impacted by supplying and demand of the derivatives so obviously we re encouraged to see that propylene remains weak ethylene is we view ethylene as a long term oversupplied market which will help us so i would tell you that we still remain firm on our raw material projection which is low single digit and that the back half of the year comps will be much easier on raw materials john ezekiel e roberts ubs investment bank analyst thank you operator our next question comes from david begleiter of deutsche bank please go ahead david l begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you michael just on raws again really tio2 do you expect to see higher tio2 prices in 2019 versus last year michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer so david our response is the same one we gave in the fourth quarter that we don t think we need to be talking about tio2 this year you had some pluses and minuses but overall it s a non event in our market basket so that would be the way we would describe that david l begleiter deutsche bank analyst understood and just on auto oem michael very good job on pricing but obviously weak volumes are the weak volumes is jeopardizing at all your price initiatives your price traction in oem michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer david i don t think so i m viewing this the same way we saw with architecture we were the first ones out with price where the most aggressive in trying to hold our customers accountable for us to recover our margins we provide a lot of value to our customers lot of new technology and obviously we re getting price across the world in that so when our competitors are getting as aggressive as we are if they do that then we would expect to see some of that volume flow back right now it s more important for us to get priced and that s our number one objective vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer and david it s vince i think our customers clearly understand that for calendar year 17 and calendar year 18 we got little to no price so we re still well in rears in terms of value capture for what we deliver to them david l begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you very much operator our next question comes from bob koort of goldman sachs please go ahead christopher mark evans goldman sachs group inc analyst good afternoon guys chris evans on for bob so on pricing eight quarters in a row of improvements recognizing your industrial coatings margins are still pretty depressed how much more price is needed there to recover the lost profitability and then way more specifically does the consolidated 1q pricing you printed this quarter represent a high watermark for the year as comps get harder throughout vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah chris this is vince i ll take the second part of your question we re still on pricing in q2 we re still doing surgical and targeted pricing and then not only in the industrial segment but in other businesses so i would definitely not consider that high watermark and i think you alluded to it properly we re starting the stack price on top of price we still got some need to recover in certain businesses or regions and we re going continue to push to try to fully recover this over the course or balance of this year john bruno director investor relations hi chris this is john maybe on your cumulative question if you look at the past 10 quarters raws are up accumulative amount of low single digits and pricing is maybe up 3 look more than 3 we think we say we need to get half of the raw material inflation to be even so that s the delta we re looking at christopher mark evans goldman sachs group inc analyst very helpful and then just sort of stacking that on top of the raw material commentary you put up a pretty good the best margin performance year over year in quite a while so how does the cadence of your margin sort of trend as the comps in your raw material basket gets lighter and you continue to push price michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well i think the way i would answer that chris is that vince said that we re all recognizing that when you compare margins of 17 and 18 they are below our 16 levels we need to get back to those levels the sales teams are well aware of the gap that still exists and the marching orders have not changed so we re going to continue to work hard to capture that gap our customers know the gap still exists and it s up to us to get the additional price but also provide additional value to our customers so it s a win win christopher mark evans goldman sachs group inc analyst very clear thank you michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thanks chris operator our next question comes from christopher parkinson of credit suisse please go ahead christopher s parkinson credit suisse analyst great thank you very much so it appears you guys were successful in getting regional oem pricing all synchronized positively which i m sure your team is pleased with can you just comment on whether or not this is simply a functionality of just prior price initiatives and obviously your team have been fighting for a while or any additional pricing actions and for 1q so just basically asking on what assurances the investment community has that the trend is sustainable moving forward thank you vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah chris vince for us when we worked extremely diligently the past 12 to 18 months to secure the pricing that you re seeing here in q1 we fully expect that the carry forward for the balance of the year and again we do have additional targeted pricing coming in not only in auto oem and but other businesses so again our emphasis is to recover our margins fully but to michael s point we ve got to make sure we re demonstrating to our customers the value we bring christopher s parkinson credit suisse analyst got it and then also just on the capital allocation front given your stocks that you had a bit of a run here and where you see leverage just how are you assessing share repurchases on a go forward basis versus mid and potentially large size m a thank you vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah we said coming into the year it s pretty active acquisition pipeline and our preference right now remains to vet those acquisitions before we make any considerable decisions regarding share repo but our active pipeline will keep us busy for a little bit of time and we ll determine whether those are value creating or not or whether we re considering them for our portfolio if that doesn t work we will reassess how we re going to deploy our cash christopher s parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you very much vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks chris operator our next question comes from p j juvekar of citi please go ahead p j juvekar citigroup inc analyst yeah hi good morning michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer hi juv p j juvekar citigroup inc analyst michael the china stimulus automotive stimulus went into effect i think on april 1 is that why you feel more positive on second half and i think a lot of companies are talking about second half recovery i mean do you see any momentum in second half second quarter now that you think could last into second half michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer p j we do see how our customers are pre planning and so we have insight into that so that s one item that gives us a little more confidence clearly we see the current production levels that we see in april but that s 15 days remember china s had if i remember right nine or 10 consecutive monthly decline 10 monthly declines in a row so i m not going to jump out in front of this right now let s wait until we see how the actual numbers turn out p j juvekar citigroup inc analyst okay and then on architectural business it seems like your store business is growing at or better than the market so i guess my question is why not accelerate these store growth by opening more stores because the national retail stores and independent stores seem to be lagging here so why not grow your own store ways thank you vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah p j vince i don t know that we re growing better than the market we didn t say that we do have definitional differences with some of our competitors we include industrial coatings in our industrial segment other folks include those differently and our industrial business was as michael mentioned lighter this quarter in q1 so again i would not say we re outpacing the market for those for us we go to market with a multi channel approach we ve always done that we do well certainly with the home depot and other major merchandisers our dealer channel albeit a lower growth channel is a good channel for us with a low cost to serve and we certainly support our trade network as much as possible and we re doing selective additions we re doing selective pruning in all those channels p j juvekar citigroup inc analyst thank you michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thanks p j vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks p j operator our next question comes from frank mitsch of fermium research please go ahead frank joseph mitsch fermium research analyst yes hi good afternoon this is le veon bell sitting in for frank michael on a difficult macroenvironment in the first quarter here you re able to post a nice result especially relative to the guidance that you guys had issued so i m just curious as to what were the key factors for ppg to be able to outperform those expectations vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer hi frank this is vince a couple things that differed from the beginning of the year one we certainly secured pricing at a level that we had as hoped a little bit better than that the second issue as we were very aggressive on our cost management given the uncertainty in the economic backdrop and we also seen currency come in a little better than we anticipated at the beginning of the year but still negative year over year so those are the three primary factors that deviate favorably from our guidance frank joseph mitsch fermium research analyst all right so we might want to inaudible dial in all three of those factors in for q2 relative to the 176 186 ph just kidding vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yes frank joseph mitsch fermium research analyst on the restructuring side you posted you said 20 million or i think better than 20 million in savings during q1 and you said that you d get that again into 2q release i think you said that where do you stand on 2019 i think i heard you guys talk about 80 million savings in 2018 and around 70 million in 2019 what sort of expectations should we expect out of being the cost cutting actions that you guys have under way john bruno director investor relations yeah frank this is john so our number one priority is to complete the restructuring initiatives we ve identified that those alone will probably get us close to 70 million and we have additional initiatives that are not necessarily restructuring that our other cost areas throughout the business throughout the world that will get us to 80 million so we still feel very comfortable with that number frank joseph mitsch fermium research analyst thank you so much michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thanks le veon ph operator our next question comes from don carson of susquehanna financial group please go ahead donald david carson susquehanna financial group analyst yes thank you question couple of questions on architectural you mentioned that obviously you lapped the lowe s loss in q3 but how about your home depot business in some of the new brands you have there what kind of your year over year growth can we expect as we get into the second half of the year and then on emea can you remind us where you are in terms of volumes relative to your 2007 peak and what we should think of as incremental margins in that business as you load more volume michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah so don i ll take the first half and i ll let vince take the second half we started shipping home depot early may so we ll have three months of home depot versus two months in the second quarter obviously there was a lot of confusion in the marketplace olympic was at both lowe sand home depot this year it s only at home depot so there ll still be some people look at around to make sure they find the world s greatest paint olympic but i would envision that we will continue to have positive comps won t speculate about how much because i think that s home depot s business but the relationship is very good they re the best retailer in that space and we re very privileged to be a partner with home depot so maybe vince you want to tackle that again vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah in terms of your question don around where we are versus the 2007 peak we were down still almost 20 in volume for the whole architectural europe region so we still have not seen this is really the first signs of recovery where we ve seen since the recession in our volumes that s a holistic comment we ve certainly seen differences by countries as michael mentioned the uk has been a good country for us for the past couple of years but we ve seen other markets that have continued to wane but holistically we re down just under 20 cumulative since 2007 we are recording very high incremental margins as michael mentioned in his prepared remarks these are coming in somewhere in the vicinity of 35 to 40 so that volume is extremely lucrative to us when it does occur donald david carson susquehanna financial group analyst thank you vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from arun viswanathan of rbc capital markets please go ahead arun shankar viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst hi guys good afternoon just a quick question for you guys on the margin so obviously a little bit better than what we had thought how would you characterize them versus your own expectations and you mentioned three things as far as slightly better fx price and cost could you kind of bucket that out for us on q1 and how those three would potentially progress through the year michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well i think arun the cost management something where you were watching our order book every day where we re taking necessary actions business by business region by region based on the order book and q1 was very choppy in terms of the macro so some of our businesses took immediate and swift action to minimize any cost if we see the volume come back i think we ll have one more traditional cost structure from pricing perspective the only way they will get price a little earlier than we anticipated we thought some of this will drag on into q2 but the level of pricing that we achieved is what we are targeting we just add a little earlier than what we anticipated in our guidance with respect to currency i ll let you guys you guys are the experts on currency we just make paint we don t predict the currency markets so i ll let you guys opine on that arun shankar viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks and as a follow up your discussions are margin recovery i mean you guys have targets as to where you want to get back to as far as percent margins if i went back to the 08 to 2010 period it looks like they suffered by 500 basis points and they actually recovered within a year or two is it fair to assume that something like that could happen in industrial because we ve seen that kind of deterioration over the last couple of years thanks michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah just generically speaking we re targeting 2016 as a marker there s a lot happened in the world from 16 to 19 so it s not going to be a straight linear comparison but 2016 is a point in time where we re using as a marker from our margin perspective we have work to do as you pointed out we were targeting to get margin parity by the middle of the year we re glad to get there in q1 and then we re open to improve on our margins year over year in the back half of the year arun shankar viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst and lastly on that point would you need incremental volume growth to get back to full parity or continue with that trend or could you potentially continue to see margin recovery even in a kind of sluggish volume environment thanks michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well there s two sides of that equation we certainly welcome volume that makes the story a lot easier in a nations volume environment we would expect supply demand to work in our favor on the raw material side arun shankar viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst thanks michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from steven haynes of morgan stanley please go ahead steven bryson haynes morgan stanley analyst hi guys thanks for taking my question i just want to quickly clarify so you re talking margin recovery came in ahead in 1q 19 and you re commenting that it will be up in 2q 19 as are in the second half of 19 can you just comment on whether or not the first quarter was an inflection for margins and how we should be thinking about that for 2q vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer okay this is vince again just to reiterate i think we were anticipating getting the margin parity in the first half of the year so by the end of the second quarter again got there a little earlier let s be clear we re still several hundred basis points below our targets so we still have a lot of recovery under way and we re going to start working our way back there for the balance of this year steven bryson haynes morgan stanley analyst and then if i just get a quick follow up too so the press release talked about you guys passing on some business could you just maybe talk about a little bit about what categories you are foregoing business in michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well automotive is clearly one industrial is another so those are the two biggest areas and china and asia in general what we ve said is getting price in china is not easy you have to do it a lot of times by backing up your request for price by saying that you won t meet the meeting the need that we have we re happy if you take your business somewhere else and then they get service at a i would say at a lower level then they re happy to come back and pay the higher price and or if they re missing the technology which is generally the biggest thing they miss so they come back to us and say we really need that better technology whether it s a waterborne whether it s the products that help their productivity in their plants so whatever it is that generally is important because once it s showing up in their manufacturing line and once they re manufacturing people have to account for it that s when the purchasing people have less power steven bryson haynes morgan stanley analyst thank you operator our next question comes from patrick fischer of barclays please go ahead michael leithead barclays analyst hi guys this isn t patrick this is mike leithead on for duffy i guess circling back to volumes volumes seems have decelerated the last three quarters even if we exclude some of the customer assortment changes can you maybe just talk about how we should think about volume trending into 2q in the back half and then maybe i was hoping you d quantify how much volume or the volume impact from the businesses you passed on in the quarter michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer so i think i ll pass on saying how much we pass on i think that varies by business and it varies by region but what i will tell you is that in the second quarter we re still anticipating a little bit softer on the volumes but when you look at the third and fourth quarter you re seeing as comping against a different environment from the third fourth quarter of 18 plus we see the stimulus impact going to be a positive we see us continued to be a good market mexico continued to be a good market and some slight recovery in architectural business in europe so i think there s enough things out there that give us good confidence level that our predictions are going to be relatively accurate vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer and mike i would to like add i think the volume erosion if you look over the past four quarters or three quarters as you mentioned has really come in the industrial segment and that segment has been producing 3 4 volume growth up until really the third quarter last year and everything we ve seen in that particular segments really been macro driven obviously with china auto coming off european auto coming off the halo effect of that around the general industrial businesses that get affected by our tier 1 tier 2 suppliers so that s all macro and again we re in anniversary some of that as we go into the back half of the year here michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer and mike just to put that in perspective we had 13 quarters in a row of positive volume in our industrial coatings business so not kind of i don t like this quarter but we re still looking at our sales teams doing a very good job on the marketplace michael leithead barclays analyst got it that s helpful and then if i could drill into aerospace strong solid green and when i look at your slide and above market growth in every region i was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit more about what s driving that growth whether it s product mix or new share gains or other factors that are driving the above market growth there michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well it s actually a factor of everything our sealants business continues to gain share our coatings business continues to gain share and certainly our transparencies business has done a phenomenal job of winning new programs left and right so everyone of those is a positive you have commercial areas commercial is doing very well military is doing very well and the only semisoft would be the general aviation but our biggest customer who is very large in that generally aviation market is winning share so we re also affiliated with the right customers so we did factor into our second quarter guidance some of the most recent commentary from one of the larger oem plane makers but overall we re going to have a very solid second quarter and a record full year in aerospace michael leithead barclays analyst great thanks guys michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thanks mike operator our next question comes from gary shmois of longbow please go ahead garik simha shmois longbow research analyst thanks that margins have recovered year over year and pricing is like set now on pace wondering if there s any lessons over the last couple of years that you could take forward if inflation does again start to ramp so that you can offset inflation maybe faster than expected vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer well i ll let mike answer the question but i want to make sure where our sales people on the phone our margins are not recovered so it will be very clear on that we have still room to go go ahead michael michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah so clearly as i try to explain the last time there were two events that clearly impacted the rates of initial early recovery and the first one is our friends in cleveland valspar i think the valspar team without speaking for one of my peers they were a little slow off the block that was a challenge we were trying to buy our friends in the netherlands at that time they mainly went into a mode of saying they were going to grow 4 volume and that doesn t work in an environment where raw materials are going up you need to be focused on getting prices up so the competitive environment is a challenge at that point so clearly a couple of us got off a dime and we re moving quicker than the others now every not everybody the most everybody is on looking at their margins and getting a lot of pressure from their shareholders and they re trying to recover margins so i think that s one lesson learned and maybe the other lesson learned is we need to stick to it and where we should have walked away from some volumes a little bit earlier and so maybe that s the lesson learned garik simha shmois longbow research analyst thanks for the color follow up question on inaudible just going down i think 10 million from 55 million to 60 million previously now to 45 million to 50 million is that part of the cost savings program or is there something else going on john bruno director investor relations gary that s our normal seasonal trend our corporate costs are historically higher the first quarter for some different reasons and then the second through fourth quarter normally are at a lower level but similar garik simha shmois longbow research analyst helpful thank you john bruno director investor relations thank you operator our next question comes from jeff zekauskas of j p morgan please go ahead jeffrey john zekauskas jp morgan analyst thanks very much nippon paint seems to agreed to buy dulux in australia was that property that you were interested in and you didn t want to pay as much as they paid or was that just not a property that interest interested you do at all michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer jeff this is michael what we always tell everybody is on every acquisition in the coatings paints and specialty products space that we have we re always interested in looking at everything and just because we don t get something doesn t mean that we aren t interested but what i will tell you is that if we were always winning then people would be concerned but at the same time every company makes their own decisions about what is the right price to pay and how does that impact their shareholders and so i would say different people have different answers for the exact same acquisition so all i will tell you is that we try to be active we try to look at everything but for ppg right now we re very comfortable where we are john bruno director investor relations yeah jeff and i ll just add that i think you know this of course but we have a very good architectural business in australia and a growing business there so we are on the continent michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer and we re number two on the continent jeffrey john zekauskas jp morgan analyst okay can you talk about what your operating cash flow was in the quarter and are you having a very different experience in your raw materials price changes in the united states versus your raw material price changes in the offshore markets and that it seems that propylene is pretty weak in the us but the oil price is really lifted in the offshore markets so are we seeing inflation in the offshore markets and deflation in the domestic markets and again what was your operating cash flow in the quarter michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer jeff i ll take the first one vince will jump on the second one so operating cash flow was a use of the cash i believe was 66 million used which is less of a use of cash than we had in the first quarter of last year we will have a full cash flows statement released here shortly when our q was filed vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer hi jeff i do want to mention something again we were pleased with the results in the quarter but one of the metrics we were not pleased with was our when we had a little bit of growth in working capital a couple of causation factors there we along with most other companies built a lot of inventory around brexit and now that s been extended out we ll be able to work that down michael mentioned we went we re going live with the new erp system in our refinish business in the us we build inventory ahead of that as a contingency and both the sem acquisition and the recently closed whitford acquisition we obviously have a step up that inventory as part of acquisition accounting until that inventory flows across the sales that s a high level of inventory at a retail price all that being said we ve got to get our working capital down to prior year levels we have the teams in last week talking about that specifically so we re focused on that so again we re better working better cash flow than last year but still more room to go with respect to raw material inflation we don t see any differences really at this point by geography we think it ll be more driven by supply demand as opposed to the things you mentioned the supply demand situation is different in each of the major regions and that s typically especially in a light volume environment that s typically more of a predictor of which way the raw materials may go by region but we haven t seen anything to date michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer and jeff the only thing i d add is latin america south so if you go all the way down southern part that s more us dollar based so the weakness in the currency can have impact so but no real material when you think about our total sales in latin america south that s not a material number so you should not assume that there s a material difference between the regions jeffrey john zekauskas jp morgan analyst okay great thank you so much vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks jeff operator our next question comes from john mcnulty of bmo please go ahead john patrick mcnulty bmo capital markets equity research analyst yeah thanks for taking my question michael you d indicated i believe not only were there are supply disruptions in texas but it looked like there may have been some in china can you articulate what products are affected and what s necessarily disrupting that supply and also the timing on when you think it ll be remedied michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well let s start with the original issue going back a year ago its the blue skies initiative for china in 2018 led to a lot of disruption and we saw coming into 19 that they had delegated from beijing to the provinces the enforcement of environmental actions and so there were much more focus on employment and so supply was much more readily available but once they had the explosion in jiangsu province this has led that province to get much more aggressive on some of the underperformers and so the impact of things that you probably can t see in your numbers but think about the antibacterial products that you might buy to make sure the paint in the cans are healthy that would be one there are some unique epoxies that would be coming out of there that would be another one but overall what we see is that it ll take a little while for them to resource themselves out what we re paying most attention to is what the enforcement levels are going to be post the next quarter two quarter three whether it s just going to be contained in the jiangsu province or whether they re going to get much more aggressive if you will and reinstitute the controls out of beijing that s what we re paying attention to john patrick mcnulty bmo capital markets equity research analyst got it thanks very much for the color vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks john operator our next question comes from stephen byrne of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes thank you we ve seen ppg sales reps in the home depot paint aisle and i just wanted to ask you what s the scale of that initiative and is it getting any traction with respect to either driving more paint in home depot or specifically ppg brands versus behr michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer all major suppliers to all the major home centers have sales reps that are covering the stores dependent upon the agreement with the various vendors you get excess amount of sales rep per excess number of stores so the good news is i think the home depot team has a very solid approach where everybody is focused on the customer and driving conversions in the store and that s the metric that they hold us and our competitors accountable for and i think our teams have been doing a very good job in home depot plus some of our other retail partners as i said in my opening remarks we had positive comps at the other large diy chains which is good but it s we re not doing anything different than what our peers are doing steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst and vince you mentioned that after acquisition pipeline given your commitment in home depot is that pipeline that you re looking at include any potential shelf space expansion within home depot to branch out into different products within the retail diy channel vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would call it acquisition possibility again we work with home depot on what products and what value we can bring to them on a product by product basis so again i wouldn t consider that to be any type of an acquisition relationship steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from mike harrison of seaport global securities please go ahead michael joseph harrison seaport global securities analyst hi good afternoon michael i was wondering if you could comment in a little more detail on the weakness that you saw in the latin america architectural market during the quarter i know you mentioned that the timing of the easter holiday was a factor can you maybe talk about other factors there and whether you ve seen those trends improve michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah the only other fact to that is relevant is really the fact that we have done a lot of value selling up the chain so when we bought comex there s been some additional technology brought in so there s a lot more premium products being sold so the coverage of the premium products is better than what i would call the value product so that leaves to a little bit on a share or obviously not share but volume numbers being negative but when you look at the overall impact to the ebit it s very positive so we actually even though our volume was marginally down we actually had a record quarter for the ppg latin american team and we re anticipating the same overall though the timing of easter there s two major holidays in mexico easter and christmas and christmas doesn t move but easter does and that s the impact so where we kicked off our easter promotions couple of weeks ago and so all that falls in the second quarter instead of the first quarter michael joseph harrison seaport global securities analyst got it and then in the protective and marine business it looks like that marine piece is growing faster than the protective piece wondering if you could just comment specifically on marine and the growth rate that you re seeing in those key markets i feel like you ve said in the past you ve said you have pretty good visibility on what s going on in the marine business so is the strength there going to be sustainable michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah so we started to picking up orders in the second half of 18 they re generally painted ships 12 months to 18 months after the order comes in but this is off a very low base so the marine business is right down 60 from its peak so we re coming off a very low bottom overall the business though is positive both in protective and marine that lead that double digits and we anticipate that trend line continuing michael joseph harrison seaport global securities analyst thank you very much operator our next question comes from dmitry silversteyn of buckingham research please go ahead dmitry silversteyn the buckingham research group analyst good afternoon thanks for taking my call quick question on the sort of the construction market and i know you ve sort of pushed off the question on weather and how big of an impact it had on construction but other companies were not so shy about citing weather as the delaying factor in getting the construction team in north america ramped up have you seen anything improving in terms of margin in first couple of weeks of april here that can give us confidence that market is coming back and whatever built up demand and backlog your contract with customers and stores are experiencing will be fulfilled over the next couple of quarters vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah dmitry this is vince one of the issues we had with the comparison in early april is the easter timing easter fell very early in april last year so really the proxy is diluted in order for us to compare we can get a good to compare by now but it s a bit diluted i would say we re not displeased with what we ve seen in april but it s too early to make a call on whether we re seeing some pickup from march dmitry silversteyn the buckingham research group analyst okay all right that s it thanks for vince second question in the three acquisitions that you ve done that you re carrying into 2019 what kind of revenue contribution should we be thinking about for these businesses are we talking about 1 to 2 incremental growth to your organic growth or is it going to something lower than that john bruno director investor relations dmitry this is john i ll take that so annualized these three acquisitions total about 400 million of annual revenue the majority of that s going to be in industrial coatings whitford and hemmelrath both in the industrial coatings segment in our initial guidance we provided in january we set about 250 million benefit this year that could be here higher because we have been able to complete both acquisitions maybe a little bit faster than we originally thought dmitry silversteyn the buckingham research group analyst okay all right okay that s helpful and then finally on the refinished side of the business and you talked about the overall market being flat a little bit of about 1 decline or so in collision rates in europe and you ask your business was down volume wise you talk about low single digits to let s say 1 to 2 was that in line with sort of what the market declines you saw are you still kind of suffering from being the price leaders and therefore we should see that performance improve as they unfold and you recapture some of this business michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer i think last year we were a skosh below the market 1 maybe but overall when i look at our customer base and what i see in the market and the fact that we re still having a number of shop wins i feel comfortable that we are relatively close to the market dmitry silversteyn the buckingham research group analyst got you okay thank you very much operator our next question comes from laurence alexander of jefferies please go ahead laurence alexander jefferies analyst good afternoon two quick ones then first for the share gains above the markets in the aerospace is your spread against the market getting wider as you look at the wins that you have in the pipeline or should we think that is roughly steady state and secondly on raw materials can you give us a little bit of a longer term kind of perspective on how you re thinking about your raw material chain because several parts of the channels suppliers appear to be talking a lot more than they used to about higher hurdle rates for reinvestment and so are you worried about or are you seeing any slight risk of capacity loss in your raw materials lagging your expectations for demand growth over the next say three five years michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well i m not worried about them investing right now because their incremental margins are very high so if you look at most of our suppliers i won t name names you can do it yourself but they ve had a very good run in the last few years so i m not worried about them from that standpoint i think our short term perspective we said it would be low single digits on the low side of low single digits we still see that we re still holding to that and so i think we re in the right spot laurence vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah and laurence your first question on aerospace again i think what we ve this is an industry that values technology so it really plays into our sweet spot i think we ve been able to work with our customers once they gain share we re gaining more than our share of new products our new entrants into new products that they re putting into the marketplace so that s really where we re winning in aerospace laurence alexander jefferies analyst okay thank you michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from james sheehan of suntrust robinson humphrey please go ahead james michael sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you is it correct to say that the whitford and hemmelrath acquisitions are those businesses are below average ppg margins and if so how long do you think it would take for you to expand those margins to average levels vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer hi james as michael said in his prepared remarks sem is performing at above their segment margins that was a highly creative acquisition for us good array of products very well recognized brand in the marketplace and that s performing above segment whitford and hemmelrath will come in as traditional acquisitions below segment margins it ll take us 12 to 18 months to scale those up as we work through the synergy capture james michael sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst perfect and regarding m a in global coatings how would you characterize deal multiples in the sector do you think they re mostly frothy or are you seeing some reasonable numbers today vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer well jim it really differs based on geography based on markets end markets so it s hard to call singular answer to that question there are certainly things that we looked at and we probably won t act on or didn t act on and there s other things based on synergies and post multiples and we have an interest in so it really just depends it s episodic by what s out there today and again i will just reiterate there s certainly activity in the marketplace michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer and jim the other thing i would add is we bought sem whitford and hemmelrath and each one of them had a different multiple but the way we look at it post synergy what is that multiple look like and they were all in the single digit range so you have to really pass these things into the acquisition what you re paying what you re synergies are what your growth is and so there s a lot of other factors so you just can t look at just the multiple james michael sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you very much operator our next question comes from kevin hocevar of northcoast research please go ahead kevin william hocevar northcoast research partners analyst hi good afternoon everybody vince you mentioned pricing that you realized pricing a little bit quicker than you thought here in the first quarter and you also mentioned that it might not be the high watermark of the year so does that suggest that in the second quarter you ll see a bit of a higher year over year growth rate in pricing and then i think on last quarter s call you mentioned about 2 of the 3 to 5 constant currency sales growth would be from price do you view that as having a little bit of upside based on how the year started vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer well two things we do expect the higher absolute dollar pricing in q2 versus q1 but i ll remind you last year we started to get price throughout the year so again we re stacking on top of a harder comp so the percentage remains would same kevin but on a pure stack dollar basis we definitely expect higher q2 pricing than in the prior year kevin william hocevar northcoast research partners analyst okay got you and then on the you mentioned in the press release ready to take action if need be on the cost savings front is that just simple blocking and tackling in areas where there might be weakness or is there ppg is done 80 million 100 million type cost savings programs a couple of those over last couple of years or is that something bigger like that vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer i think those comments are primarily focused on what you would call traditional blocking and tackling we can t hide from the fact that the economies out there is choppy there s a lot of things that are within our control and if we see something going sideaways or down even in a more draconian way we will take whatever decisive actions we need to take and that could be deeper than both blocking and tackling but i think the mention we had in the prepared remarks was real around blocking and tackling kevin william hocevar northcoast research partners analyst okay thank you very much operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks john bruno director investor relations thank you andrea this

ppg chairman and ceo michael mcgarry michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thank you john and good afternoon everyone today we reported first quarter 2019 financial results for the first quarter our net sales were approximately 3 6 billion and our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continued operations were 1 38 two primary factors that impact our adjusted eps were lower global industrial production and significant foreign currency translation headwinds on a constant currency basis our adjusted eps was modestly higher than the prior year we re in the early stages of a margin recovery and delivered higher year over year operating margins for the first time in two years this achievement is one quarter ahead of our internal target as we ve benefited from continued and further progress in selling price realization and strong cost management during the quarter for the first quarter our net sales in constant currency were flat with the prior year sales volumes were down about 3 impacted by weaker global industrial production most evident in the automotive oem end market and geographically in asia also half of our sales volume decline related to prior year customer assortment changes in our us architectural diy business we will anniversary this assortment change after the second quarter our selling prices were 2 6 higher marking eighth consecutive quarter of higher sequential pricing in addition we passed on modest amount of business this quarter as we prioritize margin recovery finally net sales were negatively impacted by significant unfavorable currency translation of more than 4 or about 160 million we expect unfavorable currency translation to continue into the second quarter and be in the range of 130 million to 150 million looking at some business trends for the first quarter in our performance coatings reporting segment aerospace coatings had its fourth consecutive quarter a double digit percentage sales volume growth led by above industry performance in all major regions in our automotive refinish business we continue to see flat industry demand in developed regions as an example in the us automotive collision claims were down 1 in the quarter our refinish business began the integration of the sem acquisition which is off to a great start and delivering above segment margins and we are beginning the process of expand their geographic commercial scope we were pleased that the architectural coatings emea sales volumes increased for the second consecutive quarter combination of positive sales volumes and higher selling prices supported by mid single digit per percentage net sales growth in the quarter importantly all major sub regions were higher as we discussed in the past this business and this region deliver high incremental margins on increased volumes as we do not need to add any additional cost to support the growth our sales volumes in the mexican ppg comex business were slightly lower year over year driven by the timing of easter holiday promotion which will occur in the second quarter paint sales in latin america are historically higher in the weeks leading up to this holiday we expect stronger sales volumes in the ppg comex business in the second quarter during the quarter we opened 25 new stores in mexico and central america sales volumes in architectural coatings americas and asia pacific decreased due to lower net diy sales of about 60 million stemming from the prior year customer assortment changes we did have positive year over year sales growth at our other two key diy customers for the quarter same store company owned sales growth in the us and canada was up by low single digit percentage impacted by soft market demand for most of the quarter protective marine coatings continued to deliver excellent sales volume growth of more than 10 for the quarter in our industrial coatings reporting segment sales volumes were adversely impacted by our soft industrial activity in most of the major regions of the world automotive bills were significantly lower in china and europe in aggregate our automotive sales volumes were lower by a half or by high single digit percentage consistent with global industry build rates the automotive oem business made good progress in implementing selling price increases realizing sequentially higher price in each major region of the world softer global industrial production activity also impacted our general industrial coatings business most notably in the coil and general finishes segment as expected our packaging coatings sales volumes decreased modestly in comparison to strong above market growth in the prior year driven by customer adoption to our innovel interior can coatings products from an earnings perspective our first quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share of 1 38 was slightly below the prior year quarter our earnings were negatively impacted by about 20 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation as i mentioned earlier excluding this impact our adjusted earnings per diluted share were modestly higher than prior year during the quarter we continue to be impacted by raw material inflation which was nearly all carried forward inflation from 2018 this was our 10th consecutive quarter of raw material inflation in addition we encouraged logistics and wage inflation in the quarter recent increases in crude oil prices and some supply disruptions in china and texas could affect our input costs unfavorably in the next quarter selling price increases 2 6 with comparable contributions from both of our operating business reporting segments in addition we made excellent progress on our business restructuring actions delivering more than 20 million in cost savings during the quarter pacing with our targeted savings our effective tax rate was about 24 in the first quarter which is higher than the 21 rate in the first quarter of 2018 the increase mostly relates to recognize the non recurring favorable discrete items in the prior year first quarter we are still anticipating a full year 2019 tax rate between 23 to 25 as we look ahead we expect global economic activity to remain subdued in the second quarter we anticipate improvement as the year progresses global automotive production is expected to decline in second quarter compared to the second quarter 2018 and general industrial demand is likely to be modest and uneven by end market and region in the second quarter positive developments around regional and country trade disputes could spark a return to higher industrial activity in the second half of 2018 specific to our business we believe that more stable interest rates in the us will help drive modest growth in the us housing market and also favorably impact automotive oem sales for the second quarter we expect us industry automotive bills to be flat our us architectural business sales volumes will be down about 60 million due to unfavorable customer assortment change this will be the final quarter for this impact in latin america we anticipate higher sales volumes from normal seasonal demands in the ppg comex business growth rates in asia are expected to remain soft with some modest improvements compared to the first quarter we expect our sales volumes in the automotive oem business to be stronger in the second half of the year based on recently implemented stimulus and easier comparisons to the prior year overall economic growth in europe is expected to remain weak with no clear catalysts we expect sales volumes in our automotive oem business to be lower than prior year and similar to the first quarter as decreases in industry production bills are expected to continue in the second quarter the delay of brexit would probably continue to lead to higher levels of uncertainty and could impact consumer confidence and overall demand we expect our regional architectural coatings business to produce favorable sales volumes in the second quarter we will continue to manage all elements of our business within our control to ensure that we remain competitive regardless of economic conditions in addition the execution of our restructuring programs will carry on and we expect about 20 million of additional incremental savings to be realized in the second quarter as mentioned in our earnings press release we continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment and we will be prepared to implement further cost reduction actions if necessary we provided eps guidance specific to the second quarter of 2019 this guidance is 1 76 to 1 86 which includes an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 0 05 to 0 07 per share we remain fully committed to delivering on the full year targets we announced in january for 2019 a 3 to 5 sales growth and 7 to 10 of adjusted eps growth both excluding foreign currency translation our focus on cash generation continues in the first quarter our cash flow from operations was a net use of cash this is consistent with our normal seasonal pattern of using cash in the first quarter to prepare for a higher sales activity in the second quarter in addition this year we intentionally built inventories due to our preparation around brexit and anticipation of a second quarter erp conversion in our us automotive refinish business this erp conversion is a last major conversion for all of our us and canadian businesses with all the previous us coatings businesses successfully converting over the past two years in addition the recent sem and whitford acquisition added to our working capital our goal for full year remains to reduce working capital as a percentage of sales compared to 2018 we completed the whitford acquisition in the first quarter and just recently announced the completion of the hemmelrath acquisition the three recently announced and completed acquisitions including sem will add about 400 million in annualized revenue provided with a broader range of products and technology to grow our business accretive earnings acquisitions continue to be our cash deployment preference and our acquisition pipeline remains active in addition to acquisitions we continue to invest organically in our business capital expenditure is expected to be about 3 of sales in 2019 and we continue to invest in research and development at similar levels as we have done historically we ended the first quarter with more than 800 million of cash and short term investments and we continue to have significant financial flexibility finally as i stated at our annual meeting this morning in our 135th year of business ppg 47 000 employees around the world focus on strengthening our position as the world s leading paint

questions questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question will come from kevin mccarthy of vertical research partners please go ahead kevin william mccarthy vertical research partners analyst yes good morning michael i was wondering if you could expand upon your outlook for china in the release you indicated that you are cautiously optimistic and expect a better back half of the year just wondering how much of that is predicated on a trade deal or are you starting to see stimulus related benefits any color there would be helpful michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer kevin as you know the 13th national people s conference took place in the first quarter the vat for coatings was dropped from 16 to 13 the vat for cars was dropped from 10 to 9 the social insurance contributions were reduced so there s a lot of what i would say i don t know total stimulus is the right word but there s a lot of influence in the marketplace to lead to better performance as you now we do see automotive numbers in real time and so we re optimistic that the second half of the year is going to be better than the first half and we do have insight into like i said previously 90 days we have a fair amount of confidence 60 days 30 days we have high confidence so we re starting to see the early signs of that kevin william mccarthy vertical research partners analyst okay that s helpful and then state side what is your outlook for us architectural and perhaps you could touch on the subjects of whether weather was an impact at all in your first quarter and what you re seeing in terms of the macro indicators for architectural coatings demand in the us michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well ok no as you know reported the last january and february around but as we always tell our operating teams we have to be able to function because somewhere else in the world you get good weather always have a different put and take on that so we re not going to point to that we do see our customers have good backlogs we do have a slightly different mix and maybe some of our competitors as far as our stores but overall we still think this is a very good market and we re anticipating favorable comps going forward kevin william mccarthy vertical research partners analyst thanks very much operator our next question comes from michael sison of keybanc please go ahead michael joseph sison keybanc capital markets inc analyst hi guys nice quarter michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thanks mike michael joseph sison keybanc capital markets inc analyst in terms of the second half of the year you talked about maintaining your outlook for sales growth ex currency so can you maybe walk us through by some of the sub businesses what type of growth you re going to see in the second half to sort of hit that full year number michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well mike if you look at the various pieces let s start with aerospace we re going to continue to see very very good growth in that business the underlying trends are very nice so whether it s the build rates whether it s the military however you want to frame it in aerospace is going to have a very solid quarter and back half of the year refinish we had a lighter comp numbers in the third and fourth quarter of last year so we re going to be comping against a little bit easier pmc as you saw in the first quarter up double digits we continue to see a recovery in that segment marine bouncing off the bottom strong protective sales in that segment so i would tell you that we have a lot of confidence in that and probably the most encouraging one is architectural europe we tried to kind of lead you to this conclusion in prior calls we were the first ones to raise price in europe we raised it significantly so last year we were given up share preferentially to get prices up now our competitors are out they are raising price so that business that it s historically been ours it s been flowing back to us we had a very good quarter in the first quarter we anticipate that trend line continuing the second quarter as well as the back half of the year comex and our team is just doing a phenomenal job in mexico central america so i would tell you that that s we re getting price there we re having customers trade up ever since we found comex we ve brought higher value added products in there that s been a positive automotive oem is a little bit of a wildcard we see the us is relatively stable 16 7 16 8 ph somewhere in that range europe kind of ticking down marginally but eventually they re going to have all these diesel things behind them and it s a solid market so we anticipate a better second half of the year and then when you think about asia similar what i said earlier we have very soft comps to compare again third and fourth quarters so that will be better general industrial more the same we see the stimulus having a little more positive impact so i think there s a lot of things we would point to that gives us this confidence michael joseph sison keybanc capital markets inc analyst great and then just a quick follow up on 2q earnings outlook the year over year decline eps is larger than basically flattish in the first quarter so are some of the headwinds more daunting in 2q than they were in 1q because it seems like maybe it should be less but i m just curious on your thoughts there vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer hi michael this is vince just a couple key items to put forward one the customer assortment change that michael talked about earlier that actually was announced last year march 1 once that was announced in 2018 we took out most of the support costs before we got to q2 while we had a full sell in q2 we would take our pay with that customer in q2 so they took a full allotment without the support costs so that assortment is a bit more penal in 2019 we did have obviously a strong automotive market last year in q2 we didn t see erosion in the auto market until q3 q2 is typically a higher seasonal quarter so bigger impact than q1 and then finally in q2 last year if you look at our corporate line we started to make adjustments to our incentive compensation on our corporate line i think our corporate line was in the mid 20s 20 million range last year and we gave a lot projection in the release it ll be almost double that in q2 of this year so those are three of the primary factors that put this a little bit different in q1 michael joseph sison keybanc capital markets inc analyst okay great thank you michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thanks mike operator our next question comes from ghansham panjabi of robert w baird please go ahead ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst thank you good afternoon everyone michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer good afternoon ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst i guess first off on auto refinish in europe and some of the weakness you called out michael in your prepared comments on i know you touched on a pre buy in europe the benefit of 4q but how would you characterize overall market conditions in the region specific to auto refinish michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer i mean the market over there is not that much different in the us you have a slightly softer less collisions down 1 or 2 slightly more totals but overall we re still gaining the shops over there so that s the positive prices we ve been able to successfully raise price over there so i don t see the trends in europe any different than i do anywhere else now obviously sequentially second quarter will be better than first quarter for refinish europe because of the timing of the price increase but i m not concerned at all about our refinish sales volumes ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst okay and then just sticking with europe and architectural emea last couple of quarters have been positive they are smaller quarters on a relative basis i know you mentioned the pricing dynamics and sounds like just some reversion from a market regained perspective but taken that in context with what you said michael in terms of just european macro and brexit what do you think though was reasonable to expect for the market itself to grow in 2019 there kevin william mccarthy vertical research partners analyst well we still have the same kind of perspective is that it s going to be a low growth market let s call it 0 to 2 but i think what we re mostly excited about is the share that s flowing back to us and i think the fact that we do see a number of countries especially eastern europe which we always view as a good sign when eastern europe is doing well that s a very good market for us they re having some strong numbers and probably a little bit of a surprise to us is uk and ireland they ve outperformed our expectations we thought with brexit it would be a much slower market but surprisingly we continued to grow nicely in that market ghansham panjabi robert w baird analyst terrific thank you so much operator our next question comes from john roberts of ubs please go ahead john ezekiel e roberts ubs investment bank analyst thanks first a short one and then i have a question on raw materials but do you think you ll have the portfolio reviewed by the outside consultants done in time for your investor day in early june or do you think it s going to take until the end of the quarter vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer john we re looking to test something by the end of the quarter john ezekiel e roberts ubs investment bank analyst okay and then is the potential raw material disruption in texas related to the tank farm fire that occurred in the shipping terminals or is it something else and how do we think about the volatility in oil prices some of your raw materials like solvents follow oil quickly some are lot more slowly so they probably didn t change much in the quarter and then customers often look at oil as kind of a leading indicator of price i don t know if you had maybe more push back on price early in the quarter and now you might have some tailwind here with the oil coming back up michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah john the fire in texas didn t impact anything we buy but what it does impacted the access to the other products are in that terminal so that s been the challenge so we regard that as a one quarter disruption as far as oil remember we have a i always like to say we have like nine different buckets of raw materials you got half of them up and half of them down one of them flat oil will impact solvents but most of our other raw materials are impacted by supplying and demand of the derivatives so obviously we re encouraged to see that propylene remains weak ethylene is we view ethylene as a long term oversupplied market which will help us so i would tell you that we still remain firm on our raw material projection which is low single digit and that the back half of the year comps will be much easier on raw materials john ezekiel e roberts ubs investment bank analyst thank you operator our next question comes from david begleiter of deutsche bank please go ahead david l begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you michael just on raws again really tio2 do you expect to see higher tio2 prices in 2019 versus last year michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer so david our response is the same one we gave in the fourth quarter that we don t think we need to be talking about tio2 this year you had some pluses and minuses but overall it s a non event in our market basket so that would be the way we would describe that david l begleiter deutsche bank analyst understood and just on auto oem michael very good job on pricing but obviously weak volumes are the weak volumes is jeopardizing at all your price initiatives your price traction in oem michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer david i don t think so i m viewing this the same way we saw with architecture we were the first ones out with price where the most aggressive in trying to hold our customers accountable for us to recover our margins we provide a lot of value to our customers lot of new technology and obviously we re getting price across the world in that so when our competitors are getting as aggressive as we are if they do that then we would expect to see some of that volume flow back right now it s more important for us to get priced and that s our number one objective vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer and david it s vince i think our customers clearly understand that for calendar year 17 and calendar year 18 we got little to no price so we re still well in rears in terms of value capture for what we deliver to them david l begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you very much operator our next question comes from bob koort of goldman sachs please go ahead christopher mark evans goldman sachs group inc analyst good afternoon guys chris evans on for bob so on pricing eight quarters in a row of improvements recognizing your industrial coatings margins are still pretty depressed how much more price is needed there to recover the lost profitability and then way more specifically does the consolidated 1q pricing you printed this quarter represent a high watermark for the year as comps get harder throughout vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah chris this is vince i ll take the second part of your question we re still on pricing in q2 we re still doing surgical and targeted pricing and then not only in the industrial segment but in other businesses so i would definitely not consider that high watermark and i think you alluded to it properly we re starting the stack price on top of price we still got some need to recover in certain businesses or regions and we re going continue to push to try to fully recover this over the course or balance of this year john bruno director investor relations hi chris this is john maybe on your cumulative question if you look at the past 10 quarters raws are up accumulative amount of low single digits and pricing is maybe up 3 look more than 3 we think we say we need to get half of the raw material inflation to be even so that s the delta we re looking at christopher mark evans goldman sachs group inc analyst very helpful and then just sort of stacking that on top of the raw material commentary you put up a pretty good the best margin performance year over year in quite a while so how does the cadence of your margin sort of trend as the comps in your raw material basket gets lighter and you continue to push price michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well i think the way i would answer that chris is that vince said that we re all recognizing that when you compare margins of 17 and 18 they are below our 16 levels we need to get back to those levels the sales teams are well aware of the gap that still exists and the marching orders have not changed so we re going to continue to work hard to capture that gap our customers know the gap still exists and it s up to us to get the additional price but also provide additional value to our customers so it s a win win christopher mark evans goldman sachs group inc analyst very clear thank you michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thanks chris operator our next question comes from christopher parkinson of credit suisse please go ahead christopher s parkinson credit suisse analyst great thank you very much so it appears you guys were successful in getting regional oem pricing all synchronized positively which i m sure your team is pleased with can you just comment on whether or not this is simply a functionality of just prior price initiatives and obviously your team have been fighting for a while or any additional pricing actions and for 1q so just basically asking on what assurances the investment community has that the trend is sustainable moving forward thank you vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah chris vince for us when we worked extremely diligently the past 12 to 18 months to secure the pricing that you re seeing here in q1 we fully expect that the carry forward for the balance of the year and again we do have additional targeted pricing coming in not only in auto oem and but other businesses so again our emphasis is to recover our margins fully but to michael s point we ve got to make sure we re demonstrating to our customers the value we bring christopher s parkinson credit suisse analyst got it and then also just on the capital allocation front given your stocks that you had a bit of a run here and where you see leverage just how are you assessing share repurchases on a go forward basis versus mid and potentially large size m a thank you vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah we said coming into the year it s pretty active acquisition pipeline and our preference right now remains to vet those acquisitions before we make any considerable decisions regarding share repo but our active pipeline will keep us busy for a little bit of time and we ll determine whether those are value creating or not or whether we re considering them for our portfolio if that doesn t work we will reassess how we re going to deploy our cash christopher s parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you very much vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks chris operator our next question comes from p j juvekar of citi please go ahead p j juvekar citigroup inc analyst yeah hi good morning michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer hi juv p j juvekar citigroup inc analyst michael the china stimulus automotive stimulus went into effect i think on april 1 is that why you feel more positive on second half and i think a lot of companies are talking about second half recovery i mean do you see any momentum in second half second quarter now that you think could last into second half michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer p j we do see how our customers are pre planning and so we have insight into that so that s one item that gives us a little more confidence clearly we see the current production levels that we see in april but that s 15 days remember china s had if i remember right nine or 10 consecutive monthly decline 10 monthly declines in a row so i m not going to jump out in front of this right now let s wait until we see how the actual numbers turn out p j juvekar citigroup inc analyst okay and then on architectural business it seems like your store business is growing at or better than the market so i guess my question is why not accelerate these store growth by opening more stores because the national retail stores and independent stores seem to be lagging here so why not grow your own store ways thank you vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah p j vince i don t know that we re growing better than the market we didn t say that we do have definitional differences with some of our competitors we include industrial coatings in our industrial segment other folks include those differently and our industrial business was as michael mentioned lighter this quarter in q1 so again i would not say we re outpacing the market for those for us we go to market with a multi channel approach we ve always done that we do well certainly with the home depot and other major merchandisers our dealer channel albeit a lower growth channel is a good channel for us with a low cost to serve and we certainly support our trade network as much as possible and we re doing selective additions we re doing selective pruning in all those channels p j juvekar citigroup inc analyst thank you michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thanks p j vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks p j operator our next question comes from frank mitsch of fermium research please go ahead frank joseph mitsch fermium research analyst yes hi good afternoon this is le veon bell sitting in for frank michael on a difficult macroenvironment in the first quarter here you re able to post a nice result especially relative to the guidance that you guys had issued so i m just curious as to what were the key factors for ppg to be able to outperform those expectations vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer hi frank this is vince a couple things that differed from the beginning of the year one we certainly secured pricing at a level that we had as hoped a little bit better than that the second issue as we were very aggressive on our cost management given the uncertainty in the economic backdrop and we also seen currency come in a little better than we anticipated at the beginning of the year but still negative year over year so those are the three primary factors that deviate favorably from our guidance frank joseph mitsch fermium research analyst all right so we might want to inaudible dial in all three of those factors in for q2 relative to the 176 186 ph just kidding vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yes frank joseph mitsch fermium research analyst on the restructuring side you posted you said 20 million or i think better than 20 million in savings during q1 and you said that you d get that again into 2q release i think you said that where do you stand on 2019 i think i heard you guys talk about 80 million savings in 2018 and around 70 million in 2019 what sort of expectations should we expect out of being the cost cutting actions that you guys have under way john bruno director investor relations yeah frank this is john so our number one priority is to complete the restructuring initiatives we ve identified that those alone will probably get us close to 70 million and we have additional initiatives that are not necessarily restructuring that our other cost areas throughout the business throughout the world that will get us to 80 million so we still feel very comfortable with that number frank joseph mitsch fermium research analyst thank you so much michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thanks le veon ph operator our next question comes from don carson of susquehanna financial group please go ahead donald david carson susquehanna financial group analyst yes thank you question couple of questions on architectural you mentioned that obviously you lapped the lowe s loss in q3 but how about your home depot business in some of the new brands you have there what kind of your year over year growth can we expect as we get into the second half of the year and then on emea can you remind us where you are in terms of volumes relative to your 2007 peak and what we should think of as incremental margins in that business as you load more volume michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah so don i ll take the first half and i ll let vince take the second half we started shipping home depot early may so we ll have three months of home depot versus two months in the second quarter obviously there was a lot of confusion in the marketplace olympic was at both lowe sand home depot this year it s only at home depot so there ll still be some people look at around to make sure they find the world s greatest paint olympic but i would envision that we will continue to have positive comps won t speculate about how much because i think that s home depot s business but the relationship is very good they re the best retailer in that space and we re very privileged to be a partner with home depot so maybe vince you want to tackle that again vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah in terms of your question don around where we are versus the 2007 peak we were down still almost 20 in volume for the whole architectural europe region so we still have not seen this is really the first signs of recovery where we ve seen since the recession in our volumes that s a holistic comment we ve certainly seen differences by countries as michael mentioned the uk has been a good country for us for the past couple of years but we ve seen other markets that have continued to wane but holistically we re down just under 20 cumulative since 2007 we are recording very high incremental margins as michael mentioned in his prepared remarks these are coming in somewhere in the vicinity of 35 to 40 so that volume is extremely lucrative to us when it does occur donald david carson susquehanna financial group analyst thank you vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from arun viswanathan of rbc capital markets please go ahead arun shankar viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst hi guys good afternoon just a quick question for you guys on the margin so obviously a little bit better than what we had thought how would you characterize them versus your own expectations and you mentioned three things as far as slightly better fx price and cost could you kind of bucket that out for us on q1 and how those three would potentially progress through the year michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well i think arun the cost management something where you were watching our order book every day where we re taking necessary actions business by business region by region based on the order book and q1 was very choppy in terms of the macro so some of our businesses took immediate and swift action to minimize any cost if we see the volume come back i think we ll have one more traditional cost structure from pricing perspective the only way they will get price a little earlier than we anticipated we thought some of this will drag on into q2 but the level of pricing that we achieved is what we are targeting we just add a little earlier than what we anticipated in our guidance with respect to currency i ll let you guys you guys are the experts on currency we just make paint we don t predict the currency markets so i ll let you guys opine on that arun shankar viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks and as a follow up your discussions are margin recovery i mean you guys have targets as to where you want to get back to as far as percent margins if i went back to the 08 to 2010 period it looks like they suffered by 500 basis points and they actually recovered within a year or two is it fair to assume that something like that could happen in industrial because we ve seen that kind of deterioration over the last couple of years thanks michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah just generically speaking we re targeting 2016 as a marker there s a lot happened in the world from 16 to 19 so it s not going to be a straight linear comparison but 2016 is a point in time where we re using as a marker from our margin perspective we have work to do as you pointed out we were targeting to get margin parity by the middle of the year we re glad to get there in q1 and then we re open to improve on our margins year over year in the back half of the year arun shankar viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst and lastly on that point would you need incremental volume growth to get back to full parity or continue with that trend or could you potentially continue to see margin recovery even in a kind of sluggish volume environment thanks michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well there s two sides of that equation we certainly welcome volume that makes the story a lot easier in a nations volume environment we would expect supply demand to work in our favor on the raw material side arun shankar viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst thanks michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from steven haynes of morgan stanley please go ahead steven bryson haynes morgan stanley analyst hi guys thanks for taking my question i just want to quickly clarify so you re talking margin recovery came in ahead in 1q 19 and you re commenting that it will be up in 2q 19 as are in the second half of 19 can you just comment on whether or not the first quarter was an inflection for margins and how we should be thinking about that for 2q vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer okay this is vince again just to reiterate i think we were anticipating getting the margin parity in the first half of the year so by the end of the second quarter again got there a little earlier let s be clear we re still several hundred basis points below our targets so we still have a lot of recovery under way and we re going to start working our way back there for the balance of this year steven bryson haynes morgan stanley analyst and then if i just get a quick follow up too so the press release talked about you guys passing on some business could you just maybe talk about a little bit about what categories you are foregoing business in michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well automotive is clearly one industrial is another so those are the two biggest areas and china and asia in general what we ve said is getting price in china is not easy you have to do it a lot of times by backing up your request for price by saying that you won t meet the meeting the need that we have we re happy if you take your business somewhere else and then they get service at a i would say at a lower level then they re happy to come back and pay the higher price and or if they re missing the technology which is generally the biggest thing they miss so they come back to us and say we really need that better technology whether it s a waterborne whether it s the products that help their productivity in their plants so whatever it is that generally is important because once it s showing up in their manufacturing line and once they re manufacturing people have to account for it that s when the purchasing people have less power steven bryson haynes morgan stanley analyst thank you operator our next question comes from patrick fischer of barclays please go ahead michael leithead barclays analyst hi guys this isn t patrick this is mike leithead on for duffy i guess circling back to volumes volumes seems have decelerated the last three quarters even if we exclude some of the customer assortment changes can you maybe just talk about how we should think about volume trending into 2q in the back half and then maybe i was hoping you d quantify how much volume or the volume impact from the businesses you passed on in the quarter michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer so i think i ll pass on saying how much we pass on i think that varies by business and it varies by region but what i will tell you is that in the second quarter we re still anticipating a little bit softer on the volumes but when you look at the third and fourth quarter you re seeing as comping against a different environment from the third fourth quarter of 18 plus we see the stimulus impact going to be a positive we see us continued to be a good market mexico continued to be a good market and some slight recovery in architectural business in europe so i think there s enough things out there that give us good confidence level that our predictions are going to be relatively accurate vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer and mike i would to like add i think the volume erosion if you look over the past four quarters or three quarters as you mentioned has really come in the industrial segment and that segment has been producing 3 4 volume growth up until really the third quarter last year and everything we ve seen in that particular segments really been macro driven obviously with china auto coming off european auto coming off the halo effect of that around the general industrial businesses that get affected by our tier 1 tier 2 suppliers so that s all macro and again we re in anniversary some of that as we go into the back half of the year here michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer and mike just to put that in perspective we had 13 quarters in a row of positive volume in our industrial coatings business so not kind of i don t like this quarter but we re still looking at our sales teams doing a very good job on the marketplace michael leithead barclays analyst got it that s helpful and then if i could drill into aerospace strong solid green and when i look at your slide and above market growth in every region i was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit more about what s driving that growth whether it s product mix or new share gains or other factors that are driving the above market growth there michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well it s actually a factor of everything our sealants business continues to gain share our coatings business continues to gain share and certainly our transparencies business has done a phenomenal job of winning new programs left and right so everyone of those is a positive you have commercial areas commercial is doing very well military is doing very well and the only semisoft would be the general aviation but our biggest customer who is very large in that generally aviation market is winning share so we re also affiliated with the right customers so we did factor into our second quarter guidance some of the most recent commentary from one of the larger oem plane makers but overall we re going to have a very solid second quarter and a record full year in aerospace michael leithead barclays analyst great thanks guys michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thanks mike operator our next question comes from gary shmois of longbow please go ahead garik simha shmois longbow research analyst thanks that margins have recovered year over year and pricing is like set now on pace wondering if there s any lessons over the last couple of years that you could take forward if inflation does again start to ramp so that you can offset inflation maybe faster than expected vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer well i ll let mike answer the question but i want to make sure where our sales people on the phone our margins are not recovered so it will be very clear on that we have still room to go go ahead michael michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah so clearly as i try to explain the last time there were two events that clearly impacted the rates of initial early recovery and the first one is our friends in cleveland valspar i think the valspar team without speaking for one of my peers they were a little slow off the block that was a challenge we were trying to buy our friends in the netherlands at that time they mainly went into a mode of saying they were going to grow 4 volume and that doesn t work in an environment where raw materials are going up you need to be focused on getting prices up so the competitive environment is a challenge at that point so clearly a couple of us got off a dime and we re moving quicker than the others now every not everybody the most everybody is on looking at their margins and getting a lot of pressure from their shareholders and they re trying to recover margins so i think that s one lesson learned and maybe the other lesson learned is we need to stick to it and where we should have walked away from some volumes a little bit earlier and so maybe that s the lesson learned garik simha shmois longbow research analyst thanks for the color follow up question on inaudible just going down i think 10 million from 55 million to 60 million previously now to 45 million to 50 million is that part of the cost savings program or is there something else going on john bruno director investor relations gary that s our normal seasonal trend our corporate costs are historically higher the first quarter for some different reasons and then the second through fourth quarter normally are at a lower level but similar garik simha shmois longbow research analyst helpful thank you john bruno director investor relations thank you operator our next question comes from jeff zekauskas of j p morgan please go ahead jeffrey john zekauskas jp morgan analyst thanks very much nippon paint seems to agreed to buy dulux in australia was that property that you were interested in and you didn t want to pay as much as they paid or was that just not a property that interest interested you do at all michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer jeff this is michael what we always tell everybody is on every acquisition in the coatings paints and specialty products space that we have we re always interested in looking at everything and just because we don t get something doesn t mean that we aren t interested but what i will tell you is that if we were always winning then people would be concerned but at the same time every company makes their own decisions about what is the right price to pay and how does that impact their shareholders and so i would say different people have different answers for the exact same acquisition so all i will tell you is that we try to be active we try to look at everything but for ppg right now we re very comfortable where we are john bruno director investor relations yeah jeff and i ll just add that i think you know this of course but we have a very good architectural business in australia and a growing business there so we are on the continent michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer and we re number two on the continent jeffrey john zekauskas jp morgan analyst okay can you talk about what your operating cash flow was in the quarter and are you having a very different experience in your raw materials price changes in the united states versus your raw material price changes in the offshore markets and that it seems that propylene is pretty weak in the us but the oil price is really lifted in the offshore markets so are we seeing inflation in the offshore markets and deflation in the domestic markets and again what was your operating cash flow in the quarter michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer jeff i ll take the first one vince will jump on the second one so operating cash flow was a use of the cash i believe was 66 million used which is less of a use of cash than we had in the first quarter of last year we will have a full cash flows statement released here shortly when our q was filed vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer hi jeff i do want to mention something again we were pleased with the results in the quarter but one of the metrics we were not pleased with was our when we had a little bit of growth in working capital a couple of causation factors there we along with most other companies built a lot of inventory around brexit and now that s been extended out we ll be able to work that down michael mentioned we went we re going live with the new erp system in our refinish business in the us we build inventory ahead of that as a contingency and both the sem acquisition and the recently closed whitford acquisition we obviously have a step up that inventory as part of acquisition accounting until that inventory flows across the sales that s a high level of inventory at a retail price all that being said we ve got to get our working capital down to prior year levels we have the teams in last week talking about that specifically so we re focused on that so again we re better working better cash flow than last year but still more room to go with respect to raw material inflation we don t see any differences really at this point by geography we think it ll be more driven by supply demand as opposed to the things you mentioned the supply demand situation is different in each of the major regions and that s typically especially in a light volume environment that s typically more of a predictor of which way the raw materials may go by region but we haven t seen anything to date michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer and jeff the only thing i d add is latin america south so if you go all the way down southern part that s more us dollar based so the weakness in the currency can have impact so but no real material when you think about our total sales in latin america south that s not a material number so you should not assume that there s a material difference between the regions jeffrey john zekauskas jp morgan analyst okay great thank you so much vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks jeff operator our next question comes from john mcnulty of bmo please go ahead john patrick mcnulty bmo capital markets equity research analyst yeah thanks for taking my question michael you d indicated i believe not only were there are supply disruptions in texas but it looked like there may have been some in china can you articulate what products are affected and what s necessarily disrupting that supply and also the timing on when you think it ll be remedied michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well let s start with the original issue going back a year ago its the blue skies initiative for china in 2018 led to a lot of disruption and we saw coming into 19 that they had delegated from beijing to the provinces the enforcement of environmental actions and so there were much more focus on employment and so supply was much more readily available but once they had the explosion in jiangsu province this has led that province to get much more aggressive on some of the underperformers and so the impact of things that you probably can t see in your numbers but think about the antibacterial products that you might buy to make sure the paint in the cans are healthy that would be one there are some unique epoxies that would be coming out of there that would be another one but overall what we see is that it ll take a little while for them to resource themselves out what we re paying most attention to is what the enforcement levels are going to be post the next quarter two quarter three whether it s just going to be contained in the jiangsu province or whether they re going to get much more aggressive if you will and reinstitute the controls out of beijing that s what we re paying attention to john patrick mcnulty bmo capital markets equity research analyst got it thanks very much for the color vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks john operator our next question comes from stephen byrne of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes thank you we ve seen ppg sales reps in the home depot paint aisle and i just wanted to ask you what s the scale of that initiative and is it getting any traction with respect to either driving more paint in home depot or specifically ppg brands versus behr michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer all major suppliers to all the major home centers have sales reps that are covering the stores dependent upon the agreement with the various vendors you get excess amount of sales rep per excess number of stores so the good news is i think the home depot team has a very solid approach where everybody is focused on the customer and driving conversions in the store and that s the metric that they hold us and our competitors accountable for and i think our teams have been doing a very good job in home depot plus some of our other retail partners as i said in my opening remarks we had positive comps at the other large diy chains which is good but it s we re not doing anything different than what our peers are doing steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst and vince you mentioned that after acquisition pipeline given your commitment in home depot is that pipeline that you re looking at include any potential shelf space expansion within home depot to branch out into different products within the retail diy channel vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would call it acquisition possibility again we work with home depot on what products and what value we can bring to them on a product by product basis so again i wouldn t consider that to be any type of an acquisition relationship steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from mike harrison of seaport global securities please go ahead michael joseph harrison seaport global securities analyst hi good afternoon michael i was wondering if you could comment in a little more detail on the weakness that you saw in the latin america architectural market during the quarter i know you mentioned that the timing of the easter holiday was a factor can you maybe talk about other factors there and whether you ve seen those trends improve michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah the only other fact to that is relevant is really the fact that we have done a lot of value selling up the chain so when we bought comex there s been some additional technology brought in so there s a lot more premium products being sold so the coverage of the premium products is better than what i would call the value product so that leaves to a little bit on a share or obviously not share but volume numbers being negative but when you look at the overall impact to the ebit it s very positive so we actually even though our volume was marginally down we actually had a record quarter for the ppg latin american team and we re anticipating the same overall though the timing of easter there s two major holidays in mexico easter and christmas and christmas doesn t move but easter does and that s the impact so where we kicked off our easter promotions couple of weeks ago and so all that falls in the second quarter instead of the first quarter michael joseph harrison seaport global securities analyst got it and then in the protective and marine business it looks like that marine piece is growing faster than the protective piece wondering if you could just comment specifically on marine and the growth rate that you re seeing in those key markets i feel like you ve said in the past you ve said you have pretty good visibility on what s going on in the marine business so is the strength there going to be sustainable michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer yeah so we started to picking up orders in the second half of 18 they re generally painted ships 12 months to 18 months after the order comes in but this is off a very low base so the marine business is right down 60 from its peak so we re coming off a very low bottom overall the business though is positive both in protective and marine that lead that double digits and we anticipate that trend line continuing michael joseph harrison seaport global securities analyst thank you very much operator our next question comes from dmitry silversteyn of buckingham research please go ahead dmitry silversteyn the buckingham research group analyst good afternoon thanks for taking my call quick question on the sort of the construction market and i know you ve sort of pushed off the question on weather and how big of an impact it had on construction but other companies were not so shy about citing weather as the delaying factor in getting the construction team in north america ramped up have you seen anything improving in terms of margin in first couple of weeks of april here that can give us confidence that market is coming back and whatever built up demand and backlog your contract with customers and stores are experiencing will be fulfilled over the next couple of quarters vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah dmitry this is vince one of the issues we had with the comparison in early april is the easter timing easter fell very early in april last year so really the proxy is diluted in order for us to compare we can get a good to compare by now but it s a bit diluted i would say we re not displeased with what we ve seen in april but it s too early to make a call on whether we re seeing some pickup from march dmitry silversteyn the buckingham research group analyst okay all right that s it thanks for vince second question in the three acquisitions that you ve done that you re carrying into 2019 what kind of revenue contribution should we be thinking about for these businesses are we talking about 1 to 2 incremental growth to your organic growth or is it going to something lower than that john bruno director investor relations dmitry this is john i ll take that so annualized these three acquisitions total about 400 million of annual revenue the majority of that s going to be in industrial coatings whitford and hemmelrath both in the industrial coatings segment in our initial guidance we provided in january we set about 250 million benefit this year that could be here higher because we have been able to complete both acquisitions maybe a little bit faster than we originally thought dmitry silversteyn the buckingham research group analyst okay all right okay that s helpful and then finally on the refinished side of the business and you talked about the overall market being flat a little bit of about 1 decline or so in collision rates in europe and you ask your business was down volume wise you talk about low single digits to let s say 1 to 2 was that in line with sort of what the market declines you saw are you still kind of suffering from being the price leaders and therefore we should see that performance improve as they unfold and you recapture some of this business michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer i think last year we were a skosh below the market 1 maybe but overall when i look at our customer base and what i see in the market and the fact that we re still having a number of shop wins i feel comfortable that we are relatively close to the market dmitry silversteyn the buckingham research group analyst got you okay thank you very much operator our next question comes from laurence alexander of jefferies please go ahead laurence alexander jefferies analyst good afternoon two quick ones then first for the share gains above the markets in the aerospace is your spread against the market getting wider as you look at the wins that you have in the pipeline or should we think that is roughly steady state and secondly on raw materials can you give us a little bit of a longer term kind of perspective on how you re thinking about your raw material chain because several parts of the channels suppliers appear to be talking a lot more than they used to about higher hurdle rates for reinvestment and so are you worried about or are you seeing any slight risk of capacity loss in your raw materials lagging your expectations for demand growth over the next say three five years michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer well i m not worried about them investing right now because their incremental margins are very high so if you look at most of our suppliers i won t name names you can do it yourself but they ve had a very good run in the last few years so i m not worried about them from that standpoint i think our short term perspective we said it would be low single digits on the low side of low single digits we still see that we re still holding to that and so i think we re in the right spot laurence vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah and laurence your first question on aerospace again i think what we ve this is an industry that values technology so it really plays into our sweet spot i think we ve been able to work with our customers once they gain share we re gaining more than our share of new products our new entrants into new products that they re putting into the marketplace so that s really where we re winning in aerospace laurence alexander jefferies analyst okay thank you michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from james sheehan of suntrust robinson humphrey please go ahead james michael sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you is it correct to say that the whitford and hemmelrath acquisitions are those businesses are below average ppg margins and if so how long do you think it would take for you to expand those margins to average levels vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer hi james as michael said in his prepared remarks sem is performing at above their segment margins that was a highly creative acquisition for us good array of products very well recognized brand in the marketplace and that s performing above segment whitford and hemmelrath will come in as traditional acquisitions below segment margins it ll take us 12 to 18 months to scale those up as we work through the synergy capture james michael sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst perfect and regarding m a in global coatings how would you characterize deal multiples in the sector do you think they re mostly frothy or are you seeing some reasonable numbers today vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer well jim it really differs based on geography based on markets end markets so it s hard to call singular answer to that question there are certainly things that we looked at and we probably won t act on or didn t act on and there s other things based on synergies and post multiples and we have an interest in so it really just depends it s episodic by what s out there today and again i will just reiterate there s certainly activity in the marketplace michael h mcgarry chairman and chief executive officer and jim the other thing i would add is we bought sem whitford and hemmelrath and each one of them had a different multiple but the way we look at it post synergy what is that multiple look like and they were all in the single digit range so you have to really pass these things into the acquisition what you re paying what you re synergies are what your growth is and so there s a lot of other factors so you just can t look at just the multiple james michael sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you very much operator our next question comes from kevin hocevar of northcoast research please go ahead kevin william hocevar northcoast research partners analyst hi good afternoon everybody vince you mentioned pricing that you realized pricing a little bit quicker than you thought here in the first quarter and you also mentioned that it might not be the high watermark of the year so does that suggest that in the second quarter you ll see a bit of a higher year over year growth rate in pricing and then i think on last quarter s call you mentioned about 2 of the 3 to 5 constant currency sales growth would be from price do you view that as having a little bit of upside based on how the year started vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer well two things we do expect the higher absolute dollar pricing in q2 versus q1 but i ll remind you last year we started to get price throughout the year so again we re stacking on top of a harder comp so the percentage remains would same kevin but on a pure stack dollar basis we definitely expect higher q2 pricing than in the prior year kevin william hocevar northcoast research partners analyst okay got you and then on the you mentioned in the press release ready to take action if need be on the cost savings front is that just simple blocking and tackling in areas where there might be weakness or is there ppg is done 80 million 100 million type cost savings programs a couple of those over last couple of years or is that something bigger like that vincent j morales senior vice president and chief financial officer i think those comments are primarily focused on what you would call traditional blocking and tackling we can t hide from the fact that the economies out there is choppy there s a lot of things that are within our control and if we see something going sideaways or down even in a more draconian way we will take whatever decisive actions we need to take and that could be deeper than both blocking and tackling but i think the mention we had in the prepared remarks was real around blocking and tackling kevin william hocevar northcoast research partners analyst okay thank you very much operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks john bruno director investor relations thank you andrea this is john bruno again i d like to thank everyone for their time and interest in ppg if you have any further questions please contact our investor relations department this concludes our first quarter

overview many financial centers are closed today these include australia india most european markets and the us in asia equity markets that were open moved higher the nikkei which gapped higher on monday rose 0 5 today for a 1 5 gain on the week china s shanghai composite rose 0 6 lifting the weekly increase to 2 6 the us dollar is confined to narrow ranges but has drifted lower against all the majors after yesterday s gain on the back of strong retail sales a new cyclical low in weekly jobless claims among emerging market currencies the turkish lira and south african rand are a bit soggy while several asian currencies including the chinese yuan have edged higher japan three developments are noteworthy first japan s core measure of inflation which excludes fresh food prices and is the measure that the boj formally targets at 2 rose to 0 8 from 0 7 where it had been expected to remain last october and november core inflation peaked at 1 and fell back to 0 7 non fresh food prices rose 0 8 from 0 6 and energy prices accelerated to 5 1 from 4 5 the headline cpi rose 0 5 after a 0 2 year over year increase in february excluding fresh food and energy japan s consumer inflation was unchanged at 0 4 deflation in fresh food prices eased from 11 in february to 6 in march the outlook is not particularly inspiring downward pressure on core inflation is expected for two sources in the coming months free schooling for young children and cuts in mobile phone service the former is a new government initiative the largest mobile service provider is expected to cut prices by as much as 40 these two developments could shave 0 2 0 3 percentage points off core cpi the second development was surprising the bank of japan reduced the purchases of its long dated bonds both the 10 25 year and the 25 year plus segments it is the first tapering in two months the timing was unexpected it is days ahead of next week s boj meeting and more importantly it is ahead of the unusually long 10 day holiday april 27 may 6 some observers see the tapering as a protest to the recent curve flattening if this is the case it is very subtle japan s 10 year yield is virtually unchanged over the past two weeks at minus three basis points the two year yield is flat at minus 15 bp the 30 year jgb yield had risen one basis point over the past two weeks coming into today and with the boj s help rose 3 5 bp to almost 60 bp matching a high since early march the third development was not so much the suggestion by the deputy cabinet secretary that the sales tax increase slated for october could be delayed for the third time but how quickly senior officials came out to deny it the bar to delaying it a third time is high the government has already approved of measures aimed at offsetting the impact on consumption officials have suggested that only a major crisis would derail the process ahead of the tax increase japan holds upper house elections in july since abe campaigned for his third term defending the tax there is a thought that a delay would require new elections for the lower house too and even if abe was sympathetic with responsibilities associated with being the g20 host the bar is even higher us the divergence revealed yesterday where the eurozone flash pmi disappointed and the us retail sales surged could hardly have been starker the composite pmi slipped to 51 3 from 51 6 both the german and french manufacturing pmi readings remained below the 50 boom bust level the us retail sales were better than we feared due to the decline in tax refunds and the decline in household auto purchases and better than the market expected the 1 6 increase was the strongest in 18 months the gains were widespread 12 of the 13 retail categories increased the lone exception was sporting good and hobby stores excluding autos and gasoline retail sales rose 0 9 which recoups the 0 7 drop in february and a little more the strength of the report prompted many economists to revise up their forecasts for q1 gdp that will be released at the end of next week we are not as optimistic as the atlanta fed whose gdp tracker estimates a 2 8 annualized expansion nor are we as pessimistic as those economists forecasting around a 1 5 print our own back of the envelope calculation puts it around 2 the response to the publication of a redacted mueller report is the lead news in the us today in trying to understand the drivers of the capital markets and exchange rates in particular it seems irrelevant it does not impact the larger divergence theme that underpins our constructive dollar outlook it has no bearing on our assessment of the trajectory of fed policy we would still not want to bet the monetary cycle is complete no matter how pregnant of a pause is taken it may distract on the domestic political scene but the international agenda continues the us trade representative returns to beijing before china s vice premier comes to washington in early may the last attempt to manage expectations suggest a meeting between the two presidents could come as early as the end of next month after stopping in europe and call on tusk and juncker japan and the eu free trade agreement went into effect february 1 abe will come to the us at the end of next week although trade talks are the ostensible reason and finance minister aso will join to talk about the currency component in the trade talks some suspect this is abe s effort to also ingratiate himself with the trump it is the first lady s birthday on april 26 exchange rates the dollar s losses today pare with week s advance it has risen against all the major currencies but the japanese yen which is virtually flat the euro unable to take out the previous week s high near 1 1325 fell a cent on yesterday s diverging news monday s april 15 close above 1 13 was the first close above the old floor this month it looks as if in the options market the dollar longs have been selling calls for protection this has seen the put call skew risk reversal shrink while volatility continues to trend lower sterling closed below 1 30 yesterday for the first time since february 18 we suspect it is a false break uk recent employment and retail sales data have been stronger than expected but brexit continues to suck up the oxygen parliament returns next week the dollar continues to hover around jpy112 00 the closes for the last five sessions have been within a few ticks of it a convincing break could spur a move toward jpy114 00 that said the jpy112 00 area stemmed the march rally too and then the dollar was set back and briefly traded below jpy110 before finding bids again the us dollar remains range bound between cad1 33 and cad1 34 those playing for a breakout have had their fingers burned again the problem is that making money in the range leaves one vulnerable to losing money when the real break comes the bank of canada meets next week the neutral stance is likely to be reinforced the australian dollar briefly poked above 0 7200 for the first time in two months this saw fresh sales despite the stronger chinese data and many embrace the aussie as a proxy a soft q1 cpi report next week may reinforce the cap disclaimer
april 20 2019 12 02 am updated 12 29 am ist when asad umar finance minister of pakistan returned from washington after attending the spring meetings of the international monetary fund imf and the world bank a few days ago the first task he had in front of him was to deny the strong rumours that he was being demoted to be the petroleum minister the rumours died down at that moment but on thursday he was sent packing he was indeed offered the petroleum ministry which he has declined dr abdul hafeez sheikh a former adviser under general musharraf has been named the adviser on finance adding to the growing list of the musharraf cabinet in this current government at a moment when pakistan s economy is facing a major crisis it also has no finance minister now whoever will take the new job will have to face challenges they may neither be prepared for nor experienced enough to deal with in free fall mode pakistan s economy has been ruined in the last eight months since when imran khan became prime minister and his party the pakistan tehreek e insaf pti formed the government almost every indicator has deteriorated substantially for example inflation at 9 4 is at its highest level in five and a half years and is likely to rise to double digits for the months ahead the rupee continues to lose value every other day which adds to further inflation especially with the oil price on the way up more devaluation is expected over the next few months especially when the government gives in to yet another imf programme the fiscal deficit is about to hit more than 6 of gdp and even a cut in development expenditure will not stop this rot as defence spending and interest payments continue to rise pakistan s exports which have been stuck at around 26 bn for years despite the 35 devaluation of the rupee over one year have barely budged the government owes power producing companies huge amounts of money known as the circular debt which continues to accumulate and interest rates are also going up making the cost of business even more uncompetitive the state bank of pakistan recently lowered the expectations of the gdp growth for the current fiscal year to an eight year low to around 3 5 an estimate which was reduced further by the imf and the world bank to a dismal 2 9 for the current fiscal year and expected to fall further over the next three years the gdp grew by 5 8 in the last fiscal year the highest in 13 years by all accounts pakistan s economy is in a dismal state key factors a major reason why the economy has taken such a sharp plunge with gdp growth being halved within a year is on account of the mismanagement and incompetence of the current government and by its economic team on top of that there has been the hubris led by and manifested in mr khan once saying that he would rather commit suicide than go to the imf popular slogans when one is the main nuisance factor in the opposition but quite embarrassing as prime minister of a country facing a major economic meltdown the economic problem pakistan faces at the moment has two aspects to it and is a major case of damned if you do and damned if you don t one reason why pakistan s economy is in such a mess is because the arrogance and bravado of mr khan which was mimicked by his economic and finance team has come to haunt all of them for eight months the economy has been mismanaged because of the fact that the then newly elected government in august did not do what it should have it was almost certain that whichever party would have won the elections of july 2018 it would ask the imf for a major structural adjustment loan at that time there did not seem to be many alternatives mr khan s strategy was to run to a few of pakistan s friends begging for money and to not bow his head in front of the imf by not submitting to the imf then they now have no option but to submit almost a year later a non imf policy and programme was always preferred and a better option in august last year but the incompetence of mr khan matched with vanity did not allow for reforms to be undertaken and has only made matters far worse so after having said that they won t go to the imf that s exactly where they are now from finding and failing at alternatives to revive pakistan s economy the finance minister has had to find ways to convince the imf that pakistan needs the imf the reasons for the rumours of him being dismissed from his post should have been based on his poor performance of running the economy but they shifted to how he wasn t able to cut an imf deal a few days ago when he was in washington the fact that he was not able to meet the u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin nor the imf head christine lagarde on this visit was seen as yet another sign of this failure by the pakistani media nevertheless the imf deal is now a certainty and although the finance minister has been replaced there was probably no need for a replacement when the imf implements its strict conditionalities and adjustment programme to which the finance minister and the country supposedly agree the finance minister becomes redundant and is simply the bearer and front for bad news and tough conditions the new finance adviser will fit this role perfectly tough road ahead the new imf programme the biggest pakistan is expecting to receive to be between 6 10 bn which is almost a certainty now is going to make things far worse for all pakistanis and especially for the working people already dealing with prospects of a marked economic slowdown and high and rising inflation the imf will further cut the minuscule development expenditure left although defence spending will remain a matter of national security never discussed in parliament hence not to be touched the imf will ensure austerity stabilisation and will cut the growth rate further it will insist on further devaluation or adjustment of the rupee as it calls it causing greater inflation and will insist on raising utility prices in every respect the people of pakistan will face the prospects of fewer jobs rising prices and an economy which is now the worst performer in all of south asia this will be the 13th imf rescue package for pakistan s governments and its elites in less than four decades each time there is an economic crisis created due to mismanagement the elite remain under taxed the imf and world bank jump in to save them usually pakistan s governments in the past especially the military leverage pakistan s so called geostrategic position and situation and gain undue access with the u s having been pakistan s biggest champion and supporter as global power shifts and the region changes so has pakistan s position in it one of the stumbling blocks to the deal this time has been the imf s insistence that pakistan reveal the financial deals made with china including financial loans as well as the 60 billion china pakistan economic corridor if pakistan doesn t take the imf loan it is in a mess if it takes the loan it is in a bigger mess either way the news is bad s akbar zaidi is a political economist based in karachi he teaches at columbia university in new york and at the iba in karachi

recent employment and retail sales data have been stronger than expected but brexit continues to suck up the oxygen parliament returns next week the dollar continues to hover around jpy112 00 the

was set back and briefly traded below jpy110 before finding bids again the us dollar remains range bound between cad1 33 and cad1 34 those playing for a breakout have had their fingers burned again

associated press trump has gone on the record as not being too pleased with his own pick for the federal reserve jerome powell now he is actively stacking the bench at the fed in hopes to have more doves in his corner come 2020 one time republican presidential candidate herman cain is one of two cain made clear to the wsj this week that he is committed to pursuing one of the open permanent voting seats on the fed s board of governors on political betting markets such as predictit org the chances cain s nomination will be ratified by the senate are still a very weak 10 republican senators mitt romney cory gardner lisa murkowksi and kevin cramer are not in favor the other trump nominee is a former wsj editorial board member and economist steven moore he has come out saying that one of the reasons why we had a 2008 2009 housing market crash is because of fed raising rates too fast that s right up trump s alley 2019 bloomberg finance lp the fed s shift from inflation to deflation inadvertently crushed the mortgage backed securities markets this made the recession that began in december 2007 inevitable then a second course reversal by the fed in june 2008 created a severe scarcity of dollars that contributed to the collapse of the real economy he wrote in an op ed published by the washington times on april 7 moore s op ed was like a cover letter to the market and to the senate in his hopes to land a seat on the board cain did the same thing on wednesday in the wsj in a nod to trump he even took a jab at the millennial generation s newfound adoration for socialism like trump he wants to keep wages rising something even the socialists can get behind two terms each of republican and democratic administrations failed to end wage stagnation which says all you need to know about why donald trump was elected president cain wrote now wages are rising at robust rates above 3 a year thanks to cuts in taxes and regulation with the largest wage increases going to low wage workers and the federal reserve has been itching to raise interest rates here we have both of trump s choices for the board of governors taking a jab at powell a man that will kind of be their boss if selected moore and cain would be at the fed to cage the hawks keeping interest rates low and giving the economy some legs into 2020 the business cycle is already running on empty at best bulls see it at a quarter tank the economy is trump s most important achievement heading into next year s campaign season a strong stock market isn t enough especially for those with scant investments to benefit from the s p 500 what matters to most to them is wage growth and powell s fed has focused on wages as a threat to inflation higher inflation obviously means higher interest rates trump doesn t want it neither does cain cain picked on the academic model by fed leaders their textbooks say strong economic growth particularly strong wage growth causes inflation which fed policy should temper both the bush and obama administrations perpetuated the professor standard and both presided over income stagnation he says the fed trump 2020 associated press as everyone knows the year started off with investors expecting two to four rate hikes now there are none stocks have risen ever since investor business and consumer sentiment remains strong for once the fed might not kill a growing economy unless there is an acceleration in wages then we are good on rates says scott clemons chief investment strategist for brown brothers harriman let it ride on monday chicago fed chief charles evans a dove who votes on the fed s open markets committee this year and next said he saw no reason to move on rates until fall 2020 st louis fed chief jim bullard said last week that normalization of interest rates is now over trump s anti rate hike base is growing ever so slightly at the fed 2019 bloomberg finance lp trump criticized powell in november and december saying his rate hikes were erasing fiscal stimulus signed into law in trump s first year many cried foul saying he was interfering with the fed s independence then in january during a conversation with former fed leaders janet yellen and ben bernanke at the american economic association s annual meeting in atlanta powell looked the odd man out both yellen and bernanke said economic growth cycles don t just die on their own they are killed by the fed the fed s hawkish camp is being dismantled if moore and cain do not manage to get on board it is more probable than not that other doves take their place if not and if the fed moves on rates next year as everyone expected as recently as january then trump s odds of reelection look worse goldman sachs recently predicted trump to win next year the prediction markets have it differently according to predictit org a democratic party win is the more expensive bet meaning they re favored to take 2020 healthcare is expected to be a big issue for voters as it was in the midterm elections if trump s economy is doing well people may not be focused on wages and unemployment with democrats offering free health insurance trump s stacking the bench at the fed might not be enough for a win
a noticeable shift has taken place on wall street and among many economists and business leaders in recent weeks fears of an imminent recession have faded and been replaced with cautious optimism especially about 2020 a trend that bodes well for president donald trump as he seeks re election the international monetary fund is a good example it made headlines last week when it slashed its global growth forecast to the lowest pace since the financial crisis but it is not as gloomy as it sounds the imf also predicted a rebound for later this year and slightly stronger growth next year for the world economy which should be a positive for the united states the imf isn t alone in its optimism the u s stock market had one of its best starts to the year since 1998 and is now within striking distance of hitting an all time high goldman sachs says the likelihood a recession in the next year has been cut in half to 10 percent there s a plausible story to tell that explains why this optimism has taken root it goes like this a u s china trade agreement looks likely the chinese economy appears to be stabilizing and the federal reserve and other central banks have shown they will do whatever it takes to keep this expansion going many of the major fears that drove the stock market down at the end of last year and caused anxiety about a u s and global recession by 2020 have subsided instead of a recession some are now talking about an upside surprise in which the u s economy could grow faster than expected especially if businesses start to spend more as trump s trade war cools and the fed doesn t raise interest rates almost no independent expert thinks the economy will achieve above 3 percent growth in 2019 and 2020 as the white house predicts but most forecasters are now in the 2 to 2 5 percent range for 2019 and about 2 percent for 2020 good enough to keep unemployment low and wages rising at a robust pace how the economy fares in spring 2020 is likely to play a large role in trump s re election chances according to election experts like larry sabato of the center for politics at the university of virginia the best guess now is that the economy in early to mid 2020 won t be the huge growth trump likes to boast about but there s a decent chance it will be doing well enough to give him an edge if unemployment is still 3 5 to 4 percent and gas is still 2 75 and the stock market is still near a record high then the economy is probably at the president s back or at least not a headwind said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics if you plug that scenario into our election model trump wins or it s close u s companies continue to hire at a robust pace and wages are rising including for lower skilled workers which should make americans comfortable enough to keep spending the housing market is showing signs of a rebound another indication that people are still confident about the economy and their finances china a nation trump often berates is providing a boost to the global and u s economies by stimulating its own the world s second largest economy said wednesday that growth was 6 4 percent in the first quarter slightly better than expected and a sign that china has stabilized despite the trade war but not all is well the u s manufacturing sector has had a noticeable slowdown this year and business and consumer sentiment while still high by historical levels is down from where it was a few months ago trump has repeatedly blamed the fed especially chairman jerome powell for dragging the economy down by raising interest rates too quickly last year the fed raised interest rates a full percentage point but economists investors and business leaders no longer see the fed as a worry after powell indicated that the central bank is on hold and unlikely to raise rates again this year trump has yet to remove any tariffs he has put in place even the steel and aluminum tariffs on canada and mexico which he said were a bargaining tactic did not change after the revised north american free trade agreement nafta was finished last fall all of the optimism about the economy assumes the u s china trade conflict is rolled back and mr trump doesn t start imposing auto tariffs on the eu and asia said joseph brusuelas chief economist at accounting firm rsm heather long is an economics correspondent for the washington post
growth projections remain cautious but there are promising signs asia may be snapping out of its slowdown asia s growth slowdown may be nearing an end despite gloomy global forecasts and the threat of a u s china trade war are the good times back for the world s most economically dynamic region champagne corks have been kept idle lately however from hong kong to washington forecasters have lined up to downgrade their growth projections in its april 3 asian development outlook 2019 the asian development bank adb forecast declining gross domestic product gdp growth for developing asia from 5 9 percent in 2018 to 5 7 percent this year and 5 6 percent by 2020 risks remain tilted to the downside the philippines based bank said pointing to threat of a drawn out or deteriorating trade conflict between the united states and china and uncertainties over u s fiscal policy and brexit it projected china the world s second largest economy would slow from 6 6 percent gdp growth in 2018 to 6 3 percent this year and 6 1 percent in 2020 due to restrictions on the housing market and shadow banking along with sluggish exports southeast asia could suffer the after effects although south asia is expected to buck the trend led by india delicate moment following the adb s gloomier forecasts the international monetary fund imf projected a slowdown in 2019 for 70 percent of the global economy the washington based institution s latest world economic outlook sees global growth softening from 3 6 percent in 2018 to a subpar 3 3 percent this year down 0 2 percentage point from its january projection on the back of negative revisions for several major economies in the asia pacific region china is seen slowing to a 6 3 percent expansion this year and 6 1 percent in 2020 japan the world s third largest economy could cool from 1 percent gdp growth this year to just 0 5 percent in 2020 elsewhere the asean 5 comprising indonesia malaysia the philippines thailand and vietnam are seen broadly stable with 5 1 percent gdp growth this year rising to 5 2 percent in 2020 india is expected to set the pace with its economy growing by 7 3 percent in 2019 and 7 5 percent in 2020 albeit 0 2 percentage points lower than the imf s previous forecasts the imf said global growth should pick up in the second half of 2019 thanks to significant monetary policy accommodation by central banks in the united states europe and japan along with stimulus efforts by china and an improved outlook for u s china trade talks nevertheless the imf s gita gopinath described it as a delicate moment for the world economy if the downside risks do not materialize and the policy support put in place is effective global growth should rebound said the imf s economic counsellor and director of its research department if however any of the major risks materialize then the expected recoveries in stressed economies export dependent economies and highly indebted economies may be derailed policy stimulus amid such warnings other economists see signs that asia s downturn is bottoming out starting with china s surprisingly upbeat gdp growth data on april 17 beijing announced a 6 4 percent gdp expansion in the first quarter on the back of increased industrial production and rising consumer demand the expansion compared to a 6 3 percent gdp gain projected by a reuters survey of analysts and followed recent fiscal stimulus and increased bank lending admittedly the latest surge in industrial production is hard to take at face value and is likely to be partially reversed in the coming months and some downside risks to broader growth remain said julian evans pritchard senior china economist capital economics but the big picture is that policy stimulus is clearly working and should help to shore up china s economy in the coming quarters anz research s khoon goh head of asia research said it supported evidence that asia s growth slowdown may be close to a trough china s gdp growth has beat expectations but more importantly the activity indicators for march showed improving momentum goh said in an april 18 report goh continued across the region export data for march has been mixed so far but the latest pmi new export orders point to a likely improvement in the months ahead a key leading indicator for the global technology cycle is pointing toward a rebound which would bode well for asia s exports these signs alongside our view that there would be further monetary stimulus from some central banks in the region will help secure a growth recovery in the second half of 2019 given the inventory overhang in some economies the magnitude of the recovery is likely to be moderate in the initial stages however it should be sufficient to support risk appetite and sustain foreign portfolio flows into the region significantly goh said the australian bank had revised upward its china gdp forecast to 6 4 percent for 2019 from 6 3 percent previously due to beijing s fiscal and monetary stimulus asia s currency and equity markets are expected to strengthen as a result of interest rate cuts along with stronger foreign equity inflows as the recovery takes hold however capital economics is unconvinced arguing that recent weak global growth will endure much longer than is commonly assumed previous policy tightening has yet to take its full toll on activity in the u s and china s stimulus seems too modest to prompt a sustained pick up in growth the london based consultancy said in an april 18 report disappointing economic performance will cause monetary policy to be loosened almost across the board but we do not see this prompting any meaningful recovery until 2021 in asia india is still viewed as the best performing major emerging economy in the coming years but for a region responsible for much of the world s recent economic expansion signs of emerging green shoots should give hope to policymakers and investors alike

stagflation is an ugly word in fact a forced marriage of sorts imposed on two independent minded if scary words stagnation and inflation it implies rampant inflation accompanied by a loss in gdp growth the word was first coined in 1970s to describe the economic situation of the united states the economy was reeling from an oil embargo imposed by a coalition of arab oil producing countries to protest hegemonic us policies stagflation is now threatening the pakistani economy not on account of some natural disaster or hostile action by foreign powers but owing primarily to flawed economic policies of the incumbent government following several years of low inflation eight months after the pakistan tehreek i insaf took power the inflation rate has touched 8 per cent according to official herald the rate is determined by comparing the prices of of 481 goods and services of routine use unofficial estimates vary with the worst pessimists claiming 30 to 40 per cent hike in prices the salaried class and the unemployed people have been the worst hit as a result the government has also reported that tax collection over the period has been nearly half of that during the previous financial year this corroborates with warnings of a recession that is reduced production levels and a decline in employment for nearly seven decades now the is lm economic model a mixture of the financial and monetary policy has occupied the central position in economic policy making in both developing and developed economies the model suggests that when a tight monetary policy is pursued in an economy on account of meager reserves foreign investment has little impact on economic growth an expansionary fiscal policy under the circumstances would bring about a crowding out and raise interest rates in the economy a review of the past decade indicates that the pakistan peoples party led government was in the good books of the masses particularly the salaried class although the official inflation rate in 2010 was 8 per cent this can be explained in terms of a drastic salary raise 50 per cent the policy caused a positive trickle down in almost every sector of the economy it proved the optimal pro people and pro cyclical policy however the rising interest would cause a shrinking of the domestic investments as well the gdp the redeeming feature of an interest hike could attract more domestic bank deposits which might strengthen the ceurrency against the us dollar however such an improvement might lack longevity a review of the past decade indicates that the pakistan peoples party led government was in the good books of the masses particularly the salaried class although the official inflation rate in 2010 was 8 per cent this can be explained in terms of a drastic salary raise 50 per cent the policy caused a positive trickle down in almost every sector of the economy it proved the optimal pro people and pro cyclical policy currently there is no effort to increase the bank deposit ratio the rupee has lost consierably against us dollar on account of rampant money laundering and a reluctance to invest in domestic markets the reluctance is being blamed on the investors fear of being pursued by the national accountabilty bureau and the federal investigation agency thus a large amount of money is such lying idle persuading people to invest it can boost gdp and exports and bring the inflation down the government would do well to provide some relief to the salaried class this can be accomplished by raising the salaries by at least 50 per cent to offset the inflationary impact in the late 1960s during the ayub era the economy was keeping abreast with singapore taiwan japan south korea and malaysia a sustainable change can only come from within a society or economy the writer is a phd scholar of economics
overview many financial centers are closed today these include australia india most european markets and the us in asia equity markets that were open moved higher the which gapped higher on monday rose 0 5 today for a 1 5 gain on the week china s rose 0 6 lifting the weekly increase to 2 6 the us dollar is confined to narrow ranges but has drifted lower against all the majors after yesterday s gain on the back of strong retail sales a new cyclical low in weekly jobless claims among emerging market currencies the turkish lira and south african rand are a bit soggy while several asian currencies including the have edged higher japan three developments are noteworthy first japan s core measure of inflation which excludes fresh food prices and is the measure that the boj formally targets at 2 rose to 0 8 from 0 7 where it had been expected to remain last october and november core inflation peaked at 1 and fell back to 0 7 non fresh food prices rose 0 8 from 0 6 and energy prices accelerated to 5 1 from 4 5 the headline cpi rose 0 5 after a 0 2 year over year increase in february excluding fresh food and energy japan s consumer inflation was unchanged at 0 4 deflation in fresh food prices eased from 11 in february to 6 in march the outlook is not particularly inspiring downward pressure on core inflation is expected for two sources in the coming months free schooling for young children and cuts in mobile phone service the former is a new government initiative the largest mobile service provider is expected to cut prices by as much as 40 these two developments could shave 0 2 0 3 percentage points off core cpi the second development was surprising the bank of japan reduced the purchases of its long dated bonds both the 10 25 year and the 25 year plus segments it is the first tapering in two months the timing was unexpected it is days ahead of next week s boj meeting and more importantly it is ahead of the unusually long 10 day holiday april 27 may 6 some observers see the tapering as a protest to the recent curve flattening if this is the case it is very subtle japan s 10 year yield is virtually unchanged over the past two weeks at minus three basis points the two year yield is flat at minus 15 bp the 30 year jgb yield had risen one basis point over the past two weeks coming into today and with the boj s help rose 3 5 bp to almost 60 bp matching a high since early march the third development was not so much the suggestion by the deputy cabinet secretary that the sales tax increase slated for october could be delayed for the third time but how quickly senior officials came out to deny it the bar to delaying it a third time is high the government has already approved of measures aimed at offsetting the impact on consumption officials have suggested that only a major crisis would derail the process ahead of the tax increase japan holds upper house elections in july since abe campaigned for his third term defending the tax there is a thought that a delay would require new elections for the lower house too and even if abe was sympathetic with responsibilities associated with being the g20 host the bar is even higher us the divergence revealed yesterday where the eurozone flash pmi disappointed and the us retail sales surged could hardly have been starker the composite pmi slipped to 51 3 from 51 6 both the german and french manufacturing pmi readings remained below the 50 boom bust level the us retail sales were better than we feared due to the decline in tax refunds and the decline in household auto purchases and better than the market expected the 1 6 increase was the strongest in 18 months the gains were widespread 12 of the 13 retail categories increased the lone exception was sporting good and hobby stores excluding autos and gasoline retail sales rose 0 9 which recoups the 0 7 drop in february and a little more the strength of the report prompted many economists to revise

as those economists forecasting around a 1 5 print our own back of the envelope calculation puts it around 2 the response to the publication of a redacted mueller report is the lead news in the us today in trying to understand the drivers of the capital markets and exchange rates in particular it seems irrelevant it does not impact the larger divergence theme that underpins our constructive dollar outlook it has no bearing on our assessment of the trajectory of fed policy we would still not want to bet the monetary cycle is complete no matter how pregnant of a pause is taken it may distract on the domestic political scene but the international agenda continues the us trade representative returns to beijing before china s vice premier comes to washington in early may the last attempt to manage expectations suggest a meeting between the two presidents could come as early as the end of next month after stopping in europe and call on tusk and juncker japan and the eu free

according to a separate report from the japanese government the broader macroeconomic picture is hardly encouraging albeit it is far from being disastrous either the cabinet office said its assessment of economic health was unchanged in april from the previous month due to a fall in national exports which have declined for four consecutive months officials said japan s shipments to mainland china had dropped amid the ongoing sino american trade tensions which pose risks of disruptions in their trade with third party countries additionally the cabinet office said the recovery in japan s consumer spending has been slow this year due to the weak inflation and a lacklustre performance of the industrial sector japanese manufacturers are reliant on the exports of electronic parts and equipment to china where these products are used to manufacture the lion s share of goods bound for the us the japanese government also said that the slow progress in trade talks between the us and china poses a risk of extended uncertainty which could hold back japan s economic momentum boj policymakers say these factors will likely prevent japan s inflation rate from gaining any momentum until the year 2021 inflation is holding up but isn t accelerating much either an anonymous boj official said as quoted by reuters inflation will gradually head toward 2 percent but the pace will be moderate at best amid these latest developments some officials and economics experts are calling on the japanese government to postpone its planned hike in sales tax from 8 to 10 percent saying the move could further impair the fragile economic expansion government officials disagree saying the hike is necessary to bolster japan s budget sustainability as it faces an elevated debt to gdp ratio of roughly 300 percent read more japan industrial sector shows signs of slowdown amid weaker investment plans the sales tax hike to 10 percent is needed the most to secure stable financial resources to pay for social security for all generations in order to cope with the ageing population finance minister taro aso said we will proceed unless a big incident like the lehman shock occurs

as americans filed their taxes this season a process filled with confusion for many and startlingly small refunds for some democrats in congress offered a sharp contrast to president donald trump s unpopular tax law in the form of two ambitious tax plans that actually work for working families while trump s 2017 tax law rewrote the tax code to further enrich millionaires billionaires and wealthy corporations congressional democrats proposals the american family act afa and the working families tax relief act wftra would double down on two of the tax code s most effective income boosters for working and middle class families the earned income tax credit eitc and the child tax credit ctc rather than push the nation even further toward inequality a trend accelerated by trump s tax law these tax plans offer smart investments to help everyday families feeling the stress of flat wages and the rising costs associated with reaching and staying in the middle class for example center for american progress analysis shows that under the afa a minimum wage worker who has two young children would see their ctc boosted by more than 100 a week greater than the 75 ctc increase they receive from the trump tax law for the entire year this is the kind of policy that workers and families desperately need more than 40 percent of u s households are struggling to afford basics such as food and housing while 70 percent of voters faced at least one serious economic hardship in the last year moreover 4 in 10 american adults would not be able to readily come up with 400 in an emergency the wftra would help alleviate these financial pressures by increasing the incomes of an estimated 46 million households including 9 million latinx households 8 million black households and 2 million asian american households while the afa would cut the child poverty rate by more than one third here are five reasons this progressive tax vision is the kind of tax reform america actually needs dramatically reduces child poverty both the afa and the wftra include bold ideas to reduce child poverty through major investments in the ctc the bills would make the ctc fully refundable effectively transforming the credit into a child allowance similar to what many other developed nations have long had in place including the united kingdom and canada this investment would also ensure that the poorest families are no longer left behind by the ctc s minimum earnings threshold importantly the proposals would also index the ctc to inflation so it keeps pace with expenses and would deliver monthly benefits to help families meet their expenses without needing to wait for tax time in recognition that the early years of life are the most critical for child development both bills also propose a new young child tax credit an idea originally developed by the center for american progress to help families shoulder the costs of raising young children and invest in kids when it matters most the cost of diapers alone makes up nearly 14 percent of after tax income for families in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution and in 33 states the average cost of full time center based infant care is greater than the average cost of in state college tuition and fees researchers at columbia university estimate that the afa s improvements to the ctc alone would shrink child poverty by nearly one third and reduce the share of children in deep poverty those living at or below half the poverty line by nearly half meanwhile the wftra would expand the eitc for families with children by 25 percent and protect 7 million people including 3 million children from poverty these investments stand in sharp contrast to the lopsided trump tax law which made wealthy parents earning hundreds of thousands of dollars newly eligible for the full credit while leaving behind 26 million children in low and moderate income families who did not fully benefit from the tax law s ctc increase promotes children s economic mobility in addition to dramatically reducing poverty and hardship today these investments would pay long term dividends as modest increases in struggling families household income have long lasting far reaching benefits throughout a child s life for example one study found that a 3 000 increase in family income for low income children under age 5 leads to a 17 percent average earnings increase in adulthood exposure to poverty and economic instability can have lasting consequences for children s health educational and employment outcomes a recent study from the national academy of sciences revealed that child poverty costs the american economy as much as 1 1 trillion in lost gross domestic product gdp annually however the latest organization for economic cooperation and development oecd data show that the united states spent just 1 1 percent of gdp on family benefits in 2015 less than half of the oecd average of 2 4 percent helps workers without dependent children as well as working students and seniors in addition to boosting the eitc for families with kids the wftra calls for substantially increasing the credit for several groups of workers whom the eitc currently leaves behind more than 7 million low income workers without dependent children are taxed or taxed more deeply into poverty in large part due to the small eitc benefit they receive a maximum of just 529 per year the wftra proposes nearly quadrupling the current maximum eitc for these workers to 2 074 the plan also calls for important advances for working students and older workers two groups who are particularly economically vulnerable yet currently ineligible for the eitc as it is limited to workers ages 25 to 64 the wftra proposes lowering the minimum eligibility age to 19 years old and raising the maximum age to 67 boosting these workers wallets with income that could provide much needed cash for textbooks or prescription medications reduces reliance on predatory payday lenders in addition to boosting the eitc s value for workers and families the wftra advances an innovative new idea first proposed by the center for american progress in 2014 to allow families to access up to 500 as an advance on their eitc refund at a time when 4 in 10 americans don t have even 400 in the bank this proposal would help reduce the number of people turning to predatory payday loans according to the latest data 12 million americans annually resort to these loans though they average only 375 each payday loans can lead to a cycle of poverty driving americans and particularly people of color who are especially targeted for these loans deeper and deeper into debt in addition to helping families avoid payday loans the 500 advance could also be used to make mobility enhancing investments such as summer camp that might otherwise be out of reach invests in hard hit puerto rico the wftra makes a huge investment in puerto rico ensuring that puerto ricans are treated the same as other americans when it comes to receiving eitc and ctc it rectifies a long standing inequality in the tax code by ensuring that puerto rican families with fewer than three children can claim the ctc the bill also creates a match for the new puerto rican eitc injecting hundreds of millions of dollars into the puerto rican economy these improvements are especially timely given the economic challenges puerto rico is currently facing in part due to insufficient investment by the trump administration they would serve to reduce puerto rico s elevated child poverty rate and promote labor force participation conclusion these bills aren t just good policy in contrast to president trump s deeply unpopular tax law they re also precisely the kind of tax reform americans want to see their leaders embrace for example while just 36 percent of registered voters support president trump s tax law 6 in 10 support expanding the eitc for workers without dependent children there is growing momentum to enact tax policies that benefit everyday families rather than the wealthy the groundswell of support for a more progressive tax code is evidenced not only by the fact that nearly every democrat in congress is a co sponsor of these bills but also by the steady stream of additional proposals to strengthen the eitc and ctc this ambitious legislation is among the clearest articulations to date of the society in which americans can live if leaders advance policies that put children and families first instead of the ultrarich and wealthy corporations katherine gallagher robbins is the senior director of poverty policy for the poverty to prosperity program at the center for american progress rebecca vallas is the vice president for the poverty to prosperity

as prospects for the global economy darken the united states has remained a beacon of growth helped by donald trump s tax cuts but a shadow is creeping over that light the yield curve a financial indicator with a reputation for predicting previous american recessions is in the danger zone just how worried should we be the yield curve shows interest rates across the range of maturities the periods over which money is borrowed from short term such as three months to long term typically ten years the benchmark yield curve is for government debt treasuries in america because it is the least risky typically it slopes upwards as the maturity of the treasuries lengthens long rates are higher than short ones because investors generally demand a higher return for parking their money away for longer exposing them among other things to the risk that it will melt away if inflation takes off but this term premium or extra reward for long term rather than short term investing does not hold at all times and what economists have noted is that when the yield curve flattens and even inverts so that short rates are higher than long ones turning the term premium negative that is an early warning of recession although the evidence for such a predictive property applies to the us an american recession hurts economies around the world that s why there s anxiety now about the us where short rates are almost identical to 10 year rates on monday 15th april rates on three month treasury bills were 2 43 per cent whereas yields on 10 year notes were 2 55 per cent in late march the short rate was marginally higher than the long rate inverting the yield curve on past form that indicates trouble ahead despite continuing evidence of momentum in the american economy with a healthy increase in jobs of almost 200 000 in march although recoveries are not doomed to die of old age another cause for disquiet is the sheer length of the recovery since the severe recession triggered by the financial crisis bottomed out in mid 2009 in july the upswing will become the longest ever on records stretching back to the mid 19th century why should a flattening or even inverting yield curve spell trouble ahead one reason is that it is picking up market expectations of a prospective about turn in the direction of monetary policy starting in december 2015 america s federal reserve has raised its key policy rate by 2 25 percentage points from the post crisis low of between zero and 0 25 per cent and since october 2017 the fed has also been running down the assets it piled up through three bouts of quantitative easing buying bonds by creating money in the wake of the financial crisis the flattening yield curve is consistent with investors judging that the monetary squeeze has gone too far requiring the fed to switch to a looser stance that expectation has already brought down long rates which have fallen steeply since november when they were above 3 per cent this interpretation of the flattening yield curve chimes with the fed s change of course already this year to keeping its key rate on hold rather than pushing through more increases and also limiting the rundown of the assets it has purchased but there is another reason why long rates have declined the markets are now anticipating lower inflation over the next decade than they did in 2018 that makes investing in long term nominal debt more attractive and is incorporated in lower yields the dampening in inflation expectations follows the surprisingly meek recent behaviour of inflation despite a tight labour market and a pick up in wage growth in january it was just 1 4 per cent according to the price index used by the fed in relation to its 2 per cent target the core rate which excludes the more volatile categories of energy and food stood at 1 8 per cent a reappraisal of the long term outlook for inflation does not necessarily mean that the american economy is about to stumble into a recession and there are other reasons to suspect that a flattening yield curve may on this occasion be giving a false signal most important is the continuing impact around the world of the extreme monetary policies adopted to prop up keeling economies following the financial crisis of 2008 when central banks ran out of traditional ammunition after slashing short term rates down to around zero they decided to act directly on long term rates by making big purchases of long term securities this quantitative easing aimed to reduce the term premium and succeeded in doing so with estimates suggesting it pared a full percentage point off ten year treasury yields in america much of that effect lingers since the fed s reduction of its balance sheet has been modest and achieved by allowing bonds to mature rather than selling them moreover the fed announced in march that the rundown of assets will finish this autumn much sooner than seemed likely last year and leaving its balance sheet higher than previously expected in other economies such as britain and the euro area central banks are still maintaining their stock of bought assets by reinvesting the proceeds of maturing bonds while setting interest rates that are much lower than in america this matters because bond markets now operate internationally even though 10 year bond yields have fallen below 3 per cent in the us that is still attractive to investors in germany and japan where they are zero there is certainly good reason to worry about the global economic outlook as world trade growth dwindles china s growth sags and the eurozone flounders again but it is too soon to man the lifeboats for the american economy still less so on the basis of a single financial indicator the yield curve may be fabled but it has become fallible
u s retail sales increased by the most in 1 1 2 years in march as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles and a range of other goods the latest indication that economic growth picked up in the first quarter after a false start the economy s enduring strength was underscored by other data on thursday showing the number of americans filing applications for unemployment benefits dropped to the lowest in nearly 50 years last week fears of an abrupt slowdown in activity escalated at the turn of the year after a batch of weak economic reports but those concerns have dissipated in recent weeks amid fairly upbeat data on trade inventories and construction spending that have suggested growth last quarter could actually be better than the moderate pace logged in the final three months of 2018 a report from the federal reserve on wednesday described economic activity as expanding at a slight to moderate pace in march and early april the fed s beige book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide showed a few of the u s central bank s districts reported some strengthening supported by strong labour market conditions and improving wage growth household spending appears well positioned to increase in the coming months said jim baird chief investment officer at plante moran financial advisors in kalamazoo michigan fears about the softening in the economy were overblown the commerce department said retail sales surged 1 6 percent last month that was the biggest increase since september 2017 and followed an unrevised 0 2 percent drop in february economists polled by reuters had forecast retail sales would accelerate 0 9 percent in march retail sales in march advanced 3 6 percent from a year ago with march s rebound retail sales have now erased december s plunge which had put consumer spending and the overall economy on a sharply lower growth trajectory retail sales last month were probably lifted by tax refunds even though they have been smaller than in previous years following the revamping of the u s tax code in january 2018 excluding automobiles gasoline building materials and food services retail sales rebounded 1 0 percent in march after a downwardly revised 0 3 percent decline in february these so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product they were previously reported to have decreased 0 2 percent in february consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of economic activity and is being buoyed by a tightening labour market that is driving up wage growth strong labour market a separate report from the labor department on thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 5 000 to a seasonally adjusted 192 000 for the week ended april 13 the lowest level since september 1969 claims have now declined for five straight weeks economists had forecast claims would rise to 205 000 in the latest week though the trend in hiring has slowed job gains remain above the roughly 100 000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working age population the unemployment rate is at 3 8 percent near the 3 7 percent fed officials project it will be by the end of the year the dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies while stocks on wall street were mixed prices of u s treasuries were up march s strong core retail sales could result in the further upgrading of first quarter gdp estimates growth forecasts for the first quarter were boosted to around a 2 5 percent annualised rate on wednesday after data showed the u s trade deficit narrowed for a second straight month in february first quarter growth forecasts have been raised from as low as a 0 5 percent rate following relatively strong reports on trade inventories and construction spending the economy grew at a 2 2 percent pace in the fourth quarter another report from the commerce department on thursday showed business inventories rose in february and stock accumulation in the prior month was a bit stronger than initially estimated a potential boost to growth stronger growth in the first quarter will probably not change the view that the economy will slow this year as the stimulus from a 1 5 trillion tax cut package diminishes and the impact of interest rate hikes over the last few years lingers it also is unlikely to have any impact on monetary policy after the fed recently suspended its three year campaign to tighten monetary policy the central bank dropped projections for any rate hikes this year after increasing borrowing costs four times in 2018 in march sales at auto dealerships jumped 3 1 percent the most since september 2017 receipts at service stations increased 3 5 percent likely reflecting higher gasoline prices receipts at clothing stores shot up 2 0 percent the largest increase since last may there were also increases in sales at furniture outlets electronics and appliances shops and food and beverage stores sales at building materials and garden equipment and supplies also rose last month online and mail order retail sales increased 1 2 percent in march sales at restaurants and bars climbed 0 8 percent the most since last july but receipts at hobby musical instrument and book stores fell 0 3 percent last month source reuters reporting by lucia mutikani

the first 100 days of andrés manuel lópez obrador s government have passed although this is a relatively short space of time it is enough to know the fundamental features of his administration this article was originally published in spanish on the mexican website of the imt la izquierda socialista power state and government in a capitalist regime the real power resides with the big capitalists they are the ones who decide what happens and how the 16 richest men in mexico have around 150 billion dollars between them equivalent to a little over 60 percent of the state budget for this year one percent of the population owns almost half of the national wealth they control the economy but they are not a democratic body nobody votes for them and they have their positions because they were born rich or have become so by wheeling and dealing in the course of their lives the super rich make the decisions but to exercise their dominance requires a legal political structure which is obscured by rules that formally permit anyone to govern while in actuality preserving the present state of affairs to ensure that the capitalists can continue to augment their wealth this legal political and repressive structure is the state the process of depredation of the bourgeoisie was done at the expense of destroying the legitimacy of the state image world economic forum the mexican state defends capitalism it can assume repressive or democratic forms depending on the degree of consensus that exists in society but will never itself seek to modify existing relations of power one aspect of the rules of the state is the renewal of its governing bodies the executive and legislative branches formally anyone can apply to occupy these organs but in reality they are filled from the ranks of the elite when a revolution takes place the masses demand participation in the state overthrow governments and reconstruct laws in their image but as long as economic relations are not changed and unless a new state with a proletarian class character is built the oligarchy will always end up assimilating the new ruling caste this was what happened with the pri institutional revolutionary party which eventually ended up as a traditional right wing party in mexico the assimilation of the government by the bourgeoisie gathered pace after miguel alemán s administration but it was in the government of carlos salinas when it reached a peak since then in its eagerness to enrich itself as quickly as possible the bourgeoisie transferred the equivalent of a quarter of the gdp to the current gang of fat cats this is a different process but in essence very similar to what happened with the porfirio díaz dictatorship the process of depredation of the bourgeoisie was done at the expense of destroying the legitimacy of the state during the administration of calderón following rampant fraud and wastefulness the state had no power in either the territories or the economic sphere in this situation criminal groups in all spheres assumed control crony capitalism replaced the rules of state control with mafia rule 1 december 2018 the masses step forward the working masses instinctively defending themselves over the course of a historical phase lasting more than 30 years have led a ceaseless battle against the bourgeoisie which reached a high point on 1 december 2018 a rare event took place someone who was not part of the bourgeois elite entered the government with 30 million votes behind him this was a real cataclysm for the system since the people opted for an alternative to the policies of so called neoliberalism the working masses have led a ceaseless battle against the bourgeoisie for 30 years which reached a high point on 1 december 2018 with amlo s election image twitter jeremias ra andrés manuel lópez obrador amlo dominated the last elections his party has a majority in both the chamber of representatives and the senate so he doesn t need to give in to the blackmail of the parties of the old regime the movement was such that even today the masses do not miss the opportunity to show their repudiation of the pri or the pan national action party by booing them in amlo s presence end of the media monopoly even the traditional media has been overwhelmed by social networks for example one mainstream news programme s youtube channel has 900 000 subscribers the 10 channels run by amlo supporters with the same number of subscribers exceed 100 000 daily views while the aforementioned mainstream news channel fails to hit 2 000 or 3 000 the control of big television and radio stations over the spread of information has been broken at this point the productive forces have flooded the relations of production but this is only one aspect of the new situation the battle for a new trade unionism the masses desire for change is expressed in all fields an example of this is in the trade union movement a battle broke out on the northern border especially in matamoros in response to amlo s announcement of an increased minimum wage the masses quickly overtook the traditional unions and strikes broke out some legal and others not and won important victories in most cases such as 20 percent wage increases comparable victories were unheard of for 30 years with the exception of the workers of the mining union whom given their strategic position and combativeness have achieved similar increases in the past despite the wrecking role of their leadership it is necessary to clarify that the triumph of the workers of matamoros is a product of the current atmosphere of class struggle it is an example of proletarian militancy a victory exclusively for the workers given that the amlo government itself would have preferred to avoid the struggle in order to get along with the businessmen now the workers face repression from the bosses in the form of dismissals but the proletariat on the border is not intimidated it is pushing for more now that the amlo government says that there must be union democracy a struggle will be unleashed to build unions to replace the fragments of ctm confederation of mexican workers and the like this will be done with or without the consent of the government the process has only just begun over these last 100 days and will tend towards generalisation at the national level regional struggles with regard to other social sectors it is important to emphasise the masses feelings of confidence in fact their greatest advantage for the moment is that they are not subject to the will of the new government for example there is a plan to build a thermoelectric plant in the state of morelos against the will of the inhabitants and they continue to struggle against its construction similar events have occurred around projects such as the gold mine in baja california which had to be cancelled due to the clamor of the masses and we will probably see struggles against projects in the isthmus of tehuantepec and the mayan train in all these cases the way forward is through class struggle working class organisation and independent mobilisation government proposals will have to confront the will of the masses in all the towns and regions of mexico women s rights the battle against women s oppression cannot be left for an indeterminate future it must be fought now image peace news a similar militancy can be seen in women s struggles it is clear that there will be not government initiative to apply the right to abortion nationwide which is currently provided by health services in mexico city for example a mass campaign will be necessary to see that this is carried through especially in the more backward regions such as guanajuato and nuevo león the same goes for the fight against femicide and for the true equality of women on these issues the impetus must come from below and the fight must be both systematic and systemic it is not a question of government policy alone but of a society poisoned by capitalism from which racism sexism and violence against the oppressed inexorably arise these battles cannot be left for an indeterminate future they must be fought now given that lives are currently being lost we must not lose sight of the fact that capitalist society will revive all the scourges of oppression and barbarism while it continues to exist in short the masses plan to take their destiny into their own hands if amlo is a partner in this all the better but they ll fight with or without him the national guard violent crime is another symptom of the capitalist crisis the president s response has been to create a new military force which will have 80 000 members the initiative is viewed with sympathy by the majority of the population given that it sounds like action rather than the empty words and window dressing of previous governments of course the reaction of large sectors of the masses that felt abandoned to rampant violence is very natural it is likely that in the long run we will see some effect in terms of more criminals being arrested but the main matter of concern is the creation of a body of armed men who being isolated from the masses can be used against them by this or future governments it could also be used against amlo himself marx pointed out the french national assembly at the time of louis bonaparte was dissolved at the hands of the armed forces it had created both the pri and the pan finally gave their approval to this new body perhaps thinking who knows maybe we will have to use this national guard to crush lópez obrador the alternative is not to sing songs of peace and love to the criminals but rather the armament of the people in the form of local militias elected in popular assemblies and placed under their oversight with the power of revocability this could be an armed force not of 80 000 but of 2 or 3 million an authentic people in arms how to fight against neoliberalism there is no doubt that amlo is genuinely a well intentioned person he has repeatedly pointed out that it is necessary to overcome neoliberalism which he identifies with corruption and the use of government positions for personal enrichment that is he acknowledges the relationship between economic power and political power instead of using the state to strengthen the oligarchy amlo intends is to use the state to distribute the wealth for the benefit of the poorest with state support ranging from 800 6 000 pesos depending on the individual case of course there is no one who opposes increasing the income of the poor except the oligarchs who consider it a mortal sin to waste money by giving it away to the poor they would prefer the continue the tradition of giving it away to the rich to put it in other words amlo aims to move from a government centred on the rich to one focused on the poor state support for 8 million seniors and 10 million high school students is just one example to finance this social investment he intends to combat another feature of neoliberalism corruption there is no doubt that amlo is genuinely a well intentioned person but his programme to create a government for the poor cannot succeed on a capitalist basis image salvador alc when it comes to any economic problem there seems to be only one response from the new government fight corruption of course there is a lot of sense in this let us suppose that the fight against corruption is successful that we all behave ourselves and we achieve savings and a budget of 500 billion pesos annually to distribute to the poor this would be an increase of 60 million enough provide about 8 400 pesos a year each per person this is better than nothing but hardly comparable to a job with an annual salary of 144 000 pesos which is necessary to pay for the basics in summary even if the programmes of the new government are successful they would still be inadequate to actually reduce poverty these policies mark a huge change from the governments of the pri and the pan but are not enough to eradicate poverty nevertheless the masses optimism is reflected in the consumer confidence indicator cci which reached 48 81 the highest level in all history to the bafflement of the bourgeois experts el sol de méxico 6 03 19 there are reasons for the masses to be optimistic including the fact that inflation 3 9 annually is at one of the lowest levels in five years to top it off the dollar currently averages 19 pesos while 100 days ago it exceeded 20 pesos international turbulence of course these circumstances are due to external factors such as the fact that donald trump is dedicated to destroying trade agreements with the whole world russia turkey india the eu but especially with china with whom he is carrying out a genuine trade war this has led the trump administration to exert relatively little pressure on mexico which in the short term creates a relatively advantageous scenario for mexican foreign trade which still has a valid treaty with the states the world economy is heading towards the collapse of the dollar although this process may still take some time and while this is happening the mexican economy survives by treading water in the face of international turbulence however when the international crisis erupts there will be no shield to protect us the shackle of debt neither has the printing of money nor further debt been resorted to the latter has angered us banks which like vampires live by sucking the blood of entire countries through interest on unpayable loans enrique peña nieto was a hero to the us banks since he took total indebtedness internal and external from 30 percent of gdp to 50 percent today allowing the bankers to earn billions pemex alone the privatised state oil company took on debt worth almost 100 billion dollars this was so painful that amlo says there will be no further loans even so the mexican debt does not compare for example with us debt which is 104 percent of gdp nor countries such as germany with 70 percent of gdp italy with 135 percent or china with over 200 percent as we have said on other occasions debt is one of the mechanisms that the bourgeoisie uses to drain the wealth of workers without creating a penny of value setting limits is a good thing as is avoiding a deficit and rejecting the idea that state expenditures can be reduced without implying a reduction in social spending however even with these measures the real power structures in mexico have not changed investment and development lópez obrador is right when he says that neoliberalism results in corruption but this is not the essence of it if we look at the economic structure of the country in 1982 and compare it with that of 2018 we find the basis of this economic model and understand how to break it in mexico the total investment in 1981 was around 30 percent of gdp almost 11 percent of it was public cuamatzin 2006 for 2017 it was 22 percent of which 19 percent was private and 3 percent government in other words neoliberalism has meant a relative reduction of 8 percent of gdp of public investment without the private capitalists investing more in fact the opposite is true the bourgeoisie was not able to develop the economy and the state almost collapsed until this situation is reversed we will have a government that criticises neoliberalism while actually administering it the only way to start combating this would be expropriating the rich and putting the biggest companies banks and financial organisations under the democratic control of the workers some will say that the capitalists are allied internationally and we would no longer receive any loans we say that in fact we could ignore the government debt declare it illegitimate in short not pay it then we would have resources for development and neoliberalism would end surely workers in the states given their own situation would sympathise with ignoring the national debt some would say that refusing to pay would require a revolution in the united states we say well yes that s the idea the fourth transformation must know no boundaries pension schemes in practically all sectors of the economy similar conditions are evident the last 30 years of counter reforms have generated a scheme of capitalist reproduction that feeds itself at the cost of the misery of the masses it must be destroyed or else the government will end up as an agent of this scheme let s take an example pensions were privatised between 1997 imss social security and 2007 issste social security and services for state workers this means that pensions are not guaranteed on retiring workers will receive what they manage to save pension fund managers meanwhile embezzle the money and earn commissions whether the funds go up or down barefaced robbery the proposal by the amlo administration is not to renationalise pensions but to expand their investment faculties while leaving them privately owned in the long run this will become a source of social conflicts of monstrous proportions at the moment these problems have not risen to the surface given that it will be until the middle of the next decade when workers retire to realise they have nothing at this point it is not enough fight corruption we must renationalise the funds and build a state administration as a source of productive investment with guaranteed pensions this is how to genuinely overthrow neoliberalism not one step backwards amlo emphasises that it is important to arrive at social harmony as a mechanism for the fourth transformation to be consolidated we consider social harmony to be an end not a means when exploitation and violence ends then there will be room for harmony meanwhile you cannot appeal to the patience of the people the most positive thing about the current situation is that it creates space to free up the class struggle against the exploiting classes the first 100 days of the amlo government have shown that the real conflicts are only just emerging image fair use morena amlo s party is not an organ of social control like the pri was it has neither the mechanisms nor the strength to subdue a single directive of the trade union peasant or even youth movement this is an opportunity that must be taken advantage of in order not to place limits on the struggles throughout mexican society the main enemies are the bourgeoisie and imperialism as long as the masses take the initiative it will be possible to advance the demands of the people and these first 100 days of the amlo government have shown that the real conflicts are only just emerging
here s our summary of key events overnight that affect new zealand with news things don t seem to be going the way of the us or china firstly however there was some good data out of north america at the end of this week american retail sales were up much more than analysts were expecting posting a 1 6 month on month annualised gain in march when half that was expected that is most of the 3 6 gain from the same month a year ago given that us inflation is 1 9 that is a modest real rise in retail sales and their inventory to sales ratio surprised by not getting worse but us housing start data wasn t so good for march down a concerning 15 from the same month a year ago and the early look at april business activity in the us shows it s growth is slowing sharply in fact that is now at a 31 month low driven by their giant services sector output new orders and hiring all show sharp pullbacks this downtrend is supported by the philadelphia feds regional index which also came in way below expectations it declined to a reading of 8 5 in april from 13 7 in march this index was at 32 3 in may 2018 so it has come a long way off over the border to the north canadian retail sales data also brought a stronger that expected rise in february data released overnight but to be fair most of this rise is accounted for by inflation trade over that border is supposed to be subject to the new updated nafta but a new official review casts doubt on the likely benefit for the us and that may reinforce the trouble the administration has getting congressional consent apparently its not a great deal at all for the americans even if it is for mexico and canada china has lost a key wto ruling in a dispute with the us over tariff levels for wheat rice and corn in australia a ray of hope for their manufacturing sector after declining for a many months the latest pmi data shows it expanding again equity markets ended last week in generally positive territory for all of 2019 so far the s p500 is up nearly 16 the german dax is up a similar amount the british ftse has gained a bit more than 10 in asia tokyo is up more than 13 hong kong is up 19 and shanghai takes the cake up 33 locally the asx is up 13 and the nzx50 is up 14 the ust 10yr yield has drifted off its recent rise and now down 4 bps at 2 56 but that is exactly where it was a week ago their 2 10 curve is little changed at 16 bps but their negative 1 5 curve is wider at 8 bps the aussie govt 10yr is at 1 95 and an overnight dip of 2 bps the china govt 10yr is down 4 bps at 3 39 while the nz govt 10 yr is at 2 00 and down 1 bp overnight gold is unchanged overnight at us 1 276 which is a us 2 gain from thursday but a 15 from for the week the vix volatility index is unchanged this week at 12 the average over the past year has been 16 the fear greed index we follow is also unchanged and still firmly on the greed side us oil prices are a little firmer now just on us 64 bbl while the brent benchmark is at us 72 bbl and the us rig count fell a little this week after last week s gain but it is still at a similar level to where it was last year the kiwi dollar is weaker this morning at 66 9 usc which is almost a 1c fall since this time last week all triggered by the cpi miss on the cross rates we are lower 93 5 auc against the euro we are at 59 5 euro cents that puts the twi 5 down to 71 5 bitcoin is at us 5 273 and that is a 4 5 gain since this time last week this rate is charted in the exchange rate set below the easiest place to stay up with event risk today is by following our economic calendar here

the global economy looks disturbingly like japan before its â lost decadeâ after world war ii japan experienced rapid growth as the us and others helped rebuild its economy this led to a roaring expansion that culminated in the 1980s japanese asset bubble it popped in the early 1990s bringing what came to be called the lost decade it was really more than a decade as the early 2000s brought only mild recovery gdp shrank wages fell and asset prices dropped or went sideways at best japan is still grappling with it today now the rest of the world is approaching a period that may be an equivalent of japan s lost decade it won t be the end of the world but it might be more painful than in japan japan s lost decades japan had little growth due mainly to exports that won t work when every major economy in the world is in the same position plus we are headed toward a global credit crisis i ve dubbed the great reset describing this decline as japanification may be unfair to japan but it s the best paradigm we have the good news is it will spread slowly the bad news is it will end slowly too i believe we will avoid literal blood in the streets but it will be a challenging time the lost decade had monetary roots the 1985 plaza accord drove the yen higher and inflated the asset bubble the bank of japan tried to pop the bubble with a series of rate hikes beginning in 1989 source mauldin economics upon reaching 6 in 1992 the boj began cutting rates and eventually reached zero a few years later since then it has made two short lived tightening attempts shown in the red circles neither worked and that was it no more rate hikes period japan has now kept its policy rate at or near zero for 20 years the boj also resorted to large qe like programs that also had little effect meanwhile the government tried assorted fiscal policies infrastructure projects deregulation tax cuts etc they had little effect too gdp growth has been stuck near zero plus or minus a couple of points so has inflation that said the boj s asset purchases certainly had an effect they more or less bought everything including stock etfs and other private assets japan is a prime example of faux capitalism all this capital is going into businesses not because they have innovative profit generating ideas but simply because they exist that s how you get zombie companies the result at least so far has been neither boom nor depression japan has its problems but people aren t standing in soup lines not working double down many say the present situation can t go on indefinitely but there s no exit in sight the bank of japan has bought every bond it can now they are buying stocks not just in japan but in the us as well they are trying to put yen into the system to generate inflation it

2016 with little effect from zero rates the fed launched qe and continued it despite the limited success and harmful side effects the european central bank did the same to even a great extent also with little effect which brings us to the next point why europe and the us will follow japan too much too fast the federal reserve spent 2017 and 2018 trying to exit from its various stimulus policies it began raising short term interest rates and reversing the qe program in hindsight it now appears the fed tried to do too much too fast my friend samuel rines calculated that when you include the qe tapering this fed tightening cycle was the most aggressive since paul volcker s draconian rate hikes in the early 1980s they should have started sooner and tightened more gradually for whatever reason they didn t and so the complaints began wall street wasn t happy but more important president trump wasn t pleased with the rate hikes but the real deal breaker may have been the late 2018 market tantrum then the yield curve inverted coinciding with weakening economic data that was probably the last straw the fed hasn t exactly loosened but there s a good chance it will later this year meanwhile the ecb s mario draghi had a tightening plan in place not so long ago that plan is now out the door before draghi is even close to gone so on both sides of the atlantic plans to exit from

washington reuters us retail sales increased by the most in 1 1 2 years in march as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles and a range of other goods the latest indication that economic growth picked up in the first quarter after a false start the economy s enduring strength was underscored by other data on thursday showing the number of americans filing applications for unemployment benefits dropped to the lowest in nearly 50 years last week fears of an abrupt slowdown in activity escalated at the turn of the year after a batch of weak economic reports but those concerns have dissipated in recent weeks amid fairly upbeat data on trade inventories and construction spending that have suggested growth last quarter could actually be better than the moderate pace logged in the final three months of 2018 a report from the federal reserve on wednesday described economic activity as expanding at a slight to moderate pace in march and early april the fed s beige book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide showed a few of the us central bank s districts reported some strengthening supported by strong labor market conditions and improving wage growth household spending appears well positioned to increase in the coming months said jim baird chief investment officer at plante moran financial advisors in kalamazoo michigan fears about the softening in the economy were overblown the commerce department said retail sales surged 1 6 percent last month that was the biggest increase since september 2017 and followed an unrevised 0 2 percent drop in february economists polled by reuters had forecast retail sales would accelerate 0 9 percent in march retail sales in march advanced 3 6 percent from a year ago with march s rebound retail sales have now erased december s plunge which had put consumer spending and the overall economy on a sharply lower growth trajectory retail sales last month were probably lifted by tax refunds even though they have been smaller than in previous years following the revamping of the us tax code in january 2018 excluding automobiles gasoline building materials and food services retail sales rebounded 1 0 percent in march after a downwardly revised 0 3 percent decline in february these so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product they were previously reported to have decreased 0 2 percent in february consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of economic activity and is being buoyed by a tightening labor market that is driving up wage growth strong labor market a separate report from the labor department on thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 5 000 to a seasonally adjusted 192 000 for the week ended april 13 the lowest level since september 1969 claims have now declined for five straight weeks economists had forecast claims would rise to 205 000 in the latest week though the trend in hiring has slowed job gains remain above the roughly 100 000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working age population the unemployment rate is at 3 8 percent near the 3 7 percent fed officials project it will be by the end of the year us stock index futures and us treasury yields rose after the release of the data the dollar gained against a basket of currencies march s strong core retail sales could result in the further upgrading of first quarter gdp estimates growth forecasts for the first quarter were boosted to around a 2 5 percent

after world war ii japan experienced rapid growth as the us and others helped rebuild its economy this led to a roaring expansion that culminated in the 1980s japanese asset bubble it popped in the early 1990s bringing what came to be called the lost decade it was really more than a decade as the early 2000s brought only mild recovery gdp shrank wages fell and asset prices dropped or went sideways at best japan is still grappling with it today now the rest of the world is approaching a period that may be an equivalent of japan s lost decade it won t be the end of the world but it might be more painful than in japan japan had little growth due mainly to exports that won t work when every major economy in the world is in the same position plus we are headed toward a global credit crisis i ve dubbed the great reset describing this decline as japanification may be unfair to japan but it s the best paradigm we have the good news is it will spread slowly the bad news is it will end slowly too i believe we will avoid literal blood in the streets but it will be a challenging time japan s lost decades the lost decade had monetary roots the 1985 plaza accord drove the yen higher and inflated the asset bubble the bank of japan tried to pop the bubble with a series of rate hikes beginning in 1989 source mauldin economics upon reaching 6 in 1992 the boj began cutting rates and eventually reached zero a few years later since then it has made two short lived tightening attempts shown in the red circles neither worked and that was it no more rate hikes period japan has now kept its policy rate at or near zero for 20 years the boj also resorted to large qe like programs that also had little effect meanwhile the government tried assorted fiscal policies infrastructure projects deregulation tax cuts etc they had little effect too gdp growth has been stuck near zero plus or minus a couple of points so has inflation that said the boj s asset purchases certainly had an effect they more or less bought everything including stock etfs and other private assets japan is a prime example of faux capitalism all this capital is going into businesses not because they have innovative profit generating ideas but simply because they exist that s how you get zombie companies the result at least so far has been neither boom nor depression japan has its problems but people aren t standing in soup lines not working double down many say the present situation can t go on indefinitely but there s no exit in sight the bank of japan has bought every bond it can now they are buying stocks not just in japan but in the us as well they are trying to put yen into the system to generate inflation it simply hasn t worked when you don t have a better answer the default is to do more of the same that s the case in japan europe and soon the us charles hugh smith described it pretty well recently the other dynamic of zombification japanification is past success shackles the power elites to a failed model the greater the past glory the stronger its hold on the national identity and the power elites and so the power elites do more of what s failed in increasingly extreme doses if lowering interest rates sparked secular growth then the power elites will lower interest rates to zero when that fails to move the needle they lower rates below zero i e negative interest rates when this too fails to move the needle they rig statistics to make it appear that all is well in the immortal words of mr junker when it becomes serious you have to lie and it s now serious all the time do more of what s failed in increasingly extreme doses also describes well the federal reserve policy from 2008 through 2016 with little effect from zero rates the fed launched qe and continued it despite the limited success and harmful side effects the european central bank did the same to even a great extent also with little effect which brings us to the next point why europe and the us will follow japan too much too fast the federal reserve spent 2017 and 2018 trying to exit from its various stimulus policies it began raising short term interest rates and reversing the qe program in hindsight it now appears the fed tried to do too much too fast my friend samuel rines calculated that when you include the qe tapering this fed tightening cycle was the most aggressive since paul volcker s draconian rate hikes in the early 1980s they should have started sooner and tightened more gradually for whatever reason they didn t and so the complaints began wall street wasn t happy but more important president trump wasn t pleased with the rate hikes but the real deal breaker may have been the late 2018 market tantrum then the yield curve inverted coinciding with weakening economic data that was probably the last straw the fed hasn t exactly loosened but there s a good chance it will later this year meanwhile the ecb s mario draghi had a tightening plan in place not so long ago that plan is now out the door before draghi is even close to gone so on both sides of the atlantic plans to exit from loose money now look disturbingly like those two little circles in the boj rate chart when it tried to hike and found it could not worse we are also replicating japan s fiscal policy with rapidly growing deficit spending in fact this year we will be exceeding it the japanese deficit as a percentage of gdp is projected to be below 4 while the us is closer to 5 and given the ever widening unfunded liabilities gap the us deficit will grow even larger in the future

18 04 2019 a delicate moment capital s major financial institutions are warning of the likelihood of another global recession notes michael roberts the international monetary fund world bank meeting in washington last weekend revealed again that the world economy is slowing down and the prospect of an outright recession is getting much higher the imf economists cut their outlook for global growth to the lowest since the global financial crisis of 2009 amid a bleaker outlook in most major advanced economies and signs that higher tariffs are weighing on trade a growth slowdown and precarious recovery the imf called it the imf estimates that the world economy will grow by 3 3 this year down from the 3 5 it had forecast for 2019 in january it is the third time the imf has downgraded its outlook in six months its new chief economist gita gopinath reckoned the global economy had entered a delicate moment she offered a decisive insight if the downside risks do not materialise and the policy support put in place is effective global growth should rebound if however any of the major risks materialise then the expected recoveries in stressed economies export dependent economies and highly indebted economies may be derailed so on the one hand or on the other alongside the imf view the private brookings institution delivered its view on the global economy concluding from its tracking index of economic activity that the world had entered a synchronised slowdown which may be difficult to reverse the brookings ft tracking index for the global economic recovery tiger compares indicators of real activity financial markets and investor confidence with their historical averages for the global economy and for individual countries the headline readings slipped back significantly at the end of last year and are at their lowest levels for both advanced and emerging economies since 2016 the year of the weakest global economic performance since the financial crisis brookings did not reckon a recession was imminent but all parts of the world economy were losing momentum even if a global recession is not yet with us it is clear from the latest data on the major economies that the long depression as i have characterised this period since 2009 is still with us frances coppola the heterodox economist has also blogged that capitalism is locked into a long depression and makes similar points to me on its outcome but as for causes coppola like other keynesians holds to the idea of secular stagnation namely that the depression is due to a chronic lack of demand regular readers will know that i do not consider this is an adequate explanation of crises and depressions in a profit making economy it is the profitability of capital that matters and here the imf s new global stability report offers more support for my causal interpretation of the long depression confirming what i have shown empirically the imf finds that corporate profitability as measured by corporate earnings as a share of the stock of assets in the major economies has not recovered to 2008 levels indeed profitability of capital is well below the levels of the late 1990s this long depression has similar characteristics as the late 19th century depression and the great depression of the 1930s the first was resolved by a series of slumps eventually driving up profitability and the second by a world war it is my view that this one will be resolved more like the 19th century one profitability low profitability explains above all else why corporate investment has been so weak since 2009 what profits have been made have been switched into financial speculations mergers and acquisitions share buybacks and dividend payouts also there has been hoarding of cash all this is because the profitability of productive investment remains historically low as gillian tett in the ft put it the imf calculates that american companies made shareholder payouts and buybacks that were worth 0 9 of assets last year twice the level seen in 2010 little wonder that equity markets have soared leaving aside the wobble late last year companies have also used this arsenal for a mergers and acquisitions boom such deals gobbled up cash flows equivalent to 0 4 of assets in 2019 compared with virtually nothing in 2011 but the amount of cash flow spent on in contrast has flatlined since 2012 running at around 0 7 of all assets smaller than the cash flow spend on shareholder payouts or as the imf report notes strong profits in the united states were used for payouts and other financial risk taking but not it seems lots more investment the other key factor in the long depression has been the rise in debt particularly corporate debt with profitability low companies have run up more debt in order to fund projects or speculate the big companies like apple or microsoft can do this because they have cash hoards to fall back on if anything goes wrong the smaller companies can only manage this debt spiral because interest rates remain at all time lows and so servicing the debt is still feasible as long as there is not a downturn in sales and profits again the imf s global stability report sums up the issue in most advanced economies debt service capacity in the corporate sector improved during the recent cyclical upswing balance sheets appear strong enough to sustain a moderate economic slowdown or a gradual tightening of financial conditions however overall debt levels and financial risk taking have increased and creditworthiness of borrowers has deteriorated in the investment grade bond and leveraged loan markets a significant downturn or a sharp tightening of financial conditions could lead to a notable repricing of credit risks and strain the debt service capacity of indebted firms should monetary and financial conditions remain easy for longer debt will likely continue to rise over the medium term in the absence of policy action raising the risk of a sharper adjustment in the future each crisis has a different trigger or proximate cause the 1974 75 international recession was triggered by a sharp rise in oil prices and the us coming off the dollar gold standard the 1980 82 slump was triggered by a housing bubble in europe and a manufacturing crisis in major economies the 1990 92 recession was triggered by the iraq war and oil prices the 2001 mild recession was the result of the bursting of the dot com bubble and the great recession was started with the collapse of the housing bubble in the us and the ensuing credit crunch brought on by the international diversification of credit derivatives but underlying each of these crises was the downward movement in the profitability of productive capital and eventually a slowdown or decline in the mass of profits the profit investment nexus this time i reckon the trigger will be in corporate debt as companies get overstretched on cheap credit and as profits fall and interest costs rise they become insolvent marxist economist eric toussaint of the committee for the abolition of illegitimate debt cadtm agrees this mountain of corporate private debt will be a prime element in the next financial crisis he points out as interest rates climb the value of corporative debt sinks the greater the share of sinking corporate debt in a company s assets the greater the negative impact on the corporate balance sheet the corporate equity value sinks too and may get to a point where it no longer covers its obligations in 2016 apple informed us authorities that in the case of a 1 increase in interest rates it would lose 4 9 billion of course just like other companies apple borrowed to finance its debt purchases in 2017 apple has already borrowed 28 billion bringing the total to 75 billion this by domino effect could produce a crisis of similar ampler to that of the us financial crisis in 2007 08 as the imf chief economist puts it capitalism is in a delicate moment michael roberts blogs

finance late tax returns affect retailers counting on a shopping boost the u s economy is expected to cruise along at a moderate speed this year after whizzing past the speed limit last year one major change this year are income taxes and whether people are paying more or less under the trump administration s revised tax code implemented under the tax code and jobs act of 2017 this bill eliminated personal exemptions and certain itemized deductions but doubled the standard deduction and adjusted tax brackets state and local tax deductions were capped at 10 000 a year this is the first year the full effect of the revision is being felt by individuals who were wondering whether they would be receiving a bigger refund or paying more in taxes than before so far the results are mixed the tax policy center predicted that 82 percent of middle class workers described as households making 49 000 to 86 000 a year would receive a tax cut averaging about 1 050 about 9 percent of middle class households were expected to pay more and the rest were expected to pay the same in taxes but hard hit were wealthier households in states including california new york new jersey connecticut and pennsylvania where state local and property taxes are high and people generally earn higher wages than in the rest of the country in california many people had sticker shock after visiting their tax preparers and finding they needed to write a check to the internal revenue service instead of getting a refund this is due in part to withholding tables being adjusted to reflect the lower tax rates but these changes did not take into account other tax law updates such as the reduction in itemized deductions for retailers this tax year is well taxing first tax refunds are arriving two weeks to four weeks later than normal because of the 35 day government shutdown that ran dec 28 2018 to jan 25 this year second consumers may be spending their tax refunds on things such as vacations or putting their refunds into savings accounts or paying down debt because refunds are 15 to 30 days later than normal retailers have not felt the impact of those refunds as early as last year said britt beemer founder of america s research group which polls 1 200 consumers a week to take the pulse of their retail spending attitude the good news is that if consumers decide to go on a vacation spree shopping is always part of that fun mix of exploring and spending time away from home for americans 26 percent of their time on vacation is spent on shopping beemer said that is even more than the japanese who spend 25 percent of their time shopping when on vacation jack kleinhenz the chief economist for the national retail federation said an nrf survey in february found that 50 percent of consumers were planning to put their tax refunds into their savings accounts and 34 percent said they were planning to pay down debt my hypothesis for this is that we had a volatile stock market at the end of last year and earlier this year kleinhenz said people pulled back spending in december and that continued in january consumers are still being guarded and putting money away to cope with any financial headwinds that was seen when the u s census on april 18 released data on march retail sales in short online sales did really well they were up 9 2 percent over last year established bricks and mortar sales were challenged clothing and clothing accessory stores saw sales dip 2 6 percent from last march sporting goods stores continued in negative territory with sales sliding 10 8 percent over last year much of this is because easter and other religious holidays fall in april this year as opposed to march last year challenging retail still retail sales overall are expected to be slightly better than last year kleinhenz said with the nrf sticking to its forecast of a 3 8 percent to 4 4 percent rise in sales to 3 8 trillion in 2019 but shopping malls will continue to face hurdles as consumers spend more time on their computers placing orders for everything from bedroom furniture to swimsuits i do see the malls being more and more challenged beemer said during the holiday season only 19 percent of families shopped the malls which is an all time low those people under the age of 35 that used to live in malls as kids are refusing to go back and buy their abercrombie fitch clothes now it is a whole different story shoppers complain mall stores don t vary that much from shopping center to shopping center and it takes too long to park their car and walk into a shopping mall than parking at a big store with an adjacent parking lot the consumer is going through a big sea change and when they come out of this tidal wave you are going to see another set of retailers go away he noted beemer predicts more retailers will be going out of business in the next 24 months than in the last 24 months california cooling economists are expecting a bit of a slowdown in the u s and california as the country s gross domestic product is predicted to rise about 2 percent this year compared with 2 9 percent last year california s unemployment rate will probably rise slightly to 4 5 percent later this year from its 4 2 percent rate in january but it will dip back down again in 2020 and 2021 to 4 3 percent one major change for california this year will be seen in housing prices which won t be experiencing their usual ride to the sky as in past years single family housing prices went up 6 3 percent in 2018 said raymond sfeir director of the a gary anderson center for economic research at chapman university in orange calif housing prices won t exceed a 3 1 percent increase this year and in the first quarter they were up only 1 4 percent many consumers gauge their personal wealth on the value of their homes but homeowners won t be losing any equity in their houses just less of a year over year big jump we don t see any recession this year at all sfeir said interest rates have stabilized which is a plus for the economy as a whole

end mandatory arbitration in adviser and broker contracts on february 28 2019 u s sen sherrod brown d oh ranking member of the u s senate banking committee introduced the arbitration fairness for consumers act a measure which would end pre dispute arbitration agreements that are part of nearly every brokerage and investment adviser contract the legislation is primarily focused on student loans credit card agreements and employment contracts but the bill would also apply to the arbitration system for broker customer disputes run by finra as well as to the american arbitration association system used by most investment adviser clients according to the press release issued by sen brown when introducing the bill it is supported by several consumer groups the arbitration legislation will face a challenging landscape as it proceeds on capitol hill where democrats control the house and republicans hold the majority in the senate maryland joins other states in pursuing fiduciary regulations maryland has joined other states including nevada new jersey and washington in introducing fiduciary regulations in early february 2019 the financial consumer protection act of 2019 was introduced in maryland s house and senate chambers the act would deem both brokers and insurance agents fiduciaries with a duty to act in the best interest of the customer without regard to the financial or other interest of the person or firm providing the advice as with other state proposals maryland s proposal would create a blanket fiduciary rule for all advisors the securities industry and financial markets association sifma argues against state fiduciary regulations sifma recently reiterated its opposition to state fiduciary initiatives explaining that it believes the sec s proposed regulation best interest regulation bi will preempt state action in this area arguing that regulation bi should be a substitute for and not an addition to any state fiduciary standard in arguing that regulation bi would preempt state fiduciary laws sifma relies on the national securities markets improvements act a 1996 law that delegated the authority to regulate the u s securities industry to federal agencies which forced states to conform their financial regulations and recordkeeping requirements to the securities exchange act of 1934 and other federal laws sifma s position is that states have no authority to enact rules that require financial professionals to keep more records than federal law mandates sifma spokeswoman lindsay gilbride stated to the extent a state passes a statute or regulation that includes or requires a books records requirement that is new or different than bi or other books and records requirements under the exchange act and finra rules it is preempted sec commissioner advises states to wait for finalization of regulation bi before moving ahead with state fiduciary regulations on march 7 2019 sec commissioner hester peirce said that states should wait until the sec s regulation bi is finalized before they move ahead with their own best interest rules i do think it would be helpful to have a common standard ms peirce stated during a q a session at the iawatch compliance conference in washington d c she urged the industry to take a close look at the standards set forth in regulation bi and said the states continued input in the process of finalizing regulation bi is important to the sec xbrl taxonomy update the sec announced on march 11 2019 that its edgar system was upgraded to release 19 1 and now supports the 2019 u s

discuss the latest developments for registered investment companies and investment advisers to consider in connection with potential use cases and strategies of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies sec seeks input regarding blockchain role in asset custody regulations in a public letter sent to the investment adviser association iaa on march 14 2019 the sec sought input regarding whether blockchain can help investment advisers track client assets and whether such advisers consider tokens and cryptocurrencies to be securities or funds incorporating new technology into the agency s evaluation of asset custody regulations the sec asked advisers how regulations are being applied in the digital arena what unique risks are associated with the custody of digital assets and how the transaction process works the sec also asked to what extent distributed ledger or decentralized technology such as blockchain could enhance or diminish client protection when settling transactions involving assets other than securities such as funds swaps and bank loans the iaa has been working with sec staff to elucidate scenarios in which the agency deems advisers to have taken custody of digital assets a designation which not only comes with additional compliance expectations but also has raised concerns for the iaa the iaa plans to detail those and other concerns in its response to the sec cryptocurrency futures intercontinental exchange ice owner of the n y s e is planning to launch the first futures contract that would pay out in bitcoin the launch of bakkt ice s name for the project has been delayed due to a lack of commodity futures trading commission cftc approval in february 2019 the cftc told ice that bakkt s plan to store customers bitcoins would require disclosures of the venture s business plan and a public comment period which would further delay approval of the project ice and the cftc are discussing alternative ways for bakkt to custody customer funds to mitigate any further delays sec approval of cryptocurrency exchange traded fund etf currently the sec has not approved any proposals for a cryptocurrency etf despite the recent slew of rejections robert j jackson jr a commissioner at the sec indicated that a cryptocurrency etf will likely be approved at some point in time guidance on investment contract analysis of digital assets and no action letter on april 3 2019 the sec released staff guidance titled framework for investment contract analysis of digital assets which applies the factors set forth in sec v w j howey co 328 u s 293 1946 to determine whether a digital asset that is offered and sold is an investment contract under the federal securities laws the factors set forth in howey the howey test are 1 an investment of money 2 an expectation of profits from the investment 3 whether the investment of money is in a common enterprise and 4 whether any of the profits arise from the efforts of a promoter or third party the staff guidance is non binding and does not alter the requirements established in howey or other related securities law analysis in existing court decisions but it does provide insight into how the sec intends to apply the howey test to digital assets and when the sec may determine to pursue possible violations of the securities laws the staff guidance for the first time provides a roadmap for utility tokens focusing on whether the digital asset purchaser has a reasonable expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others this analysis is objective focused on the transaction itself and the manner in which the digital asset is offered and sold in determining whether a digital asset purchaser relies on the efforts of others namely active participants promoters sponsors or other parties who traditionally participate in the offer and sale of securities the staff analyzed two key issues does the purchaser reasonably expect to rely on the efforts of an active participant and are those efforts the undeniably significant ones those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise the staff guidance focuses on a number of elements that will influence the determination including whether the active participant is responsible for the network including whether the network or the digital asset is fully functional at the time of the offer or sale whether essential tasks or responsibilities will be performed by an active participant rather than unaffiliated users who are spread around the globe whether an active participant creates or supports a market or the price of the digital asset including controlling the creation and issuance of the digital asset whether an active participant has a lead or central role in the direction of the ongoing development and governance of the network in which the digital asset is created whether an active participant has a continuing managerial role regarding the network or the characteristics of the digital asset and whether purchasers reasonably expect the active participant to undertake efforts to promote its interests and enhance the value of the network or digital assets the core focus is whether an active participant provides essential managerial efforts that affect the success of the enterprise as such the less control the active participants have the less likely the sec is to find that the purchaser was relying on the efforts of others with respect to whether a digital asset purchaser has a reasonable expectation of profits the staff looked at whether the digital asset gives the holder a share in the enterprise s income or profits whether the digital asset is transferable including whether it is or may be traded on a secondary market or platform whether purchasers would reasonably expect that an active participant s efforts would result in capital appreciation whether the digital asset was offered to any potential purchaser or more narrowly targeted only to users of the goods or services associated with the digital asset correlation between the offering or purchase price and the price of the goods or services to be acquired in exchange for the digital asset correlation between typical quantities of digital assets traded and the amount of underlying goods or services a typical consumer would purchase for use or consumption whether proceeds from the offering exceed what may be needed to create and maintain the functional network for the digital asset whether the active participant benefits from its efforts as a result of holding the same class of digital assets whether the active participant continues to expend funds from the proceeds to enhance the functionality or value of the network or digital asset and whether there are any other relevant elements of the marketing of the digital asset that support a profit intent the staff also disclosed that it will consider other factors that inform the economic reality of the transactions such as whether the network for the digital asset is functional at launch whether the digital asset can be used immediately to transfer value to another holder and whether the active participants promote secondary market trading of the digital asset are other factors in making the determination of whether a digital asset is a security this staff guidance provides additional analytical details as to how the sec will view token offerings and where key distinctions should be made in determining whether digital asset sales fall outside of the howey test analysis regarding the reasonable expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others thus providing a clear indication that certain utility tokens can be issued without fear of making an unregistered distribution of securities also on april 3 2019 the sec issued a no action letter regarding turnkey jet inc turnkey related to its digital asset offering turnkey is an interstate air charter service provider that plans to use digital tokens to facilitate air travel transactions in the no action letter the staff of the division of corporation finance of the sec said it would not recommend an enforcement action to the commission if in reliance on a token issuer s opinion as counsel that the tokens to be distributed were not securities the token issuer offers and sells the tokens without registration under the securities act and the exchange act because 1 funds from the digital asset sales would not be used to develop turnkey s blockchain platform network or app 2 tokens would be immediately useable upon purchase 3 tokens would only be tradeable in the turnkey wallet and not across external platforms 4 the token value would be maintained at one u s dollar and can only be resold to turnkey at a discount to its face value and 5 turnkey s marketing material focuses on the functionality of the token rather than the token s potential increase in market value accordingly this no action letter

one area where the two parties of the millionaires and billionaires put in place policies that favor the rich are tax laws tax policy has favored the wealthy under both parties but the trump administration has brought this tax corruption to new levels we need to transform tax policy to build the working class base of the economy shrink the wealth divide and confront the climate crisis an honest analysis of the tax code calls out in stark detail the extreme injustice of the economy in the united states the tax system favors the wealthy as low and middle income people are hit the hardest while big business and high income people are subsidized the most regressive tax of all is the fica payroll tax at 15 3 percent for social security and medicare 15 3 percent includes the employer match but employers include the tax in their labor budgets and it limits what they can pay their workers the 12 4 percent social security share of fica is outright regressive because it is capped for high income earners at 128 400 in 2018 the trump tax favors the wealthy at the expense of the working class on december 19 2017 the trump tax bill passed congress it was a gift for big business and the wealthy it cut tax rates for corporations to 21 percent from 35 percent it created a new 20 percent deduction for pass through businesses that is favorable to commercial real estate companies like the trumps it lowered individual tax rates for the wealthy in the top bracket to 37 percent from 39 6 it also helped the super rich by exempting larger inheritances from the estate tax doubling the thresholds to 11 million for individuals and 22 million for married couples the benefits of the trump law go to the most wealthy people in the united states the tax policy center reported that the top 0 1 percent would receive an average tax benefit of 193 380 in 2018 and over half of the bill s total benefits would go to the top 10 percent of earners the joint committee on taxation the official congressional scorekeeper estimates that by 2027 every income group making less than 75 000 would see a net tax increase jpmorgan chase the biggest bank in the country bragged to its investors that the trump tax cuts increased its bottom line by 3 7 billion people know the trump tax was for the rich and not them nearly two thirds favor its outright repeal the trump tax bill is the opposite direction the country needs to go at a time of record wealth divides when three people have the wealth of half the population the trump tax law made inequality worse as it resulted in a record amount being spent to buy back stock more than 1 trillion artificially raising stock prices and increasing top management pay and investment earnings tax cuts for the rich hurt the economy for working people the trump tax bill has once again demonstrated the failure of supply side tax cuts for the rich to trickle down to the rest of us as expanded production more jobs and higher wages this trickle down theory in practice just makes the rich richer given capitalism s endemic tendency to overproduction more money for the rich is not invested in the real economy of production but in financial maneuvers like stock buy backs which simply rearrange and concentrate who owns the real productive assets of the economy it would be more productive and efficient to tax the rich and invest that money through the public sector in needed programs like improved medicare for all and needed infrastructure and production like mass transit and clean energy systems growing economic inequality the income gap between the rich and everyone else has been growing markedly by every major statistical measure for more than 40 years as of 2017 the richest 0 1 percent take in 188 times as much income as the bottom 90 percent between 1979 and 2007 paycheck income for those in the richest 1 percent and 0 1 percent exploded meanwhile the bottom 90 percent of earners have seen little change in their average income with just a 22 percent increase from 1979 to 2017 an estimated 43 5 percent of the u s population 140 million people are either poor or low income according the the u s bureau of labor statistics supplemental poverty measure which is a far more realistic measure of actual living costs compared to the old official poverty line which simply multiplies the minimum food diet by three as bad as income inequality is wealth inequality is even more pronounced the wealthiest 5 percent own two thirds of the nation s wealth the top 10 percent owns nearly 80 percent of the nation s wealth over the past three decades the most affluent u s families have added dramatically to their net worth while those on the bottom have dipped into negative wealth i e their debts exceed the value of their assets when looked at through a racial lens the situation is even worse the median black family with just over 3 500 net wealth owns just 2 percent of the net wealth of the median white family at nearly 147 000 the proportion of black families with zero or negative wealth rose by 8 5 percent to 37 percent between 1983 and 2016 the median white family has 41 times more wealth than the median black family and 22 times more wealth than the median latino family the u s poverty rate for white men is 7 0 percent while it is 21 4 percent for black women 18 7 percent for latinas and 22 8 percent for native american women the low wealth and high poverty in communities of color are not only due to current policy but the enduring impacts of slavery and racial discrimination and exclusion in the united states since its founding major investments and empowerment of communities of color are essential to create economic and racial justice the tax system should reduce inequality we need a tax plan that takes the opposite approach of the trump tax plan and the obama era tax plan that preceded it a february 2019 poll found that 76 percent of registered voters want the wealthiest americans to pay more rather than failing to build the economy by reducing taxes on the wealthy we need to actually build the economy by creating a strong foundation of purchasing power in the working class by ending poverty and economic insecurity first we need to end the regressive payroll tax by lifting the 128 400 cap on social security taxes currently undocumented immigrants contribute billions of dollars in federal taxes each year and their income taxes and payroll tax dollars are keeping social security and medicare solvent showing the hypocrisy and dishonesty of the immigration debate in the u s lifting the cap on taxes for the wealthy would put social security on such a firm financial footing that it would be a major contribution to doubling social security payments in order to address the retirement security crisis second put in place more a progressive income tax especially on the wealthiest in capital in the twenty first century thomas piketty recommends top marginal income tax rates of 80 percent on income above 500 000 and 50 or 60 percent on income above about 200 000 for the united states in order to combat inequality and fully fund and revitalize the public sector in fact throughout the 1950s and until 1962 the top marginal tax rate was over 90 percent and remained over 70 percent until 1980 this was a period of shared prosperity where wages kept pace with increases in productivity the high top marginal rates incentivized top management to reinvest earnings in their companies instead of bleeding them dry with excessive executive compensation as we have seen over the last 40 years with the decline of us manufacturing third institute a wealth tax emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman of the university of california berkeley proposed taxing wealth in excess of 50 million at 2 percent per year and wealth above 1 billion at an additional 1 percent tax this would affect only seventy five thousand households and would raise some 2 8 trillion over a decade fourth increase the inheritance tax reversing the trend of reducing such taxes senator bernie sanders has proposed a top rate of 77 percent on estates worth more than 1 billion and rates of at least 45 percent on estates valued above 3 5 million this would raise up to 315 billion over a decade and only impact the wealthiest not the ability of people to pass down their home to their children or small businesses or family farms fifth tax wealth at the same rates we tax work capital gains profits from the sale of stocks bonds and other assets are taxed at much lower rates than income from work is taxed the current top federal rate for this tax is 20 percent compared with the top income tax rate of 37 percent this reform would impact the very wealthy for households making over 10 million capital gains account for 46 4 percent of income for households making less than 100 000 capital gains account for a tiny 0 7 percent of the income sixth put in place a progressive carbon tax as a tool to combat the climate crisis a progressive carbon tax taxes carbon at its source some of its proceeds are returned to individuals and households as rebates and other proceeds fund the transition to clean renewable energy funding a green new deal more progressive and ecological taxation is essential to fund the ecosocialist green new deal for climate and economic security the goals are to transition to 100 percent green energy by 2030 while ending the insecurity of the economy with an economic bill of rights that guarantees to all living wage jobs an income above poverty decent housing comprehensive health care and lifelong public education from pre k through college the green new deal can close racial income and wealth gaps by empowering racially oppressed communities through community control of green new deal programs so these communities are no longer subject to discrimination and exploitation by outside employers landlords real estate agents and other gatekeepers in addition hr 40 for a commission to study and develop reparation proposals for african americans should be enacted to find the best way to create individual and collective wealth to compensate for hundreds of years of unpaid and underpaid labor in addition to a more progressive tax system we need to get our spending priorities straight the u s military budget is greater than those of the next 10 largest military powers combined and eight of them are us allies the military budget takes more than 60 percent of federal discretionary spending totaling 989 billion annually 21 trillion of pentagon financial transactions between 1998 and 2015 cannot be traced documented or explained the u s can cut its military budget by 75 percent and still spend more on the military than any other nation we can invest the resulting peace dividend in a global green new deal to meet basic needs like clean water and preventive health care around the world as well as to help developing countries leap over the fossil fuel age into the solar age by acting as the world s humanitarian superpower instead of its global military occupation force we can make friends instead of enemies a global green new deal will build a sustainable peace where the world s nations work cooperatively to solve our common problems of the climate and poverty amazon run by jeff bezos the world s richest man paid no federal taxes on 11 2 billion in profits in 2018 in comparison undocumented people contribute some 11 billion in taxes every year the third richest man in the world warren buffett admits

by an increase of 2 7 million or 126 2 in interest paid on deposits and borrowings the increase in net interest income between the periods was primarily due to the increase in the weighted average

during the six months ended march 31 2019 from 1 03 during the comparable period in 2018 primarily due to increases in market rates of interest reflecting in part the competitive market for deposits in the areas in which the company operates for the three and six months ended march 31 2019 the net interest margin was 2 26 and 2 27 respectively compared to 2 83 and 2 81 for the same periods in fiscal 2018 respectively the margin compression experienced in the 2019 periods reflected in large part the higher funding costs resulting from the increases in the federal funds rates combined with a competitive market for funding deposits asset yields have not risen as quickly as liability costs in response to the rising interest rate environment exacerbated by the competitive market for funding sources especially locally sourced deposits non interest income non interest income amounted to 542 000 and 922 000 for the three and six month periods ended march 31 2019 respectively compared to 567 000 and 982 000 respectively for the comparable periods in fiscal 2018 the decrease experienced in both of the 2019 periods was primarily attributable to the decrease in derivative related income in 2019 periods from the 2018 periods the effect of this decrease was partially offset by investment gains during the quarter and six months ended march 31 2019 non interest expenses for the three and six month periods ended march 31 2019 non interest expense increased 277 000 or 7 2 and 226 000 or 2 9 respectively compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year non interest expense increased in the fiscal 2019 periods due in part to the hiring of additional personnel in our lending operations normal salary increases as well as increases in benefit plan expenses partially offsetting these

ended march 31 2019 the company recorded a tax expense of 380 000 compared to a tax expense of 619 000 for the same period in fiscal 2018 for the six month period ended march 31 2019 the company recorded an income tax expense of 809 000 as compared to a tax expense of 2 9 million for the same period in fiscal 2018 the reduction in the three month period reflected a benefit in 2019 associated with company stock benefit plans combined with the decrease in the federal statutory income tax rate the 2 9 million tax expense for the six months ended march 31 2018 includes a one time charge of 1 8 million related to a re evaluation of the company s deferred tax assets due to the tax legislation enacted in december 2017 that reduced the statutory federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 balance

stockholders equity increased by 5 5 million to 133 9 million at march 31 2019 from 128 4 million at september 30 2018 the increase was primarily due to net income of 4 3 million combined with a 3 6

no provision for loan losses for the three and six months ended march 31 2019 respectively compared to provisions for loan losses of 150 000 and 360 000 respectively for the same periods in fiscal

construction loans and a rising interest rate environment the average balance of interest earning assets increased by 206 4 million or 23 3 from the comparable period in 2018 the yield on interest earning assets increased by 17 basis points to 3 89 for the six months ended march 31 2019 from the comparable period in 2018 the weighted average cost of borrowings and deposits increased to 1 83 during the six months ended march 31 2019 from 1 03 during the comparable period in 2018 primarily due to increases in market rates of interest reflecting in part the competitive market for deposits in the areas in which the company operates for the three and six months ended march 31 2019 the net interest margin was 2 26 and 2 27 respectively compared to 2 83 and 2 81 for the same periods in fiscal 2018 respectively the margin compression experienced in the 2019 periods reflected in large part the higher funding costs resulting from the increases in the federal funds rates combined with a competitive market for funding deposits asset yields have not risen as quickly as liability costs in response to the rising interest rate environment exacerbated by the competitive market for funding sources especially locally sourced deposits non interest income non interest income amounted to 542 000 and 922 000 for the three and six month periods ended march 31 2019 respectively compared to 567 000 and 982 000 respectively for the comparable periods in fiscal 2018 the decrease experienced in both of the 2019 periods was primarily attributable to the decrease in derivative related income in 2019 periods from the 2018 periods the effect of this decrease was partially offset by investment gains during the quarter and six months ended march 31 2019 non interest expenses for the three and six month periods ended march 31 2019 non interest expense increased 277 000 or 7 2 and 226 000 or 2 9 respectively compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year non interest expense increased in the fiscal 2019 periods due in part to the hiring of additional personnel in our lending operations normal salary increases as well as increases in benefit plan expenses partially offsetting these increases were decreases in professional fees and occupancy expense as the company maintained its focus on continued implementation of operating efficiencies income taxes for the three month period ended march 31 2019 the company recorded a tax expense of 380 000 compared to a tax expense of 619 000 for the same period in fiscal 2018 for the six month period ended march 31 2019 the company recorded an income tax expense of 809 000 as compared to a tax expense of 2 9 million for the same period in fiscal 2018 the reduction in the three month period reflected a benefit in 2019 associated with company stock benefit plans combined with the decrease in the federal statutory income tax rate the 2 9 million tax expense for the six months ended march 31 2018 includes a one time charge of 1 8 million related to a re evaluation of the company s deferred tax assets due to the tax legislation enacted in december 2017 that reduced the statutory federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 balance

million to 503 6 million as compared to 366 1 million at september 30 2018 primarily as a result of the purchase of u s government agency mortgage backed securities net loans receivable decreased 21 3 million to 581 6 million at march 31 2019 from 602 9 million at september 30 2018 total liabilities increased by 115 7 million to 1 1 billion at march 31 2019 from 952 8 million at september 30 2018

fhlb advances outstanding of 225 1 million as compared to 154 7 million at september 30 2018 the increase in the level of borrowings was primarily due to the match funding of purchases of investment securities in order to lock in the yield with minimal interest rate risk as part of the company s asset liability management all of the borrowings had maturities of less than six years total stockholders equity increased by 5 5 million to 133 9 million at march 31 2019 from 128 4 million at september 30 2018 the increase was primarily due to net income of 4 3 million combined with a 3 6 million increase in the appreciation in the fair market value of available for sale securities due to increased market rates of interest these increases were partially offset by net treasury stock repurchases net of stock plan activity of 1 2 million and dividend payments of 893 000 asset quality at march 31 2019 the company s non performing assets totaled 13 9 million or 1 2 of total assets as

no provision for loan losses for the three and six months ended march 31 2019 respectively compared to provisions for loan losses of 150 000 and 360 000 respectively for the same periods in fiscal 2018 primarily due to the decrease in the size of the loan portfolio and to a lesser degree the reduction in the amount of non performing loans during the three and six months ending march 31 2019 the company recorded no charge offs and recorded one recovery in the amount of 58 000 during the quarter ended march 31 2019 during the three and six months ended march 31 2018 the company recorded a

central bank independence is increasingly at risk around the world in the u s president donald trump reportedly still plans to nominate political allies to the federal reserve even after potential nominee herman cain withdrew in the face of stiff opposition in italy the government proposed seizing control of banca italia s approximately us 100 billion in gold reserves which it reportedly would use to fund spending plans and has threatened the central bank s independence in other ways they re not alone governments and lawmakers in turkey the u k india and elsewhere have been steadily eroding the bedrock idea that a central bank should be left alone to manage the economy based on evidence and data not political goals this is motivating numerous commentators to write farewell notes for the concept of central bank independence i agree with their concern and find government interference deeply troubling that s because a large body of economic research makes it quite clear placing monetary policy into the hands of an independent central banker who bases decisions on evidence and data instead of populist ideals leads to lower inflation and greater economic stability key ingredients of a strong economy and as i know from research i ve done with a variety of colleagues political meddling comes with a hefty price tag while it is incredibly hard to build a sound central bank that is trusted by investors and citizens it is even harder to do so after its credibility has been corroded the promise of easy credit there s a reason politicians like to gain control over a central bank it s a powerful institution that literally supplies constituents with cheap money via lower interest rates creating jobs and boosting growth in the process at least in the short term to underscore the kind of weaponry central banks bring to bear economists and journalists use the term bazooka to describe their firepower and with populists taking power across the globe on promises of endless economic prosperity governments are tempted to use this bazooka to help meet them lowering interest rates is one such weapon another is the ability to essentially create money out of thin air even though technically central banks don t print cash this can help governments fill budget shortfalls and fund new spending programs presumably in the hope of more votes on election day economists call the ability to withstand such political pressures and steer the financial side of an economy in a consistent manner monetary credibility attempts to manipulate interest rates or to regain control over monetary policy for political gain is effectively undermining this credibility the price of political meddling a few historical examples show what can happen when a government meddles with a central bank in 1971 u s president richard nixon successfully pressured federal reserve chair arthur burns to lower interest rates which juiced up the economy and helped him win reelection the following year americans paid dearly for nixon s victory however as the low interest rates helped fuel double digit inflation throughout most of the 1970s and hurt the value of the u s dollar the fed s efforts to fight these rising prices with higher interest rates resulted in two recessions political interference in monetary policymaking can have even worse effects in countries that rely heavily on international investors to fund governments and the private sector hungary s decision to revoke its central bank s independence in 2011 prompted credit rating agencies to downgrade the country s debt to junk status this caused the currency to fall to record lows drove the economy into recession and pushed the country to the brink of default in argentina almost a third of its citizens are in poverty thanks in part to out of control inflation a problem decades of central bank meddling largely caused and it doesn t take actual interference to have disastrous consequences in his attempt to mobilize popular pressure for lower interest rates president recep tayyip erdogan has repeatedly attacked the bank of turkey and called interest rates the mother of all evil although the bank has resisted bending to his will the turkish lira and the country s financial markets have been on a roller coaster ride causing economic turmoil credibility lost is hard to recover undoing the consequences of political meddling and restoring faith in a central bank and the country s currency often requires a lot of short term pain primarily this takes the guise of rising interest rates even if the economy is in trouble this is a sure recipe for recession that s what happened in the 1980s as then fed chair paul volcker tried to restore the bank s credibility and bring inflation under control the fed raised rates to a record 20 in the process pushing the u s economy into recession twice the bank of turkey has hiked interest rates to 24 in attempts to fend off further rounds of speculative attacks on the lira and hang on to its credibility the economy is suffering as a result and in argentina although the current government says it believes in central bank independence banco central de la república argentina continues to struggle with the legacy of rampant inflation with only sky high interest rates likely to put it in check more economic pain is likely the experiences of central and eastern europe after the fall of the berlin wall are further testimony of this long and often painful road to monetary credibility something today s populist movements might want to bear in mind put bluntly political meddling with central banks is an incredibly bad and dangerous idea

net interest income increased to 6 3 million as compared to 6 2 million for the same period in fiscal 2018 the increase reflected a 2 8 million or 33 3 increase in interest income substantially offset by an increase of 2 7 million or 126 2 in interest paid on deposits and borrowings the increase in net interest income between the periods was primarily due to the increase in the weighted average balance of earning assets combined with the shift in the bank s emphasis on increasing its investment in commercial real estate and construction loans which generally produce higher yields than those obtained on residential loans the average balance of interest earning assets increased by 241 2 million or 27 0 to 1 1 billion from the comparable period in 2018 the yield on interest earning assets increased by 19 basis points to 3 98 for the quarter ended march 31 2019 from the comparable period in 2018 however during the same period the weighted average cost of borrowings and deposits

4 million for the same period in fiscal 2018 the increase in interest income of 4 7 million or 29 0 was offset by an increase of 4 8 million or 118 5 in interest paid on deposits and borrowings the

construction loans and a rising interest rate environment the average balance of interest earning assets increased by 206 4 million or 23 3 from the comparable period in 2018 the yield on interest earning assets increased by 17 basis points to 3 89 for the six months ended march 31 2019 from the comparable period in 2018 the weighted average cost of borrowings and deposits increased to 1 83 during the six months ended march 31 2019 from 1 03 during the comparable period in 2018 primarily due to increases in market rates of interest reflecting in part the competitive market for deposits in the areas in which the company operates for the three and six months ended march 31 2019 the net interest margin was 2 26 and 2 27 respectively compared to 2 83 and 2 81 for the same periods in fiscal 2018 respectively the margin compression experienced in the 2019 periods reflected in large part the higher funding costs resulting from the increases in the federal funds rates combined with a competitive market for funding deposits asset yields have not risen as quickly as liability costs in response to the rising interest rate environment exacerbated by the competitive market for funding sources especially locally sourced deposits non interest income non interest income amounted to 542 000 and 922 000 for the three and six month periods ended march 31 2019 respectively compared to 567 000 and 982 000 respectively for the comparable periods in fiscal 2018 the decrease experienced in both of the 2019 periods was primarily attributable to the decrease in derivative related income in 2019 periods from the 2018 periods the effect of this decrease was partially offset by investment gains during the quarter and six months ended march 31 2019 non interest expenses for the three and six month periods ended march 31 2019 non interest expense increased 277 000 or 7 2 and 226 000 or 2 9 respectively compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year non interest expense increased in the fiscal 2019 periods due in part to the hiring of additional personnel in our lending operations normal salary increases as well as increases in benefit plan expenses partially offsetting these

ended march 31 2019 the company recorded a tax expense of 380 000 compared to a tax expense of 619 000 for the same period in fiscal 2018 for the six month period ended march 31 2019 the company recorded an income tax expense of 809 000 as compared to a tax expense of 2 9 million for the same period in fiscal 2018 the reduction in the three month period reflected a benefit in 2019 associated

8 million related to a re evaluation of the company s deferred tax assets due to the tax legislation enacted in december 2017 that reduced the statutory federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 balance

fhlb advances outstanding of 225 1 million as compared to 154 7 million at september 30 2018 the increase in the level of borrowings was primarily due to the match funding of purchases of investment

stockholders equity increased by 5 5 million to 133 9 million at march 31 2019 from 128 4 million at september 30 2018 the increase was primarily due to net income of 4 3 million combined with a 3 6

over the past couple of years the annual meetings of the international monetary fund imf and world bank in washington have been the occasions for much lauding of egyptian economic policy makers the spring meetings for 2019 held from 9 to 14 april in washington were no different egypt has delivered under its programme imf managing director christine lagarde told the opening press conference of the meetings in comments on egypt s 12 billion extended fund facility eff with the imf jihad azour director of the imf s middle east and central asia department said programme so far was very well implemented during a press briefing on the middle east and central asia economic outlook egypt s three year programme which began in november 2016 is now nearing completion a fifth review is scheduled for june when azour said an imf mission was expected to have detailed discussions with the government a mission would be in egypt in the next few weeks he said we very much hope that the next review will be completed satisfactorily lagarde said adding that she had received assurances from egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi that they will stay committed in order to complete the programme and in order to deliver on their commitment lagarde met president al sisi while he was in washington for a meeting with us president donald trump last week egyptian officials reiterated their commitment to reform while in washington for the spring meetings however they denied an intention to pursue another programme or to request further imf loans speaking to the state middle east news agency mena in washington the central bank of egypt cbe governor said on friday that cairo was not in need of a new loan programme from the imf however lagarde said she had assured al sisi that the imf remained available to continue to help in order to maintain stability and to make sure that growth continued to create more jobs at the same time minister of finance mohamed maait showcased improvements in the economy in a meeting with top investment banks when he said that egypt was targeting gdp growth of 5 9 per cent in the upcoming fiscal year as well as a primary budget surplus of two per cent egypt s gdp growth for the current fiscal year is expected to be 5 5 per cent the minister added that the government was making tremendous efforts to sustain economic growth rates and improvements in the financial indicators by maintaining the downward trend of the budget deficit and debt as a percentage of gdp he said that economic growth in egypt was based on growing activity and the growth of most economic sectors reflecting the ability of the economy to meet all its challenges he added that public debt had fallen from 108 per cent of gdp to 98 per cent currently he said he expected it to fall to 93 per cent in june this year and 89 per cent in fiscal year 2019 2020 according to a ministry of finance press release lowering the debt is one of the main objectives of the government s reform programme azour said it was now very important to continue investing in the digital economy and education and in ensuring that the stability of the economy would continue he also said it was important to focus on structural reforms that would help the economy to grow faster and be led by the private sector the key reform area will be how to improve the business environment he said the private sector was the main engine of growth and job creation in egypt because of its dynamism and because the public sector could not create more jobs he added between 700 000 and one million new jobs are needed annually in that framework lagarde said she had raised the issue of youth entrepreneurship with president al sisi adding that young people needed space and the freedom to operate in order to contribute to economic development similar points were raised by mahmoud mohieldin senior vice president of the world bank for the 2030 development agenda in a speech he gave to the second annual conference organised by economic news outlet hapi he stressed the importance of attracting investment and highlighted the importance of exports both were needed to sustain the growth to create jobs he said the proportion of exports to national income is lower than that in egypt s counterparts mohieldin said pointing out that while the ratio of exports to national income in egypt is 15 per cent in vietnam it reaches 101 per cent other factors important for sustainable development included the creation of a database to monitor performance and guide policies and institutions to achieve sustainable development goals he said these should be more focused on local development or the localisation of development he added saying that this was what made people in different villages districts and cities feel the impacts of economic growth through improved education healthcare and basic services growth also needed to take place while protecting the most vulnerable sections of the population and azour stressed the importance of directing more money to social protection he acknowledged that vulnerable sectors had benefited from social protection programmes such as the takaful and karama welfare programmes that have softened some of the negative impacts of the reforms seventy per cent of the beneficiaries were women who had no skills or were illiterate azour pointed out these programmes provide a minimum level of dignity continuing them is important since people will feel that the reforms are now paying off he added a version of this article appears in print in the

wolf richter wolfstreet com www amazon com author wolfrichter greed and scheming the team that is picking through what is left of bankrupt sears holding corp has filed a lawsuit today against former ceo eddie lampert his hedge fund esl seritage growth properties bruce berkowitz of fairholme capital management and various directors of esl and sears such as us treasury secretary steven mnuchin who was an executive at esl and a director of sears holding serving on its finance committee the lawsuit 110 page court document alleges that lampert and the other culpable insiders have systematically stripped many billions of dollars worth of assets from the retailer for their own benefit and to the detriment of the creditors this asset stripping was done in various ingenious ways involving scores of insiders but given the magnitude of the court document i will focus on the biggies the five fraudulent transfers in 2010 in the face of sears rapidly deteriorating performance and increasing demands for redemptions by esl s investors lampert and the other culpable insiders began a scheme to strip sears of assets plaintiffs claim which led to these five fraudulent transactions the 2011 spinoff of orchard a california home improvement retailer with 89 stores orchard was liquidated in 2018 the sho rights offering in oct 2012 the sears canada partial spinoff in nov 2012 sears canada was liquidated in 2017 the lands end spinoff the apr 2014 the seritage transaction in july 2015 in 2017 lampert et al already settled a lawsuit by aggrieved shareholders over the seritage deal lampert and the other culpable insiders created a false record to conceal the fraudulent nature of these transactions this included causing reviews of certain of these transactions by committees of independent directors based on solvency opinions by duff phelps that were premised on the unrealistic projections these processes failed to protect and indeed ignored the interests of creditors below are some select quotes about these five fraudulent transactions this is still long but it makes for some grisly reading about culpable insiders trying to enrich themselves at the expense of others while gutting a large company alive fraudulent transaction 1 the orchard spinoff first step in lampert s plan to strip sears of assets orchard was acquired by sears roebuck in 1996 in 2005 sears roebuck sold a 19 9 stake in orchard to ares capital management ares a hedge fund retaining the remaining 80 1 at the time of the spinoff orchard was profitable much more so than the rest of sears sears had been planning a spinoff of orchard since at least april 2010 when it made a formal request for a private letter ruling from the irs that the spinoff would be tax free yet in that time sears never pursued a third party sale of orchard sears received no consideration for the orchard spinoff in december 2011 sears spun off its entire 80 1 common stock and 100 preferred stock stake in orchard as a dividend to its shareholders for no consideration after the spinoff lampert and esl held 48 of orchard s common stock and 61 2 of orchard preferred stock ares held 19 9 of the common stock fairholme held 12 2 of the common and 15 2 of the preferred stock tisch held 3 of the common and 3 7 of the preferred stock other public shareholders held 15 9 of the common and 19 9 of the preferred stock the culpable insiders acted with fraudulent intent the orchard spinoff was approved by a board that included lampert mnuchin and tisch these culpable insiders acted with the intent to hinder delay and defraud sears creditors through the orchard spinoff this intent can be inferred from several traditional badges of fraud first the transfer was to insiders the culpable shareholders owned approximately 80 1 of sears stock and thus received nearly 64 2 of orchard common stock and 80 1 of orchard preferred stock second lampert and esl and william crowley of esl received special rights under a shareholders agreement between esl lampert crowley ares and orchard that were not enjoyed by the other shareholders of sears who received shares of orchard in the spinoff a right of first offer should ares seek to sell its shares a tag along right should ares sell its shares to a third party a drag along right should esl arrange a sale of a large percentage of orchard s shares to a third party preemptive rights with respect to orchard s future debt offerings registration rights with respect to certain unregistered securities that esl might acquire and the right along with ares to approve the composition of the boards of orchard s subsidiaries and its annual budget third sears received no consideration in the spinoff the shareholders paid nothing to sears in exchange for the orchard stock that they received fourth the transfer was unusual and not in the ordinary course of business fifth the orchard spinoff was not an isolated transaction but rather the first step in an ongoing scheme to transfer sears most valuable assets to the culpable shareholders at the expense of sears creditors at the time of the orchard spinoff the culpable insiders already intended to continue with future transactions that would take sears past the point of insolvency in the aggregate the contemplated transactions that were part of this scheme would result in the divestiture of a substantial percentage of sears assets fraudulent transaction 2 the sho rights offering oct 2012 a further step in the same scheme to divest a declining sears of its valuable assets sho was a wholly owned direct subsidiary of sears sho operated stores that sold appliances and tools under sears brands sho stores were generally smaller than sears other stores and did not carry the full line of sears products at the time of the spinoff sho was profitable much more so than the rest of sears sears received no consideration sears filed a registration statement on form s 1 for 23 1 million shares or 100 of common stock of sho on april 30 2012 sears also created 105 919 089 rights to purchase shares of sho the sho rights the sho rights gave their holders the option to purchase 0 22 shares of common stock of sho at an exercise price payable to sears of 15 per share sears distributed all 105 919 089 of the sho rights to its shareholders on september 7 2012 of which approximately 80 8 were given to the culpable shareholders the sho rights were valuable securities after its first day of trading sho had a market capitalization of 709 million the shareholders paid aggregate consideration of 346 5 million to exercise the sho rights implying a transfer of 362 million from sears to its shareholders the culpable insiders acted with fraudulent intent the sho rights offering was approved by a board that included lampert mnuchin and tisch these culpable insiders acted with the intent to hinder delay and defraud sears creditors through the sho rights offering this intent can be inferred from several traditional badges of fraud first the transfer was to insiders the culpable shareholders owned nearly 80 8 of sears stock and thus received nearly 80 8 of the sho rights second sears received no consideration for the distribution of the sho rights and inadequate consideration for the exercise of the sho rights third the transfer was unusual and not in the ordinary course of business fourth the sho rights offering was not an isolated transaction but rather a continued step in an ongoing scheme to transfer sears most valuable assets to the culpable shareholders at the expense of sears creditors fifth the sho rights offering was premised on unrealistic bad faith projections of sears future performance sears retained duff phelps to provide a solvency opinion to support the transaction duff phelps was provided with projections from management regarding sears performance the 2012 solvency projections that predicted incredibly that revenue ebitdap and ebitdap margin which had been declining would instead begin to grow through 2017 sears actual results fell dramatically short of the projections rather than turning around revenue steadily fell and ebitdap and ebitdap margin fell and remained negative fraudulent transaction 3 sears canada partial spinoff yet another step in a continued scheme to divest a declining sears of its valuable assets prior to the spinoff sears indirectly owned 95 5 of sears canada through sears roebuck and certain of its subsidiaries the remaining 4 5 was publicly traded on the toronto stock exchange sears received no consideration in november 2012 sears spun off 44 5 of sears canada to its shareholders sears shareholders paid no consideration to sears for the sears canada shares this reduced sears remaining stake in sears canada to just 51 the day before the spinoff was announced the 44 5 stake was worth at least 621 million the day before the final approval of the spinoff the 44 5 stake was still worth at least 501 million ust two months after the spinoff on december 31 2012 sears canada paid a 102 million dividend if this dividend had been paid before the spinoff 95 5 of it would have been paid to sears and 4 5 to sears canada s public shareholders instead because the dividend was paid after the spinoff only 51 of the dividend was paid to sears the value representing the difference between 51 and 95 5 was instead paid to sears shareholders who became sears canada s shareholders as a result of the partial spinoff the primary beneficiaries were lampert and esl followed by fairholme and tisch the culpable insiders acted with fraudulent intent the sears canada partial spinoff was approved by a board that included lampert mnuchin and tisch these culpable insiders acted with the intent to hinder delay and defraud sears creditors through the sears canada partial spinoff this intent can be inferred from several traditional badges of fraud first the transfer was to insiders the culpable shareholders owned 81 2 of sears stock and thus personally received 81 2 of the distribution or nearly 36 3 of the equity in sears canada second sears received no consideration for the sears canada shares third the transfer was unusual and not in the ordinary course of business fourth the sears canada partial spinoff was not an isolated transaction but rather a continued step in an ongoing scheme to transfer sears most valuable assets to the culpable shareholders at the expense of sears creditors fifth the sears canada partial spinoff was premised on unrealistic bad faith projections of sears future performance for the sears canada partial spinoff duff phelps undertook only minor updates to its solvency analysis for the sho rights offering and continued to predict unrealistically that revenue ebitdap and ebitdap margin which had been declining would instead begin to grow through 2017 fraudulent transaction 4 lands end spinoff in 2014 a fraudulent transfer and an illegal dividend the lands end spinoff transferred the common stock of the lands end business worth more than 1 billion at the time from sears to its shareholders the largest of whom were the culpable shareholders the shareholders paid sears no consideration for lands end sears acquired lands end in june 2002 for 1 86 billion sears owned lands end indirectly through sears roebuck its wholly owned subsidiary because of its strong cash flow and profitability particularly in comparison to sears other business units lands end was one of sears crown jewels lampert insists on a spinoff to benefit ahareholders rather than alternatives that would have generated more proceeds for sears despite planning the lands end spinoff for at least two years sears never seriously pursued any alternatives including a third party sale of lands end which would have maximized the proceeds to sears and left such proceeds available to creditors nor did sears engage an investment banker to conduct a sale process or obtain an independent valuation as lampert and other insiders knew prospective buyers existed on january 9 2014 sears received an unsolicited indication of interest from leonard green partners and the tommy hilfiger investment group lgp th lgp th stated that they were highly interested in investing in lands end which they valued at 1 6 billion including net debt lgp th proposed a sponsored spin transaction that would give lgp th a 25 stake in lands end alongside sears shareholders and deliver proceeds of either 850 million or 1 billion depending on the transaction structure to sears lampert summarily rejected this opportunity just six days later lampert personally told lgp th that the proposed transaction was a non starter not because it failed to maximize proceeds to sears but because it would have diluted his and esl s stake in lands end relative to a non sponsored spin ultimately lands end was distributed to lampert esl and sears other shareholders for no consideration following a pre spin dividend from lands end of 500 million lands end s stock price on its first day of trading confirms that the standalone company after paying the pre spin dividend was worth more than 1 billion lampert and esl as the largest sears shareholders were by far the largest beneficiaries of the transaction receiving lands end stock then worth at least 490 million the land s end spinoff left sears and sears roebuck insolvent at the time of the lands end spinoff sears had existing debt obligations with an aggregate principal amount of more than 3 8 billion together with interest sears required more than 4 7 billion and more than 4 3 billion by 3q 2018 alone to pay off its debt sears total cash and cash equivalents immediately after the lands end spinoff including the pre spin dividend were approximately 842 million even assuming that sears used all of these funds for principal and interest payments rather than to fund continued operating losses as actually occurred sears still would have required more than 3 4 billion of additional free cash flow by 3q 2018 sears had no basis to expect to earn anything close to what it needed after the lands end spinoff it could not reasonably have expected to earn 841 million in free cash flow by 1q 2016 when the asset based loan abl came due in reality sears ultimately saw free cash flow of approximately negative 1 7 billion in fy 2014 negative 2 4 billion in fy 2015 and negative 1 5 billion in fy 2016 after lands end the only way sears could have made the abl principal payment due in 1q 2016 was by selling core assets and that of course is what sears ultimately did paying down the abl with part of the proceeds of the seritage transaction discussed in more detail below but even with non ordinary course sales of core assets after the lands end spinoff sears could not reasonably have funded 4 3 billion in debt principal and interest payments by 3q 2018 when the second lien notes would come due not coincidentally 3q2018 is when sears ultimately filed for bankruptcy in light of sears declining financial performance over the preceding years and the numerous adverse qualitative trends as detailed above it was not reasonable to assume that sears could achieve the level of cash flow necessary for timely debt principal and interest payment despite a cumulative net loss of 5 3 billion in the four fiscal years prior to the land s end spinoff fys 2010 2013 duff phelps the valuation advisor hired to opine on sears solvency at the time of the spinoff opined that sears was solvent only by adopting management s speculative top down projections about future performance the 2014 solvency projections were unrealistic and unreasonable in the base case duff phelps assumed that revenue gross margin earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent expense and pension expense ebitdarp and ebitdap would increase rather than continuing to decrease and in the case of ebitdap would turn positive instead of negative and would continue to increase dramatically over the entire three year projection period even in the sensitivity case duff phelps assumed that sears revenue decline would slow and then turn to growth and that ebitdap and ebitdap margin would become positive and increase rather than remaining negative and continuing to decrease in other words even the sensitivity case assumed a substantial turnaround in sears profitability duff phelps did not consider the far more realistic likelihood that sears results would stay on the same downward track or that they would at best stabilize at 2013 levels without these unwarrantedly optimistic assumptions sears would have had negative free cash flow and thus would be unable to make scheduled debt principal and interest payments starting between 2014 and 2016 we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the lands end spinoff left sears and sears roebuck with unreasonably small capital after the lands end spinoff sears had insufficient capital or reserves to account for its normal business operations and to repay its existing debt load much less sustain operations through any difficulties likely to arise in its line of business including general or industry wide economic downturn sears was also left with insufficient capital or reserves even to survive a continuation of established trends in its free cash flow net sales margins and net profits losses the culpable insiders acted with fraudulent intent the lands end spinoff was approved by a board that included lampert mnuchin tisch and alvarez the culpable insiders acted with the intent to hinder delay and defraud sears and sears roebuck s creditors through the lands end spinoff this intent can be inferred from several traditional badges of fraud first the transfer was to insiders in lampert s words he wanted to give lands end to ourselves the culpable shareholders owned approximately 74 7 of sears stock and thus personally received approximately 74 7 of the equity of lands end in total the culpable shareholders received at least 756 million in value from the lands end spinoff second lands end comprised a significant percentage of sears ebitda producing assets in fy 2012 the last year in which sears had positive ebitda lands end comprised 17 3 of sears ebitda the year before fy 2011 lands end had comprised a majority 52 3 of sears ebitda third sears and sears roebuck received no consideration in the spinoff the shareholders paid nothing to sears or sears roebuck in exchange for the lands end stock that they received fourth the transfer was unusual and not in the ordinary course of business fifth as noted above sears and sears roebuck were insolvent prior to the transaction or became insolvent as a result of the transaction finally the culpable insiders and duff phelps knew or should have known that the 2014 solvency projections could not realistically be achieved by this time sears had fallen short of the performance projections in its four immediately preceding annual plans for fiscal years 2010 through 2013 sears also had fallen short of the multi year projections that had been submitted to duff phelps in 2012 for its analysis of the sho rights offering and sears canada partial spinoff these shortcomings were material in the words of former sears ceo alan lacy in 2014 with the lands end spinoff and then the seritage spinoff that s when it seemed to shift into managing for cash flow or liquidation everybody knew how the movie was going to end it was just a question of how many minutes are left fraudulent transaction 5 seritage transaction in july 2015 a fraudulent transfer and an illegal dividend ever since the kmart sears merger analysts and financial journalists have speculated that lampert s intentions for sears involved some type of real estate play the seritage transaction which closed in july 2015 proved them right the seritage transaction constituted a fraudulent transfer and an illegal dividend the sale and lease back agreement and related agreements between sears and seritage the sale and lease back undervalued the real estate by hundreds of millions of dollars and saddled sears with grossly one sided and costly lease terms and the seritage rights offering transferred highly valuable subscription rights to sears shareholders again principally to the benefit of the culpable shareholders for no consideration first first sears sold to the seritage defendants the title or joint venture interests for the land under 266 of its most profitable stores for a purchase price of approximately 2 58 billion while simultaneously agreeing to lease those spaces back from the seritage defendants the purchase price was ostensibly based upon appraisals of the properties by c w but the appraisals were fundamentally flawed and as a result the transferred real estate was undervalued by approximately 649 to 749 million second second sears transferred subscription rights to purchase shares in seritage common stock to the culpable shareholders and other sears shareholders for no consideration the trading price of the subscription rights reflects that they were worth approximately 400 million and for lampert esl the esl shareholders and fairholme the value of the subscription rights was even greater those insiders benefited from a side agreement pursuant to which they exchanged some of their subscription rights plus cash for other classes of seritage stock and interests in the seritage operating partnership which were particularly valuable sears financial condition was even worse in july 2015 when the seritage transaction closed than it had been fourteen months earlier when lands end was spun off that was due in part to sears continuing losses it recorded a net loss of 1 68 billion in fy 2014 and in part to the lands end spinoff itself which divested sears of one of its few profitable subsidiaries yet sears transferred the seritage subscription rights for no consideration and the real estate for grossly inadequate consideration the inadequate consideration is confirmed by seritage s stock price increase on its first day of trading closing at 37 73 up 27 6 from 29 58 a one day increase in seritage s market capitalization of 453 million by april 15 2016 less than one year later seritage s stock price had increased more than 50 to 56 47 giving it a market capitalization of 3 2 billion seritage also paid quarterly dividends since december 2015 totaling approximately 209 million on information and belief the culpable shareholders have received approximately 131 million of dividends from seritage the terms of the seritage transaction including the price seritage paid sears for the properties the rent and other terms of the leases between sears and seritage and the terms of the rights offering were established unilaterally by lampert and others who reported to him and without negotiation lampert however was grossly conflicted because once the transaction went through he and esl would be by far the largest shareholders of seritage no consideration was given to the interests of creditors lampert was the driving force behind the sale and lease back transaction as a result the sale and lease back proposal was developed while other alternatives were not seriously considered by september 21 2014 the company was moving forward with the creation of a reit because legal restrictions on ownership concentration in reits would have prevented sears largest shareholders lampert the esl shareholders and fairholme from owning the same percentage of the reit as they owned of sears substantial attention was devoted to developing transaction features that would benefit these large shareholders by november 2014 the principal elements of the transaction including the creation of a new reit an estimate of the number of properties to be sold to the reit and the terms of the master lease whereby the reit would lease back the properties to sears were in place pursuant to a subscription distribution and purchase and sale agreement between sears and seritage dated june 8 2015 the newly created reit seritage issued and delivered to sears 106 597 798 unitized subscription rights seritage rights the seritage rights gave their holders the option to purchase new shares of common stock of seritage at an exercise price payable to seritage of 29 58 per share the balance of seritage s capital structure consisted of third party financing secured by the real estate to be acquired from sears sears distributed all 106 597 798 of the seritage rights to its shareholders that same day of which 81 359 794 or 76 3 were given to the culpable shareholders the shareholders did not pay sears any consideration in exchange for the seritage rights the seritage rights were valuable securities between june 9 and 26 2015 the seritage rights traded on the nyse the volume weighted average trading price of the seritage rights over this period was 3 75 per right based on this price the 106 597 798 seritage rights were worth at least 399 million as sears cfo wrote in an email before the closing the market thinks is selling something for about 600m less than it is worth in fact the seritage rights were worth materially more than this amount because the trading price did not account for the more valuable interests that lampert the esl shareholders and fairholme were able to obtain by exchanging their excess rights which they did not trade on the nyse plus cash with seritage for class b and class c shares of seritage and operating partnership interests these other interests were worth more than seritage common stock because they gave lampert the esl defendants and fairholme the special ability to block a change of control third though fifth third sears roebuck contributed its joint venture interests in gs portfolio holdings llc and ms portfolio llc for no consideration to seritage gs holdings llc and seritage ms holdings llc respectively fourth kmart corporation contributed seritage kmt finance llc to kmt mezz for no consideration fifth sears roebuck contributed seritage src finance llc seritage gs holdings llc and seritage ms holdings llc to src mezz for no consideration the sale and lease back undervalued the transferred real estate assets and joint venture interests on or about july 7 2015 sears and seritage closed on the sale and lease back of 266 sears stores these 266 properties were selected to include only stores that generated sufficient ebitda to be able to pay the assigned rent to seritage and thus represented sears most valuable available properties seritage paid sears a total of 2 58 billion for the real estate assets and joint venture interests a purchase price that was purportedly based in primary part on appraisals performed by c w c w s appraisals were fundamentally flawed and undervalued the properties by between 649 and 749 million which in turn meant seritage underpaid at least that much for the properties confirmation can be found in sears subsequent sales through the petition date of 36 properties at prices that were on average 40 higher than c w s valuation ut 250 of the best stores in the reit get 2b in cash and hope that this is sufficient to fund the business for 2 years to get past fraudulent conveyance statutes

syracuse n y destiny usa s d day arrives june 6 on that day its 430 million in mortgage loans come due in full and the owner of the giant syracuse mall is in danger of default pyramid management group the company founded by mall developer robert congel in 1970 has indicated it will not be able to pay off the loans by the due date as a result its lender recently took the rare step of transferring the loans to a third party special servicer a company that specializes in handling defaults or renegotiating troubled loans for lenders on the surface it looks like a crisis for destiny usa the nation s sixth largest shopping mall and a major driver of the local retail and entertainment economy its owner could potentially lose control of its flagship asset one right in its own back yard but a search of records and several interviews with financing experts by syracuse com the post standard show that below the surface there s something more going on something that speaks to the brass knuckles world of commercial finance it s definitely a mortgage crisis but it s also an opportunity for the kind of hardball negotiations for which pyramid is known destiny usa is far from joining the nation s growing ranks of dead malls while every other shopping mall in central new york is dead or dying destiny is frequently filled with visitors it contains 250 stores restaurants and entertainment venues and is visited by 26 million shoppers annually including many traveling from canada there are always a lot of cars in the parking lots said pat hogan chairman of the onondaga county industrial development agency and a former city councilor whose district includes destiny usa robert congel 83 is no longer running the company but pyramid is still owned by him and is headed by his son stephen congel its ceo stephen congel did not respond to interview requests but according to one person who spoke with him about the situation he did not appear worried about losing the mall onondaga county executive ryan mcmahon said stephen congel called him last week to notify him that the mall s mortgages were being transferred to a special servicer he certainly didn t seem concerned that they would not be able to work out an agreement he said they seemed upbeat what is likely experts said is that pyramid will agree to changes to the mortgage that it may not like but which will allow it to retain ownership of its prized shopping and entertainment center i don t think this is going to be a foreclosure said roy chun managing director at kroll bond rating agency of new york city i think the lender will work with the borrower and there s a wide range of things they could do a sweet deal from the city the mall benefits from an unprecedented level of government subsidies that congel obtained through a series of tough negotiations and at times litigation with three different city administrations under an agreement with the city destiny usa does not have to pay property taxes for 30 years a benefit that will save pyramid literally hundreds of millions of dollars during that time in addition pyramid is collecting 112 million from the state under new york s much criticized empire zone economic development program and has received 69 million from the state under the equally criticized brownfield cleanup program with that kind of help from state and local taxpayers how could pyramid be in trouble on its mortgage congel borrowed the 430 million from j p morgan chase in june 2014 that allowed him to refinance an existing 300 million loan on the original part of the mall and providing 130 million to complete the build out of a large expansion under loan terms common for large commercial developments the developer has been required to only pay the interest on the loans a fixed rate of 3 8 then after five years he was expected to find a new lender to refinance the balance which remains 430 million that s not the kind of mortgage a homeowner would ever get because it does not pay down the principal but it s a common practice in the commercial lending industry on large properties the terms increase the risk for a lender in the event of a default but banks take that into account when setting the interest rate for a loan helping ensure they are going to make money in addition banks can shift some of the risk as chase did with its destiny mortgages by wrapping their loans into securities and selling at least a portion of them to investors and in the case of mall owners like pyramid the arrangement frees up money to reinvest in the property to draw in new tenants said lisa spaziano senior director of commercial mortgage backed securities surveillance at kroll excess cash goes into the mall as is happening at destiny she said pyramid has been making its interest only payments so it s not in default yet but it has not been able to obtain new financing to replace the chase loans at least not with terms it finds acceptable that creates the possibility of a default and that s why the loans were transferred to a special servicer earlier this month a commercial loan going to a special servicer was not uncommon during the great recession 10 years ago but it s rare in today s strong economy fewer than 1 5 of the 17 800 commercial loans rated by kroll are in the hands of special servicers according to the agency a tough climate for malls but two trends in the retail industry are squeezing the mall the spectacular growth of online retailers like amazon is taking away customers from brick and mortar stores and consumers pressed for time are increasingly doing their shopping at easy in and out shopping plazas when congel began expanding his mall originally named carousel center in 2007 he saw the coming changes in the retail industry and signed up tenants not likely to be competing with on line retailers restaurants outlet stores and entertainment venues such as wonderworks a science focused indoor amusement park and rpm raceway an indoor go kart track nevertheless destiny usa has not been immune to what s happening in the industry eateries outlet stores and big entertainment venues help fill a lot of the space in the new section of the mall and draw people to the center but those types of tenants generally pay lower rental rates in addition the original portion of the mall remains filled with traditional retailers who are very much feeling the effects of on line competition bon ton one of destiny s four large department stores closed in 2016 and its space remains vacant destiny usa in syracuse became central new york s premiere shopping mall when it opened as the carousel center in 1990 rick moriarty rmoriarty syracuse com sales at the mall have slipped in recent years at least at the original 1 5 million square foot section formerly known as carousel center sales fell from 380 million in 2014 to 345 million last year about 10 percent according to documents filed with bondholders the percentage of mall space occupied by retailers also declined during the same period from 97 percent in 2014 to 89 percent last year the documents show these declines are making it harder for pyramid to refinance the full amount of its mortgages the lending market is less favorable to malls in general chun said they re just much more careful about lending to malls now impacting pyramid to a lesser degree are the rising payments it must make on 323 million in other debt on the mall that money was borrowed when it sold 30 year bonds issued by the syracuse industrial development agency as part of the mall s tax deal with the city payments on the bonds which have a first lien position increase 4 a year they started out at 14 million in 2007 will total 20 million this year and rise to 36 million before the bonds are retired in 2037 that means less of the mall s shrinking rental revenues are available each year to make its mortgage payments can pyramid work a better loan deal chun said the special servicer s options include extending the mortgage loans maturity date while requiring pyramid to pay down some of the principal in an odd way the decline in mall business actually helps pyramid avoid foreclosure milena petrova a professor of finance at syracuse university s whitman school of management said it s doubtful the lender would take the drastic step of foreclosing on the mall especially if pyramid remains able to make its interest payments it s very likely that the mall s value has declined since the loan was made so it s possible that a forced sale would generate less money than what it is owed on the mortgages she said the bank really has an interest in giving them more time she said she said it s likely pyramid is trying to negotiate a short term extension perhaps of a few months to give it time to nail down a new loan from another lender or if market conditions remain unfavorable it might agree to pay down some of the principal in exchange for a longer term extension of a year or two to buy time to transform more of the mall into an entertainment center she said i think they re working on kind of reinventing themselves and looking at ways of attracting customers from canada petrova said shoppers walk past a sign promoting tourism at the destiny usa shopping mall in syracuse rick moriarty rmoriarty syracuse com rick moriarty if anyone can come out on top in a tough negotiation it s pyramid two years after pyramid began work on an 874 200 square foot expansion of the mall citigroup stopped making advances on a promised 155 million construction loan the third biggest bank in the nation cited cost overruns construction delays and a lack of signed tenants for the addition without the additional financing pyramid stopped working on the big expansion just quit the unfinished addition an empty shell of a building stood unchanged along hiawatha boulevard for two years congel went on the offensive he sued the bank alleging breach of contract after a two year court battle citigroup agreed to a settlement that was highly favorable to the developer the bank agreed to forgive the 86 million construction loan it had already advanced as well as a 100 million mortgage on the original portion of the mall a total of 186 million in loans that congel did not have to pay back all the developer had to do was find another lender to refinance a remaining 310 million mortgage on the property ending all of citigroup s ties with pyramid soon after congel found a new lender j p morgan chase the nation s biggest bank to loan him 430 million it s that same 430 million that five years later is the subject of new negotiations between his company and a lender without a lot of good options staff writer tim knauss

mayor bill de blasio s appointment of new york university law professor and former new york city housing commissioner vicki been as the new deputy mayor for housing and economic development comes at a critical time for the city new york has been the beneficiary of incomparably good economic fortune but has been unable to manage the problem of population growth induced by the ready availability of jobs new york sits at the center of one of the nation s most productive metropolitan areas a 2017 brookings study ranked the region seventh among the 100 largest metro areas nationwide in output per worker high productivity metros yield bountiful tax revenues according to the new york city comptroller s comprehensive annual financial reports in fiscal year 2008 the peak of the last business cycle total city tax revenues amounted to 38 6 billion by fy 2018 tax revenues added up to 59 1 billion a 53 percent increase more than three times greater than the rate of inflation all that money facilitated large increases in spending on education social programs an expanded public workforce and neighborhood amenities everyone in new york likes the revenue benefit of being a high productivity city but accommodating high productivity workers the people who make the high salaries has proved difficult the census bureau s american community survey acs categorizes occupations that require higher levels of education and generally pay more as management business science and arts occupations in 2008 37 percent of employed new york city residents fit this category in 2017 41 2 percent did over that period the number of people in this category grew by 273 000 or about 19 percent to more than 1 7 million we don t yet have comparable data for 2018 but new york city s rapid job growth has continued the problem the seemingly inexorable growth of higher paying jobs brings in people who will outbid others for a limited housing supply in the ten years from 2009 through 2018 new york city completed 177 062 new housing units according to the rent guidelines board and department of city planning this may sound like a large number but in a city with a housing stock of 3 37 million housing units it s not enough to improve the rental market conditions faced by the typical household the median new york city household pays more than 30 percent of its income for rent a threshold defined as rent burdened meaning that this cost eats into other typical household expenditures like food and clothing about a third of all renter households pay more than 50 percent of income for rent de blasio s response has been to institute a huge affordable housing program setting a production target of 120 000 new units by 2026 of which 35 685 had been started by the end of october 2018 the mayor s effort has not however changed the broader reality that available rental housing is too expensive for most households attention at the state and local levels is increasingly focused on strengthening rent regulation lawmakers threaten to repeal provisions of current law that have enabled landlords to raise regulated rents nearer to market levels while popular such measures protect current tenants and prevent landlords from renting to newcomers including the well educated professionals who drive the city s economic growth and yet it s not clear that such households can be kept out successfully in decades past when new york s rent controls were even stricter potential renters who could afford it paid under the table commissions to landlords and lower rent tenants were paid to leave were new york s legislators to enact new rent laws that further cap rents and somehow prevent these evasions they would trade a rent squeeze for a skilled labor shortage as the economist remarks in places where demand for urban housing is rising a more effective policy is simply to build more housing if more new housing were available to newcomers the city could continue growing its high productivity labor force while keeping older housing affordable it s the only way that everybody can benefit from the city s amazing growth machine the new deputy mayor has an opportunity to institute common sense policies that move the city in that direction such policies should include a bona fide effort to mobilize private sector resources to produce more housing any expansion of housing would have to be substantial to relieve the strangled rental market de blasio once aspired to permit 16 000 new market rate units per year though he proposed no policies to achieve this goal and appears to have forgotten about it been should revive it and try to surpass it the city needs to set borough and community district wide targets for new housing the bloomberg and giuliani administrations pushed through large scale rezonings that dominated housing production over the last decade including in long island city greenpoint williamsburg downtown brooklyn hudson yards and west chelsea the next round of rezonings should be more widespread so that the effects of growth are shared development opponents must be challenged to accept the changes to zoning and other regulations to allow new housing at the same time the city should tailor its mandatory inclusionary housing policies to economic realities enacted in 2016 this program which applies to all residential rezoning is tough on real estate developers without acknowledging that developers build all our new housing limiting developer incentives by forcing the industry to build and subsidize new housing for lower income people simply causes developers to look to the public sector for financial support by tying new housing construction in many parts of the city to still limited public funding when private capital would be otherwise available the program effectively ensures that we will never build enough housing for everyone the good news is that new yorkers have the means to keep their city both prosperous and affordable new york doesn t need a bailout from albany or washington it needs only to avoid policies that prevent housing from being built and adopt policies that facilitate it let s hope the new

police official short circuit likely caused notre dame fire paris paris police investigators think an electrical short circuit most likely caused the fire at notre dame cathedral a police official said thursday as france paid a daylong tribute to the firefighters who saved the world renowned landmark advertising a judicial police official told the associated press that investigators made an initial assessment of the cathedral wednesday but don t have a green light to search notre dame s charred interior because of ongoing safety hazards the cathedral s fragile walls were being shored up with wooden planks said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn t authorized to speak by name about an ongoing investigation investigators so far believe the fire was accidental and are questioning both cathedral staff and workers who were carrying out renovations some 40 people had been questioned by thursday according to the paris prosecutor s office the police

for this week s big interview i sat down with robert rapier the in house energy expert at investing daily and the chief investment strategist of utility forecaster robert rapier is one of the world s foremost experts on the oil and gas industry the guy in the picture in the freezing snow that s robert he s inspecting an oil field in the permian basin in texas sure robert frequently appears on television but he isn t one of those preening pundits with manicured hands who talk tough but know little robert has two decades of in the trenches experience in a wide range of fossil fuel and biofuel technologies he earned his master of science in chemical engineering and a bachelor of science in chemistry and mathematics double major at texas a m university in his quest to generate market beating gains for his followers robert gets out into the field as often as he can to observe market dynamics with his own eyes with volatility roiling the energy market and utility stocks on a tear i felt that now is a good time to tap robert s expertise oil and gas prices have been bouncing around lately as inventory and demand data fluctuate and provide a mixed picture under current conditions what are your latest projections for energy prices i believe the natural gas markets will continue to be adequately supplied in some places there is more natural gas than the markets can accommodate for example in the permian basin natural gas prices have routinely turned negative in recent months that situation will remain until more natural gas pipeline capacity is built out thus i see natural gas remaining below 3 mmbtu despite inventories that are a little tight coming out of the winter the oil markets are looking a lot tighter which was my expectation and prediction for this year brent crude is now over 70 per barrel and west texas intermediate is approaching the mid 60s those prices represent gains of nearly 40 since the start of the year what s driving the rise in wti and brent last month goldman sachs nyse gs reported that oil demand was on pace to jump by nearly 2 million barrels per day in the first quarter well ahead of bearish forecasts i have been saying for years that those who believe we are on the cusp of peak oil demand are getting ahead of themselves on the supply side u s production continues to grow led by strong gains in the permian but opec has responded by lowering output to prop up prices in addition unrest in venezuela and libya are contributing to lower oil exports add it all up and i think my prediction at the beginning of the year that wti would get back to 70 bbl this year remains in place supply and demand are the tightest they have been in more than a year and we are starting to see a return of predictions of 100 bbl oil i don t think we get there anytime soon but i do think opec will maintain discipline and keep restraining production as u s production continues to grow that will keep upward pressure on oil prices why should investors who aren t exposed to the energy patch care about oil and gas prices how do the fortunes of the energy industry affect the broader economy and stock market the energy industry has a tremendous impact on other sectors the utility industry has benefited from low natural gas prices while rising oil prices hurt the airline and trucking businesses at the same time what we pay for energy helps dictate what we have left over to pay for other items extremely high oil prices will dry up disposable income for many people leading to less overall spending in the economy this dynamic may change somewhat if the u s becomes a net exporter of crude oil as high oil prices will result in an increase in the amount of money flowing into the u s but as long as we are a net importer high oil prices increase the amount of money we are sending to saudi arabia and russia among others last week energy supermajor chevron nyse cvx announced it would buy anadarko petroleum nyse apc in the sixth largest oil and gas deal in history what s it all mean for investors it was a nearly 40 windfall for anadarko investors while chevron investors weren t happy with the price chevron shares dropped nearly 5 on the news however chevron management has proven their competence over the years i agree that on the surface it looks like a high premium but there are synergies there that increased the appeal for chevron outside of this deal it may mean that more consolidation is coming in the permian basin this area has some of the most attractive shale oil economics anywhere and the supermajors like chevron and exxonmobil nyse xom are increasingly moving in several permian basin companies saw their share price gain double digits following news of the chevron deal a strong indicator that investors believe other candidates could be acquired specifically pioneer natural resources nyse pxd and the much smaller parsley energy nyse pe were both up more than 10 following the chevron anadarko deal as the lead analyst at utility forecaster you specialize in income investments investors have been fleeing to safe havens such as utilities will the sector s outperformance continue in 2019 and why volatility has returned to the stock market which reminds investors that they can lose money quickly so that has helped drive investors into these safe havens the economy is also late in the business cycle when economic growth rates start to slow as credit tightens the consistent overperformers during the late cycle are defensive and inflation resistant sectors like the energy and utilities sectors recession also often follows the late cycle and utilities generally outperform during a recession there is no evidence that we are on the cusp of recession but some recession indicators have started to pop up utility stocks are interest rate sensitive so by necessity you closely monitor rates won t rising rates hurt utility stocks certainly as interest rates rise we will see competition from fixed income offerings thus we have to pick companies that offer a compelling combination of yield and yield growth while managing the downside risk it has become harder to find value in the conventional utility space as money has flowed into the sector but there are still some bargains out there governments around the world including our own have been pressuring their respective central banks to loosen monetary policy in the u s do threats against the independence of the federal reserve concern you or is it just a lot of political theater it does concern me the federal reserve needs to be able to do its job without worrying about political consequences it s important that wall street and washington dc get out of the mindset of wanting lower interest rates just because it might help the stock market that s myopic thinking that could cause economic damage down the road there is such a thing as inflation and those of us who can remember the late 1970s know how important it is to keep inflation in check i think that many investors have gotten complacent about inflation rising prices erode wealth over time editor s note robert rapier just

to produce certain ingredients which are very important in some medical products when we export blood plasma these countries manufacture these ingredients and export them back to our country for very high prices with this new project we will receive a quantity of these products for our local use in 2017 the government medical officers association gmoa urged the health ministry to appoint a suitable officer to the post of director general of health services this is the apex position in the health services and the post has been vacant for nearly one year now with an acting dghs in 2018 the gmoa asked the health ministry to fill the 148 deputy director posts which had fallen vacant instead of creating acting deputy directors there were 180 deputy director posts in the country and 148 of them were vacant the vacancies had been advertised about one year back but no attempt had been made to fill them medical superintendents in base hospitals deputy directors in all major hospitals deputy regional directors come under the category of deputy director state run hospitals are facing a crisis due to the delays in appointments in 2018 the government medical officers association warned it would resort to a strike if the north central provincial council attempted to bring doctors serving in the province under the provincial health service north central province ncp had in a letter informed the provincial director health services that the council had taken a decision to absorb doctors under its purview gmoa said doctors belonged to the all island service the doctors had also wanted to take up with the governor ncp several other issues including indian medical officers conducting mobile clinics in the east the misuse of world bank funds and the delay in paying doctors overtime a group of gmoa representatives in the east who attempted to take up those issues at a meeting with governor on march 29 had been threatened puttalam nurses staged a demonstration in march 2018 saying that they had worked in puttalam for nine years and had got transfer orders but the hospital is not letting them go doctors protested in 2018 against an appointment of a second vascular surgeon to the ragama teaching hospital colombo north teaching hospital from outside the annual transfer list the surgeon involved was sent to the anuradhapura teaching hospital in 2016 two years later a special position had been created for a second vascular surgeon at colombo north teaching hospital cnth ragama and this surgeon appointed to it in violation of the annual transfer list doctors allege that the second position had been created to accommodate this particular surgeon director of the ragama hospital told the director general health services that two vascular specialists are not required in his hospital as the hospital doesn t have a specialized unit for vascular surgery the post of the chief epidemiologist was always held by a qualified epidemiologist but a doctor without the required medical knowledge was appointed to this position in 2017 protests were made by the gmoa former chief epidemiologists current epidemiologists and senior academics chief epidemiologist dr paba palihawadana sought and obtained no pay leave from the health ministry to join the un service for one year in 2017 while she was on no pay leave another senior public health specialist of the epidemiology unit acted for the chief epidemiologist however when dr palihawadana reported back for duty as chief epidemiologist on january 1 2018 she found that another person had been appointed to the post dr a dissanayake was appointed as chief epidemiologist on december 19 2017 there was an advertisement i applied and i was selected he said pointing out that the appointment was made by the public service commission in accordance with the prevailing medical minutes dr dissanayake said he had headed the national blood transfusion service for several years before that he was regional director of health services rdhs in kalutara where he was handling everything the medical profession did not agree they said dr d did not have the necessary qualifications he had a m sc in medical administration according to circular no 02 132 2000 dated september 26 2000 the chief epidemiologist should be a board certified consultant in community medicine with work experience in epidemiology these criteria are also included in the medical services minute of 2014 all consultants attached to the epidemiology unit have these qualifications and field experience in epidemiology related activities the epidemiology unit is responsible for controlling communicable diseases if there is a major outbreak of a communicable disease the epidemiology unit will not be able to handle the crisis with a non technical head without a background in epidemiology sri lanka s much commended public health system would crash with the next outbreak of disease all epidemiological related activities which include communicable disease control and the immunization programme are coordinated and implemented through regional epidemiologists based at district level when the regional epidemiologists need any technical input it has to be provided by the chief epidemiologist the chief epidemiologist has to provide technical advice and guidance to these consultants the doctors will not be ready to follow the medical instructions given by a doctor who does not have the requisite knowledge that is why we think that the current chief epidemiologist cannot handle the job doctors pointed out that a non technical doctor had been appointed to head the dengue control programme he had abandoned his post during the height of the dengue epidemic in 2017 the main reason for influenza reaching the epidemic level in the southern province is the appointment of a doctor without the relevant medical knowledge to the post of chief epidemiologist said the gmoa in may 2018 the influenza started to spread in the southern province one month ago but nothing was done to control it the chief epidemiologist kept mum now it is up to the parents and the school authorities to control the outbreak and prevent it from spreading all over the country the epidemiology unit and the chief epidemiologist is not ready to face any possible disease outbreak that could occur as a result of the present floods either cardiothoracic surgeon dr namal gamage has decided in july 2018 to stop performing surgeries as the air conditioner at the karapitiya teaching hospital was not functioning there were around 3 000 heart patients waiting to undergo heart surgery at the hospital although a number of requests had been made for repairing the central air conditioning system no action had been taken the patients also made the same request to the authorities the health ministry said in 2017 it would make use of theatres at private hospitals to perform cardiac and eye surgeries to clear waiting lists at government hospitals the surgeons and staff would be from the government and private sectors health ministry would meet the cost the private hospitals have submitted their charges for each surgery and the time table during which the operations could be performed the private sector regulatory authority would study the report and come up with an action plan the emergency medical service system of the country will soon be strengthened with eight airbus helicopters and 28 state of the art emergency vehicles said the ministry in 2017 steiger foundation of germany will provide 24 helicopters 1 025 ambulances and 24 emergency vehicles helicopters will be useful addition to the system considering road traffic congestion sometimes ambulances could not travel through roads due to traffic congestion the government announced that it has decided to continue with sri lanka s pioneering pre hospital emergency care ambulance service suwasariya launched with indian financial backing in 2016 the free ambulance services now operating in western and southern provinces will be expanded covering the entire country by 2018 joint opposition pointed out in parliament that it was the ambulance service in the hospitals which should be expanded the indian firm gvk emri lanka operated the free ambulance service through a public private partnership with the ministry of health the operation is a 24 hour 7 days a week round the clock service the control centre received over 322 000 calls and has served over 32 000 cases out of which cardio trauma and stroke were the major cases in a memorandum to the cabinet of ministers wickremesinghe had said that the pre hospital emergency care ambulance service which was launched in the western and southern provinces with gvk emri lanka limited and assistance of the indian government on july 29 2016 had by april 2017 responded to 236 000 calls with an average responding time of 12 52 minutes and transported 130 to 135 patients daily in a letter to the editor which was supposedly to praise a hospital ward concerned woman heaped praise on the indian ambulance service which she said was excellent the service included a doctor a nurse and nurse aide they were trained in india including the driver they knew emergency medical action they were considerate and capable they helped revive her husband with emergency first aid all this at no cost thanks to the present government she said health ministry has in 2018 outsourced the laundry services of hospitals in the western province to an indian company complained government medical officers association the gmoa wanted this outsourcing of the laundry in government hospitals to an indian company stopped the ministry said that the new laundry service would be provided by the sri lankan affiliate of india s sugram hospital solutions which is engaged in laundry services at several hospitals worldwide the service is a board of investment boi project under the build operate transfer bot method with a usd 4 7 5 million investment the government does not bear any expenses for the project constructing of buildings and installing required machinery will be done at the expense of the investors after 15 years the project with up to date technology will be transferred to the ministry of health more than 300 unemployed youths will be given employment under the project the garments used by the patients and staff during the surgical procedures will be sterilized using modern methods washed and ironed sealed in protective covers and transported to the hospitals in sterilized trucks the ministry of health will spend less than the cost incurred by the hospitals on local laundry services at present the ministry said doctors in western province had complained about the local providers who were engaged in the laundry service for the hospitals in the western province they were using substandard materials for sterilization they were not sterilizing there was delay in providing cleaned laundry to hospitals during rainy season and the possible spread of skin related diseases due to incomplete cleaning also white colored bed linen are brownish they were washed with water from the beira lake gmoa replied that the local agencies involved in washing hospital linen had been registered with and certified by the health ministry after calling for tenders they were experienced and met the required standards the charge that beira lake water was used for washing hospital linen was incorrect gmoa wanted to know whether cleaner water was to be brought from india or whether linen was to be sent to india to be washed and brought back to sri lanka this was yet another instance of sri lankan politicians acting as agents of foreign countries they were selling government institutions and services to foreign companies said gmoa gmoa had warned that the economic and technology corporation agreement etca would threaten the services and professions in sri lanka now it seems that not even small enterprises and family trade would be safe with ecta said gmoa this project has no relevance to etca replied the ministry there were 13 local drug manufacturers who locally produce 82 items for the state pharmaceuticals manufacturing corporation said the ministry at a media briefing in 2017 ten more local manufacturers producing 40 more items will join the local drug manufacturing in the near future a total of 38 agreements have been signed between the government and the local drug manufacturers to produce drugs in sri lanka sri lanka has already begun local drug production at two factories situated in kandy and horana sri lanka expects to produce 80 of its drug requirements by the end of 2018 which will save usd 400 million plus annually which the government spends for drug importation accordingly the importation of all drugs which can be produced locally will be stopped by the end of 2018 the state pharmaceuticals manufacturing corporation of sri lanka spmc and pharma zone pvt ltd entered into an agreement in january 2018 to build the first ever exclusive pharmaceutical manufacturing zone pharma zone of sri lanka it will be located on 50 acres in welipenna kalutara district at an investment of over us 10 million to be the pharma zone is a boi approved company whose principals are the sultan of johor and patrick lim soo kit a leading malaysian entrepreneur this is a 100 malaysian investment and it underlines the high regard that the sultan and the people of johor for sri lanka said the ministry the zone will be run and administered by pharma zone headed by patrick lim soo kit while the spmc along with the ministry of health will set the standards and monitor quality electricity water road infrastructure security waste water management will l be provided to the companies operating within the zone it is the intention of pharma zone to attract overseas investors to set up operations within the zone as well we will be marketing pharma zone regionally said lim pharma zone will facilitate the local pharmaceutical manufacturers with sufficient land for manufacturing plants and basic infrastructure facilities for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products so that the government can achieve its target of localising production of essential pharmaceutical items to a value of us 100 million with the completion of the pharma zone envisaged to be in operation within one year the country s dependency on imported drugs will soon become a thing of the past said the ministry in 2017 the health ministry announced an exclusive agreement between the government and the staff of the state pharmaceutical corporation spc to grant a staggering 55 per cent salary increase to the lowest paid employees and 41 per cent pay hike to their highest paid counterparts this salary increase had been granted due to an impressive profit of rs 1 800 earned by the spc it would be effective from july 1 2017 to june 6 2020 hospitals do not have adequate drugs to treat cancer patients and are not sure when the drugs will arrive critics said in january 2019 this is due to the delay in appointments to tender boards that is turn is due to vetting process by the committees appointed by the president the boards cannot function until persons are formally appointments to tender boards the medical supplies division of the health ministry and the state pharmaceuticals corporation spc responsible for supplying the required medicines confirmed that delays in appointing tender boards and the release of payments to suppliers had adversely affected the supplies the resulting delays in completing tender processes has particularly affected the purchase of vital drugs for cancer patients medical authorities have been forced to defer treatment of cancer patients throughout the country the country s main cancer hospital apeksha in maharagama was forced to tell patients to come back later for treatment or advise them to by the medicine from private pharmacies hundreds of patients have already been turned away reported the media in september 2018 health ministry officials said that a crisis is looming in the health sector due to the treasury not releasing more than rs 20 billion to settle bills for essential items including medicines it is the first time such a large amount has been outstanding of this rs 10 billion is owed to the health ministry another rs 10 billion is due to the state pharmaceuticals manufacturing corporation spmc which has not been paid up to five months for production of essential medicines arrears to the tune of rs 450 million are owed to one supplier the spmc takes out loans to manufacture close to 200 pharmaceuticals when treasury reimbursement is delayed it is forced to reduce the quantity of drugs it produces or cease manufacturing completely this is because it costs money to import the raw material required to make the medicines in sri lanka all these medicines are for government hospitals said the official if the outstanding amounts are not settled soon manufacturers will refuse to provide medicines plunging the free health service into crisis there is also no money to advertise tenders meaning those that are in the pipeline will be delayed in 2017 yahapalana government purchased two clinically untested cancer drugs trastuzumab and bevazizumab produced and imported from russia in 2016 25 oncologists wrote to the health ministry advising it not to import these two drugs the drugs were of low quality and were not used even in russia their price was higher than other drugs which have us food and drug authority fda approval the drug was hurriedly registered in the nmra and tenders called there were no oncologists in the technical committee which approved the tender the tender was floated by the state pharmaceuticals corporation of sri lanka spcsl tender no lp msd cpu dhs rq 016 018 the five shortlisted bidders submitted quotations for rs 64 700 rs 93 950 rs 109 000 rs 135 900 and rs 190 000 per vial respectively the second highest bidder wasawarded thetender despite a substantial price difference of rs 39 million for the whole stock of 557 vials the company which submitted the lowest bid wrote to the authorities complaining about the unjust manner in which it was elbowed out and the tender awarded to the second highest bidder the lowest bidder said that he too was able to supply 100 vials ex stock with three vials free of charge and the balance within 14 working days on receipt of the confirmed order a second purchase order was placed on october 3 2017 with the local supplier for another 2 500 vials of trastuzumab at a staggering cost of rs 360 250 000 despite a competitor offering a time tested fda approved product at a competitive price the move to purchase another 2 500 vials of a product which has generated much controversy is beyond belief said critics somebody is making a big kill on the bid otherwise why opt for a higher price when a better time tested drug is on offer after the appointment of mahinda rajapaksa as prime minister and chamal rajapaksa as health minister in october 2018 the spc had ordered a better and cheaper drug but when a court order preventing the prime minister and the cabinet from functioning was made the spc cancelled the order and again ordered the russian drug the spc bought 557 vials from this company at the second highest bid price of rs 135 900 each at a total cost of more than rs 75 million the lowest bidder had offered the stock for rs 36 37 million which meant that the government had spent an additional rs 39 million analysts said this was done to prevent losses to the local importer of this drug the importer was holding large stocks of this very expensive drug it had known that the ministry will definitely purchase the drug from them these three purchases have resulted in a colossal loss of more than rs 108 million to the country said critics the commission of inquiry coi appointed by the president to investigate and inquire into serious acts of fraud corruption and the abuse of power state resources and privileges by the present the government issued summons on the current and former chairmen of the national medicines regulatory authority nmra this was regarding the import of the russian made cancer drug herticad by the state pharmaceutical corporation spc for the maharagama cancer hospital this drug is deemed to be of an inferior quality and can only be used on patients with stage two cancer spc had decided to import a drug that couldn t be used for all stages of the disease in spite of paying such a high price for it furthermore this drug lacked the approval of the world health organisation who and the european medcines agency ema several oncologists in the country had objected to the use of this drug said the attorney general s department those summoned before the commission stated that government hospitals do not have proper supplementary medicines that are used with chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer patients currently sri lankan government hospitals only had the drug herticad and that it was not suitable for treating early stage breast cancer patients herticad is good for treating patients with advance cancer herticad saw clinical practice in russia where the drug originates only in march 2016 the nmra had registered the drug in sri lanka in february 2016 the reasons given was that nmra only registers drugs and the decision to import them or not is decided by a tender committee herticad was introduced in 2016 by the ministry of health that insisted that the drug is a cheaper alternative to herceptin however oncologists have been critical of the drug stating that 80 of sri lankan breast cancer patients are detected at an early stage and that herticad is not suitable for treating them the oncologists on the tender committee objected to herticad stating that by allowing this drug nmra has failed to follow guidelines set by who and european medicines regulatory authority this product is not suitable to be used for adjunct use during early stages of cancer a number of oncologists have written to the ministry of health about the dangers of herticad but the response from the ministry has not been positive four oncologists had to face a disciplinary inquiry due to their objections to using herticad the inquirer wasn t even a technical person when oncologists had sent letters complaining about it to the ministry it has responded by saying that this is the only drug available and that they better use it from the time yahapalana government took power the gmoa has been actively opposing the government on economic issues such as ecta they antagonized the government and the government retaliated in november 2016 the tyres of cars belonging to doctors has been deflated at the ministry doctors at kandy kurunegala and matara had suspended work for four hours as protest there were several disagreements between the doctors and the health ministry gmoa said government has cut down vehicle permits their children were not given good schools when transfers were made and did not grant schools to their children when they returned from abroad government said schools had been given doctors said no not all children had got schools only 20 out of 138 children had got schools doctors were contemplating trade union action doctors also complained of an inordinate delay in the implementation of enhanced transport allowance as well as the amendments in respect of duty free vehicle scheme they objected to the way they were taxed in budget 2017 they staged a lunch hour protest demanding that the government solve several issues of the budget 2017 western province doctors would stop private practice for a day against the budget proposal to tax government employees private practice association of medical specialists said in june 2018 they would refrain from private practice in protest over the new tax policy for doctors all specialists doctors will strike if the discussion with the finance minister fails yahapalana gave in and said they would give the disturbance availability and transport allowance and allowances will be increased also doctors private practice will not be subject to tax in 2017 the ministry said that gmoa was preventing the routine transfers gmo said that was nonsense the gmoa has always participated in the transfer process for years and it is only in 2017 that gmoa has clashed like this with the health ministry the ministry has still not got the transfer list ready they said the list should have been published in december last year and by now the doctors would have been in their new stations education the ceylon teachers union ctu said in 2018 that though around 7 500 candidates qualified for promotions only 700 were promoted principals that is due to a circular issued by the ministry of education moe in 2015 that all teachers to be eligible for the principal s post should have a simple pass in sinhala or tamil at their ordinary level o l exam a sinhala medium teacher have a pass in the tamil language while a tamil medium teacher have a pass in the sinhala language of those eligible for promotion to the principal grade only 4 possess language proficiency this has resulted in about 4 000 grade 2 teachers and 3 500 grade 3 teachers stagnating without their due promotions minister mano ganeshan granted a solution by diluting the clause stating that teachers over 50 year of age instead of the pass at o l could follow a 100 hours course in tamil sinhala to qualify for promotions however the ministry has this concession and granted promotions only to those candidates with passes in sinhala tamil in their o ls the ceylon teachers unions stated that teachers in class iii and ii unable to acquire proficiency in sinhala and tamil are stagnating in their grades and unable to get promotion according to public administration circular 1 2007 all officers recruited to the public service and provincial ps should acquire proficiency in the other official language within a period of 5 years of their recruitment this includes a pass in s or t at o level and speech test when the matter came up in 2017 they granted concession to all teachers who had reached the age of 50 they were allowed to follow 100 hours of sinhala or tamil course conducted by the ministry of national integration and official languages however government failed to extend this concession in 2018 and 2019 which resulted in several teachers retiring without achieving class i status and have gone on pension without this the ceylon teachers union ctu charged that the education ministry which failed to distribute free copies of the teacher s guide book for the year 4 syllabus is now selling the books to teachers the syllabus for year 4 had changed and teachers were inconvenienced as there was no guide the education publications department epd which is responsible for distribution was now selling the guide at rs545 a copy and teachers serving year 4 classroom had to buy them the teacher s guide book for year 13 has also not been distributed for the last six years stalin pointed out that the advanced level syllabus was changed in 2012 the national institute of education was releasing the syllabus in sections to teachers via the internet in may 2019 cabinet of ministers approved a proposal by the minister of education to purchase 160 000 laptops to develop it facilities in secondary schools across the country a previous attempt by the minister to purchase tab computers in 2017 for al students and teachers had created controversy presidential commission investigating frauds under the current administration found that education ministry officials had inflated the number of al students and teachers eligible for tab computers in 2017 in the first estimate officials stated that 113 340 students 2820 principals and 5000 teachers were eligible to receive tabs these numbers were gathered from a census of schools conducted in 2016 a later estimate three months after the first stated that 159 786 students 2820 principals and 31 459 teachers were eligible to receive tabs cabinet approval was obtained in january 2019 to appoint 3 850 sports instructors to schools island wide salaries are to be paid by the central government a training programme was to be arranged for those selected and the chosen would be individuals who had proved their sports abilities at provincial or national levels 850 individuals were already selected and awaiting appointments said yahapalana ceylon teachers services union is opposing this when there are vacancies for some 4 000 sports teachers why is the government trying to introduce sports instructors instead asked the teachers the ministry was trying to provide employment to party loyalists due to this persons who had no sports qualifications had been selected ceylon teachers services union is also opposing the government s decision to recruit sports instructors to government schools in violation of the teacher service minutes tsm requires candidates appointed to the teaching post have sports qualifications in one of five national colleges of education ncoe sports instructors can be selected from ncoe graduates and the sabaragamuwa university the ncoe at vavuniya and batticaloa conducts diploma courses for sports instructors in tamil and bandarawela ruwanpura and milwela ncoe conduct diploma courses in sinhala the sabaragamuwa university conducts degree programmes in sports training instead there were moves to recruit persons with gce ordinary level qualifications with a sports background further these instructors are not teachers and have no responsibility towards students the ceylon teachers union ctu claims politicians are changing the name boards of schools in the western province to include their own names in alleged gratitude for the work they do for the schools it is claimed madiwela sri rahula vidyalaya has been renamed isuru maha vidyalaya after western province chief minister isuru devapriya in a similar move provincial council chairman sunil wijeratne has proposed that bulugahagoda maha vidyalaya in the gampaha district change its name to sunil wijeratne maha vidyalaya another school kiridiwela sangamitha balika vidyalaya also in the gampaha district has a three storey building named after provincial council member upali wijeratne chief minister devapriya told the sunday times he had no hand in the change of name of madiwela sri rahula vidyalaya to isuru maha vidyalaya and that it was the parents of the school s pupils who had decided on the move he said this had been done as a token of appreciation for the work he had done for the school the school was in a bad state almost on the verge of closure and i took it upon me to reconstruct and rejuvenate it he said meanwhile he noted this issue was nothing new as a playground in mirihana had been named isuru devapriya sports pavilion western province education minister ranjith somawansa said protocol should be followed in changing names of schools there was no provision to change the name boards and if at all there were to be a change a school could not be named after a living person he said sunday times 7 4 19 p 11 the presidential commission of inquiry to investigate corruption of the current administration was informed that there was a misuse of rs 2 430 million due to the re insuring the funds allocated for the suraksha insurance policy for schoolchildren with a reinsurance company in india reinsurance is the practice whereby insurers transfer portions of their risk portfolios to other parties by some form of agreement to reduce the likelihood of paying a large obligation resulting from an insurance claim the ministry spends approximately rs 285 million per year on the insurance cover for all students in the country however the ministry obtains public funds amounting to around rs 2 700 million for the insurance scheme said an officer giving evidence before the commission he said he was employed at the health and nutrition division of the education ministry and the insurance scheme was handled by that division we had several discussions with director of health and nutrition division and chairman of suraksha committee we pointed out that there was no need to re insure this with an indian company we were told that they were working according to the minister s orders wijeyadasa rajapakshe when he was education minister had submitted a cabinet paper to establish a fund at the education ministry that can re insure the suraksha insurance scheme the ministry of education had made seven appointments to top positions without following proper procedure they have got covering approval for these appointments from the education services committee of the public services commission said the ceylon teachers union these seven positions are additional secretary establishments chief commissioner of colleges of education education director technology education director research education director human resources education director teacher training schools and education director extra curricular activities however nine other top positions have been vacant in the education ministry for an extended period of time and that had caused a serious crisis in the education sector the vacant positions are director of sports and physical education director primary education director private schools director science director aesthetic studies director estate schools director languages and humanities director teacher transfers and director informal education these are vital positions and due to this lapse these sectors not functioning properly these positions have been left vacant to be filled with those who say they have been politically victimized said the ceylon teachers union the yahapalana government has been turning the education sector into a job bank for unpers the government has attempted to fill important positions in the ministry with unp henchmen who claim that they have been politically victimized about two weeks ago they appointed 3 850 sports instructors they are also appointing a large number of watchers last week the ministry of education has sent a list of 217 political victims to the public service commission seeking permission to give them appointments last year the government tried to promote over 1 000 unp supporters who claimed to have been politically victimized the teachers union complained in may 2019 one of the main issues in the education sector was that there were 302 acting principals in national schools these appointments were made for the most part by old boys girls associations and or regional politicians to exercise control over institutions by having persons dependent on them for survival appointed as acting school heads in 2012 there were 96 vacancies for principles in national schools that number has risen to 302 in2019 in 2017 there was an attempt to select principals but because the process was so corrupt the public services commission psc canceled the recruitments and asked the ministry to stick to rules and regulations nothing has been done so far ceylon teachers union complained in june 2019 that the ministry of education was planning to appoint registrars to all schools with over 1 000 students at a time when there were vacancies for principals in 302 out of 353 national schools there were 984 schools with over 1 000 students and depending on the number of students in a school the grades of the registrars would be determined schools with over 4 500 students will get senior registrars the work that is to be assigned to the registrars is currently done by vice principals so essentially the ministry is creating positions in 984 schools to give jobs to unp henchmen the teachers summarized the various grievances in a statement to the media in june 2019 the government has been turning education sector into a job bank for unpers such attempts have been ramped up in recent months as national elections were fast approaching in mid may the government appointed 3 850 sports instructors the ctu said they are also appointing a large number of watchers last week the ministry of education has sent a list of 217 political victims to the public service commission seeking permission to employ them last year the government tried to promote over 1 000 unp supporters who claimed to have been politically victimized the government has left nine top positions vacant in the education ministry for an extended period and that has caused a serious crisis in the education sector and made seven appointments to top positions without following proper procedure these actions are creating a lot of issues they said

some non gaap financial measures reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release financial supplement and other materials available in the investor section on our website and now i d like to turn the call over to alan schnitzer advertisement advertisement alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer thank you abbe good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today our 30 000 employees are engaged in executing on our focused strategic priorities and we re seeing the impacts as we ve explained in the past our strategic efforts are geared toward creating attractive top line opportunities and improving productivity and efficiency the strong results we delivered across all our business segments this quarter reflect progress on both fronts net income for the quarter of 796 million was up 19 over the prior year quarter generating return on equity of 13 5 the highest level in two years core income was 755 million up 11 and core return on equity was 13 also the highest level in two years the underwriting gain of 395 million pre tax is up more than 50 over the prior year quarter reflecting higher business volumes and a lower combined ratio earned premiums were up 5 to a first quarter record of 6 9 billion with each of our business segments contributing the combined ratio of 93 7 improved by nearly two points the underlying combined ratio improved almost a point to 91 6 with strong results in each of our business segments notably we achieved improvements in productivity and efficiency in each of the segments advertisement advertisement our high quality investment portfolio performed well generating net investment income of 496 million after tax while slightly below the results in the prior year quarter due to lower private equity returns net investment income benefited from higher fixed income return our strong results this quarter contributed to growth in book value per share of 7 and growth in adjusted book value per share of 2 after returning 625 million of excess capital to shareholders consistent with our long standing capital management strategy turning to production we remain very pleased with the execution of our marketplace strategies during the quarter we grew gross written premiums to a record 7 8 billion an increase of 6 net written premiums which reflect the impact of the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty we discussed with you last quarter were 7 1 billion up 3 our premium growth once again reflects high levels of retention and positive renewal premium change that speaks to the high quality of the business we re putting on the books in business insurance gross written premiums increased by 6 as we achieved renewal premium change of 6 including renewal rate change of more than 2 for both rate and rpc those were the highest levels in almost five years as you might expect the price increases were led by the commercial auto and property lines but with the exception of workers comp rate was up both year over year and sequentially in each of our product lines that s the result of granular and deliberate execution to meet our return objectives we ll continue to see great gains selectively and thoughtfully and in close coordination with our distribution partners importantly we are encouraged that while we were improving margins we maintained retention at historical highs and generated a higher level of new business in our consistently high performing bond and specialty business gross written premiums were up 4 driven by historically high levels of both retention and new business in our domestic management liability business advertisement advertisement surety premium volume was at high levels in both the current and prior year quarters in personal insurance which as you know is a great story gross written premiums were up 6 reflecting strong results in both our agency auto and agency homeowners businesses you ll hear more shortly from greg tom and michael about our segment results lastly i m pleased to report that as a reflection of confidence in our business our board of directors has declared a 6 5 increase in our quarterly dividend to 0 82 per share marking 15 consecutive years of dividend increases with a compound annual growth rate of more than 9 over that period to sum it up our first quarter performance was a terrific start to the year we generated strong results in terms of both profits and returns on top of that we had another quarter of excellent production our performance competitive advantages and commitment to innovation position us to continue delivering industry leading results over time and with that i ll turn it over to dan dan frey chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thank you alan core income for the first quarter was 755 million up 11 from 678 million in the prior year quarter and core roe was 13 up from 11 9 earnings per share and core earnings per share were up 24 and 15 respectively these improvements resulted from lower catastrophe losses and higher underlying underwriting margins partially offset by lower net favorable prior year reserve development and lower private equity returns pretax underlying underwriting gain which excludes the impacts of cats and pyd increased by 16 driven by improvements in all three segments underlying results benefited from higher business volumes and the consolidated underlying combined ratio of 91 6 improved by eight tenths of a point from the prior year quarter driven by a lower expense ratio successful execution of our productivity and efficiency initiatives resulted in improved operating leverage as insurance g a expenses were nearly flat while net earned premiums grew by 5 our first quarter results include 193 million of pre tax catastrophe losses down significantly from 354 million in last year s first quarter net favorable prior year reserve development in the first quarter was 51 million pre tax down from 150 million in the prior year quarter in personal insurance net favorable pyd of 69 million pre tax resulted primarily from better than expected performance in auto in business insurance net unfavorable pyd of 21 million pre tax compares to net favorable pyd of 66 million pre tax in the prior year quarter the change primarily resulted from the enactment of the child victims act in new york during the first quarter this legislation extends the statute of limitations for cases of child sexual abuse creating potential exposure to claims in the general liability line that were previously time barred excluding the impact of the new york law change business insurance would have reported net favorable prior year reserve development workers comp had net favorable reserve development commercial auto was largely unchanged and commercial multi peril had modest net unfavorable reserve development pretax net investment income decreased by 3 from the prior year quarter to 582 million as higher fixed income returns were more than offset by lower returns in our non fixed income portfolio advertisement advertisement fixed income nii increased by 39 million pre tax due to the higher average yield on invested assets and an increase in the amount of average invested assets lower returns in the private equity portfolio reflected the market downturn in the fourth quarter of 2018 as these private equity results are generally reported to us and consequently by us on a quarter lag as we discussed on our earnings call last quarter we added a new catastrophe reinsurance treaty for 2019 providing coverage for pcs designated events for which we incur 5 million or more in losses above an aggregate retention of 1 3 billion the cost of this new treaty is reflected in ceded premiums and that is the primary reason that the growth rate in net written premiums is less than the growth rate in gross written premiums this quarter because the ceded written premium is all recorded up front this impact will not recur in the remaining quarters of the year on an earned premium basis the new reinsurance treaty will affect the results of all four quarters in 2019 most loss recoveries from this treaty would likely benefit our net cat losses which are excluded from underlying results based on our assumed weather losses for the year the treaty would have about have a point adverse impact on the full year underlying combined ratio but a minimal impact on the full year total combined ratio and we assume that any recoveries would likely only benefit the second half of the year of course the effect on our underlying and total combined ratios for 2019 will be impacted by the level of pcs events we actually experience turning to capital management operating cash flows for the quarter of 639 million were again very strong all our capital ratios were at or better than target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately 1 9 billion holding company liquidity is temporarily elevated as we issued 500 million of 30 year debt at 4 1 ahead of our upcoming 500 million debt maturity in june we took advantage of attractive market rates and issued the new debt in early march so we re carrying an artificially high level of holding company liquidity exiting the first quarter that will naturally adjust itself before the end of the second quarter in terms of the unrealized gain interest rates decreased during the first quarter and as a result we went from a net unrealized investment loss of 113 million after tax at year end to 1 billion after tax unrealized gain as of march 31 advertisement advertisement adjusted book value per share which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses was 89 09 at march 31 2 higher than at year end we returned 625 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter comprising share repurchases of 421 million and dividends of 204 million and as alan noted the board raised our quarterly dividend from 0 77 per share to 0 82 per share so across all key measures we remain pleased with our strong financial position and with that i ll turn the microphone over to greg for a discussion of business insurance greg toczydlowski executive vice president and president of business insurance thanks dan business insurance had a strong first quarter as reflected in our underwriting and production results as you heard alan say both renewal rate change and renewal premium change were at the highest levels in almost five years significantly we achieved that while maintaining a very strong retention level advertisement advertisement and importantly we also continue to invest in strategic initiatives to position us for the future segment income for the quarter was 414 million while the combined ratio was 98 1 the underlying combined ratio of 95 improved by half a point from the prior year quarter even after the impact on earned premium from the new cat reinsurance treaty the treaty increased the underlying combined ratio by half a point split about evenly between the loss ratio and expense ratio let me break the underlying combined ratio down a bit further the underlying loss ratio was eight tenths of a point higher than the prior year quarter driven by about a point of elevated losses in our international business i ll provide some additional comments on international in just a minute in addition the change in the underlying loss ratio also included a little more than half a point from lower non cat weather losses which was mostly offset by the impact of the new cat treaty as well as a little less than half a point from higher commercial auto loss estimates consistent with the reestimates we reported in the fourth quarter of 2018 auto losses for the quarter were generally in line with our expectations the underlying expense ratio was favorable to the prior year quarter by 1 3 points about half a point of which was driven by continued growth in premium volumes while maintaining generally flat insurance g a expense dollars the other half of the improvement resulted from the benefit this quarter related to a state assessment before i turn to the top line in production i ll spend a minute more on what we re seeing in our international business for a couple quarters in a row now we ve shared with you that we ve experienced some elevated loss activity these losses are predominantly property driven and have come primarily from a small number of large losses and to a lesser degree higher attritional losses we re pursuing meaningful rate increases to address what we believe to be industrywide challenges in addition we re applying risk selection and risk control measures in response to the losses we re seeing and taking targeted actions to exit certain lines and accounts these measures are well under way and our production results in these market reflect the progress we re making in our efforts to improve profitability now to the top line gross written premiums for the quarter were up 6 over the prior year reflecting strong production results we continue to be pleased with the impact that our strategic initiatives are having in creating opportunities for us to grow the top line profitably in terms of domestic production we achieved strong renewal premium change of 6 in the quarter including renewal rate change of 2 2 the renewal rate change of 2 2 was up six tenths of a point from both the prior year and the fourth quarter with the commercial auto and property lines leading the way importantly at the same time as we achieved these pricing increases we maintained historically high retentions of 86 in addition to what you see in rpc we ve also been improving terms and conditions particularly in our large property business which improves the risk profile of the book new business was a very healthy 564 million we re pleased with our production results which reflect our thoughtful balance toward retaining our best business improving pricing where we need to in order to meet our return objectives and pursuing attractive new business opportunities as for the individual businesses in select renewal premium change and renewal rate change both remain consistent with the past several quarters while retention remained strong at 83 new business was strong and comparable to the prior year quarter we re pleased with the returns in this business and the production results reflect our strategic execution in middle market renewal premium change was 6 with renewal rate of 2 2 up seven tenths of a point from the prior year and six tenths of a point from the fourth quarter while retention remained historically high at 87 new business premiums of 336 million were up 4 from the prior year quarter building on the success from the business centers in commercial accounts we begun to roll out the utilization of the same centers across several of our other middle market businesses as with commercial accounts the goal is to be more active in the marketplace by creating additional capacity for our field underwriters to partner with our agents and brokers to create more solutions for our customers to sum up a strong start of the year for business insurance and we continue to feel great about our execution in the marketplace with that i ll turn the call over to tom tom kunkel executive vice president and president of bond and special insurance thanks greg bond and specialty delivered another quarter of strong results segment income was 138 million and both the combined and underlying combined ratios were an excellent 81 1 net written premiums for the quarter were up 2 driven by continued growth in our domestic management liability business considering the high quality of our management liability portfolio we are pleased that the domestic retention remained high at 89 with renewal premium change up 3 6 new business continued at historically high levels and up 6 from the prior year quarter surety premiums were strong in both the current and prior year quarters and we remain well positioned to capitalize on potential increases in public infrastructure investments so bond and specialty results were strong we feel great about our marketplace execution competitive advantages and our ability to continue delivering leading returns and profitable growth and now i ll turn it over to michael to discuss personal insurance michael klein executive vice president and president of personal insurance thank you tom and good morning everyone personal insurance is off to a great start in 2019 with strong profitability and solid production segment income was 278 million the highest quarterly total in a decade and an improvement of 149 million over the first quarter of 2018 our combined ratio of 90 1 improved 7 4 points driven by lower catastrophes improved underlying underwriting results and higher net favorable prior year reserve development on an underlying basis the combined ratio was 89 1 an improvement of 1 4 points even after an 80 basis point impact from the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty turning to the top line gross written premiums grew 6 demonstrating continued momentum in the segment net written premiums were up 2 in the quarter reflecting the impact of the new cat treaty the impact is more pronounced in agency homeowners and other where net written premiums grew 1 compared to gross written premium growth of 9 agency automobile delivered an impressive quarter with a combined ratio of 89 4 5 4 points better than the prior year quarter and the best result in more than 10 years the quarter benefited from higher net favorable prior year reserve development and very strong underlying results the underlying combined ratio of 92 1 improved 4 2 points relative to the prior year quarter due primarily to earned pricing exceeding loss trend including the benefit from continued improvements and observed frequency levels just as a brief reminder the first quarter underlying auto combined ratio is typically the lowest of the year we re also very pleased with our first quarter results in agency homeowners and other where our combined ratio improved by more than 10 points from the prior year quarter to 88 2 driven by lower catastrophes on an underlying basis the combined ratio was a solid 82 6 the increase of 2 4 points versus the prior year quarter primarily reflects the impact of the new cat treaty turning to quarterly production agency automobile retention remained solid at 84 with renewal premium change of 5 1 and a 7 increase in new business from the prior year quarter we re encouraged by these production results as we work to grow the line at returns that continue to meet our objectives agency homeowners and other delivered strong production results as well with retention at 85 renewal premium change up over half a point from the fourth quarter and increased momentum in new business driven primarily by the successful roll out of quantum home 2 0 our quantum home 2 0 product is now available in 25 states versus three states at this time last year we re on track to launch the product in most of the remaining states by year end including enhancements like our expanded smart home discount and home sharing endorsement both of which we ve introduced since the initial launch to date the product is performing well both in terms of marketplace reception by agency and customers and in terms of production and profitability to recap we re pleased to be off to a great start to the year in personal insurance and are well positioned to grow profitably while continuing to invest in the business with that i ll turn the call back over to abbe abbe goldstein senior vice president of investor relations thanks michael and thank you operator we re ready to begin q a questions and answers operator your first question comes from jay gelb with barclays your line is open jay gelb barclays analyst thanks and good morning in domestic business insurance renewal i m sorry the renewal rate change so it was good to see that that rate change accelerated in the first quarter and you mentioned that was largely due to commercial auto and property with an offset from workers compensation we ve seen in the past how that s gone up comparatively one quarter versus the prior quarter and then has shifted down over time do you think this has momentum to stay at this level or potentially increase or do you think this might be more of a one time boost alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer yes jay good morning it s alan if you go back and think about when we started talking about rate most recently beginning of 2017 and we said then we were starting to push for rate and if you plot out the line for either rate or rate and rpc you ll see an upward sloping line and that s been very deliberate on our part i shared in my prepared remarks that we intend to continue to push for renewal rate change and just in terms of managing the returns now we are getting some help from exposure and that counts too both in terms of the component of exposure behaves like rate and the expense leverage we get from it and if you see in the outlook section of the 10 q that we filed you ll see that we re calling for higher rpc there as well i mean that s a single number there s a lot of texture underneath we re forecasting essentially nine months out so who knows but we re going to continue to push in this direction jay gelb barclays analyst all right great higher rpcs and then separate question on small commercial we ve seen a number of potential competitors looking to move into small commercial on a direct basis like berkshire hathaway and progressive what s your perspective on how much that business could shift to the direct channel given that travelers primary presence on that is clearly an independent agent greg toczydlowski executive vice president and president of business insurance jay this is greg small commercial marketplace has always been a competitive section of the marketplace and we obviously are monitoring assessing all the competitors that enter that space and we make the assumption that some of them are going to be successful and we accordingly manage to that way and in terms of channel preference we re not seeing any material shift of channel preference right now we believe we ve got a model that s very effective and we re investing to make it as frictionless as possible so wherever the consumer ultimately goes in the future we think we re going to be positioned very well jay gelb barclays analyst ok including direct greg toczydlowski executive vice president and president of business insurance correct jay gelb barclays analyst appreciate that thank you operator your next question comes from mike phillips with morgan stanley your line is open mike phillips morgan stanley analyst thank you good morning everybody i ll take a shot at this one first on the pyd any chance you can give the dollar impact on the new york law change dan frey chief financial officer mike it s dan i think we re going to not be real specific on that given that it s an issue that we expect to be involved in legislation over a particular coverage matter we did try to give you at least direction of magnitude early in the press release i think we talk about the year over year change in pyd which on a pre tax basis was pretty close to 100 million being primarily attributable to the child victims act and in our minds that means more than half but i think to get much tighter than that would be more detail than we want to give mike phillips morgan stanley analyst ok no i appreciate that on the workers comp pyd was any of that from accident year 18 dan frey chief financial officer that s a good question of the top of my head i will tell you in one second comp 18 is a very young year on a longtail line so not a lot of movement in 18 favorability and workers comp is some recent accident years but that s a little too recent for us to be making much of a change mike phillips morgan stanley analyst ok and then i guess on the business insurance sticking with that for a second well there are clearly a few moving parts on the expense ratio from you mentioned in the q the simply business expansion the state assessment and such i guess is there a way for us to maybe help us think about how kind of a good run rate going forward would be i don t know how much the state assessment was or how much the simply business expansion is worth and that kind of thing because it s a good expense ratio with a lot of moving parts there dan frey chief financial officer yes so it s dan again i guess i ll think about expense ratio more at an enterprise level and from a high level we gave you some outlook at the end of last year which we expect in this year to be broadly consistent with what we saw last year last year as an enterprise we re at about a 30 1 this year in the first quarter it s a 29 7 there s a little bit of a benefit as greg mentioned from this state assessment change would have put you could think about that as 20 or 30 basis points back into the expense ratio this is an example of things can be a little bit lumpy from one quarter to the next we re happy with the expense ratio in the first quarter but not taking that as a permanent improvement versus what we had expected previously alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer ok mike just as a point of clarification mike that the simply business investment wouldn t be in the expense ratio just for clarification mike phillips morgan stanley analyst ok no i guess i was reading something out of the q that said part of your g a expense was due to expansion in simply business that s what i was referring to alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer yes it s g a but all of g a doesn t go into the expense ratio insurance g a does we can take it off line mike phillips morgan stanley analyst thank you i appreciate it operator your next question comes from elyse greenspan with wells fargo your line is open elyse greenspan wells fargo securities analyst hi good morning my first question i wanted to follow up on some of the commentary on the renewal premium change within business insurance so your outlook is now more positive for the year if we go back you guys did see a slowdown in the third and the fourth quarter on the renewal rate which picked up this quarter i know commercial auto and property have been lines that are getting price for some time so i m just trying to get a better sense of what really drove the sequential increase and gave you conviction to raise your outlook for the rest of 2019 greg toczydlowski executive vice president and president of business insurance elyse this is greg first of all the outlook as a reminder is an estimate and so we try to give you as much transparency and our best feel around where that s going to go on a going forward basis and if you look at the webcast slide for domestic bi overall you can see that the 6 for the first quarter we think is a terrific number and is the highest number on the page and as alan just said we re going to continue pursuing our margin improvement campaign going forward also alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer and elyse i would add that the rate increases are pretty broad other than workers comp so all products other than workers comp higher sequentially and year over year rate increases on a higher percentage of overall accounts for example so it s reasonably broad based although rational by product line relative with the returns we re getting in those lines elyse greenspan wells fargo securities analyst ok that s great and then my second question on international you guys pointed to about one point of underlying margin drag within business insurance from your international business i mean you did give some color on steps that you re taking to look to improve the margins there can you just talk to time frame i m assuming there s a certain level of drag that s embedded within your outlook for the next three quarters of the year and just how long you think those initiatives will take to work their way through your book of business alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer yes elyse it s probably more precise than either we could get or would want to share on that we ve got all the efforts focused on it we re working on it and there is an assumption that some of what we saw in the first quarter was an aberration and a return to more normal levels reasonably quickly and there s other work that we re going to be doing that s going to take some more time but to give you any more precision than that would probably give you a sense of precision that just doesn t exist elyse greenspan wells fargo securities analyst ok and then in terms of the size of the first quarter losses would you put it kind of in line with the fourth quarter of last year alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer i think elyse we re going to stick with the one point that greg shared in his prepared remarks elyse greenspan wells fargo securities analyst ok thank you very much operator your next question comes from ryan tunis with autonomous research your line is open ryan tunis autonomous research analyst hey thanks good morning my question is just on this whole discussion around rate and i guess for alan are we at a point where the better than expected rate the acceleration as you ve been factoring into the way you re thinking about your outlook this year for margins or is it more just you re taking the rate where you need it where you re seeing some elevated losses you re responding to it so broadly this is just a type of rate you think you need to be able to keep things broadly consistent or slightly better on the year alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer ryan if i understand your question i think the answer is yes to both the rate we re getting when and we give you some perspective by segment in the outlook and we give you some perspective on the outlook for margin in the outlook and the outlook we give you on margin does take into account as best as we can tell what we re going to achieve in terms of rate and exposure ryan tunis autonomous research analyst but it doesn t seem that the outlook for margins has changed materially despite i guess the better rate we re seeing this quarter so just trying to reconcile i mean how exactly are you thinking about the 22 it s just i guess what was needed or do you feel better about what margins are going to be here in 2019 than you did when we talked at the fourth quarter call alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer yes again to both yes we feel good about the 22 and we feel great about the six points of overall pricing if you go back and if you go back and look over a decade and you look at what rate and rpc have done you d say six points of price is pretty good by historical standards and particularly when you think about the fact that in end of 16 into 17 total price actually never went negative so before it went negative it started moving back up so we feel good about what we re achieving and we feel good about returns ryan if you take the results in the quarter and if you normalize for prior year development and weather you get a pretty good result and so we d be probably a little bit less than what we printed because there were some other good things that happened but you get a pretty good results so we don t look at the returns that we re generating on a consolidated basis today and say they re disappointing but as we look out the windshield into the future we think there s more work to do in terms of achieving our objective of mid teens over time and so we re not disappointed with the 22 we re not disappointed with the six and we re going to keep pushing there s more work to do ryan tunis autonomous research analyst thank you alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from brian meredith with ubs your line is open brian meredith ubs analyst a couple of questions here for you first one personal auto i noticed your outlook underlying margins looks for some deterioration for the rest of the year on auto i m just curious why is that is it because you re seeing the elevated severities is that what you re kind of factoring michael klein executive vice president and president of personal insurance sure brian it s michael klein no it s actually not due to that it s actually pretty consistent with the outlook we gave for the full year and has a lot to do with seasonality in the auto business so when we gave the outlook for the full year we said that auto experience would likely be better than the prior year in the first half and worse than the prior year in the second half and this is really just a reflection of the first quarter rolling off and now we re just looking at the nine months versus the nine months brian meredith ubs analyst so you re not seeing any issues with severity or anything michael klein executive vice president and president of personal insurance when you look at severity i would say we continue to see some of the same things you re seeing in the industry physical damage repair costs continue to be rising but they have been when you look underneath that you see a little bit of a shift in vehicles toward heavier vehicles and suvs you see higher repair costs due to improvements in technology and more technology in the vehicle so we think that those severity trends sort of are persisting the good news and we referred to this in our comments is that frequency has continued to be better than expected and in the quarter was an offset to that and part of the result that we produced in q1 but again the outlook is really just a quarter dropping off and consistent with the outlook that we had for the full year brian meredith ubs analyst gotcha and then basically going back to the reserve development and business charts on the child s victim act is that kind of when you think about the charts are you thinking about kind of on a national basis because of the law change there in new york or is it possible that this law in new york legislative action spreads to other states and could it get worse dan frey chief financial officer brian so it s dan so to be clear this reaction in the first quarter is to the new york change only right so we are setting reserves actuarially and from an accounting standards perspective based on what the law is we re aware that there are a number of other states that have discussed possible similar legislation on a go forward basis and are keeping a close eye on those if more states enact we would react accordingly as other states react the one that looks to be sort of in the nearest term potentially ready to go would be new jersey we ve made an assessment of new jersey and would expect that to not be anywhere near the magnitude of what we just recognized for new york but it s an ongoing issue in a number of states that we re keeping an eye on brian meredith ubs analyst thanks for the answers operator your next question comes from mike zaremski with credit suisse your line is open mike zaremski credit suisse analyst hey thanks follow up to brian s question on personal lines so auto results continued to outperform and that feels to be like an industrywide trend maybe you can comment on if you expect the competitive environment there just to naturally get tougher and then switching to the other side of personal lines homeowner s results on underlying basis are deteriorating and it seems also be industrywide trend and pricing does seem to be moving little north there so i know you guys are mostly a bundled product shop maybe you can talk to whether those two conflicting trends there and whether you feel that personal lines can start growing more for you guys going forward michael klein executive vice president and president of personal insurance sure mike again it s michael klein and i think certainly sort of two components there i will start with the segment right we re really pleased with the positioning of the segment we are growing policies in the segment growing premium in the segment and really had a terrific start to the year in terms of the total segment if you look at the pieces the auto competitive environment certainly we compete in that market every day i think if you use competitive rate filings as the proxy for a level of competitiveness and you look at that data you see that rate filings in the industry the file rate for the industry is down period to period and continues to be lower increases in aggregate than the industry had filed for in the past the aggregate i think 12 month rolling rate increase for the industry now is below 2 so that could be a proxy for the competitive environment in auto and maybe just an additional comment on the outlook while our outlook is for a higher combined ratio in the next nine months than the prior nine months it s still a target return so to your point we re seeking to grow in the auto line we re executing on marketing distribution and marketplace execution strategies to do that and as i said the production results demonstrate improvements in new business strong retention moderating pricing that i think is all consistent with that view on the home side again most of the deterioration in underlying from the first quarter of last year is explained by the treaty and so that s most of it if you actually remove the treaty impact from the underlying combined ratio and compare that to history it s very consistent with our long run average underlying combined ratio in home that said there s some period to period volatility there there is still some pressure in nonweather water loss activity which we have talked about which is part of why you see rpc rising and why we re focusing on improving rpc as we go forward but again i think we re very pleased with the performance of the property portfolio and the path we re on and then conversely to the auto outlook that i described the property outlook again mostly just because of the quarterization of the outlook is for better results on an underlying basis in property for the balance of the year sort of going the other away from auto and when you put those two together you get a better combined ratio outlook year on year mike zaremski credit suisse analyst got it it s helpful i did see the improved commentary in the outlook one follow up on commercial pricing thanks for the insights on commercial auto and property driving the pricing increases but i was wondering on workers comp pricing is that getting quarter over quarter more or less negative greg toczydlowski executive vice president and president of business insurance mike this is greg yes we really aren t going to share workers comp on an individual line in the price and just because it is such a sensitive dynamic of how we compete in the marketplace we have in the past i ve shared and it s pretty evident that there s been very good loss results in workers comp and there has been reductions in the market so if you look at our rpc at 6 clearly ex workers comp we d be higher than that and we really aren t going to disclose the individual product lines going forward mike zaremski credit suisse analyst thank you operator your next question comes from larry greenberg with janney montgomery your line is open larry greenberg janney montgomery analyst good morning and thank you for michael again on auto and if you answered it i apologize but is written auto pricing keeping up with loss trend michael klein executive vice president and president of personal insurance i don t know if i spoke specifically to written keeping up with loss trend but certainly on an earned basis we continue to expand margins and on a written basis at five points of rpc i would say we re continuing to expand margins on both basis i didn t speak specifically to that but we feel good about the margin expansion and again the outlook is for auto to produce target returns larry greenberg janney montgomery analyst great and then in bond and specialty i know the pyd jumps around quite a bit there but it was modest this quarter is there anything changing on that front tom kunkel executive vice president and president of bond and special insurance this is tom larry so the nature of the pyd in bond and specialty is it that it can be a little lumpy if you look at our surety business over the years you can see we ve had some really good returns and as our losses were continuing to come down we of course tried to accurately account for that in our initial year loss piks so that the majority of the results would hopefully be shown in that first calendar year so i think what you ve seen over time is an improved initial loss year pik and maybe less headroom in some of those areas for that stuff to move up all that said in our management liability businesses there s been a little bit of that too as we look to recognize things in that initial year as best we can so i think other than that no other great underlying dynamics that would explain that larry greenberg janney montgomery analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from meyer shields with kbw your line is open meyer shields kbw analyst thanks going back to the pricing dynamics within business insurance is there a difference between what you re seeing in what we call standard lines versus specialty alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer yes we re sort of looking at it greg you want to take that greg toczydlowski executive vice president and president of business insurance yes meyer are you referencing specialties like e and s meyer shields kbw analyst yes greg toczydlowski executive vice president and president of business insurance yes i mean that depends so much on your product mix i mean we re predominantly in the e and s business much more from a property perspective so the answer would be yes for us given some of the catastrophic pressures we ve seen on property over the last two years meyer shields kbw analyst ok and then more broadly i think this is mostly a question for greg we ve seen at least the u s treasury the pretty significant decline in interest rates from mid november how long does it take before that is reflected in pricing dan frey chief financial officer meyer it s dan so we ll consider that in pricing as we do a number of factors it s one of the hundred things that go into the process of determining what s the right price we ve seen the 10 year treasury move up and down but it s been sort of plus or minus 0 3 not more than 0 2 or 0 3 per quarter over the last four or five quarters so not a dramatic impact it does eventually get baked into what we think we need for price to generate the returns that we re trying to generate because clearly that s a component of return but it hasn t had a dramatic impact at this point alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer yes also i d add that we bifurcated a little bit we think about the return on the float and that we adjust periodically to reflect market rates and then separately we think about the capital on the balance sheet that supports the risk and that that really reflects the overall portfolio return meyer shields kbw analyst ok understood thanks so much operator your next question comes from josh shanker with deutsche bank your line is open josh shanker deutsche bank analyst yes good morning thank you for taking my question i was reading outlook as everyone else was and i think it s not too different from what it said before despite the improvement you re getting on rates it s really the cessation of large losses in non cat weather that will drive margin improvement for the remainder of the year am i reading that correctly alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer if you re looking at business insurance yes that s right it s large losses returning to a more normal level josh shanker deutsche bank analyst and so can we say with the close approximation that pricing and loss cost trend are in harmony right now i guess is your view alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer i would say that s about right on an earned basis on a written basis we re probably doing little bit better than that josh shanker deutsche bank analyst ok and just the same sort of reflections on the homeowner s business as well michael klein executive vice president and president of personal insurance yes josh this is michael i would say on the homeowner s business we re working to move rpc north so we re not quite there on a written basis yet but we re close josh shanker deutsche bank analyst ok thank you very much operator your next question comes from amit kumar with buckingham research your line is open amit kumar buckingham research analyst i guess two quick follow up questions the first question goes back to the discussion on expense ratio in your 10 k letter you talked about 40 of the business flowing through these business centers and bi and i was curious if maybe you can talk about where does that sort of net out to is that an eventual improvement in expense ratio or do the savings get reallocated somewhere else alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer amit thanks for that question productivity and efficiency is a strategic priority across the entire place in each of the businesses in the claim organization and virtually everything we do and so some of what greg s achieving through the business centers contributes to that it also contributes to other strategic objectives specifically making sure that we re providing great experiences for the brokers that we re doing business with and the customers that we re serving so it all goes to that point the savings whatever productivity and efficiency we generate there and frankly anywhere else really for us is we look at operating leverage or enhanced operating leverage as an opportunity and as we said before we ll take those dollars and we ll reallocate them over time as we see fit we can let it fall to the bottom line and you ll see it in the expense ratio we can reinvest it in strategic initiatives that we think are going to drive shareholder value or if we want to or need to we can decide that we want to put into pricing without compromising our return objectives so i know you ve heard us say that a lot but what s important to us about enhanced operating leverage is having that flexibility amit kumar buckingham research analyst now that you answered that question the only other question i had is maybe for michael switching gears to personal auto i know you answered several questions on what we saw on the loss cost trend but can you sort of opine where do you see the trajectory from here on frequency and severity michael klein executive vice president and president of personal insurance sure amit it is michael the short answer is when we look at our sort of long term trend pik it remains relatively consistent and i would say talking about frequency and severity a little bit separately generally what we see on the severity side is quarter to quarter fluctuations that sort of bounce around our long term expectation so again we see the severity pressure that you see in industry statistics around parts and liability cost and those things but feel like our long term assessment on severity reflects those on the frequency side again we talked about the first quarter underlying being driven by pricing earning in excess of trend inclusive of both sort of our assumption and a better than expected result in the quarter and we do see for a number of quarters in a row now frequency coming in better than i think we or the industry had expected it and it s something we re keeping an eye on and thinking about how to factor in amit kumar buckingham research analyst and is that with the frequency at a historical low does that trend line continue or do you get a sense that probably this is as good as it gets michael klein executive vice president and president of personal insurance i think it s a great question i think if you take a longer term look at frequency in auto you see a bit of a secular decline and that s the piece that we re trying to figure out as are we returning to sort of that long term downward trend in frequency or not there s been a lot of commentary and discussion around in the marketplace and in other places about what could be driving it and one of the things people point to is safety features on vehicles i think it is important to point out that a number of the features that folks like the insurance institute for highway safety point to as the ones that could have the most impact still have relatively low penetration in the fleet right things like automatic emergency braking less than 5 of the cars on the road have it so again i think the jury is still out on whether there is a shift in long term frequency trend but those are some of the things we re watching in addition to miles driven employment and the other factors that we ve talked about amit kumar buckingham research analyst got it thanks for the answers and good luck on that operator your next question comes from yaron kinar with goldman sachs your line is open yaron kinar goldman sachs analyst good morning everybody my first question i think elyse took a stab at it is in business insurance can you talk about the impact from the nonweather large losses this quarter how it compared to the prior year alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer beyond the international is that what you re referring to yaron yaron kinar goldman sachs analyst well i think last year you just talked about large losses nonweather losses not necessarily referring to international alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer yes the large loss activity in domestic bi has been relatively flat i would say greg toczydlowski executive vice president and president of business insurance i gave you in my comments here the non cat weather was a little more than half a point the good guy relative to the first quarter of 2018 yaron kinar goldman sachs analyst right right i mean i think in 2018 you talk about roughly 60 basis points of non cat weather and another 60 basis points or so of other large so it sounds like it couldn t really alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer yes we re also slicing the bone probably a little bit we re heading toward slicing the bone probably a little bit thinner than we d like too and i think most of the impact you re talking about was quarters two through four and so my answer relatively flat was q1 to q1 but if you go back and look at your commentary from last quarter i think you ll hear us say that the improvement was primarily going to be in quarters two through four yaron kinar goldman sachs analyst ok that s helpful and then greg i think you d said that in addition to pricing and also taking some terms and conditions actions in large property can you give maybe a few examples of where the terms and conditions are improving or how they re improving greg toczydlowski executive vice president and president of business insurance sure yes coming off those two catastrophic years there s obviously been some dislocation in the marketplace in just an opportunity for more risk sharing and that typically comes with terms and conditions so you can think about sublimits on flood and earthquake deductible shifting from a fixed component to more of the percentage certainly in the geographic exposed areas but that s something we re constantly looking at with all that said we look at our national property business on account by account basis so that s a generalization and we are again looking at each account and looking at the risk reward of those accounts and if there s an opportune time to have some risk sharing like there is in the property segment right now then we go about and achieve that yaron kinar goldman sachs analyst got it thank you very much operator your next question comes from jeff schmitt with william blair your line is open jeff schmitt william blair analyst hi good morning everyone question about your umbrella book heard in the market that there s an uptick in large losses there mainly due to the litigation environment higher jury awards higher settlement amounts is that something you re seeing at all alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer let s stay away from umbrella let me just respond to social inflation more broadly so this is probably an oversimplification but i think about social inflation broadly in three buckets i think about legal decisions i think about plaintiff activity and i think about jury awards from a legal decision s perspective certainly at the federal level over the last couple of years i d say that s probably been on balance an improvement if you look at jury awards i would say a little bit more volatile a little bit more unpredictable and broadly speaking when it comes to plaintiff activity the plaintiff s bar i would say we have seen a more aggressive plaintiff activity now that was certainly a big driver of the commercial auto charge that we took last quarter for example we think about the liability side of c and p for example but when you get into the larger end when you get into umbrella when you think about the large end of gl when you think about management liability those are broadly speaking coverages where there s already a lot of litigation generally everybody is represented in those cases and so those have always been reasonably active in terms of litigation it s really at least so far on the smaller end where we ve seen more activity jeff schmitt william blair analyst yes and i guess i was curious i mean it s been more acute obviously in commercial auto than other lines hearing they re starting to tick up in umbrella i guess is that spreading or i mean it sounds like you re saying it s a little bit more broad based already alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer no i mean we re certainly seeing it the phenomenon you re identifying could vary from company to company based on mix of business too right the net lines you put out the types of risk i mean you got to remember we re a middle market main street business for the most part i mean obviously we do have a national accounts business a national property business and we do write public company liability on management liability side but by and large when you think about travelers it s a main street middle market business so it could be a mix difference for us relative to others jeff schmitt william blair analyst and just one quick one on the homeowner s book looking at the underlying loss ratio up hundred basis points half of that looks to be about related to the new cat treaty but this remainder of a hundred basis points after being up a lot last year is that pretty much all nonweather water losses that you re seeing can you speak to that more is that state specific is this older homes i mean why is this popping up now for the industry michael klein executive vice president and president of personal insurance sure jeff just starting with the premise of the question i would say the treaty impacts a little more than you re estimating there and therefore the other impacts are a little bit less in the underlying but then underneath that we again as i mentioned we do continue to see some nonweather water loss pressure and i would stay consistent with what we ve talked about in the past we ve sort of sliced and diced that by geography by type of home by age of home we ve looked at we ve seen commentary around the first floor second floor so we ve looked at it by type of construction and what we tend to see is these nonweather water losses are up sort of consistently across most of those dimensions so there s not a thing we point to which is why our strategy to address it has been to seek to increase price so that be our view on the trend but the underlying in the quarter does reflect some continued pressure there again we expected some continued pressure there and have built a pricing strategy to address it so that s our take on it jeff schmitt william blair analyst ok thank you operator there are no further questions at this time i will now turn the call back over to the presenters abbe goldstein senior vice president of investor relations great thanks everyone for joining this morning and as always if you have any follow up questions please get in touch directly with investor relations and thanks have a good day operator duration 63 minutes call participants abbe goldstein senior vice

around the democratic world there is a power struggle taking place that might end up being the most damaging and long lasting consequence of this era of populism elected leaders from donald trump to turkey s recep tayyip erdogan to india s narendra modi have been steadily attacking the independence of their nations central banks this could end very badly a brief history of modern central banking as the economist points out politicians in the 1970s would routinely use central banks to goose the economy before elections to help them win this helped create a wave of inflation that paralyzed economies and caused untold misery the middle class saw its hard earned savings evaporate within a few years as a result over the last three decades countries around the world have given central banks much greater independence the united states was one of the leaders in this regard with paul volcker asserting the federal reserve s independence and breaking the back of the stagflation that had crippled the american economy in the 1970s today it is trump who is leading the charge in the opposite direction he is attacking the federal reserve and asking it not only to cut rates but to actually engage in emergency measures to boost the economy at a time of robust growth and low unemployment to ensure that the fed complies with his wishes he plans to nominate two candidates to its board whose only qualification appears to be a slavish devotion to the president but trump is not alone last year erdogan issued a sweeping presidential decree allowing him to directly appoint turkey s central bank leadership and in march the country s central bank spent a staggering 2 billion trying to prop up the turkish lira in advance of local elections in india modi pushed out two central bank governors so that he could find a more pliable one he has succeeded in february the bank cut rates apparently to help him in the national elections that are now underway in addition and more extraordinarily he essentially raided the central bank s coffers for 4 billion to buy the votes of poor farmers in south africa the anc is moving to change the structure of its central bank long private and fiercely autonomous in the philippines the president appointed a close political ally to head the bank and even in europe populists now routinely target their central banks the italian governing coalition has been attacking the central bank s leadership and questioning whether the bank should really be the steward of 100 billion of gold reserves that could be the start of an effort to raid the country s gold reserves to give the economy a short term sugar high to get a sense of how much the intellectual mood has changed consider this alan blinder a princeton economics professor who had served as vice chair of the federal reserve board of governors wrote an essay in 1997 arguing that the fed was so obviously successful at policymaking that the government should adopt that model in other areas like tax policy he advocated the use of independent agencies and commissions to shield policy from the overt political influence of elected officials who would want to manipulate policy for short term advantage today trump wants the opposite he would like to infuse the short term passions of partisan politics into the federal reserve trump senses that the country s mood has changed the financial crisis and the bank bailouts have eroded the fed s credibility and it s not just in america across the world central banks are seen as having failed to rescue main street while being too solicitous of wall street some of this criticism is justified though not in the united states where the actions of the fed and the bush and obama administrations worked better than anywhere else that s why the american economy recovered fastest and its financial sector is now stronger than any other major economy but even where the critique has merit the solution should not be to destroy the entire institutional structure of central bank independence the assault on central banks will not have an immediate effect but over time their credibility will be eroded their effectiveness will wane and then one day when the next crisis hits we will all wish we had institutions that could weather the storm but by then it will be too late fareed zakaria hosts cnn s fareed zakaria gps and makes regular appearances on shows such as abc s this week and nbc s meet the press he has been an editor at large time magazine since 2010 and spent 10 years overseeing newsweek s foreign editions he is a washington post and internationally syndicated columnist he is author of the post american world for more of fareed zakaria s reports go here now
the trump administration is readying a public relations offensive over the economic impact of its new north american trade deal to counter a crucial report expected on thursday that economists see as likely to show minimal gains at best industry sources familiar with the administration s plans told reuters the u s international trade commission s analysis of the u s mexico canada agreement would be met with a rosier forecast from the u s trade representative s office the three countries agreed last year to the deal to replace the 25 year old north american free trade agreement after president donald trump s relentless criticism of nafta calling it the worst trade deal ever made and insisting it be improved or scrapped the itc report has been kept under wraps and is being keenly awaited by u s lawmakers to help them decide whether to support usmca a report showing little or no gain from the changes would be a setback for the administration and give some democrats an excuse to deny trump a major political victory the report will measure usmca s effects on gross domestic product income job creation and specific sectors against a baseline of nafta a trade deal that already has eliminated nearly all tariffs among the three countries you wouldn t expect big effects compared to the existing nafta said laura baughman president of trade partnership worldwide llc a consulting firm that analyzes the economic impacts of trade actions and policies baughman estimated the overall gain in u s gdp in the deal s 15th year would be barely perceptible at about 0 01 percent and could be negative if the itc fails to give enough weight to new provisions on digital trade increased customs efficiency and services the itc report will analyze areas that are more difficult to measure than tariffs such as new rules of origin intellectual property protections or elimination of non scientific food safety barriers but people familiar with the matter said the ustr was expected to argue that the itc analysis fails to adequately capture the full benefits of the trade deal the ustr is expected to emphasize how the new rules of origin for autos create incentives for companies to invest in research and development and increase production of auto parts steel aluminum and textiles the trade agency also is expected to emphasize new provisions on digital trade and small parcel shipments stronger intellectual property protections including those for drug makers as well as increased dairy and poultry access to canada the deal already faces an uphill battle among democrats now in control of the house of representatives who have voiced concerns about the enforcement of labor rights provisions in mexico and usmca s effect on drug prices canada and mexico are seeking exemption from u s tariffs on global metal imports imposed last year autos rules a major question mark is whether tighter regional content rules for the automotive sector will be a positive or negative in the report usmca requires that 75 percent of a vehicle s value be made in north america with 40 to 45 percent produced in high wage areas paying at least 16 an hour requiring significant automotive production in the united states and canada the trump administration had hailed the provision as a centerpiece of usmca that would stem the flow of automotive jobs to mexico and incentivize billions annually in new u s vehicle and auto parts production commerce secretary wilbur ross said at one point the deal would bring back the vast majority of the 250 000 auto parts jobs lost over the years but economists from the international monetary fund analyzed the deal using the same economic model used by the itc and found a negligible impact on u s gdp over the medium term but a slight loss of 794 million in consumption a broader measure of economic benefit due to reduced activity in autos and textiles the results show that the tighter rules of origin in the auto sector and the labor value content requirement would not achieve their desired outcomes the imf researchers said in the paper published in late march the new rules lead to a decline in the production of vehicles and parts in all three north american countries with shifts toward greater sourcing of both vehicles and parts from outside of the region a spokeswoman for the u s trade representative s office declined to comment on a query about plans for an alternative analysis small gains for tpp in 2016 the itc s report on the trans pacific partnership trade deal showed that by its 15th year the reduced tariffs and increased trade among the 12 member countries would boost u s gdp by 0 15 percent or 42 3 billion compared with no deal employment in the tpp analysis would be higher by about 128 000 full time equivalent jobs while automotive exports would increase over the long term auto imports from japan would rise in the near term trump withdrew from the tpp in 2017 in one of his first actions as president the u s chamber of commerce also sought to temper the expected impact of the trade commission s report on usmca by pointing out that itc had traditionally focused just on goods tariff reductions in this case the usmca eliminates some remaining canadian barriers facing u s dairy and poultry exports but the bottom line is that there just aren t many tariffs left to cut john murphy the chamber s senior vice president for international policy said in a blog posting on tuesday he said members of congress should keep in mind the bigger picture of nafta s importance to the u s economy with 1 4 trillion in trade among the three countries last year trump has frequently threatened to withdraw from nafta if congress fails to approve usmca a scenario that experts have said would lead to widespread economic damage as tariffs among the three countries snap back to 1994 levels spiking costs for auto production and crippling u s agricultural exports looking at usmca against a baseline of no nafta it s a big gain said gary hufbauer a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics source reuters reporting by david lawder and david shepardson additional

mayor bill de blasio s appointment of new york university law professor and former new york city housing commissioner vicki been as the new deputy mayor for housing and economic development comes at a critical time for the city new york has been the beneficiary of incomparably good economic fortune but has been unable to manage the problem of population growth induced by the ready availability of jobs new york sits at the center of one of the nation s most productive metropolitan areas a 2017 brookings study ranked the region seventh among the 100 largest metro areas nationwide in output per worker high productivity metros yield bountiful tax revenues according to the new york city comptroller s comprehensive annual financial reports in fiscal year 2008 the peak of the last business cycle total city tax revenues amounted to 38 6 billion by fy 2018 tax revenues added up to 59 1 billion a 53 percent increase more than three times greater than the rate of inflation all that money facilitated large increases in spending on education social programs an expanded public workforce and neighborhood amenities everyone in new york likes the revenue benefit of being a high productivity city but accommodating high productivity workers the people who make the high salaries has proved difficult the census bureau s american community survey acs categorizes occupations that require higher levels of education and generally pay more as management business science and arts occupations in 2008 37 percent of employed new york city residents fit this category in 2017 41 2 percent did over that period the number of people in this category grew by 273 000 or about 19 percent to more than 1 7 million we don t yet have comparable data for 2018 but new york city s rapid job growth has continued the problem the seemingly inexorable growth of higher paying jobs brings in people who will outbid others for a limited housing supply in the ten years from 2009 through 2018 new york city completed 177 062 new housing units according to the rent guidelines board and department of city planning this may sound like a large number but in a city with a housing stock of 3 37 million housing units it s not enough to improve the rental market conditions faced by the typical household the median new york city household pays more than 30 percent of its income for rent a threshold defined as rent burdened meaning that this cost eats into other typical household expenditures like food and clothing about a third of all renter households pay more than 50 percent of income for rent de blasio s response has been to institute a huge affordable housing program setting a production target of 120 000 new units by 2026 of which 35 685 had been started by the end of october 2018 the mayor s effort has not however changed the broader reality that available rental housing is too expensive for most households attention at the state and local levels is increasingly focused on strengthening rent regulation lawmakers threaten to repeal provisions of current law that have enabled landlords to raise regulated rents nearer to market levels while popular such measures protect current tenants and prevent landlords from renting to newcomers including the well educated professionals who drive the city s economic growth and yet it s not clear that such households can be kept out successfully in decades past when new york s rent controls were even stricter potential renters who could afford it paid under the table commissions to landlords and lower rent tenants were paid to leave were new york s legislators to enact new rent laws that further cap rents and somehow prevent these evasions they would trade a rent squeeze for a skilled labor shortage as the economist remarks in places where demand for urban housing is rising a more effective policy is simply to build more housing if more new housing were available to newcomers the city could continue growing its high productivity labor force while keeping older housing affordable it s the only way that everybody can benefit from the city s amazing growth machine the new deputy mayor has an opportunity to institute common sense policies that move the city in that direction such policies should include a bona fide effort to mobilize private sector resources to produce more housing any expansion of housing would have to be substantial to relieve the strangled rental market de blasio once aspired to permit 16 000 new market rate units per year though he proposed no policies to achieve this goal and appears to have forgotten about it been should revive it and try to surpass it the city needs to set borough and community district wide targets for new housing the bloomberg and giuliani administrations pushed through large scale rezonings that dominated housing production over the last decade including in long island city greenpoint williamsburg downtown brooklyn hudson yards and west chelsea the next round of rezonings should be more widespread so that the effects of growth are shared development opponents must be challenged to accept the changes to zoning and other regulations to allow new housing at the same time the city should tailor its mandatory inclusionary housing policies to economic realities enacted in 2016 this program which applies to all residential rezoning is tough on real estate developers without acknowledging that developers build all our new housing limiting developer incentives by forcing the industry to build and subsidize new housing for lower income people simply causes developers to look to the public sector for financial support by tying new housing construction in many parts of the city to still limited public funding when private capital would be otherwise available the program effectively ensures that we will never build enough housing for everyone the good news is that new yorkers have the means to keep their city both prosperous and affordable new york doesn t need a bailout from albany or washington it needs only to avoid policies that prevent housing from being built and adopt policies that facilitate it let s hope the new

on june 23 2016 the people of the united kingdom voted in a referendum to leave the european union that decision now known simply as brexit has led to nearly three years of protracted political turmoil in the country the unexpected decision raised many concerns about how a u k exit from the european union common market will affect international trade currently governed by the bloc s common quotas and duties bilateral trade between ukraine and the u k is far from enormous as of 2018 it stands at only 2 53 billion with a negative trade balance of 247 million for ukraine according to the state statistics service but even kyiv is feeling brexit s shockwaves ukrainian business is asking how will trade now work what will the tariffs be how will duties and logistics look once the u k gets a divorce deal but despite these concerns some segments of the ukrainian business community see brexit not as a risk but as an opportunity for growth trade between ukraine and the u k could increase very sharply says bate toms a kyiv based lawyer and president of the british ukrainian chamber of commerce we should become the principal trading partner of ukraine in europe and maybe the principal trading partner in the world delayed gratification brexit has already been postponed twice the eu has set oct 31 as the new deadline for an agreement in order to avoid the worst case scenario the u k leaving the bloc without a deal everyone expected that there would be an agreement before the 2019 new year and after that u k would have three months to settle trading relations with other countries said alex lissitsa president of the ukrainian agribusiness club but something went wrong lissitsa said the u k has failed to sign free trade agreements with many different countries including the most important ones china japan and the united states they signed trade agreements with fiji panama and some other small countries he says on the one hand they re losing the eu and on the other hand they have gained nothing they are deadlocked there are other more technical concerns the u k has been part of the eu for a very long time says anzhela makhinova partner at the sayenko kharenko law firm the u k s own customs authorities which will stand at the border the border itself the certification bodies they don t exist it all needs to be created from scratch and therefore it is difficult to guess how it will be done in practice and what problems may arise agri advantage but with the u k leaving the eu ukraine may get a new market for its goods between 2013 and 2016 bilateral trade between the countries fell sharply from 3 5 billion to 2 05 billion however over the last two years it has seen a 23 percent recovery however there has not been a single year in which ukraine s exports to the u k have exceeded its imports from the u k but if brexit goes ahead experts believe ukraine s powerful agricultural sector could prove a big winner the u k is a significant net importer of food removing quotas and eliminating the remaining food tariffs would be good for the british consumer and benefit ukraine in terms of its opportunity to sell more food and agricultural produce to the u k says martin potter the founder of bluebirch a lviv based consultancy for u k businesses that operates in ukraine in 2018 35 percent of all goods the u k imported from ukraine were food and agricultural products worth a total of 238 7 million according to the ukrainian exporters club ukraine s largest agricultural holding myronivsky hliboproduct or mhp exported a modest 484 tons of poultry to the u k last year but that number could be much higher if the company is able to bypass the eu experts forecast when i talk to people in britain they all say they can t trade with ukraine under the eu s rules so they re sourcing produce from romania france and germany but it s much more expensive and it limits food security says the british ukrainian chamber of commerce s toms toms thinks that ukraine will be among the u k s safest options to ensure food security both germany and france are consistently growing in population meaning the amount they can export is limited ukraine is the opposite the population is declining and producing more food he says ukrainian agriculture isn t the only sector that could potentially benefit from brexit metallurgy faces four anti dumping duties in the eu after brexit there will only be one such duty the one london imposed as a world trade organization member britain is a major consumer of metal but lacks a domestic manufacturer definitely those ukrainian producers will benefit says sayenko kharenko s makhinova according to mark pritchard the u k prime minister s trade and investment envoy to georgia and armenia ukraine has no envoy there is also a huge opportunity to increasing trade and investment between the u k and ukraine this is especially true in financial services education new and emerging technologies as well as u k companies investing in major infrastructure projects in ukraine says pritchard however some experts are much more skeptical about ukraine s opportunities to increase exports to the u k after brexit according to ievgeniia lytvynova ceo and founder of the ukrainian exporters club ukraine will face significant competition from powerful countries that prioritize trade with the u k why should this be such a great opportunity for ukraine when everyone else will do everything possible to maintain their positions there she asks luxury import but while brexit could benefit ukrainian exporters it might deal a blow to ukrainian importers in 2018 ukraine s imports from the uk reached 1 4 billion currently goods from the u k enter ukraine at lower rates under the kyiv s deep and comprehensive free trade agreement or dcfta with the eu if the uk leaves the eu it will become like any other member of the world trade organization until a new trade agreement is reached ukraine and the u k will not have any preferential rates according to makhinova for example for fertilizers there is a 6 5 percent duty for wto members but under the dcfta there is a zero taxation so if the u k leaves the eu it will have to pay more she says as a final result ukrainian imports from the u k could decrease for a while but that is not guaranteed says the ukrainian agribusiness club s lissitsa ukraine largely imports cars and expensive luxury goods from the u k in 2018 cars made up 44 8 percent of imports as a result he believes imports will remain stable i do not think that it will be a problem for those who pay 200 000
china was a frequent topic of discussion at the international monetary fund imf world bank spring meetings held april 12 14 in washington the imf marked down the 2019 growth forecasts for every major economy except china the forecast for the u s was reduced 0 2 percentage points to 2 3 percent china was marked up from 6 2 percent to 6 3 percent a small change but a signal that the chinese economy is stabilizing mosads the first quarter q1 data reported this week ratified this confidence gdp growth of 6 4 percent year on year y y was better than expected industrial production growth in march came in at a surprisingly high 8 5 percent y y and retail sales in march were up 8 7 percent the trade data reported earlier were also mostly positive export growth was a healthy 14 2 percent belying the idea of a serious global slowdown or of major impact from the trade conflict imports however declined 7 6 percent from the year before which seems odd given the other evidence that consumption and investment are stabilizing in q1 china clearly shifted from worrying about deleveraging to stabilizing growth the march credit data new yuan loans total social financing and growth of the money supply all surprised on the upside the government has announced a cut in the value added tax which will make most goods and services cheaper for households and should spur consumption to that stimulus has to be added increases in local government bond issuance to finance approved infrastructure projects the overall stimulus seems to be about 1 5 percent of gdp much smaller than the big stimulus after the global financial crisis but apparently enough to already have had a positive effect on the economy while there was a general consensus on the sidelines of the imf meetings that the stimulus would be sufficient to stabilize growth in the 6 2 6 3 range for the year there was less optimism about the medium term with the additional stimulus even though modest in scope leverage will naturally rise as will financial risks there are reports of medium sized banks mostly under the control of local governments facing serious rising non performing loans the big five commercial banks that make up more than half of the system seem to have adequate capital and provisioning the chinese government can afford to resolve small banks that are insolvent but it will be a political challenge to carry this out smoothly around washington attitudes toward the u s china trade dispute have a similar character optimism that a near term deal will be struck reducing risks for the global economy in 2019 but pessimism that a deal will stick the two sides seem motivated to reach an agreement in the next few weeks the parameters of a deal are likely to include chinese commitments to purchase more u s products the number leaked is 1 2 trillion over six years open additional markets to imports and inward investment eg autos financial services and now discussion of cloud computing and take steps to eliminate forced technology transfer and intellectual property rights ipr violations each element faces risks over the medium term some of the purchases may not materialize because of problems on either side of the pacific and or the u s china trade deficit may rise despite the purchases because u s imports from china have been growing rapidly up 17 percent between 2016 and 2018 on market access the sectors to be opened all involve heavy regulation so it remains to be seen if these markets are truly opened and strengthening of ipr protection is inherently a slow and institutional process hence it is easy to imagine the u s declaring at some point that china is not rigorously implementing the deal the consensus among china experts is that president xi jinping is not going to dramatically open and reform the economy and hence the possibility of disillusionment on the u s side somewhere down the road is very high david dollar is a senior fellow in the john l thornton china center at the brookings institution and host of the brookings trade podcast dollar sense follow him on twitter davidrdollar

for joining us today our 30 000 employees are engaged in executing on our focused strategic priorities and we re seeing the impacts as we ve explained in the past our strategic efforts are geared toward creating attractive top line opportunities and improving productivity and efficiency the strong results we delivered across all our business segments this quarter reflect progress on both fronts net income for the quarter of 796 million was up 19 over the prior year quarter generating return on equity of 13 5 the highest level in two years core income was 755 million up 11 and core return on equity was 13 also the highest level in two years the underwriting gain of 395 million pre tax is up more than 50 over the prior year quarter reflecting higher business volumes and a lower combined ratio earned premiums were up 5 to a first quarter record of 6 9 billion with each of our business segments contributing the combined ratio of 93 7 improved by nearly two points the underlying combined ratio improved almost a point to 91 6 with strong results in each of our business segments notably we achieved improvements in productivity and efficiency in each of the segments our high quality investment portfolio performed well generating net investment income of 496 million after tax while slightly below the results in the prior year quarter due to lower private equity returns net investment income benefited from higher fixed income return our strong results this quarter contributed to growth in book value per share of 7 and growth in adjusted book value per share of 2 after returning 625 million of excess capital to shareholders consistent with our long standing capital management strategy turning to production we remain very pleased with the execution of our marketplace strategies during the quarter we grew gross written premiums to a record 7 8 billion an increase of 6 net written premiums which reflect the impact of the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty we discussed with you last quarter were 7 1 billion up 3 our premium growth once again reflects high levels of retention and positive renewal premium change that speaks to the high quality of the business we re putting on the books in business insurance gross written premiums increased by 6 as we achieved renewal premium change of 6 including renewal rate change of more than 2 for both rate and rpc those were the highest levels in almost five years as you might expect the price increases were led by the commercial auto and property lines but with the exception of workers comp rate was up both year over year and sequentially in each of our product lines that s the result of granular and deliberate execution to meet our return objectives we ll continue to see great gains selectively and thoughtfully and in close coordination with our distribution partners importantly we are encouraged that while we were improving margins we maintained retention at historical highs and generated a higher level of new business in our consistently high performing bond and specialty business gross written premiums were up 4 driven by historically high levels of both retention and new business in our domestic management liability business surety premium volume was at high levels in both the current and prior year quarters in personal insurance which as you know is a great story gross written premiums were up 6 reflecting strong results in both our agency auto and agency homeowners businesses you ll hear more shortly from greg tom and michael about our segment results lastly i m pleased to report that as a reflection of confidence in our business our board of directors has declared a 6 5 increase in our quarterly dividend to 0 82 per share marking 15 consecutive years of dividend increases with a compound annual growth rate of more than 9 over that period to sum it up our first quarter performance was a terrific start to the year we generated strong results in terms of both profits and returns on top of that we had another quarter of excellent production our performance competitive advantages and commitment to innovation position us to continue delivering industry leading results over time and with that i ll turn it over to dan dan frey chief financial officer thank you alan core income for the first quarter was 755 million up 11 from 678 million in the prior year quarter and core roe was 13 up from 11 9 earnings per share and core earnings per share were up 24 and 15 respectively these improvements resulted from lower catastrophe losses and higher underlying underwriting margins partially offset by lower net favorable prior year reserve development and lower private equity returns pretax underlying underwriting gain which excludes the impacts of cats and pyd increased by 16 driven by improvements in all three segments underlying results benefited from higher business volumes and the consolidated underlying combined ratio of 91 6 improved by eight tenths of a point from the prior year quarter driven by a lower expense ratio successful execution of our productivity and efficiency initiatives resulted in improved operating leverage as insurance g a expenses were nearly flat while net earned premiums grew by 5 our first quarter results include 193 million of pre tax catastrophe losses down significantly from 354 million in last year s first quarter net favorable prior year reserve development in the first quarter was 51 million pre tax down from 150 million in the prior year quarter in personal insurance net favorable pyd of 69 million pre tax resulted primarily from better than expected performance in auto in business insurance net unfavorable pyd of 21 million pre tax compares to net favorable pyd of 66 million pre tax in the prior year quarter the change primarily resulted from the enactment of the child victims act in new york during the first quarter this legislation extends the statute of limitations for cases of child sexual abuse creating potential exposure to claims in the general liability line that were previously time barred excluding the impact of the new york law change business insurance would have reported net favorable prior year reserve development workers comp had net favorable reserve development commercial auto was largely unchanged and commercial multi peril had modest net unfavorable reserve development pretax net investment income decreased by 3 from the prior year quarter to 582 million as higher fixed income returns were more than offset by lower returns in our non fixed income portfolio fixed income nii increased by 39 million pre tax due to the higher average yield on invested assets and an increase in the amount of average invested assets lower returns in the private equity portfolio reflected the market downturn in the fourth quarter of 2018 as these private equity results are generally reported to us and consequently by us on a quarter lag as we discussed on our earnings call last quarter we added a new catastrophe reinsurance treaty for 2019 providing coverage for pcs designated events for which we incur 5 million or more in losses above an aggregate retention of 1 3 billion the cost of this new treaty is reflected in ceded premiums and that is the primary reason that the growth rate in net written premiums is less than the growth rate in gross written premiums this quarter because the ceded written premium is all recorded up front this impact will not recur in the remaining quarters of the year on an earned premium basis the new reinsurance treaty will affect the results of all four quarters in 2019 most loss recoveries from this treaty would likely benefit our net cat losses which are excluded from underlying results based on our assumed weather losses for the year the treaty would have about have a point adverse impact on the full year underlying combined ratio but a minimal impact on the full year total combined ratio and we assume that any recoveries would likely only benefit the second half of the year of course the effect on our underlying and total combined ratios for 2019 will be impacted by the level of pcs events we actually experience turning to capital management operating cash flows for the quarter of 639 million were again very strong all our capital ratios were at or better than target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately 1 9 billion holding company liquidity is temporarily elevated as we issued 500 million of 30 year debt at 4 1 ahead of our upcoming 500 million debt maturity in june we took advantage of attractive market rates and issued the new debt in early march so we re carrying an artificially high level of holding company liquidity exiting the first quarter that will naturally adjust itself before the end of the second quarter in terms of the unrealized gain interest rates decreased during the first quarter and as a result we went from a net unrealized investment loss of 113 million after tax at year end to 1 billion after tax unrealized gain as of march 31 adjusted book value per share which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses was 89 09 at march 31 2 higher than at year end we returned 625 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter comprising share repurchases of 421 million and dividends of 204 million and as alan noted the board raised our quarterly dividend from 0 77 per share to 0 82 per share so across all key measures we remain pleased with our strong financial position and with that i ll turn the microphone over to greg for a discussion of business insurance greg toczydlowski executive vice president and president of business insurance thanks dan business insurance had a strong first quarter as reflected in our underwriting and production results as you heard alan say both renewal rate change and renewal premium change were at the highest levels in almost five years significantly we achieved that while maintaining a very strong retention level and importantly we also continue to invest in strategic initiatives to position us for the future segment income for the quarter was 414 million while the combined ratio was 98 1 the underlying combined ratio of 95 improved by half a point from the prior year quarter even after the impact on earned premium from the new cat reinsurance treaty the treaty increased the underlying combined ratio by half a point split about evenly between the loss ratio and expense ratio let me break the underlying combined ratio down a bit further the underlying loss ratio was eight tenths of a point higher than the prior year quarter driven by about a point of elevated losses in our international business i ll provide some additional comments on international in just a minute in addition the change in the underlying loss ratio also included a little more than half a point from lower non cat weather losses which was mostly offset by the impact of the new cat treaty as well as a little less than half a point from higher commercial auto loss estimates consistent with the reestimates we reported in the fourth quarter of 2018 auto losses for the quarter were generally in line with our expectations the underlying expense ratio was favorable to the prior year quarter by 1 3 points about half a point of which was driven by continued growth in premium volumes while maintaining generally flat insurance g a expense dollars the other half of the improvement resulted from the benefit this quarter related to a state assessment before i turn to the top line in production i ll spend a minute more on what we re seeing in our international business for a couple quarters in a row now we ve shared with you that we ve experienced some elevated loss activity these losses are predominantly property driven and have come primarily from a small number of large losses and to a lesser degree higher attritional losses we re pursuing meaningful rate increases to address what we believe to be industrywide challenges in addition we re applying risk selection and risk control measures in response to the losses we re seeing and taking targeted actions to exit certain lines and accounts these measures are well under way and our production results in these market reflect the progress we re making in our efforts to improve profitability now to the top line gross written premiums for the quarter were up 6 over the prior year reflecting strong production results we continue to be pleased with the impact that our strategic initiatives are having in creating opportunities for us to grow the top line profitably in terms of domestic production we achieved strong renewal premium change of 6 in the quarter including renewal rate change of 2 2 the renewal rate change of 2 2 was up six tenths of a point from both the prior year and the fourth quarter with the commercial auto and property lines leading the way importantly at the same time as we achieved these pricing increases we maintained historically high retentions of 86 in addition to what you see in rpc we ve also been improving terms and conditions particularly in our large property business which improves the risk profile of the book new business was a very healthy 564 million we re pleased with our production results which reflect our thoughtful balance toward retaining our best business improving pricing where we need to in order to meet our return objectives and pursuing attractive new business opportunities as for the individual businesses in select renewal premium change and renewal rate change both remain consistent with the past several quarters while retention remained strong at 83 new business was strong and comparable to the prior year quarter we re pleased with the returns in this business and the production results reflect our strategic execution in middle market renewal premium change was 6 with renewal rate of 2 2 up seven tenths of a point from the prior year and six tenths of a point from the fourth quarter while retention remained historically high at 87 new business premiums of 336 million were up 4 from the prior year quarter building on the success from the business centers in commercial accounts we begun to roll out the utilization of the same centers across several of our other middle market businesses as with commercial accounts the goal is to be more active in the marketplace by creating additional capacity for our field underwriters to partner with our agents and brokers to create more solutions for our customers to sum up a strong start of the year for business insurance and we continue to feel great about our execution in the marketplace with that i ll turn the call over to tom tom kunkel executive vice president and president of bond and special insurance thanks greg bond and specialty delivered another quarter of strong results segment income was 138 million and both the combined and underlying combined ratios were an excellent 81 1 net written premiums for the quarter were up 2 driven by continued growth in our domestic management liability business considering the high quality of our management liability portfolio we are pleased that the domestic retention remained high at 89 with renewal premium change up 3 6 new business continued at historically high levels and up 6 from the prior year quarter surety premiums were strong in both the current and prior year quarters and we remain well positioned to capitalize on potential increases in public infrastructure investments so bond and specialty results were strong we feel great about our marketplace execution competitive advantages and our ability to continue delivering leading returns and profitable growth and now i ll turn it over to michael to discuss personal insurance michael klein executive vice president and president of personal insurance thank you tom and good morning everyone personal insurance is off to a great start in 2019 with strong profitability and solid production segment income was 278 million the highest quarterly total in a decade and an improvement of 149 million over the first quarter of 2018 our combined ratio of 90 1 improved 7 4 points driven by lower catastrophes improved underlying underwriting results and higher net favorable prior year reserve development on an underlying basis the combined ratio was 89 1 an improvement of 1 4 points even after an 80 basis point impact from the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty turning to the top line gross written premiums grew 6 demonstrating continued momentum in the segment net written premiums were up 2 in the quarter reflecting the impact of the new cat treaty the impact is more pronounced in agency homeowners and other where net written premiums grew 1 compared to gross written premium growth of 9 agency automobile delivered an impressive quarter with a combined ratio of 89 4 5 4 points better than the prior year quarter and the best result in more than 10 years the quarter benefited from higher net favorable prior year reserve development and very strong underlying results the underlying combined ratio of 92 1 improved 4 2 points relative to the prior year quarter due primarily to earned pricing exceeding loss trend including the benefit from continued improvements and observed frequency levels just as a brief reminder the first quarter underlying auto combined ratio is typically the lowest of the year we re also very pleased with our first quarter results in agency homeowners and other where our combined ratio improved by more than 10 points from the prior year quarter to 88 2 driven by lower catastrophes on an underlying basis the combined ratio was a solid 82 6 the increase of 2 4 points versus the prior year quarter primarily reflects the impact of the new cat treaty turning to quarterly production agency automobile retention remained solid at 84 with renewal premium change of 5 1 and a 7 increase in new business from the prior year quarter we re encouraged by these production results as we work to grow the line at returns that continue to meet our objectives agency homeowners and other delivered strong production results as well with retention at 85 renewal premium change up over half a point from the fourth quarter and increased momentum in new business driven primarily by the successful roll out of quantum home 2 0 our quantum home 2 0 product is now available in 25 states versus three states at this time last year we re on track to launch the product in most of the remaining states by year end including enhancements like our expanded smart home discount and home sharing endorsement both of which we ve introduced since the initial launch to date the product is performing well both in terms of marketplace reception by agency and customers and in terms of production and profitability to recap we re pleased to be off to a great start to the year in personal insurance and are well positioned to grow profitably while continuing to invest in the business with that i ll turn the call back over to abbe abbe goldstein senior vice president of investor relations thanks michael and thank you operator we re ready to begin q a questions and answers operator your first question comes from jay gelb with barclays your line is open jay gelb barclays analyst thanks and good morning in domestic business insurance renewal i m sorry the renewal rate change so it was good to see that that rate change accelerated in the first quarter and you mentioned that was largely due to commercial auto and property with an offset from workers compensation we ve seen in the past how that s gone up comparatively one quarter versus the prior quarter and then has shifted down over time do you think this has momentum to stay at this level or potentially increase or do you think this might be more of a one time boost alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer yes jay good morning it s alan if you go back and think about when we started talking about rate most recently beginning of 2017 and we said then we were starting to push for rate and if you plot out the line for either rate or rate and rpc you ll see an upward sloping line and that s been very deliberate on our part i shared in my prepared remarks that we intend to continue to push for renewal rate change and just in terms of managing the returns now we are getting some help from exposure and that counts too both in terms of the component of exposure behaves like rate and the expense leverage we get from it and if you see in the outlook section of the 10 q that we filed you ll see that we re calling for higher rpc there as well i mean that s a single number there s a lot of texture underneath we re forecasting essentially nine months out so who knows but we re going to continue to push in this direction jay gelb barclays analyst all right great higher rpcs and then separate question on small commercial we ve seen a number of potential competitors looking to move into small commercial on a direct basis like berkshire hathaway and progressive what s your perspective on how much that business could shift to the direct channel given that travelers primary presence on that is clearly an independent agent greg toczydlowski executive vice president and president of business insurance jay this is greg small commercial marketplace has always been a competitive section of the marketplace and we obviously are monitoring assessing all the competitors that enter that space and we make the assumption that some of them are going to be successful and we accordingly manage to that way and in terms of channel preference we re not seeing any material shift of channel preference right now we believe we ve got a model that s very effective and we re investing to make it as frictionless as possible so wherever the consumer ultimately goes in the future we think we re going to be positioned very well jay gelb barclays analyst ok including direct greg toczydlowski executive vice president and president of business insurance correct jay gelb barclays analyst appreciate that thank you operator your next question comes from mike phillips with morgan stanley your line is open mike phillips morgan stanley analyst thank you good morning everybody i ll take a shot at this one first on the pyd any chance you can give the dollar impact on the new york law change dan frey chief financial officer mike it s dan i think we re going to not be real specific on that given that it s an issue that we expect to be involved in legislation over a particular coverage matter we did try to give you at least direction of magnitude early in the press release i think we talk about the year over year change in pyd which on a pre tax basis was pretty close to 100 million being primarily attributable to the child victims act and in our minds that means more than half but i think to get much tighter than that would be more detail than we want to give mike phillips morgan stanley analyst ok no i appreciate that on the workers comp pyd was any of that from accident year 18 dan frey chief financial officer that s a good question of the top of my head i will tell you in one second comp 18 is a very young year on a longtail line so not a lot of movement in 18 favorability and workers comp is some recent accident years but that s a little too recent for us to be making much of a change mike phillips morgan stanley analyst ok and then i guess on the business insurance sticking with that for a second well there are clearly a few moving parts on the expense ratio from you mentioned in the q the simply business expansion the state assessment and such i guess is there a way for us to maybe help us think about how kind of a good run rate going forward would be i don t know how much the state assessment was or how much the simply business expansion is worth and that kind of thing because it s a good expense ratio with a lot of moving parts there dan frey chief financial officer yes so it s dan again i guess i ll think about expense ratio more at an enterprise level and from a high level we gave you some outlook at the end of last year which we expect in this year to be broadly consistent with what we saw last year last year as an enterprise we re at about a 30 1 this year in the first quarter it s a 29 7 there s a little bit of a benefit as greg mentioned from this state assessment change would have put you could think about that as 20 or 30 basis points back into the expense ratio this is an example of things can be a little bit lumpy from one quarter to the next we re happy with the expense ratio in the first quarter but not taking that as a permanent improvement versus what we had expected previously alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer ok mike just as a point of clarification mike that the simply business investment wouldn t be in the expense ratio just for clarification mike phillips morgan stanley analyst ok no i guess i was reading something out of the q that said part of your g a expense was due to expansion in simply business that s what i was referring to alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer yes it s g a but all of g a doesn t go into the expense ratio insurance g a does we can take it off line mike phillips morgan stanley analyst thank you i appreciate it operator your next question comes from elyse greenspan with wells fargo your line is open elyse greenspan wells fargo securities analyst hi good morning my first question i wanted to follow up on some of the commentary on the renewal premium change within business insurance so your outlook is now more positive for the year if we go back you guys did see a slowdown in the third and the fourth quarter on the renewal rate which picked up this quarter i know commercial auto and property have been lines that are getting price for some time so i m just trying to get a better sense of what really drove the sequential increase and gave you conviction to raise your outlook for the rest of 2019 greg toczydlowski executive vice president and president of business insurance elyse this is greg first of all the outlook as a reminder is an estimate and so we try to give you as much transparency and our best feel around where that s going to go on a going forward basis and if you look at the webcast slide for domestic bi overall you can see that the 6 for the first quarter we think is a terrific number and is the highest number on the page and as alan just said we re going to continue pursuing our margin improvement campaign going forward also alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer and elyse i would add that the rate increases are pretty broad other than workers comp so all products other than workers comp higher sequentially and year over year rate increases on a higher percentage of overall accounts for example so it s reasonably broad based although rational by product line relative with the returns we re getting in those lines elyse greenspan wells fargo securities analyst ok that s great and then my second question on international you guys pointed to about one point of underlying margin drag within business insurance from your international business i mean you did give some color on steps that you re taking to look to improve the margins there can you just talk to time frame i m assuming there s a certain level of drag that s embedded within your outlook for the next three quarters of the year and just how long you think those initiatives will take to work their way through your book of business alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer yes elyse it s probably more precise than either we could get or would want to share on that we ve got all the efforts focused on it we re working on it and there is an assumption that some of what we saw in the first quarter was an aberration and a return to more normal levels reasonably quickly and there s other work that we re going to be doing that s going to take some more time but to give you any more precision than that would probably give you a sense of precision that just doesn t exist elyse greenspan wells fargo securities analyst ok and then in terms of the size of the first quarter losses would you put it kind of in line with the fourth quarter of last year alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer i think elyse we re going to stick with the one point that greg shared in his prepared remarks elyse greenspan wells fargo securities analyst ok thank you very much operator your next question comes from ryan tunis with autonomous research your line is open ryan tunis autonomous research analyst hey thanks good morning my question is just on this whole discussion around rate and i guess for alan are we at a point where the better than expected rate the acceleration as you ve been factoring into the way you re thinking about your outlook this year for margins or is it more just you re taking the rate where you need it where you re seeing some elevated losses you re responding to it so broadly this is just a type of rate you think you need to be able to keep things broadly consistent or slightly better on the year alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer ryan if i understand your question i think the answer is yes to both the rate we re getting when and we give you some perspective by segment in the outlook and we give you some perspective on the outlook for margin in the outlook and the outlook we give you on margin does take into account as best as we can tell what we re going to achieve in terms of rate and exposure ryan tunis autonomous research analyst but it doesn t seem that the outlook for margins has changed materially despite i guess the better rate we re seeing this quarter so just trying to reconcile i mean how exactly are you thinking about the 22 it s just i guess what was needed or do you feel better about what margins are going to be here in 2019 than you did when we talked at the fourth quarter call alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer yes again to both yes we feel good about the 22 and we feel great about the six points of overall pricing if you go back and if you go back and look over a decade and you look at what rate and rpc have done you d say six points of price is pretty good by historical standards and particularly when you think about the fact that in end of 16 into 17 total price actually never went negative so before it went negative it started moving back up so we feel good about what we re achieving and we feel good about returns ryan if you take the results in the quarter and if you normalize for prior year development and weather you get a pretty good result and so we d be probably a little bit less than what we printed because there were some other good things that happened but you get a pretty good results so we don t look at the returns that we re generating on a consolidated basis today and say they re disappointing but as we look out the windshield into the future we think there s more work to do in terms of achieving our objective of mid teens over time and so we re not disappointed with the 22 we re not disappointed with the six and we re going to keep pushing there s more work to do ryan tunis autonomous research analyst thank you alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from brian meredith with ubs your line is open brian meredith ubs analyst a couple of questions here for you first one personal auto i noticed your outlook underlying margins looks for some deterioration for the rest of the year on auto i m just curious why is that is it because you re seeing the elevated severities is that what you re kind of factoring michael klein executive vice president and president of personal insurance sure brian it s michael klein no it s actually not due to that it s actually pretty consistent with the outlook we gave for the full year and has a lot to do with seasonality in the auto business so when we gave the outlook for the full year we said that auto experience would likely be better than the prior year in the first half and worse than the prior year in the second half and this is really just a reflection of the first quarter rolling off and now we re just looking at the nine months versus the nine months brian meredith ubs analyst so you re not seeing any issues with severity or anything michael klein executive vice president and president of personal insurance when you look at severity i would say we continue to see some of the same things you re seeing in the industry physical damage repair costs continue to be rising but they have been when you look underneath that you see a little bit of a shift in vehicles toward heavier vehicles and suvs you see higher repair costs due to improvements in technology and more technology in the vehicle so we think that those severity trends sort of are persisting the good news and we referred to this in our comments is that frequency has continued to be better than expected and in the quarter was an offset to that and part of the result that we produced in q1 but again the outlook is really just a quarter dropping off and consistent with the outlook that we had for the full year brian meredith ubs analyst gotcha and then basically going back to the reserve development and business charts on the child s victim act is that kind of when you think about the charts are you thinking about kind of on a national basis because of the law change there in new york or is it possible that this law in new york legislative action spreads to other states and could it get worse dan frey chief financial officer brian so it s dan so to be clear this reaction in the first quarter is to the new york change only right so we are setting reserves actuarially and from an accounting standards perspective based on what the law is we re aware that there are a number of other states that have discussed possible similar legislation on a go forward basis and are keeping a close eye on those if more states enact we would react accordingly as other states react the one that looks to be sort of in the nearest term potentially ready to go would be new jersey we ve made an assessment of new jersey and would expect that to not be anywhere near the magnitude of what we just recognized for new york but it s an ongoing issue in a number of states that we re keeping an eye on brian meredith ubs analyst thanks for the answers operator your next question comes from mike zaremski with credit suisse your line is open mike zaremski credit suisse analyst hey thanks follow up to brian s question on personal lines so auto results continued to outperform and that feels to be like an industrywide trend maybe you can comment on if you expect the competitive environment there just to naturally get tougher and then switching to the other side of personal lines homeowner s results on underlying basis are deteriorating and it seems also be industrywide trend and pricing does seem to be moving little north there so i know you guys are mostly a bundled product shop maybe you can talk to whether those two conflicting trends there and whether you feel that personal lines can start growing more for you guys going forward michael klein executive vice president and president of personal insurance sure mike again it s michael klein and i think certainly sort of two components there i will start with the segment right we re really pleased with the positioning of the segment we are growing policies in the segment growing premium in the segment and really had a terrific start to the year in terms of the total segment if you look at the pieces the auto competitive environment certainly we compete in that market every day i think if you use competitive rate filings as the proxy for a level of competitiveness and you look at that data you see that rate filings in the industry the file rate for the industry is down period to period and continues to be lower increases in aggregate than the industry had filed for in the past the aggregate i think 12 month rolling rate increase for the industry now is below 2 so that could be a proxy for the competitive environment in auto and maybe just an additional comment on the outlook while our outlook is for a higher combined ratio in the next nine months than the prior nine months it s still a target return so to your point we re seeking to grow in the auto line we re executing on marketing distribution and marketplace execution strategies to do that and as i said the production results demonstrate improvements in new business strong retention moderating pricing that i think is all consistent with that view on the home side again most of the deterioration in underlying from the first quarter of last year is explained by the treaty and so that s most of it if you actually remove the treaty impact from the underlying combined ratio and compare that to history it s very consistent with our long run average underlying combined ratio in home that said there s some period to period volatility there there is still some pressure in nonweather water loss activity which we have talked about which is part of why you see rpc rising and why we re focusing on improving rpc as we go forward but again i think we re very pleased with the performance of the property portfolio and the path we re on and then conversely to the auto outlook that i described the property outlook again mostly just because of the quarterization of the outlook is for better results on an underlying basis in property for the balance of the year sort of going the other away from auto and when you put those two together you get a better combined ratio outlook year on year mike zaremski credit suisse analyst got it it s helpful i did see the improved commentary in the outlook one follow up on commercial pricing thanks for the insights on commercial auto and property driving the pricing increases but i was wondering on workers comp pricing is that getting quarter over quarter more or less negative greg toczydlowski executive vice president and president of business insurance mike this is greg yes we really aren t going to share workers comp on an individual line in the price and just because it is such a sensitive dynamic of how we compete in the marketplace we have in the past i ve shared and it s pretty evident that there s been very good loss results in workers comp and there has been reductions in the market so if you look at our rpc at 6 clearly ex workers comp we d be higher than that and we really aren t going to disclose the individual product lines going forward mike zaremski credit suisse analyst thank you operator your next question comes from larry greenberg with janney montgomery your line is open larry greenberg janney montgomery analyst good morning and thank you for michael again on auto and if you answered it i apologize but is written auto pricing keeping up with loss trend michael klein executive vice president and president of personal insurance i don t know if i spoke specifically to written keeping up with loss trend but certainly on an earned basis we continue to expand margins and on a written basis at five points of rpc i would say we re continuing to expand margins on both basis i didn t speak specifically to that but we feel good about the margin expansion and again the outlook is for auto to produce target returns larry greenberg janney montgomery analyst great and then in bond and specialty i know the pyd jumps around quite a bit there but it was modest this quarter is there anything changing on that front tom kunkel executive vice president and president of bond and special insurance this is tom larry so the nature of the pyd in bond and specialty is it that it can be a little lumpy if you look at our surety business over the years you can see we ve had some really good returns and as our losses were continuing to come down we of course tried to accurately account for that in our initial year loss piks so that the majority of the results would hopefully be shown in that first calendar year so i think what you ve seen over time is an improved initial loss year pik and maybe less headroom in some of those areas for that stuff to move up all that said in our management liability businesses there s been a little bit of that too as we look to recognize things in that initial year as best we can so i think other than that no other great underlying dynamics that would explain that larry greenberg janney montgomery analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from meyer shields with kbw your line is open meyer shields kbw analyst thanks going back to the pricing dynamics within business insurance is there a difference between what you re seeing in what we call standard lines versus specialty alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer yes we re sort of looking at it greg you want to take that greg toczydlowski executive vice president and president of business insurance yes meyer are you referencing specialties like e and s meyer shields kbw analyst yes greg toczydlowski executive vice president and president of business insurance yes i mean that depends so much on your product mix i mean we re predominantly in the e and s business much more from a property perspective so the answer would be yes for us given some of the catastrophic pressures we ve seen on property over the last two years meyer shields kbw analyst ok and then more broadly i think this is mostly a question for greg we ve seen at least the u s treasury the pretty significant decline in interest rates from mid november how long does it take before that is reflected in pricing dan frey chief financial officer meyer it s dan so we ll consider that in pricing as we do a number of factors it s one of the hundred things that go into the process of determining what s the right price we ve seen the 10 year treasury move up and down but it s been sort of plus or minus 0 3 not more than 0 2 or 0 3 per quarter over the last four or five quarters so not a dramatic impact it does eventually get baked into what we think we need for price to generate the returns that we re trying to generate because clearly that s a component of return but it hasn t had a dramatic impact at this point alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer yes also i d add that we bifurcated a little bit we think about the return on the float and that we adjust periodically to reflect market rates and then separately we think about the capital on the balance sheet that supports the risk and that that really reflects the overall portfolio return meyer shields kbw analyst ok understood thanks so much operator your next question comes from josh shanker with deutsche bank your line is open josh shanker deutsche bank analyst yes good morning thank you for taking my question i was reading outlook as everyone else was and i think it s not too different from what it said before despite the improvement you re getting on rates it s really the cessation of large losses in non cat weather that will drive margin improvement for the remainder of the year am i reading that correctly alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer if you re looking at business insurance yes that s right it s large losses returning to a more normal level josh shanker deutsche bank analyst and so can we say with the close approximation that pricing and loss cost trend are in harmony right now i guess is your view alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer i would say that s about right on an earned basis on a written basis we re probably doing little bit better than that josh shanker deutsche bank analyst ok and just the same sort of reflections on the homeowner s business as well michael klein executive vice president and president of personal insurance yes josh this is michael i would say on the homeowner s business we re working to move rpc north so we re not quite there on a written basis yet but we re close josh shanker deutsche bank analyst ok thank you very much operator your next question comes from amit kumar with buckingham research your line is open amit kumar buckingham research analyst i guess two quick follow up questions the first question goes back to the discussion on expense ratio in your 10 k letter you talked about 40 of the business flowing through these business centers and bi and i was curious if maybe you can talk about where does that sort of net out to is that an eventual improvement in expense ratio or do the savings get reallocated somewhere else alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer amit thanks for that question productivity and efficiency is a strategic priority across the entire place in each of the businesses in the claim organization and virtually everything we do and so some of what greg s achieving through the business centers contributes to that it also contributes to other strategic objectives specifically making sure that we re providing great experiences for the brokers that we re doing business with and the customers that we re serving so it all goes to that point the savings whatever productivity and efficiency we generate there and frankly anywhere else really for us is we look at operating leverage or enhanced operating leverage as an opportunity and as we said before we ll take those dollars and we ll reallocate them over time as we see fit we can let it fall to the bottom line and you ll see it in the expense ratio we can reinvest it in strategic initiatives that we think are going to drive shareholder value or if we want to or need to we can decide that we want to put into pricing without compromising our return objectives so i know you ve heard us say that a lot but what s important to us about enhanced operating leverage is having that flexibility amit kumar buckingham research analyst now that you answered that question the only other question i had is maybe for michael switching gears to personal auto i know you answered several questions on what we saw on the loss cost trend but can you sort of opine where do you see the trajectory from here on frequency and severity michael klein executive vice president and president of personal insurance sure amit it is michael the short answer is when we look at our sort of long term trend pik it remains relatively consistent and i would say talking about frequency and severity a little bit separately generally what we see on the severity side is quarter to quarter fluctuations that sort of bounce around our long term expectation so again we see the severity pressure that you see in industry statistics around parts and liability cost and those things but feel like our long term assessment on severity reflects those on the frequency side again we talked about the first quarter underlying being driven by pricing earning in excess of trend inclusive of both sort of our assumption and a better than expected result in the quarter and we do see for a number of quarters in a row now frequency coming in better than i think we or the industry had expected it and it s something we re keeping an eye on and thinking about how to factor in amit kumar buckingham research analyst and is that with the frequency at a historical low does that trend line continue or do you get a sense that probably this is as good as it gets michael klein executive vice president and president of personal insurance i think it s a great question i think if you take a longer term look at frequency in auto you see a bit of a secular decline and that s the piece that we re trying to figure out as are we returning to sort of that long term downward trend in frequency or not there s been a lot of commentary and discussion around in the marketplace and in other places about what could be driving it and one of the things people point to is safety features on vehicles i think it is important to point out that a number of the features that folks like the insurance institute for highway safety point to as the ones that could have the most impact still have relatively low penetration in the fleet right things like automatic emergency braking less than 5 of the cars on the road have it so again i think the jury is still out on whether there is a shift in long term frequency trend but those are some of the things we re watching in addition to miles driven employment and the other factors that we ve talked about amit kumar buckingham research analyst got it thanks for the answers and good luck on that operator your next question comes from yaron kinar with goldman sachs your line is open yaron kinar goldman sachs analyst good morning everybody my first question i think elyse took a stab at it is in business insurance can you talk about the impact from the nonweather large losses this quarter how it compared to the prior year alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer beyond the international is that what you re referring to yaron yaron kinar goldman sachs analyst well i think last year you just talked about large losses nonweather losses not necessarily referring to international alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer yes the large loss activity in domestic bi has been relatively flat i would say greg toczydlowski executive vice president and president of business insurance i gave you in my comments here the non cat weather was a little more than half a point the good guy relative to the first quarter of 2018 yaron kinar goldman sachs analyst right right i mean i think in 2018 you talk about roughly 60 basis points of non cat weather and another 60 basis points or so of other large so it sounds like it couldn t really alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer yes we re also slicing the bone probably a little bit we re heading toward slicing the bone probably a little bit thinner than we d like too and i think most of the impact you re talking about was quarters two through four and so my answer relatively flat was q1 to q1 but if you go back and look at your commentary from last quarter i think you ll hear us say that the improvement was primarily going to be in quarters two through four yaron kinar goldman sachs analyst ok that s helpful and then greg i think you d said that in addition to pricing and also taking some terms and conditions actions in large property can you give maybe a few examples of where the terms and conditions are improving or how they re improving greg toczydlowski executive vice president and president of business insurance sure yes coming off those two catastrophic years there s obviously been some dislocation in the marketplace in just an opportunity for more risk sharing and that typically comes with terms and conditions so you can think about sublimits on flood and earthquake deductible shifting from a fixed component to more of the percentage certainly in the geographic exposed areas but that s something we re constantly looking at with all that said we look at our national property business on account by account basis so that s a generalization and we are again looking at each account and looking at the risk reward of those accounts and if there s an opportune time to have some risk sharing like there is in the property segment right now then we go about and achieve that yaron kinar goldman sachs analyst got it thank you very much operator your next question comes from jeff schmitt with william blair your line is open jeff schmitt william blair analyst hi good morning everyone question about your umbrella book heard in the market that there s an uptick in large losses there mainly due to the litigation environment higher jury awards higher settlement amounts is that something you re seeing at all alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer let s stay away from umbrella let me just respond to social inflation more broadly so this is probably an oversimplification but i think about social inflation broadly in three buckets i think about legal decisions i think about plaintiff activity and i think about jury awards from a legal decision s perspective certainly at the federal level over the last couple of years i d say that s probably been on balance an improvement if you look at jury awards i would say a little bit more volatile a little bit more unpredictable and broadly speaking when it comes to plaintiff activity the plaintiff s bar i would say we have seen a more aggressive plaintiff activity now that was certainly a big driver of the commercial auto charge that we took last quarter for example we think about the liability side of c and p for example but when you get into the larger end when you get into umbrella when you think about the large end of gl when you think about management liability those are broadly speaking coverages where there s already a lot of litigation generally everybody is represented in those cases and so those have always been reasonably active in terms of litigation it s really at least so far on the smaller end where we ve seen more activity jeff schmitt william blair analyst yes and i guess i was curious i mean it s been more acute obviously in commercial auto than other lines hearing they re starting to tick up in umbrella i guess is that spreading or i mean it sounds like you re saying it s a little bit more broad based already alan schnitzer chairman and chief executive officer no i mean we re certainly seeing it the phenomenon you re identifying could vary from company to company based on mix of business too right the net lines you put out the types of risk i mean you got to remember we re a middle market main street business for the most part i mean obviously we do have a national accounts business a national property business and we do write public company liability on management liability side but by and large when you think about travelers it s a main street middle market business so it could be a mix difference for us relative to others jeff schmitt william blair analyst and just one quick one on the homeowner s book looking at the underlying loss ratio up hundred basis points half of that looks to be about related to the new cat treaty but this remainder of a hundred basis points after being up a lot last year is that pretty much all nonweather water losses that you re seeing can you speak to that more is that state specific is this older homes i mean why is this popping up now for the industry michael klein executive vice president and president of personal insurance sure jeff just starting with the premise of the question i would say the treaty impacts a little more than you re estimating there and therefore the other impacts are a little bit less in the underlying but then underneath that we again as i mentioned we do continue to see some nonweather water loss pressure and i would stay consistent with what we ve talked about in the past we ve sort of sliced and diced that by geography by type of home by age of home we ve looked at we ve seen commentary around the first floor second floor so we ve looked at it by type of construction and what we tend to see is these nonweather water losses are up sort of consistently across most of those dimensions so there s not a thing we point to which is why our strategy to address it has been to seek to increase price so that be our view on the trend but the underlying in the quarter does reflect some continued pressure there again we expected some continued pressure there and have built a pricing strategy to address it so that s our take on it jeff schmitt william blair analyst ok thank you operator there are no

or 1 49 per share a year ago net operating income for the quarter was 185 million or 1 64 per share a per share increase of 12 from a year ago on a gaap reported basis return on equity as of march 31st was 12 9 and book value per share was 54 13 excluding unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities return on equity was 14 7 and book value per share grew 11 to 45 45 in our life insurance operations premium revenue increased 4 to 624 million and life underwriting margin was 170 million up 10 from a year ago growth in underwriting margin exceeded premium growth due to higher margins in all distribution channels for the year we expect life underwriting income to grow around 4 to 6 on the health side premium revenue increased 6 to 267 million and health underwriting margin also grew 6 to 62 million for the year we expect health underwriting income to grow around 3 to 5 administrative expenses were 59 million for the quarter up 7 from a year ago and in line with our expectations as a percentage of premium administrative expenses were 6 6 compared to 6 5 a year ago for the year we expect administrative expenses to grow approximately 5 to 6 and be around 6 6 of premium i ll now turn the call over to larry for his comments on the marketing operations larry m hutchison co chairman and chief executive officer thank you gary at american income life premiums were up 7 to 282 million and life underwriting margin was up 10 to 93 million net life sales were 58 million up 4 the average producing agent count for the first quarter was 6 865 up 1 from the year ago quarter but down 1 from the fourth quarter however the producing agent count at the end of the first quarter was 7 233 at liberty national life premiums were up 2 to 71 million while life underwriting margin was up 10 to 18 million net life sales increased 8 to 12 million and net health sales were 6 million up 12 from the year ago quarter the sales growth was driven by increases in both agent count and productivity the average producing agent count for the first quarter was 2 179 up 4 from the year ago quarter but approximately the same as the fourth quarter the producing agent count at liberty national ended the quarter at 2 297 at our direct response operation at globe life life premiums were up 3 to 218 million and life underwriting margin increased 11 to 37 million net life sales were 32 million up 1 from the year ago quarter in recent years we have focused primarily on maximizing profit dollars while adjusting our marketing efforts to stabilize margins as we go forward we expect to grow both sales and profits at family heritage health premiums increased 8 to 71 million and health underwriting margin increased 14 to 18 million net health sales were down 3 to 13 million the average producing agent count for the first quarter was 1 002 up 1 from the year ago quarter but down 11 from the fourth quarter the producing agent count at the end of the quarter was 1 020 at united american general agency health premiums increased 9 to 103 million net health sales were 15 million up 5 compared to the year ago quarter to complete my discussion on marketing operations i will now provide some projections approximate net life sales for the full year 2019 are expected to be as follows american income 5 to 9 growth liberty national 7 to 11 growth direct response flat to 2 growth approximate net health sales for the full year 2019 are expected to be as follows liberty national 6 to 10 growth family heritage 2 to 6 growth united american individual medicare supplement 4 to 8 growth i will now turn the call back to gary gary l coleman co chairman and chief executive officer i want to spend a few minutes discussing our investment operations first excess investment income excess investment income which we define as net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities and debt was 66 million a 6 increase over the year ago quarter on a per share basis reflecting the impact of our share repurchase program excess investment income increased 9 for the full year we expect excess investment income to grow by about 5 which would result in a per share increase of around 9 regarding the investment portfolio invested assets were 16 9 billion including 16 billion of fixed maturities at amortized cost of the fixed maturities 15 3 billion are investment grade with an average rating of a minus and below investment grade bonds were 671 million compared to 688 million a year ago the percentage of below investment grade bonds at fixed maturities is 4 2 compared to 4 5 a year ago overall the total portfolio is rated bbb plus same as a year ago bonds rated bbb are 57 of the fixed maturity portfolio which is higher relative to our peers however we have no exposure to higher risk assets such as derivatives or equities and little exposure to commercial mortgages and asset backed securities finally we have net unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of 1 2 billion 691 million higher than the previous quarter due primarily to changes in market interest rates as to investment yield in the first quarter we invested 451 million in investment grade fixed maturities primarily in municipal and financial sectors we invested at an average yield of 4 88 an average rating of a plus and an average life of 28 years for the entire portfolio the first quarter yield was 5 53 down 5 basis points from the 5 58 yield in the first quarter of 2018 as of march 31 the portfolio yield was approximately 5 51 for 2019 the average new money yield assumed at the midpoint of our guidance is 4 90 for the full year while we would like to see higher interest rates going forward torchmark is driving a lower for longer interest rate environment a continued low interest rate environment will impact our income statement but not the gaap or statutory balance sheets since we primarily sell non interest sensitive protection products accounted for under fas 60 while we would benefit from higher interest rates torchmark will continue to earn substantial excess investment income in an extended low interest rate environment now i ll turn the call over to frank frank m svoboda executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks gary first i want to spend a few minutes discussing our share repurchases and capital position the parent ended the year with liquid assets of 41 million in addition to these liquid assets the parent will generate excess cash flow in 2019 the parent company s excess cash flow as we define it results primarily from the dividends received by the parent from its subsidiaries less the interest paid on debt and the dividends paid to torchmark shareholders we anticipate our excess cash flow in 2019 will be in the range of 365 million to 375 million thus including the assets on hand at the beginning of the year we currently expect to have around 405 million to 415 million available to the parent during the year as discussed on the prior call we accelerated 25 million of 2019 repurchases of torchmark stock into december 2018 with commercial paper and parent cash we plan to utilize 50 million of the 2019 excess cash flow to reduce the commercial paper for those repurchases as such we expect to have approximately 390 million to 400 million to be available to the parent for other uses including the 50 million of liquid assets we normally retain at the parent in the first quarter we spent 89 million to buy 1 1 million torchmark shares at an average price of 81 32 so far in april we have spent 11 million to purchase 131 000 shares at an average price of 84 61 thus for the full year through today we have spent 100 million of parent company cash to acquire more than 1 million shares at an average price of 81 68 excluding the 100 million spent on repurchases so far this year and the 50 million we plan on retaining at the parent we will have approximately 240 million to 250 million of excess cash flow available to the parent for the remainder of the year as noted on previous calls we will use our cash as efficiently as possible if market conditions are favorable and absent alternatives with higher value to our shareholders we expect that share repurchases will continue to be a primary use of those funds now regarding capital levels at our insurance subsidiaries our goal is to maintain capital at levels necessary to support our current ratings as discussed on our previous call torchmark intends to target a consolidated company action level rbc ratio in the range of 300 to 320 at december 31 2018 our consolidated rbc ratio was 326 slightly greater than the high point of our range the increased rbc ratio was primarily attributable to slightly lower required capital and higher statutory earnings than anticipated at this rbc ratio we have approximately 129 million of capital at the insurance subsidiary over the amount required at the low end of our consolidated rbc target of 300 this excess capital along with the 50 million of assets held at the parent provide approximately 179 million that are available to fund possible needs in the insurance companies should they arise in addition due to the fact that deferred tax assets were replaced in 2018 with marketable securities purchased with capital contributions the quality of our capital has substantially improved finally with respect to our earnings guidance for 2019 we are projecting that our operating income per share will be in the range of 6 61 to 6 75 for the year ended december 31 2019 the 6 68 midpoint of this guidance reflects an 0 08 increase over the prior quarter midpoint of 6 60 primarily attributable to an improved outlook on our underwriting results due to lower policy obligations than anticipated in the first quarter largely attributable to our life insurance operations those are my comments i will now turn the call back to larry larry m hutchison co chairman and chief executive officer thank you frank those are our comments we will now open the call up for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from jimmy bhullar with jp morgan jimmy bhullar jp morgan analyst hi good morning so i had a few questions first on your eps guidance the midpoint going up by 0 08 how much of that is just the fact that you had good results in 1q versus maybe a more optimistic view of the rest of the year as well frank m svoboda executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah jimmy i think most of the increase is due to the better than expected first quarter if you look at the second quarters through fourth quarters i think what we anticipate is largely going to be in line with what we ve seen there last year so i think there may be some a little slight improvement in a couple of those lines but i think the vast majority of it is really the lower claim to the better expected results we had in the first quarter jimmy bhullar jp morgan analyst okay and then in direct response you ve had two quarters now their sales have been positive pretty modest but positive and i think you re expecting a flat to 2 increase i would have thought that with the expected increases in circulation volumes you d actually see a little bit of more of a pickup but maybe you could just give some color on why you re expecting some such a modest increase or are you being conservative in your outlook larry m hutchison co chairman and chief executive officer well i don t think we re being conservative in our outlook when we look at our inquiries for 2019 we think insert media inquiries will be down about 2 to 3 our electronic inquiries will be up about 5 circulation itself will be up about 2 and mail volumes will be down about 5 given constant response rates i think the flat to 2 increase is a good prediction for what we think sales will be for the full year 2019 jimmy bhullar jp morgan analyst and then just lastly have you seen any impact on your business from either the supreme court ruling on unions and its effect on american income or just the strong labor market affecting your ability to recruit or retain agents larry m hutchison co chairman and chief executive officer we have not seen an impact to american income be it production recruiting or sales as a result of the supreme court decision jimmy bhullar jp morgan analyst okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from erik bass with autonomous research erik bass autonomous research analyst hi thank you first to follow up on the agent side can you talk about any changes in agent retention rates at american income following the recent changes you made to compensation larry m hutchison co chairman and chief executive officer the first quarter agent retention has stayed relatively unchanged we have measured third month sixth month and 13th month retention however that retention is historical if you look at the first quarter we just see a decrease in terminations particularly in the second half of the quarter and so we will have retention particularly for three month retention at the time of our earnings call the reduction in terminations is a good indicator that we think our retention will be better as we go through 2019 erik bass autonomous research analyst thank you and then i was hoping maybe switching gears to the investment portfolio that you could provide more details on your bbb exposures and specifically can you talk about how much is rated bbb minus and maybe comment on the sector allocations gary l coleman co chairman and chief executive officer well as far as the sector allocations i think they re pretty well spread among all of the sectors that we have as far as how much is bbb minus out of the total bbbs less than 20 are bbb minus the other 80 something percent is bbb or bbb plus erik bass autonomous research analyst okay thank you and that s of the 20 of the bbbs not of the overall portfolio right gary l coleman co chairman and chief executive officer no not the portfolio 20 of the bbbs erik bass autonomous research analyst got it ok thank you operator thank you our next question comes from john nadel with ubs john nadel ubs analyst hey good morning and congrats on the good quarter i guess two questions from me one is agent count at family heritage last couple of quarters have declined i was just wondering if you could just characterize what s happening there is that more of a culling of low end performers or is that recruiting driven just and what s your outlook there larry m hutchison co chairman and chief executive officer john when we look at family heritage we saw that recruitment activity was particularly slow during the holiday season and the month of january we didn t see recruiting activity really recover at family heritage until early february i think that part of the cause there we were really focused on production in the third and fourth quarter of last year and so we saw the recruiting start to drop off in november we re back to normal recruiting levels now and i think we ll see an increasing agent count in the second quarter of this year john nadel ubs analyst thank you and then the second question this is very hypothetical and i don t know how to think about the probability of some significant change here but clearly there s been an awful lot of political posturing recently as it relates to medicare for all it s had some impact on i think the healthcare providers i m just wondering if you laid out a scenario where a bernie sanders kind of medicare for all were to go through how might it do you expect that to impact medicare supplement business larry m hutchison co chairman and chief executive officer john this is larry i think it s really too early to tell we really have to wait and see how that program will be structured on one hand it could be an opportunity if we have medicare for all and we have a medicare system where co pays and deductibles are covered by a medicare type insurance that could be an opportunity on the other hand if the proposal is they eliminate all private insurance certainly that will have a negative effect we have to remember that medicare is a fairly small part of our operation now it occurs it s a fairly small part of our overall earnings john nadel ubs analyst what proportion of the health segment premiums comes from the medicare supplement business gary l coleman co chairman and chief executive officer john this is gary about 50 of our total health premium is it s 400 million or 500 million john nadel ubs analyst okay that s helpful thank you so much operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from alex scott with goldman sachs alex scott goldman sachs analyst hi good morning just a question on the admin expenses they were a little elevated this quarter it didn t look like you guided to significantly higher growth was there anything that was sort of a one timer in nature there or anything to note on sort of investment in systems accounting that sort of thing gary l coleman co chairman and chief executive officer no there was a one time type item within our employee benefits area that made the expenses a little bit higher this quarter as i mentioned the expenses were up 6 7 and for the year we re expecting that expense will be up 5 to 6 so that was more of an unusual item for the first quarter but it won t carry forward alex scott goldman sachs analyst got it and then just kind of high level could you talk about sort of the comp structure changes you ve made and sort of the impact that you re seeing on recruiting and how much of that is sort of in your go forward guide on sales and sort of the growth in agent counts anything you could provide there would be helpful larry m hutchison co chairman and chief executive officer i ll address that at american income the compensation change we didn t increase the total compensation we restructured the compensation and so that more of the agent commission is toward the front end to encourage new agents to stay in the business the other is bonuses that permit the managers that will increase the retention of new agents with their better they will spend more time in training and trying to retain those agents sort of high level that s the compensation change at family heritage to address the recruiting we also have a new bonus for agents that s based on intermediary recruiting objectives at liberty national the compensation is largely unchanged gary l coleman co chairman and chief executive officer but alex we d see some positive results at american income i think larry mentioned it we ve added new agents our terminations are down it s too early to make a definitive conclusion but the results so far look promising alex scott goldman sachs analyst okay and maybe if i could sneak one last one in just on the favorable mortalities that you experienced during the quarter is there anywhere you saw that more concentrated was it older age policies specifically some of the older blocks or anything else that you ve kind of witnessed as you looked through those results gary l coleman co chairman and chief executive officer no we didn t it was really throughout the blocks and we no we didn t see it was really a bit among ages but also as far as medical reasons and those kinds of things it was just it was really just low across the board for really american income direct response and liberty national alex scott goldman sachs analyst okay thank you operator thank you there are no additional questioners at this time michael c majors executive vice president administration and investor relations all right well thank you for joining us this morning those are our comments and we ll talk to you again next quarter operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today s presentation you may now disconnect duration 27 minutes call participants michael c majors executive vice president administration and investor relations gary l coleman co chairman and chief executive officer larry m hutchison co chairman and chief executive officer frank m svoboda executive vice president and chief financial officer jimmy bhullar jp morgan analyst erik bass autonomous research analyst john nadel ubs analyst alex scott goldman

washington april 19 xinhua the china proposed belt and road initiative bri is a positive program that will contribute significantly to addressing the important issue of the regional infrastructure gap a well known u s expert on china has said in a recent interview with xinhua it s definitely a plus for the recipient countries said stephen roach senior fellow at yale university s jackson institute for global affairs he added that in the long haul the initiative will be a plus for china as well the bri refers to the silk road economic belt and the 21st century maritime silk road china is to host the second belt and road forum for international cooperation in beijing later this month six years after the inception of the initiative and almost two years since the inaugural forum was held in the chinese capital noting that the bri was perceived as a pretty broad and all encompassing pan regional infrastructure program when chinese president xi jinping first announced it in 2013 roach said the initiative now is showing up in countries well outside of the original bri corridor especially including such a key member of the european union as italy a former chief economist at morgan stanley and ex chairman of morgan stanley asia roach is regarded as one of wall street s most influential china watchers despite his 73 years of age he still shuttles between the united states and china on a frequent basis regarding the notion that the bri creates debt traps for some countries roach said he doesn t agree i don t think that s a serious broad risk associated with this particular program the scholar however did caution against potential negative impacts on bri projects caused by political instability and corruption in certain countries along the belt and road routes he said he found it somewhat disconcerting that some of the bri countries at least in my opinion are vulnerable to political and corruption risk adding that it is important for china and other participating countries to be mindful of that according to the latest statistics the total trade volume between china and its bri participating countries was more than 6 trillion u s dollars in the 2013 2018 period during which more than 244 000 jobs were created for the locals china s direct foreign investment in those countries has exceeded 80 billion dollars till now china s import from and export to bri participating countries totalled 300 billion dollars in the first quarter of 2019 up 7 8 percent year on year and occupying 28 6 percent of the country s total foreign trade volume in the period with respect to the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib roach said he expects the bank to forge closer partnerships with key regional and international development institutions such as the asian development bank adb and the world bank in operation since 2016 with an authorized capital of 100 billion dollars the aiib was founded by china to fund infrastructure investment in asia and beyond progress is underway toward materializing what roach has envisaged the adb and the aiib on march 21 signed the cofinancing framework agreement for sovereign operations a document that will guide the overall cofinancing arrangements between the two entities additionally according to world bank president david malpass he and aiib president jin liqun talked about ways that there can be cooperation that achieves very high quality lending programs in very good conversations on the sidelines of this year s world bank international monetary fund spring meetings roach said he is optimistic about the leadership of jin who he said is a friend of his denouncing the criticism that china uses the bri to achieve geopolitical goals roach said addressing the significant and real infrastructure gap is entirely within china s purview it s in china s best interest as the world s largest trading nation to make certain that the infrastructure in the region is up to speed in terms of global standards roach said and china has a lot of expertise and experience in building high quality state of the art infrastructure asked whether it is possible that beijing and washington can cooperate on the bri roach said there s always a possibility citing the example of caterpillar inc the u s construction machinery and equipment company that has already participated in bri projects in 20 countries as of 2018 caterpillar s endorsement of the bri as well as construction related activities by other u s companies under the bri framework will happen on its own due to the natural attraction of construction projects roach said
nurses in new york city are pushing back against hospital systems that put profits over patients and threaten their efforts to strike for safer staffing ratios while nurses are fighting physicians so far have remained on the sidelines of this struggle the u s healthcare system is completely and utterly broken according to the world health organization who the u s system ranks 37th in the world all while spending dramatically more on healthcare than other wealthy countries tens of millions remain without any health insurance coverage for many medical bills can mean economic ruin some surveys show that up to 66 5 of all bankruptcies in the u s are a result of medical expenses on the front lines of this system are nurses and physicians individuals who by and large decided to go into the profession to help patients and communities are becoming more frustrated by their inability to do just that sometimes even causing providers to leave the profession while many inside the u s medical industrial complex have had enough nurses throughout new york city nyc are putting their collective foot down and showing us the way to fight for better outcomes for patients and better working conditions for providers in march members of the new york state nurses association nysna at new york s big four hospitals montefiore mount sinai new york presbyterian columbia and mount sinai west st luke s voted by an overwhelming 97 margin to authorize a strike the nurses fight centers around conditions for patient care including safer staffing ratios inside hospitals so that nurses can adequately care for each patient throughout nyc nurses are forced to work long shifts and are chronically understaffed the nurses who recently threatened to strike recognize that these working conditions are part of hospital executives push to squeeze greater and greater profits out of workers at the expense of patient health and they have had enough new york nurses are fighting just as teachers across the country did earlier this year including the tens of thousands of los angeles teachers who struck last january for better conditions for in schools they are discussing the strike option just as more than 8 000 stop shop workers in new england recently authorized a strike against cuts to healthcare benefits and pensions and the camba legal services workers voted to walk off the job if their demands are not met the nurses are also taking up the example of healthcare workers around the world including the 40 000 irish nurses who recently struck nurses are recognizing they have the power to fight and win better patient care but while nurses across new york are standing up for themselves and their patients a big question remains where are the doctors and why are they not threatening to strike together with nurses why are the physicians on the sidelines physicians see first hand every day how our dysfunctional healthcare system is simply not built to adequately address patient and community health for many doctors these frustrations manifest in burnout and dissatisfaction within a field they once loved today there is an epidemic of burnout among physicians with some studies suggesting burnout affects up to half of all physicians after training for years with the desire to help others doctors come to experience medical system that values profit over all else and rarely gives them the tools to make a difference in the communities where they work this can leave doctors feeling hopeless and combined with other factors can lead to depression or even suicide today physicians are committing suicide at two times the rate of the population as a whole yet even at this moment of frustration and anger they continue to keep their heads down providing validity to this broken system we see nowhere among doctors a resistance like that now being organized by nurses in order to analyze why doctors are not throwing down their stethoscopes and finally saying enough is enough a review of the u s medical education process is in order as longtime public educator john taylor gatto highlights in his book the underground history of american education the education system is built to create tools for industry gatto points out that this system conditions those who pass through it to take direction well and to not question authority at the same time education aim to instill the importance of profit and continually reinforces the legitimacy of the capitalist system health care education is not excluded from this the fact that the medical industrial complex serves suffering human beings gives the system the guise of morally superiority but both patient and community health remains secondary to profit maximization nonetheless psychological conditioning data has shown that physicians typically come from the upper classes in the us it is not hard to see why medical school exams and applications alone can cost thousands of dollars and this doesn t even account for the cost of exam preparation courses or materials overall the admissions system selects for a particular type of upper middle class to bourgeois candidate some reports show the median family income for a matriculating medical student is around 100 000 per year at a time when close to half the american people do not earn enough afford an unexpected 400 expense the cost of becoming a physician is prohibitive for the vast majority students with families that can bear such costs tend to come from environments that have conditioned them from a young age to respect systems of authority and not question their legitimacy after all if the parents have benefited economically from doing so why would their children act any differently this rule is then reinforced throughout the experiences of undergraduate school medical school as i have written about in the past and residency education the young medical student or resident learns that getting close to and appealing to authority figures leads to better outcomes whether that means higher test scores letters of recommendation or better employment opportunities this makes the physician less and less likely to challenge much less disrupt the medical system he will soon be working within within the hospital doctors typically adopt an individualist mentality in which they consider only how they can personally make an impact on their patients health while ignoring the need for systemic change the direct work with individual patients can be personally rewarding but this method of practice does little to impact the larger factors that lead a patient to become sick in the the first place a physician sees a patient in a clinical setting and treats him without ever actually discussing or addressing the social conditions which have caused his illness they then send the patient directly back into the environment that is harming him this method of practice ultimately helps to uphold the exact structures making patients ill but no physician could accept this fact so instead they tell themselves they are doing important work and making a positive impact over time operating within the system of factory line health delivery the norm in the u s teaches the physician that change occurs on an individual basis if a physician ever thinks of organizing collectively to withhold her labor in order to demand better conditions for her patients employers declare that doctors are abandoning those in need of care the hippocratic oath taken by physicians to do no harm is cited this argument obviously disregards the fact that it is the employer and ownership class which is directly harming patients every day in pursuit of profit denying care pushing individuals into bankruptcy pursuing unnecessary treatments neglecting systemic causes of illness etc it also ignores the fact that by continuing to focus the treatment on narrow individualistic explanations for disease and illness the physician helps to redirect the patient s attention away from the larger issues that are truly causing his or her suffering it is clear why few physicians would think about striking after being psychologically conditioned in this way many simply believe the work they are doing is adequate and having a meaningful impact on patient and community health although many may work under a boss doctors also often have more autonomy over their work than those in other professions their distinct petty bourgeois positions which allows them the possibility of being their own employers reinforces their individualist conservative mentality though it is important to note physician control is ever decreasing as healthcare becomes more corporatized the individualist mindset created through medical and residency education is completely antithetical to the consciousness necessary to take action against an employer whether protesting organizing work slow downs or using the most powerful weapon the strike those who organize collectively to strike such as the new york nurses believe that change comes from masses of individuals standing together against the status quo this runs counter to the ideology continually drilled into the physician subtle psychological methods of coercion keep physicians in line and unknowingly supporting their own oppression and the continual harm of their patients this is combined with strong material conditions of coercion which we will discussed in the next section the material conditions of doctors physicians experience the truly sickening state of the u s medical system day after day they see first hand how the profits of health insurance companies hospitals pharmaceutical companies device manufacturers and other health care corporations are placed above patient health for those who truly wish to help the patients they work with this can be extremely frustrating and could even push the physician to want to resist these oppressive systems even after undergoing the multiple levels of psychological conditioning this is where material conditions of the physician comes into play to ensure doctors stay in line in general american physicians are more economically well off than the majority of the population the exorbitantly high pay that physicians find themselves earning after residency serves to support the status quo for the healthcare industry physicians become comfortable with their lifestyle and their positions of power in hospitals they begin to develop a stake in maintaining the system though the physician may see various ways the medical industrial complex damages patients he will be reluctant to put his comfortable position at risk by questioning the current state of affairs it is much easier for a physician to accept the lifestyle this system provides her than to accept she is being used as a cog inside of the medical industrial machine where the health of patients is only a secondary concern even before graduating from residency training the material conditioning of the physician begins becoming a physician is expensive physicians typically undergo a 4 year university education in addition to their four years of medical school this can easily leave a new physician entering residency a 3 to 8 year period of training after medical school with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt this debt which is part of the over 1 5 trillion of overall student loan debt in the us puts the physician in a precarious position in the workplace at the beginning of her career indebtedness makes the resident physician less likely to do anything to jeopardize her standing during residency where she is often used as cheap labor for hospitals and clinics since it could affect job opportunities later in her career the enormous debt facing a resident a term coined from the days when they would literally live or reside in the hospital then forces him to work exorbitant hours for little pay his workweek can extend to upwards of 80 hours when a residents pay is broken down to an hourly wage he often finds himself making just over 10 hour it is now a fad for hospitals to pretend to care about physician wellness one group tasked to structure residency programs the accreditation council for graduate medical education acgme has attempted to improve resident wellness by putting work limits in place for residents these have been set at 80 hours per week averaged over four consecutive weeks meaning that a resident could potentially work as many as 100 hours in a given week in this scenario overwork and exhaustion make physician organizing and resistance even less likely we must organize physicians are key actors in the medical industrial complex today they serve as conduits for profit extraction from sick and injured people until physicians begin to put individual endeavors aside and begin to organize collectively they will continue to see their patients harmed by the healthcare system how can physicians advance their collective organization they can start by pushing for unionization in all healthcare settings even if that means going against anti union contracts that hospitals and clinics often require doctors to sign change in this system will not come from hospital administrations device manufacturers health insurance companies or medical academies like as the american medical association ama all of these groups benefit from the existing system focused on endless profit maximization change will only come through collective action and resistance by healthcare workers physicians around the world have organized and withheld their labor for better conditions around patient care in the past in a system that continues to directly harm patients strikes or various other forms of work stoppages or slowdowns are an ethical imperative whether it is teachers in virginia or nurses in new york withholding one s labor and threatening profit production is by far the greatest tool any worker has against an employer these efforts by teachers have improved educational environments for children in schools in hospitals strikes have the potential to provide better staffing ratios and ultimately better care for patients the nurses who give their time and efforts to organize even while risking their own jobs are showing what it means to truly care for patient and community health physicians have much to learn from the nurses example first published in left voice

khartoum huge crowds joined a sit in protest outside sudan s defense ministry on thursday to demand that the country s transitional military council hand power to civilians hundreds of thousands packed the streets by early evening the largest crowds to gather in the center of the capital since former president omar al bashir was ousted and the military council took over last week protesters chanted freedom and revolution are the choice of the people and civilian rule civilian rule and waved national flags we will remain in the street until power is handed to civilian authority said 24 year old protester samia abdallah we will bring down military rule the council has said it is ready to meet some of the protesters demands including fighting corruption but has indicated that it would not hand over power to them it has said that a transitional period of up to two years will be followed by elections and that it is ready to work with opposition groups to form a civilian government we are completely committed to handing over power within a maximum two years one of the members of the council lieutenant general salah abdelhalek told state tv on thursday perhaps the most difficult issue facing the military council now through its political committee is getting agreement from the political spectrum and the community forces on the naming of a prime minister abdelhak said the ball is in their court economic crisis the khartoum sit in was the culmination of 16 weeks of protests triggered by a worsening economic crisis in sudan leading to the ouster and arrest of bashir after three decades in power sudanese have been struggling with sharp price rises and shortages of cash and basic products the central bank has repeatedly devalued the currency since the start of last year though the pound strengthened against the dollar on the black market thursday a change attributed to a lull in import orders amid political uncertainty and expectations of economic aid from the gulf many analysts blame the country s economic troubles on economic mismanagement corruption and the impact of u s sanctions as well as a loss of oil revenue when south sudan seceded in 2011 in 2017 the u s lifted trade sanctions but kept sudan on its state sponsors of terrorism list depriving it of debt relief from international lenders on thursday the united states expressed its support for a democratic transition in sudan saying it was encouraged by the release of political prisoners and the cancellation of a curfew it said washington s policies toward sudan would be based on our assessment of events on the ground and the actions of transitional authorities
the only thing more worrying than the federal government s recent announcement that the debt had reached 22 trillion or 104 percent of gdp was that it generated such little attention in the 1980s and 1990s by contrast the issue was a central feature of the national conversation congressional leaders from both parties crafted a series of procedural innovations designed to keep the debt in check these included the 1985 gramm rudman hollings plan that triggered automatic cuts and the george h w bush budget famous for his no new taxes line that increased revenue and established a pay as you go requirement to any proposed new spending ross perot thrust the topic to the center of the 1992 presidential campaign the debt was then around 4 trillion but perot despite finishing third received 19 percent of the popular vote and forced the next president s hand on fiscal issues president clinton pursued cuts in defense and domestic spending and increased taxes on high earners corporations fuel and social security in concert with his sworn enemy republican house speaker newt gingrich the president pushed through congress a budget that enjoyed a surplus between 1997 and 2001 presidents george w bush and obama were interested in other matters prosecuting the war on terror and health care reform among them but at least they periodically discussed deficits and the debt bush reduced the deficit to just 161 billion in 2007 less than what it had been in 1983 despite iraq and afghanistan then the financial crisis hit still by the time he left office obama had reduced the deficit by two thirds from the huge 1 4 trillion level it attained in 2009 now we have given up democrats are uninterested in the fiscal policy of the clinton years the committee for a responsible budget estimates medicare for all a policy wildly popular among the party s 2020 presidential candidates will cost around 3 trillion annually that is roughly 75 percent of the current budget the estimated price tag of the green new deal a grab bag of quasi socialist policies loosely related to environmental concerns and sponsored by sen edward markey of massachusetts and rep alexandria ocasio cortez of new york is astronomical american action forum calculates it will blow a 50 trillion to 90 trillion dollar hole in the federal budget over 10 years and that excludes the plan s pernicious effects on the broader economy worse the democrats seem to have come up with an economic model to justify their ambitions modern monetary theory asserts the magnitude of debt doesn t matter because countries print money and can therefore always pay creditors policy makers just need to be cognizant of inflation to prevent overheating they can tax and issue bonds the republicans used to check democratic profligacy president eisenhower helped produce two years of surpluses during his presidency known traditionally as fiscal conservatives republicans became less concerned with debts and deficits during the 1980s even president reagan however despite his commitment to winning the cold war and embrace of supply side tax cuts periodically touched the brakes on the deficit he signed strategic tax increases into law in 1982 1984 and 1987 president trump has absolutely no inclination to worry about debt and deficits the 2017 tax bill has assisted economic growth a little but in the short term at least has reduced revenue he also lacks discipline on the spending side in a purely symbolic gesture the president has asked his cabinet secretaries to reduce their departments expenditures the large cuts he has proposed to agencies like the epa and state department in his 2020 budget are unrealistic trump has increased military outlays significantly he wants a border wall with mexico that will cost about 60 billion in the meantime he will not even contemplate desperately needed reform to medicare and social security left untouched the big entitlement programs will cripple the budget over the next several decades trump is running the country as he ran his original business real estate relies on debt not equity borrowing permitted the president to accumulate properties in the expensive and generally healthy new york city market so long as their paper value continued to grow all was good unfortunately the american economy doesn t work that way at least it has not for the past decade we are in a prolonged period of slow growth and meager increases in productivity as the size of our obligations to creditors grows so our ability to pay them cheaply and with promises of future benefits diminishes debt service costs are currently 10 percent of expenditures and in 2023 they will be larger than the defense budget every one percentage point loss in gdp growth costs the government about 10 billion as u s interest rates decline foreign investors look elsewhere for returns we are slowly falling into a fiscal death spiral andy taylor is a professor of political science at the school of

community it was built on people working together our school was the only school in northern saskatchewan that was not run by the church it was built by local people working together with the government to get our school built and educate our kids when it comes to northern communities in saskatchewan they don t come much more isolated than stony rapids and fond du lac situated on the north shore of the fond du lac river near the border with the northwest territories the communities are plagued by many of the same problems lack of all access by road high cost of living lack of employment

and lacks a permanent connection to southern saskatchewan the long standing hope and dream of the fond du lac denesuline first nation is an all weather road highway 905 running from stony rapids in the east 90 km to the south shore of lake athabasca across from fond du lac the cost about 80 million in 2010 dollars but adam who got to grade 3 in 1970 before he was sent out to work in the bush and

megawatt hydroelectric project at grease rapids just east of fond du lac in partnership with algonquin power the estimated cost in 2015 was about 169 million we re interested in getting involved in that project deranger told the task force we re trying to negotiate a power purchase agreement with saskpower there s a lot of work that needs to be done it will take about 10 years before it can attached to the grid another venture the fond du lac band is looking at is a fish processing plant in partnership with another first nation the last time there was commercial fishing on lake athabasca was 1981 there hasn t been any commercial fishing on the lake since the lake is overpopulated with lake trout and other species so we need to do something to lower the population deranger said adding the lake has an annual commercial fishing quota of 626 000 kilograms of fish based on the quota for walleye alone 68 000 kg the annual revenue for the commercial fishery would be 300 000 advertisement

to buy the fish in order for us to move forward we need a global market deranger said in order to get started it s going to take about three years we need to build a facility a processing plant to package it the way they want we ve got to do some training there hasn t been any commercial fishing since 1981 so people will need to equip themselves that s going to take about 3 5 million to 4 million before you can even get started so if we have a contract in place and we know much that is and how long the contract is then that will give us the opportunity to go ahead and build the plant deranger said the first nation also owns half of the athabasca camps fishing lodge alongside an american buyer deranger said the lodge would provide economic opportunities for band members amounting to 300 000 to 400 000 a year ecotourism in the athabasca sand dunes is another potential employment opportunity for the fond du lac band the dunes which stretch about 100 km along the south shore of

region it s our traditional territory it s a sacred area deranger said adding that 30 or 40 plants unique to the area are used in indigenous medicine we need to control the visitation of that area deranger said the potential investment by fond du lac band in the athabasca area could be upwards of 1 billion over the next 10 and 15 years or so the hydro plant would be 200 million in 10 years that 200 million will double to 400 million the fish plant might be about 2 2 million to build but you have to add another 1 million for training that s going to create 60 jobs in the community the lodge is about 1 million the all weather road is close to 100 million so you re probably looking at close to a 1 billion deranger said i ve been involved in economic development in the athabasca region for

people during the three year construction phase and up to eight permanent jobs after completion and being a run of the river project tazi twe will not require the impounding of water by a dam but diverting water through an underground tunnel and two 25 megawatt turbines making it less environmentally disruptive than conventional hydro projects but the project which was supposed to begin in the second half of 2014 then late 2016 or early 2017 seems to be a long way down the road in fact the project itself has been around for about 20 years although saskpower really got serious about the

cap on the amount of money that families in the united states can send their relatives on the island and new restrictions on travel to cuba the troika of tyranny cuba venezuela and nicaragua is beginning to crumble he said advertisement the move followed the announcement a day earlier that lawsuits would now be permitted against foreign companies doing business in properties seized from americans after the island s 1959 revolution the policy could deal a severe blow to cuba s efforts to draw foreign investment a senior trump administration official said the economic pressure on cuba was aimed at forcing the socialist government to stop helping its allies in venezuela and nicaragua the u s has accused cuba of sending soldiers and spies to both countries to strengthen their leaders against protests and potential defection cuba denies that we re going to make sure they cannot afford subsidized adventurism subsidized subversion of democracy outside of their borders said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about u s policy toward cuba at an extraordinarily vulnerable time in their history they re going to have to refocus on the domestic needs their domestic pressures despite some market oriented reforms over the last decade cuba is one of the last countries on earth to maintain a soviet style economy with most business run by the state that economy is afflicted by deep inefficiency and corruption many state employees demand bribes to provide services to the public others spend only a few hours a day at their jobs spending the rest of their time doing informal private work or selling supplies stolen from their office warehouse or factory despite a highly educated and generally well qualified workforce cuba s industrial sector is dilapidated after decades of underinvestment the country produces little of value on the global market besides rum tobacco and the professionals who earn billions for the government working as doctors teachers or engineers in friendly third countries the agricultural sector is in shambles requiring the country to import most of its food economy minister alejandro gil said saturday that cuba would spend 5 billion on food and petroleum products this year advertisement over the last 20 years many of those billions came from venezuela s socialist government which has deep ties to cuba s and sent nearly 100 000 barrels of oil daily for years with venezuela s economic collapse that has roughly halved along with deep cutbacks in the economic relationship across the board and the news has been bad in virtually every other sector of the cuban economy nickel production has dropped from 72 530 metric tons in 2011 to 50 000 last year according to rodríguez the former economics minister the sugar harvest dropped nearly 44 percent to a million tons the number of tourists grew only 1 percent with many coming on cruise ships a relatively unprofitable type of visitor overall gdp growth has been stuck at 1 percent for the last three years meanwhile under agreements castro struck to rehabilitate cuba s creditworthiness the country is paying 2 billion in debt service to creditors such as russia japan and the paris club state run stores that sell low quality chinese household goods at double or triple their price outside the country are facing competition from vendors in panama guyana mexico haiti and even russia where cubans fly in fill suitcases with goods and return to sell them at a profit that overseas shopping has become a vacuum sucking precious hard currency out of cuba economist omar everleny pérez said he estimated that cubans spent more than 2 billion a year buying products overseas with less cash on hand there s been even less in the state run stores and ordinary cubans are feeling the pinch pura castell for example got in line behind about 100 other people waiting for a chance to buy frozen chicken legs for two hours she leaned on her cane watching people leave the state run market with their 5 pound limit advertisement the chicken ran out at 10 a m while the 80 year old castell still had 20 people in front of her she returned the next morning but no chicken then relief a neighbor told her that chicken had arrived at the government store that distributes heavily subsidized monthly food rations her household of three was due three pieces either thighs or drumsticks i ve taken care of myself my whole life said castell a retired janitor i don t just sit on my hands i m worn out but i walk all over town the manager of the butcher shop where castell waited for chicken last week said she needed 80 boxes of chicken to fill that day s demand and only 40 arrived fears of a return to darker times are growing during the special period we had it bad like everyone even when we had money we couldn t buy anything said castell a mother of six it was really rough blackouts no food at all i don t want to go back to that said ariadne medina a 47 year old worker in a private restaurant who was waiting to buy chicken behind castell independent experts say a return to the depths of the special period is unlikely cuba does business with dozens of nations hosts nearly 5 million tourists a year and cubans can travel freely to dozens of countries on direct flights to the u s europe and latin america expatriates send billions home in annual remittances the new government is trying to halt the deterioration but it s a tough assignment pérez said it s going to take resources and time send questions

tickers emx source maurice jackson for streetwise reports 4 19 19 david cole ceo of emx royalty speaks with maurice jackson of proven and probable about his company s three pronged business model and projects that span the globe maurice jackson welcome to proven and probable joining me today is the president and ceo of emx royalty corp emx tsx v emx nyse american david cole we re at the oxford club investment u conference 2019 in saint petersburg florida mr cole welcome david cole thank you maurice always a pleasure to be here and also a pleasure to be back at the oxford club in florida maurice jackson full disclosure we are proud shareholders and emx royalty is a sponsor of proven and probable in regards to being a shareholder we just purchased shares today at 1 15 and also my sons brayden and bryce twins when they were 6 and my son carson at the age of 8 have been shareholders of emx royalty when the company was known as eurasian minerals mr cole you just conducted a presentation sharing the value proposition regarding emx royalty talk to us about the three prong approach because a lot of investors overlook the value proposition and it really begins with the three prong approach david cole our business model consists of a time tested process using a three prong approach consisting of royalty generation royalty acquisition and strategic investments as the basis for value creation for our shareholders emx royalty developed and fine tuned our business model over the course of the 16 years that we ve been a public company i left newmont mining corporation to found eurasian minerals which evolved into emx royalty corporation a key aspect of emx royalty is our business model and specifically we re prospect generators so the first prong of our business approach is the prospect generation business model which is the acquisition of prospective mineral rights around the world utilizing our geological expertise to guide us in that process and then adding value to those mineral rights that we ve acquired by building economic geologic models and then seeking to sell those off to majors as well as well funded junior companies where they advance them forward emx royalty gets paid in a variety of ways one would be work that goes into the ground another would be cash and another would be shares in companies and always a production royalty at the end of the day so we re organically building a royalty portfolio through the execution of the prospect generation business model focused on that royalty component and that s the first and most important prong of our three pronged approach that s our bread and butter in addition the same economic geologists that we have around the world doing the prospect generation also occasionally come across a royalty to purchase so it s the augmentation of growing royalties organically through the prospect generation process in addition to buying royalties that really gives us leverage at developing a portfolio of royalties around the world finally the third prong is strategic investing and we have a very very high filter very tough filter before we ll deploy our shareholders funds into the stock of another company but in the process of working around the world in the trenches of this business occasionally we come across the situation where you cannot buy the stock and so within our 16 year history we ve made 12 strategic investments and if we look at the performance of those 12 strategic investments throughout that history it has an astonishing rate of return and that is 40 compounded annually after tax which is absolutely amazing the most recent big win that drives that strong performance is the investment that we made in a company called intergeo copper which was advancing a significant copper and gold discovery in far southeastern russia and we got into that company quite early it was very difficult for it to raise capital because it was in russia it wasn t the world s favorite venue for funding exploration activities but we felt that the situation was right in 2011 we deployed a total of 13 million incrementally for a seven year period and that resulted in cash back out to us of roughly us 69 million emx royalty turned 13 million into 69 million over a seven year period and that s a nice rate of return that dominates our strategic investment performance we ve had a couple of other good performers within that portfolio over the years there are substantial synergies between the strategic investing the royalty purchasing and the bread and butter business of prospect generation it s the same people who are doing these so there are no additional folks that have to be added on to be able to accomplish these various three things and that way we re able to leverage that expertise that s around the world executing maurice jackson the business acumen that the company s deployed and successfully deployed i should say over the years we ll look at the malmyzh now let s take a look at what it s done to the treasury and what do you plan to do with that capital in the treasury and what has it done to the enterprise value as well david cole well these are great questions so first of all what i do to the treasury so we now are in a situation where we have us 60 million in the bank cash we have no debt and if we look back at the history of emx and all the money that we have raised in the history of the company to be able to build this asset based model of these royalties around the world and all the prospective mineral rights that we ve acquired 90 some odd different assets we have more money in the bank now than all the money we ve raised cumulatively in our history so we re sitting here with no debt us 60 million in the bank and a robust portfolio of 90 assets around the world so that s where we re at financially and it s great to be in that position and have more money in the bank than all the money we ve raised in our history and in the entire portfolio is proof positive that the business model works so i m very proud of that specific fact going on to the next part of your question what are we going to do with the money that s a very active question i get asked this frequently we believe wholeheartedly in exactly what we do we like to buy royalties if and when we can find them affordably at a price that s accretive to our shareholders we love to execute organic growth and we like to make the occasional strategic investment with a very high investment threshold so we re going do exactly what we have been doing we ll just have more arrows in the quiver specifically we re shopping for cash flowing royalties to help augment our top lying cash flow i intend to increase our prospect generation slightly but not substantially i like the team that we have we re lean and mean we re operating well around the world acquiring lots of prospective mineral rights we are now the largest mineral rights holder in norway the second largest mineral rights holder in sweden we re the third largest mineral rights holder in the state of arizona i just touched three examples we have over 9 000 mining claims in the western united states so we just love to control more mineral rights and so with the monies in the bank are going to be allocated toward exactly what they ve been allocated for in the past but we have more arrows in the quiver i m hopeful that we ll find some good cash flowing royalties to buy maurice jackson you have a global portfolio how much of that is copper centric david cole i would say roughly a third of our portfolio is copper we focused on copper and gold throughout the last decade and a half building this company that s specifically because that s where our economic geological expertise lies we re gold geologists and copper geologists and those two metals tend to occur in similar geological trends so it s not uncommon for folks to have expertise around those two particular metals consequently our portfolio is dominated by copper and gold but we do have a substantial portion of our portfolio that s polymetallic some of those are associated with volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits not to get too technical about this but there are some deposits that have multiple metals in them that we re working on specifically in norway and sweden and elsewhere in the world also lead zinc silver copper cobalt nickel and we do see strong interest from the mining companies that acquire our projects from us battery metals cobalt nickel and of course copper the most important battery metal but copper s also used in so many other things that the incremental increase in the use of copper from battery metals is significant but not dominating the demand for the metal maurice jackson germane to the discussion of your geological acumen expertise which is in copper predominately let s talk about 25 years future copper supply and demand how does that look david cole the demand for copper on planet earth has gone up at roughly 3 per year for our entire life time we believe that it s likely to continue growing at 3 and that s compounded growth that s exponential growth which puts us in an interesting situation we expect that the world will produce and consume as much copper in the next 25 years as has been produced in the entire history of mankind which is phenomenal when you think about that that s the case for other metals as well that 3 number is kind of a broad brushed number that applies across the metals with respect to increase in consumption over a time now of course there can be a spike in cobalt consumption because a new cobalt battery is invented or a spike in gold demand related to a currency situation or something of that nature but smoothed out when you take the big picture look these metals are consumed at 3 more per annum and when you look at the big picture that s compounded growth that s doubling every 20 years 23 years and that s phenomenal maurice jackson it really is and again the value proposition gets better as we speak here because i want to take us now to scandinavia strategically emx royalty acquired a number of mineral rights there why in scandinavia david cole so it s interesting how we ended up there and how we ve ended up in various places around the world it all comes back to people so primarily my focus as the founder of emx royalty has been first and foremost to engage really smart folks and i m humbled by the opportunity that i have to work with such smart individuals including a whole host of phd geologists with expertise and acumen from around the world working in this business sector and it was a geologist by the name of dr duncan large that got us into scandinavia he told me while we were working in serbia which is a point of huge success for us and was one of our early business units in the company you know the prospectiveness in northern europe is very interesting there s some great rocks up there there s a lot of open ground that s available for acquisition there are big governmental databases available from the swedish geological survey and the norwegian geological survey that resulted from the era when the governments did the exploration work there which is no longer the case but the data s still available for free and it s very very very well organized so it s a prospector s dream you have all this data available for free you have lots of open mineral rights so you can go out and stake claims and acquire licenses from the government and build a portfolio and over time we started to dig in more and more and more and i think sweden is one of the best places to work in the world there are 17 major operating metal mines and sweden seven smelters there are substantially more smelters in sweden than there are in the united states maurice jackson unknown fact for many people let s move a little further south let s go to maybe the next catalyst for emx let s go to turkey and serbia what can you share with us david cole well the story in serbia is phenomenal serbia was one of our first business units we helped the serbian government rewrite its concession legislation we helped it rewrite its money law we became the first company to be granted an exploration license in serbia in over 40 years and open the door for foreign investment in serbia what s interesting part and parcel to our business model we acquired the mineral rights we added value we put together the geological models we sold that on and we sold it for a combination of cash shares and a royalty on the project as we do and reservoir capital then was the company that advanced the asset and it joined a venture with freeport and it proceeded to make over the course of many years and a lot of money in the ground and a lot of risk dollars being spent and a lot of dead holes it ended up finding a phenomenal discovery probably the most exciting copper gold discovery ever made in europe it s in the timok magmatic complex some people call it the timok project some people called it the cukaru peki project and as luck would have it it was just off of our boundary of our claim so we did not have a royalty on it but because we were distinctly aware of the progress that was being made and the eminent probability of a big discovery we went out and bought the royalty that did exist over that project that a third company had and we were able to buy that royalty very very very inexpensively particularly in relation to what we believe that royalty is worth today that s a company making royalty it covers the upper zone the lower zone the whole license and we have a whole portfolio of royalties through the timok magmatic complex which is now very very very prospective ground it s a hotbed of exploration work in europe and one of the larger discoveries in the recent history in the world is being made and we have one half of one percent royalty on that we are very proud of that that s a catalyst as a company making royalty in our portfolio maurice jackson again congratulations this alludes to the business acumen that i ve been sharing with a number of my subscribers on proven and probable and why i m such a big fan and also for the record and i ve shared this with you privately i m a strong advocate for owning physical precious metals but for every single dollar that i m
