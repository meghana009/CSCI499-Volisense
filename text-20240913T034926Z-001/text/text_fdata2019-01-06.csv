the currency conundrum russ mould investment director at online trading platform aj bell says almost every major currency has challenges right now the us has a huge budget deficit the euro faces political friction and poor growth sterling is bogged down by brexit china s renminbi is hit by debt fears while slowing chinese growth is hurting commodity exporters like australia and canada most countries now actively want a weak currency to make their exports more competitive china seems happy to let the renminbi drift lower the swiss are still running quantitative easing at full tilt and central bankers everywhere are actively talking down their currencies or offering only limited support says mr mould this is a race to the bottom and everybody wants to be a winner the year started with a currency flash crash as the us and australian dollars along with the turkish lira plunged against the japanese yen to raise the curtain on what analysts expect to be a hugely volatile 12 months foreign exchange movements matter to uae residents as many internationally mobile individuals juggle two or three different currencies and make regular foreign exchange transfers gaurav kashyap head of futures at egm in dubai says the fear factor is back after the stock market meltdown of 2018 that saw equities slide amid trade war worries and a slowing global economy and currencies are also feeling the heat several market moving events are coming to a head this year notably the us china trade war and brexit the us government shutdown the prospect of further interest rate rises from the federal reserve tighter european central bank ecb monetary policy and elections in india are also adding to the uncertainty says mr kashyap so which currencies will fare the best in 2019 us dollar mr kashyap suggests us dollar strength will continue as investors seek a safe haven for their money which would be good news for uae residents sending dollar linked dirhams to their home countries the us federal reserve increased interest rates four times last year and the big question is whether chair jay powell defies criticism from president donald trump and pushes for further increases if the fed adopts a more dovish approach it could hinder my outlook for the greenback which otherwise remains bullish for the first half of the year says mr kashyap russ mould investment director at online trading platform aj bell says the dollar should shrug off concerns over the soaring budget deficit and political gridlock it would take a brave person to bet against the greenback in 2019 especially with the fed likely to increase interest rates again and withdraw quantitative easing president trump s desire to reduce the trade deficit should further support the dollar against the euro and

european economic data is mixed and i do not see any form of monetary tightening before the summer he adds he believes the single currency may continue to struggle as the eu battles political challenges from italian populists and brexit it we get a hard no deal brexit this could hurt both the euro and sterling outlook a bumpy year in prospect for the single currency sterling after two years of vacillation january looks like a make or break month for british prime minister theresa may and the pound as she faces an uphill task in persuading mps to support her deal in the rescheduled vote on january 14 however mr kashyap believes sterling could recover strongly provided a no deal brexit crisis is averted rising as much as 8 per cent against the euro from 1 11 today towards 1 20 many analysts have also argued that sterling is priced for disaster and could be a top performer if the uk avoids the worst outlook sterling could move sharply in either direction indian rupee emerging market currencies were slaughtered last year particularly the indian rupee which fell 9 per cent mr kashyap says the uncertainty may continue until elections in april and may with the prospect of a rally in stock markets and the rupee after that devesh mamtani head of investments and advisory at century financial brokers in dubai is also optimistic new governments in india tend to splurge in the first year potentially boosting economic growth and this makes the rupee very attractive he says the rupee has been hammered for years but should now outperform a dovish fed will help

mexico canada agreement usmca which should strengthen business investment when it is ratified prime minister justin trudeau s plan to cut taxes and red tape should give the economy a further lift we expect the bank of canada to raise rates from 1 75 per cent to 2 25 per cent which should also boost the dollar outlook things are looking up for the loonie emerging markets dollar strength is traditionally bad news for emerging market assets and so it proved in 2018 with crises in turkey and argentina triggering investor flight and further pressure expected this year however mr mould notes that the jp morgan emerging markets currency index is trading near all time lows potential bad news about emerging market currencies may already be in the price and they could recover he picks the chinese renminbi as one to watch president xi jinping has to juggle his growth plans against the country s growing debt mountain currency weakness and us trade war talk if the chinese decide to dash for growth the yuan could be sacrificed and fall even further says mr mould outlook the yuan could come under sustained pressure new zealand dollar mr mamtani reckons the new zealand dollar is likely to underperform as gdp growth slips to a five year low of just 0 3 per cent and the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz imposes stricter capital requirements on the country s banks this will increase the cost of credit and we expect the rbnz to cut interest rates to combat the resulting slowdown outlook there may be dollar dismay for new zealand australian dollar the australian dollar may also underperform after house prices in sydney fell 10 per cent in a year with further drops expected mr mamtani says this creates a negative wealth effect for households and curbs personal spending the slowing chinese economy could hit demand for australian commodities forcing the royal bank of australia to hold or even cut interest rates hitting its currency he adds outlook a commodity crunch threatens the aussie japanese yen mr mamtani says the japanese yen has risen for three consecutive years and is likely to outperform this year as well trade war concerns and the slowing global economy should increase its safe haven attractions outlook nervous investors should give the yen a further boost
we are living in a time of prescriptions for america s economic woes that carry little meaning forget what you hear on tv unfettered free trade tariffs de facto open borders immigration a consequence of a political dysfunction that precludes genuine immigration reform and market fundamentalism have done little to eliminate the paucity of quality employment opportunities a good new year s resolution therefore would be constructing new policies that solve this problem in a viable long lasting way even if it means discarding increasingly outdated shibboleths much of the story of the u s and other western democracies over the past 40 years has been the loss of highly skilled well paying jobs displaced in many instances by the proliferation of low wage and low productivity jobs in health care food service or becoming a gig driver for uber the effects have been confirmed in a recent study by mckinsey which showed that income growth has stagnated or fallen for the majority of households in the advanced economies over the past few decades the only way to fix this is with direct government spending into the economy that involvement must be via spending on badly needed public goods such as infrastructure and publicly funded education but that is not the only legitimate role for the state we also need a well designed industrial policy that focuses on the creation of quality private sector jobs capable of profitably supporting workers with solid middle class incomes these must be accompanied by social policies on immigration environmentalism and trade that do not simply treat worker displacement as an unfortunate by product negative externality in econ speak cast on the scrap heap of progress similarly workers should not be viewed as deplorables if and when they understandably object to disproportionately bearing the restructuring costs as the economy moves toward greater environmental sustainability free market fundamentalism has done a great job of extracting value from the economy and largely distributing its gains to the top 1 percent when governments occasionally find a way to redistribute the benefits of that value extraction to the broader population whether via a minimum wage tighter regulation state intervention or similar policy these measures are invariably castigated as wrongheaded inevitably leading to less efficiency sub optimal growth and lower standards of living but from whose perspective here s the thing reiterating superficial reforms of outdated notions of free trade liberalized immigration and comparative advantage while ignoring the social pathologies created by these long standing policies hardly constitutes a realistic policy response it evokes the definition of madness long attributed to einstein furthermore in a hyper globalized world it is harder to make the case that any nation possesses greater comparative advantage other than those obtained through lower labor costs and mercantilist manipulation indeed neither capacity nor comparative advantage is fixed both are chosen they are decisions not fate even natural resources while still a factor provide much less relative advantage than in earlier times basically any nation can produce anything the only issue is relative cost since the developed countries cannot thrive as the lower cost producers via labor advantage the only tool left in the pursuit of economic health is to combat mercantilism with mercantilism or reverse mercantilism if you prefer the policy tools may involve forms of protectionism but the same results might also be achieved via taxation since unemployment is the source of the extended pay benefits provided by the government the government can for example permanently tax the source of the unemployment u s corporations that have historically resorted to offshoring taxation done in this manner will help restore a permanent incentive to invest in plants and equipment in the u s ultimately the aim is to change the labor share of the production equation so that production vastly increases general welfare and living standards for the largest possible majority of people by conducting policy with a view toward favoring labor over capital the aim is to produce a larger economy and more stable albeit restrained profits investors in the stock market might not benefit as much but the rest of us will there is however a chicken and egg element to the concept of warranted industrial policy we cannot overstress profits or overprice goods until we have channeled sufficient incomes to households for them to afford higher priced goods otherwise we have an even bigger personal debt problem than we do now average american household debt stands at around 130 000 it was a key insight of the noted british economist of the late 19th early 20th century john atkinson hobson whose theory of under consumption as i have written before challenged the prevailing ideology of the day which considered wage suppression to be good for business and society in fact as hobson pointed out labor is not just a cost input but an important source of demand so restricting the former s purchasing power can lead to sub optimal economic growth a better policy response which runs contrary to today s prevailing neoliberal theology is to gradually enhance purchasing power by gradually removing direct burdens on households that limit their truly disposable income state assumption of medical and education costs and a reform of the tax system so that it no longer gears fiscal policy benefits largely toward the top 1 percent who have the highest savings propensities another aspect to this may entail some form of managed trade as well via local content requirements lcrs here s how this would work every large nation or bloc it doesn t work for small countries would be allowed to adopt local content requirements for the industries it wants ranging from zero to 100 percent 100 representing the highest military or economic importance the rest of the world can compete for the remaining share of the national bloc market free trade theologians will no doubt rebel but the virtue of this idea is that it reduces the incentive for mercantilism precisely because lcrs make it impossible to drive your trading partner out of a desired industry by dumping likewise currency manipulation doesn t work to wipe out your trading partner because a large percentage of say semiconductor chips must be made in the u s under this program whether the dollar is high or low import substitution via local content requirements is often derided by free market theologians it is true that import substitution partial or total can have its own pathologies but it has one significant virtue there is no incentive for dumping motivated overproduction no rational private firm is going to make products far in excess of demand in the local market national or bloc and there would be no point in governments subsidizing products to dump them abroad because dumping would be deterred by foreign in market production rules of various kinds quotas tariffs local content requirements granted this wouldn t entirely deter dumping which could still pay off for mercantilist regimes that want to corner the free shares of nations bloc markets but it would greatly lower the stakes no major nation or bloc need worry that it will lose any industry it wants to keep to predatory trade practices the idea of eliminating everybody s tariffs instead of granting market access on a case by case basis seems to have come from the wilsonian wing of the democratic party led by cordell hull the tennessee senator who subsequently became fdr s secretary of state for 11 years hull and other southerners had always been for free trade because they had no industries in need of infant industry protection and wanted to sell cotton soybeans beef and any other farm products to the markets of the european empires u s manufacturing was part of the free trade coalition during the brief moment of u s global manufacturing monopoly from the 1940s to the 70s but the postwar recovery of east asia and germany caused a crisis that u s firms solved by offshoring to cheap labor locales rather than pressing to alter trade regimes or investing to move higher up the technology curve to offset the impact of rising labor costs part of our policy challenge today springs from the fact that we are an advanced industrial economy operating with rules set by long dead agrarians and justified by an agrarian economic philosophy adam smith like the french physiocrats favored farming over premodern sweatshop manufacturing which they all thought was dehumanizing they didn t grasp machine based manufacturing which came later accordingly the 2020s need to be devoted to the end of the 40 year reagan thatcher experiment with unmanaged capitalism based on these archaic rules simply letting markets be markets the dictum of the anti trust brigade does not necessarily provide optimal outcomes in fact it represents a kind of neoliberalism on steroids the state needs to be involved so as to rectify the imbalances created by head to head competition with highly managed state supported forms of capitalism a necessary corollary is that export processing zones epzs should be outlawed many of them in china or elsewhere require by local law a majority of goods produced to be sold outside of the country in which they are made protecting local national champions while encouraging dumping and mercantilism the key to understanding contemporary global production is our bizarre new quasi medieval system of territorial enclave arbitrage epzs physical production and tax havens finance and ip add to that phenomenon the fact that there are elites willing to pay an illegal immigrant servant class off the books and you have a system of indentured servitude created by corporations and the rich that evades labor unions taxes and labor laws this new parallel world order of enclaves is incompatible with a global westphalian system of industrial nation states based at least in theory on popular sovereignty more and more of the national working class population gets priced out of the high urban living costs of our major cities and into post industrial heartlands with no high value added industry and no way to use the ballot box in democratic government to tax the rich to pay even for basic services and social insurance thus the yellow vests in france and similar phenomena elsewhere here s another aspect that would undoubtedly help labor but no doubt be greeted with profound misgivings by much of the liberal punditocracy immigration reform we also need an immigration reform bill not based on building a useless 2 000 mile wall but one predicated on the barbara jordan commission s guiding principles listed below 1 clear goals and priorities must define u s immigration policy 2 effective policy means enforcement of immigration limits 3 regular review is needed to ensure flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances in the united states 4 immigration policy should be comprehensible and its implementation efficient 5 sponsors are responsible for ensuring that immigrants do not become burdens on the american taxpayer 6 immigration policy must protect u s workers against unfair competition from foreign workers with an appropriately higher level of protection for the most vulnerable in our society 7 both temporary and permanent admissions categories must be seen as integral parts of a cohesive immigration policy 8 a sound immigration policy supports americanization meaning that immigrants share with americans such values as the belief in liberty democracy and equal opportunity 9 fundamental immigration reform requires a period of transition to get from the present system to the new one for those who chafe against the enforcement of immigration limits it s worth noting that in the words of professor bill mitchell corporations love free movement of both capital and people because in the latter case they can use the excess supply of labour to batter the existing workers and their organisations into accepting worse pay and conditions but to ensure that the immigration laws are both humane and equitable rather than placing the burden of enforcement on the immigrants themselves immigration limits are best achieved by mandating e verify for all employers and capping the number of contractors an employer can hire as a percentage of full time workers immigration should also prioritize entrants on the basis of skill not family or race once we have a proper functioning immigration system labor markets will likely tighten and the minimum wage can be raised without expanding the black market in labor this would also help to redress somewhat the significant power imbalance between capital and labor as the former relies on an army of unemployed to mitigate wage increases the traditional rebuttal from the likes of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd or the harvard economics department is that rising wages dwindling capacity and continuing trade frictions all spell inflation loss of competitiveness and with it less profitability and economic prosperity the loss of competitiveness is addressed via the local content requirement rules the other thing that never seems to occur to our experts is that productive and absorptive capacity themselves both grow as wealth and income rise beyond the top income recipients ultimately the end goal is to produce a larger proportion of our own consumption at least for the remaining quarter to half century before the new entrants to the global economy consume a larger proportion of their own production policy can work from two ends one provide lift from the bottom by assuming more social expense currently borne by households and firms in health care for example and two provide suction from above by sucking up the underemployed into better paying public infrastructure jobs one thing is clear the status quo is not working and some radical rethink is going to be required when the next economic crisis befalls us
by bernard hickey financial markets are now expecting the reserve bank to cut interest rates again as soon as march after the bank delivered a clear easing bias in its first decision of the year and fonterra surprised markets with an earlier than expected cut in its forecast payout to nz 4 15 kg the reserve bank held the official cash rate ocr at 2 5 as universally expected but the focus was on its comments about the future and it delivered the clear easing bias for the rest of 2016 that most economists had expected governor graeme wheeler said uncertainty about the global economy had increased because of concerns about china and other emerging markets he also noted that headline inflation would now take longer to reach the reserve bank s 1 3 target range than the reserve bank had forecast in its full december monetary policy statement mps forecasts some further policy easing may be required over the coming year to ensure that future average inflation settles near the middle of the target range wheeler said in an eight paragraph statement with the bank s first ocr decision of the year these comments represented a much clearer easing bias than the governor s comments on december 10 when he said of the bank achieving the middle of its 1 3 target range we expect to achieve this target at current interest rate settings although the bank will reduce rates if circumstances warrant the signal that the rbnz may reduce the ocr was more forthright than markets anticipated westpac chief economist dominick stephens said the new zealand dollar fell almost a full 1 usc to 64 2 us after the statement although it also may reflect a cut in fonterra s payout forecast to nz 4 15 kg from nz 4 60 kg the jury is out on whether the next cut will be in march or june with financial markets pricing in a 50 chance the rate cuts will restart in march wholesale swap interest rates which are the basis for fixed mortgage rates fell 5 basis points after the decision elsewhere wheeler said economic growth in new zealand was expected to increase in 2016 because of continued strong net migration tourism spending solid construction activity and a lift in business and consumer confidence however he said house price inflation in auckland remained a financial stability risk and he repeated that the new zealand dollar was still too high there are signs that the rate of increase in auckland may be moderating but it is too early to tell house price pressures have been building in some other regions wheeler said the mention of other regions was the first time the governor has mentioned the spreading of house price inflation into other regions in his initial set piece statement suggesting the bank is becoming more concerned about the double digit inflation now spreading into the likes of the waikato and bay of plenty some economists have warned the reserve bank may widen its lending restrictions for landlords if it became concerned about inflation elsewhere wheeler said there had been some easing of financial conditions in new zealand in recent weeks with a fall in the new zealand dollar and market interest rates a further depreciation in the exchange rate is appropriate given the ongoing weakness in export prices wheeler said he said headline cpi inflation remained low due to falling fuel prices but the governor noted core inflation and inflation expectations were not falling however annual core inflation which excludes temporary price movements is consistent with the target range at 1 6 percent inflation expectations remain stable he said financial markets have increased their expectations of further ocr rates as soon as march with some economists predicting the reserve bank will have to cut the ocr to 2 0 by the middle of the year the reserve bank s statement in between full monetary policy statements does not include fresh forecasts for inflation or interest rates so it s not clear how the reserve bank s own expectations have changed it forecast the ocr would be flat at 2 5 until 2018 in its december 20 statement although its comments today about some further easing may be required and its note about its headline inflation expectations falling since december suggest its own ocr rate forecasts have fallen the next full set of forecasts are not due until march although wheeler is expected to flesh out the bank s views in a luncheon speech next wednesday economist reaction asb chief economist nick tuffley said the reseve bank delivered a clearer easing bias but not an explicit signal that the rbnz will necessarily cut the ocr as soon as march but importantly the rbnz is very conscious of the growing downside risk to the inflation environment tuffley said adding he expected the reserve bank to cut the ocr to 2 0 starting from june the risks to that forecast remain a slightly earlier start he said the threshold for a march ocr cut still appears high in the wake of the january statement the rbnz still seems too relaxed about the inflation risks but events could yet prompt a move then the april ocr window follows the q1 cpi and further signs of weak inflation pressure could be a green light at that point he said westpac chief economist dominick stephens said the reserve bank had shifted to an explicit easing bias but was not explicit about the likely start date for further cuts stephens said the statement could support cuts starting in either march or june he now expected the rate cuts to resume in march whereas he had previously thought they would start in june westpac now expected annual inflation to fall to 0 by september of this year as an inflation targeting central bank there was no way the rbnz could ignore such a monumental change in the inflation outlook stephens said anz chief economist cameron bagrie said the statement delivered a more explicit easing bias than the conditional one delivered in december although it was not one way traffic he pointed to the bank s comments about solid growth house price inflation risks and a lower new zealand dollar this doesn t sound like a central bank ready to cut rates any time soon but the door is open and markets will run with it bagrie said while the easing bias has been stepped up the bank stopped short of setting the scene for a march cut so it is difficult to argue with markets when odds of a march cut sit at around 50 50 he said bnz head of research stephen toplis stuck to his view that the reserve bank was more likely to remain on hold than cut but given the stated easing bias and the obvious risks that prevail it is easy to justify current market pricing and betting against it is unlikely to offer great reward in the very near future the bank spent some time highlighting why rates should not be cut now in particular this was the first time that we can remember that the rbnz has specifically referred to core inflation in its ocr mps press statements toplis said pointing also to the bank s statement about stable inflation expectations the combination of these statements is a very strong warning to all and sundry that the rbnz will not pander to pressure to lower its cash rate just because headline inflation remains low he said equally it is a reminder that if headline inflation stays low and reduces inflation expectations to the extent that economic behaviours threaten to push the core rate down further then the rbnz will respond to this by cutting rates he said given that the rbnz is looking for weakening inflation expectations to feed into core inflation as a catalyst for further easing then it would seem that any prospective rate cut were it to happen is more likely to occur later in the year than sooner given the lags involved first nz economist chris green changed his ocr view after the decision which he described as adopting a more explicit easing bias he said he now saw one or two 25 basis point cuts over 2016 rather than the ocr remaining on hold he said the march 10 mps may be too early given a lack of fresh domestic data and he had pencilled in one cut for the june mps political reaction new zealand first leader winston peters said the fonterra payout cut threatened an economic storm the prime minister s answer is consumptive policies in auckland and an abandonment of productive polices for the rest of the country peters said our government has done less than nothing to help provincial nz which is the foundation of our export wealth historically this must be the worst national government for new zealand farmers and with the chickens coming home to roost they re paying the price for what is now a party dominated by city slickers he said labour finance spokesman grant robertson called on the government to take action on the economy the drop comes a day after fitch ratings agency revised our near term growth prospects downward because of declining prices for dairy exports and on the same day the reserve bank said dairy prices remain a risk robertson said the reserve bank governor can t fix the economy on his own he s stuck between the rock of low inflation and falling growth and the hard place of the auckland housing market he said new zealand needs a more diversified economy to help insulate us from major commodity shocks we need to invest in job rich industries and support companies to move up the value chain we can also bring forward projects to stimulate the economy despite more than a year of warnings as dairy prices have plummeted there has been no real effort from the government to do this green finance spokeswoman julie anne genter said the reserve bank would have been able to the cut the ocr without its concerns about the auckland housing market which the government was not doing enough to address national hasn t done enough to take the heat out of the auckland housing market and john key s big speech yesterday showed that national has no new ideas for how to fix the housing crisis genter said we need government backed affordable housing developments quality intensification along key transport routes and a capital gains tax excluding the family home she said here is the reserve bank s full statement today the reserve bank today left the official cash rate unchanged at 2 5 percent uncertainty about the strength of the global economy has increased due to weaker growth in the developing world and concerns about china and other emerging markets prices for a range of commodities particularly oil remain weak financial market volatility has increased and global inflation remains low the domestic economy softened during the first half of 2015 driven by the lower terms of trade however growth is expected to increase in 2016 as a result of continued strong net immigration tourism a solid pipeline of construction activity and the lift in business and consumer confidence in recent weeks there has been some easing in financial conditions as the new zealand dollar exchange rate and market interest rates have declined a further depreciation in the exchange rate is appropriate given the ongoing weakness in export prices house price inflation in auckland remains a financial stability risk there are signs that the rate of increase may be moderating but it is too early to tell house price pressures have been building in some other regions there are many risks around the outlook these relate to the prospects for global growth particularly around china global financial market conditions dairy prices net immigration and pressures in the housing market headline cpi inflation remains low mainly due to falling fuel prices however annual core inflation which excludes temporary price movements is consistent with the target range at 1 6 percent inflation expectations remain stable headline inflation is expected to increase over 2016 but take longer to reach the target range than previously expected monetary policy will continue to be accommodative some further policy easing may be required over the coming year to ensure that future average inflation settles near the middle of the target range we will continue to watch closely the emerging flow of economic data for comparison s sake here is the bank s statement from december 10 the reserve bank today reduced the official cash rate ocr by 25 basis points to 2 5 percent globally economic growth is below average and inflation is low despite highly stimulatory monetary conditions financial markets remain concerned about weaker growth in emerging economies particularly in china markets are also focused on the expected tightening of policy in the united states and the prospect of an increasing divergence between monetary policies in the major economies growth in the new zealand economy has softened over 2015 due mainly to lower terms of trade combined with increases in the labour supply from strong net immigration the slowdown has seen an increase in spare capacity and unemployment a recovery in export prices the recent lift in confidence and increasing domestic demand from the rising population are expected to see growth strengthen over the coming year the new zealand dollar has risen since august partly reversing the depreciation that occurred from april the rise in the exchange rate is unhelpful and further depreciation would be appropriate in order to support sustainable growth house price inflation in auckland remains high posing a financial stability risk residential building is accelerating and recent tax and lvr measures are expected to reduce housing pressures there are some early signs that auckland house price inflation may be moderating cpi inflation is below the 1 to 3 percent target range mainly due to the earlier strength in the new zealand dollar and the 65 percent fall in world oil prices since mid 2014 the inflation rate is expected to move inside the target range from early 2016 as earlier petrol price declines will drop out of the annual calculation and the lower new zealand dollar will be reflected in higher tradables prices there are a number of uncertainties and risks to this outlook in the primary sector there are risks that dairy prices remain weak for longer and the current el nino results in drought conditions and weaker output risks to the domestic outlook include the prospect of net immigration staying high for longer and of household expenditure picking up on the back of strong house prices monetary policy needs to be accommodative to help ensure that future average inflation settles near the middle of the target range we expect to achieve this at current interest rate settings although the bank will reduce rates if circumstances warrant we will continue to watch closely the emerging flow of economic data official cash rates

china april 27 2018 reuters jason lee file photojason lee reuters as folk singer billy bragg said you have to learn to take the crunchy with the smooth he was talking about love but it applies just as well to economics in any year in the life of an economy the positive and negative combine to tell a nuanced story sometimes the positives dominate and it s happily ever after other times the negatives reign and we talk about crises and recessions usually we land somewhere in between not as good as hoped not as bad as feared in 2018 we had a year of encouraging global growth threatened by trade wars of booming employment but tentative wage growth of rising interest rates and falling oil prices in the end we were left with a year that was largely an economic success both in canada and globally but with an inescapable tone of uncertainty that casts a shadow over the young 2019 we asked five economists at canada s biggest banks to anticipate what might be ahead in 2019 to each give us one key factor to cheer and one to fear in whichever order they preferred as another year takes shape here s what they said dawn desjardins deputy chief economist royal bank of canada fear uncertainties elevated policy uncertainty is casting a shadow on the outlook for the global economy in 2019 heightened trade tensions unnerved investors in late 2018 resulting in stock markets erasing the year s gains and commodity prices dropping this hit to investor confidence also reflected worries about brexit oil prices and the shaky political backdrop in some of the world s largest economies should these unsettled issues persist they will act as a weight on global growth in 2019 which for canada could limit demand for our exports and stymie the anticipated recovery in oil prices cheer more jobs and wages to come canada s labour market performed very well in 2018 with 163 000 jobs created and the unemployment rate falling to a 44 year low the increase was impressive as the year started with big job losses and the good news for workers is likely to continue in 2019 in mid 2018 companies were looking to fill about half a million positions with competition for workers fierce firms have bumped up the wages they are offering likely these wage increases are going to become more broadly based in 2019 and a healthy labour market is key to helping households manage rising debt service costs in 2019 avery shenfeld chief economist canadian imperial bank of commerce cheer the starting point the best news for 2019 is where canada and the united states stand today with decades low unemployment but no serious inflation pressures that gives the central banks in both countries licence to let the good times roll erring on the side of fewer interest rate hikes than in past cycles remember that many recessions have been triggered by overly aggressive interest rate hikes aimed at quelling inflation and as we enter 2019 that looks to be an unlikely policy mistake fear replacing the household sector canada s greatest fears lie in the risks that we are simply unable to replace housing and debt financed consumer spending with other sources of growth we reached full employment by leveraging up our household sector without seeing much success in trade or related business capital spending long before concerns over nafta we were lagging the united states and other jurisdictions in attracting businesses to add capacity in export oriented sectors have we done enough to polish up our attractiveness to such investments or is it going to take the labour cost savings of a still weaker canadian dollar with the attendant dent to our own import purchasing power to have businesses opt to expand here douglas porter chief economist bank of montreal fear financial markets while markets have an imperfect track record in forecasting the economy there is little doubt that the late year weakness is signalling slower activity in 2019 we are currently on course for the first year of net losses for both the s p 500 and the 10 year u s treasury in modern times it s no coincidence that this broad weakness occurred when the fed s reversal of quantitative easing hit full stride we fundamentally believe that financial markets are exaggerating the negativity but the uncertainties of trade wars and brexit are also clouding an already dimmer growth outlook there is the very realistic possibility that sour financial markets could spill over onto business and consumer activity a self fulfilling prophecy and all of this arrives when the current business cycle is already quite extended cheer moderate inflation the fact that north american core inflation trends ebbed late in 2018 is good news along with a deep slide in oil prices concerns about the north american economy overheating have largely been washed aside this suggests that the canadian and u s central banks have plenty of flexibility to potentially pause their tightening campaigns or even reverse course if markets weaken further and growth chills more than expected the rapid unwinding of inflation pressure has chopped bond yields with canada s key government 10 year yield ending 2018 lower than a year ago given that interest sensitive sectors housing and autos saw the biggest cool down in 2018 a more moderate long term rate environment could provide some important and surprising

the beetlejuice effect just like in the movie beetlejuice saying a word too many times makes it appear the word recession is increasingly creeping into media and analyst commentary financial and economic indicators have yet to breach levels that would signal an impending recession but beliefs and sentiment can become self fulfilling according to a quarterly duke university cfo global business

job growth we are finally seeing an economic expansion reaching into all the corners of the labour market the unemployment rates in canada and the united states are hovering near historic lows and employers appear equally willing to hire across the spectrum of low to high skilled workers low skilled job growth is running at about 4 per cent year to date in canada outpacing overall demand it s not surprising in a tight market that employers are also looking across the age spectrum the younger portion of the labour force those aged 15 to 24 years now faces one of the lowest unemployment rates on record while those in the 25 to 54 age bracket have already surpassed that mark should job demand maintain a firm underpinning in 2019 this offers further encouragement for more marginalized workers to be drawn into the market and garner higher wages

regarding the eu s neoliberal policies apparently the modern left is also in serious need of a history lesson regarding the eu federation s fascist origins it has been truly puzzling to see self proclaimed progressives mourning britain s decision to withdraw from a continental union that was historically masterminded by former fifth columnists of nazi germany it was in the aftermath of wwii s

states belgium luxembourg and the netherlands the europe declaration charter stated the idea of forming a supranational union was conceived by the french statesman robert schuman who during the outbreak of wwii served as the under secretary of state for refugees in the reynaud government when nazi germany invaded france in 1940 schuman by all accounts willingly voted to grant absolute dictatorial powers to marshall philippe pétain to become head of state of the newly formed vichy government the puppet regime that ruled nazi occupied france until the allied invasion in 1944 by doing so he retained his position in parliament though he later chose to resign following the war like all vichy collaborators schuman was initially charged with the offense of indignité nationale national unworthiness and stripped of his civil rights as a traitor more than 4 000 alleged quislings were summarily executed following operation overlord and the normandy landings but the future eu designer was fortunate enough to have friends in high places schuman s clemency was granted by none other than general charles de gaulle himself the leader of the resistance during the war and future french president instantly schuman s turncoat reputation was rehabilitated and his wartime activity whitewashed even though he had knowingly voted full authority to pétain the retention of his post in the vichy government was veneered to have occurred somehow without his knowledge or consent schuman is officially regarded as one of the eleven men who were founding fathers of what later became the eu one of the other major figures that contributed to the federal integration of the continent was konrad adenauer the first chancellor of the federal republic of germany the nuremberg trials may have tried and executed most of the top leadership of the nazi party but the post war government that became west germany was saturated with former third reich officials despite the purported post war denazification policy inscribed in the potsdam agreement many figures who had directly participated in the holocaust were appointed to high positions in adenauer s administration and never prosecuted for their atrocities one such war criminal was the former ministry of the interior and drafter of the nuremberg race statutes hans globke who became adenauer s right hand man as his secretary of state and chief of staff adenauer also successfully lobbied the allies to free most of the wehrmacht war criminals in their custody winning the support of then u s general and future president dwight eisenhower by 1951 motivated by the desire to quickly rearm and integrate west germany into nato in the new cold war the policy of denazification was prematurely ended and countless offenders were allowed to reenter branches of government military and public service their crimes against humanity took a backseat to the greater imperialist priority of rearmament against east germany and the soviets in the years following wwii there was also concern among the elite of anti americanism growing in western europe the annual bilderberg group conference was established in 1954 by prince bernard of the netherlands himself a former reiter ss corps and nazi party member to promote atlanticism and facilitate cooperation between american and european leaders invitations to the bilderberg

before the treaty of rome which established the european economic community without the public s knowledge the mysterious bilderberg gatherings are still held to this day under notorious secrecy and

building how ironic that liberals are clinging to a multinational political union founded by fascist colluders while the same economic bloc is being opposed by today s far right after its new islamophobic facelift while nationalism may have played an instrumental role in brexit there is a manufactured hysteria hatched by the establishment which successfully reduced the complex range of reasons for the leave eu vote to racism and flag waving they are now repeating this pattern by overstating the presence of the far right among the yellow vests such delirium not only demonizes workers but coercively repositions the left into supporting something it otherwise shouldn t the eu and by default its laissez faire policies thereby driving the masses further into the arms of the same far right echoes of this can be seen in the u s with the vapid response to journalist angela nagle s recent article about the immigration crisis on the southern border the faux left built a straw man in their attack on nagle who dared to acknowledge that the establishment only really wants open borders for an endless supply of low wage labor from regions in the global south destabilized by u s militarism and trade liberalization aligning itself with the hollow symbolic gestures of centrists has only deteriorated the standards of the left participating in such vacuousness and dragged down to the level of liberals there is no doubt brexit and trump pushed the xenophobia button and could not have come about without it however such criticism means nothing when it comes from moral posturers who claim to stand with refugees while supporting the very humanitarian interventionist policies displacing them nativism was not the sole reason the majority voted to leave the eu and many working class minorities also were brexiters of course their fellow workers and migrants are not the true cause of their misery after all it was not just chattel slaves who came to the u s unwillingly but european immigrants fleeing continental wars and starvation as well the crisis in the eu today is no different already desperate to reinvent itself and a new enemy in russia despite its functional obsolescence the shock of the referendum has inconveniently undermined nato s ability to pressure moscow and beijing a step forward for mitigating world peace in the long run and a silver lining to its outcome it is the task of the left to reject the eu s neoliberal project while transmitting the message that capital not refugees is the cause of the plight of the masses it is also necessary to have faith in the people something cynical liberals lack racism may historically be the achilles heel of the working class but underlying brexit the election of trump and the yellow vests is the spirit of defiance in working people albeit one of political confusion in need of guidance if the yellow vests are today s sans culottes like those which became the revolutionary partisans in the french revolution they will eventually need a jacobin club relatively progressive but ultimately reformist figures like mélenchon are no such spearhead and will only lead them down the same dead end of syriza the absence of any such vanguard has forced the working class to take matters into their own hands in the interim if history is any guide the gilets jaunes will be stamped out until a new cadre takes the reins whose objective is as lenin said not to champion the degrading of the revolutionary to the level of an amateur but to raise the amateurs to the level of revolutionaries we also cannot fall into ideological fantasies that we live in permanent revolutionary circumstances or that a spontaneous uprising can become comprehensive simply because of ingenious leadership nevertheless as mao tse tung wrote a single spark can start a prairie fire and hopefully the yellow vests are that flame

class minorities also were brexiters of course their fellow workers and migrants are not the true cause of their misery after all it was not just chattel slaves who came to the u s unwillingly but european immigrants fleeing continental wars and starvation as well the crisis in the eu today is no different already desperate to reinvent itself and a new enemy in russia despite its functional obsolescence the shock of the referendum has inconveniently undermined nato s ability to pressure moscow and beijing a step forward for mitigating world peace in the long run and a silver lining to its outcome it is the task of the left to reject the eu s neoliberal project while transmitting the message that capital not refugees is the cause of the plight of the masses it is also necessary to have faith in the people something cynical liberals lack racism may historically be the achilles heel of the working class but underlying brexit the election of trump and the yellow vests is the spirit of defiance in working people albeit one of political confusion in need of guidance if the yellow vests are today s sans culottes like those which became the revolutionary partisans in the french revolution they will eventually need a jacobin club relatively progressive but ultimately reformist figures like mélenchon are no such spearhead and will only lead them down the same dead end of syriza the absence of any such vanguard has forced the working class to take matters into their own hands in the interim if history is any guide the gilets jaunes will be stamped out until a new cadre takes the reins whose objective is as lenin said not to champion the degrading of the revolutionary to the level of an amateur but to raise the amateurs to the level of revolutionaries we also cannot fall into ideological fantasies that we live in permanent revolutionary circumstances or that a spontaneous uprising can become comprehensive simply because of ingenious leadership nevertheless as mao tse tung wrote a single spark can start a prairie fire and hopefully the yellow vests are that flame
the united states benchmark index s p500 dropped by almost 10 percent in december as investors dumped stocks out of fear of the yield curve of us treasury bonds inverted adarsh sinha co head of asia rates and currencies strategy at bank of america merrill lynch says the phenomenon is inevitable whenever the us economy approaches the end of the federal reserve s tightening cycle however he takes a view that this negative signal should not cause any concern at this time saying people forget there are very long lead lags between the inversion of the yield curve and the us recession i think on average the us recession happens five years after an inverted curve he says the fed s tightening cycle is very likely to end in 2019 or in 2020 at most but this does not mean the us economy is headed towards recession and it will not entail a major collapse of the equity market sinha says the us dollar might weaken this year as a result of fiscal stimulus measures that the us has adopted over the years and due to a widening of its current account and fiscal deficits he says there is a typical two year lag between a widening of both deficits and weakness of the greenback the important message this year is that the twin deficits could widen for about 15 months so we are very close to the point where this two year lead lag in the twin deficits and weakness in the us dollar start to matter he predicts the japanese yen and swiss franc will trend lower in the short term sinha says the financial market seems to underestimate the impact of the gridlock between the us congress and the federal government when you have a divided congress uncertainties in the us economic policy could be heightened he says as a result of the gridlock it will be harder for the us companies to make long term commitments to capital expenditures and sinha fears that the history of 2011 s debt ceiling crisis will repeat congress resolved the debt ceiling crisis when it passed the budget control act of 2011 and it decided to immediately raise the us debt ceiling by us 400 billion hk 3 12 trillion from us 14 3 trillion to us 14 7 trillion standard and poor s subsequently downgraded the credit rating of the us from aaa to aa even though the us did not default at that time sinha says the us may reach its debt ceiling at the end of the first quarter this year and the government will probably continue using extraordinary measures for several months that debt ceiling may have to be raised by the middle of this year he stresses that the greenback may no longer be regarded as a safe haven when markets weaken when risks are driven by us specific factors the greenback won t do well we think that this will happen this year he says last october the us treasury department estimated that the federal government would issue us 1 34 trillion worth of new debt for 2018 a 146 percent jump from the 2017 level and the highest amount of new debt issued since 2010 president donald trump is reportedly not worried about the us heading into a massive debt crisis because of his view that it will not happen until after he leaves office meanwhile sinha says two important issues in europe should be tracked closely this year the first is the parliamentary elections in that region the key thing to watch out for is the extent of the shift towards parties that do not support european integration he says although europe needs greater fiscal integration of its markets greater integration is looking more and more unlikely and prospects are looming that nations may not work very well together in the long term the second key issue relates to the european central bank which is set to end quantitative easing measures next year even though economic growth in the region remains weak central banks are trying to tighten policy whether by way of ending qe or raising interest rates largely due to financial stability concerns they also want an easing of monetary policy before the next crisis hits he cites bank of korea as an example which raised key rates not because of souring economic conditions but due more to concerns over financial stability risks sinha predicts an easing in china of the government s macro policies and credit growth starting to outpace gdp growth this year he bases his forecast on china s historical data adding that china will bolster policy when credit growth and gdp growth are expanding at the same pace as occurred in 2008 and 2011 on the brazil soybean issue sinha notes the recent easing in china us trade tensions if trade tensions between the two countries intensify china is more likely to buy soybeans from brazil not the us and soybean prices have tended to favor the us soybean prices therefore serve as an interesting gauge of whether china us trade tensions are easing or not
china s economic performance in 2018 was rather disappointing according to official statistics the country s growth rate up to the end of the third quarter was 6 7 per cent the lowest since the global financial crisis the real situation was probably even worse a lack of progress on institutional reform together with obstacles to structural adjustment have been fueling doubt among many foreign and domestic observers about china s growth prospects some even anticipate a financial crisis caused by a bursting housing bubble or large scale debt defaults by local governments and corporations the trade war with the united states only deepens such worries although a slowdown was inevitable in china after four decades of breakneck growth the chinese government should try to stop further deceleration this year otherwise china s economic financial and social stability will be jeopardized this can be achieved if the government adjusts its macroeconomic policy stance begin with monetary policy the people s bank of china pboc is currently responsible for at a minimum maintaining the stability of economic growth employment prices and the exchange rate that is too many objectives to pursue simultaneously as reflected in sudden and frequent monetary policy reversals since late 2011 the pboc has changed its policy stance four times in response to fluctuations in housing prices but its maneuvers have often undermined its other objectives for example while tightening monetary policy can rein in runaway housing prices it exacerbates the growth slowdown in fact monetary tightening might not even be called for though many argue that the pboc s past liquidity injections especially its large stimulus in response to the 2008 global economic crisis caused the real estate bubble housing prices began to skyrocket long before indeed it is not at all clear that increasing the money supply boosts prices it may even work the other way around because rising housing prices have absorbed too much liquidity the pboc has to increase the money supply to support the real economy with china s growth steadily declining and the consumer price index at around 2 per cent the pboc would do well to adopt a more expansionary monetary policy fiscal levers can be used to contain housing prices which given popular frustration with the real estate market remains an important objective of course expansionary monetary policy would put downward pressure on the renminbi compounding the effects of the us federal reserve s ongoing normalization of interest rates but that needs to be allowed to happen with the pboc no longer shouldering the responsibility for maintaining exchange rate stability for too long china s obsession with currency stability has deprived the pboc of true monetary autonomy it is time to move on chinese enterprises should have learned by this point how to protect themselves from exchange rate fluctuations and china maintains capital controls that effectively protect it against an excessively sharp devaluation let alone a run on the renminbi in any event the more important challenge for china s leaders is to devise a new approach to fiscal policy even us president donald trump s administration with its limited understanding of economics recognizes government s vital role in strengthening areas in which the private sector has insufficient incentive to invest but that are important to national security and economic stability at the end of 2017 china s official public debt to gdp ratio stood at 36 2 per cent the real figure is probably significantly higher if one accounts for contingent liabilities especially the debts owned by local government financing vehicles but even then china s fiscal position is rather strong compared to most countries especially bearing in mind that not all local government debts are bad debts this means that china still has room to pursue expansionary fiscal policy with a focus on reversing the investment slowdown that fueled the decline in gdp growth in 2018 in the first three quarters of 2018 fixed investment grew by just 5 4 per cent year on year compared to 7 5 per cent in 2017 largely because growth in infrastructure investment which accounted for some 27 per cent of fixed investment plummeted from 19 8 per cent in 2017 to just 3 3 per cent in 2018 a major concern here relates to the efficiency of infrastructure investments but the concern that inefficient investments are fueling debt accumulation can be addressed effectively with better designed projects and appropriate limitations on the role of local governments in particular rather than permit local governments to borrow from commercial banks to fund infrastructure investments the central government should foot the bill the combination of higher expenditures and lower revenues resulting from tax cuts and fee reductions may cause china s budget deficit to gdp ratio to exceed 3 per cent but like the cn 7 threshold for the us dollar exchange rate that threshold should not be considered sacred as long as interest rates for government bonds can be kept low the government should not be afraid to issue more of them expansionary macroeconomic policy alone will not resolve all of china s problems in the long term and it undoubtedly carries significant risks but given the paramount importance of stabilizing growth the chinese authorities need to use all of the tools at their disposal project syndicate
new york ap â global stocks soared friday and reversed the big losses they suffered just a day earlier the dow jones industrial average rallied 746 points in the latest twist in a wild three months for markets hopes for progress in the u s china trade dispute a strong report on the u s jobs market and encouraging comments from the head of the u s central bank about its interest rate policy all

the trade dispute and rising interest rates the stock market s plunge also threatened to shake up the confidence and the spending plans of businesses and consumers some analysts said investors were acting as if a recession was on the horizon despite a lack of evidence that the u s economy is struggling it s hard to square recession worries with the strongest job growth we ve seen in years said alec young managing director of global markets research for ftse russell stocks rose even further after federal reserve chairman jerome powell said the central bank will be flexible in deciding if and when it raises interest rates he added that the fed is open to making changes in the way it shrinks its giant portfolio of bonds which affects rates on long term loans such as mortgages until recently the fed had suggested it planned to raise short term interest rates three times this year and next and powell said the fed s balance sheet was shrinking on auto pilot wall street feared that the fed might be moving too fast in raising borrowing costs said phil orlando chief equity market strategist at federated investors the fed s interest rate and bond portfolio policies were at the top of the list of things we were concerned about which is why the statement powell made today is so supportive of the market orlando said the fed understands that what they attempted to communicate last month was inartful that they didn t get the right message across and powell tried to reset the s p 500 index climbed 84 05 points or 3 4 percent to 2 531 94 more than wiping out thursday s loss the dow rose

industrial companies all made strong gains most of the companies in those industries stand to do better in times of faster economic growth smaller and more u s focused companies did even better than larger multinationals the russell 2000 index surged 49 92 points or 3 8 percent to 1 380 75 smaller companies have fallen further than larger ones in the last few months as investors got nervous about

for northern trust wealth management said investors will continue to react to the health of the economy and to concerns about high levels of corporate debt as interest rates rise we don t expect that

president donald trump held forth on all manner of things this past week as he emerged from a lonely spell over the holidays he opined for more than 90 minutes to the press at the top of a cabinet meeting on the shutdown immigration drug prices the soviet history in afghanistan his approval ratings syria oil prices the nature of walls the attractiveness of his generals better looking than tom cruise and much more he capped the week with a rose garden news conference that stretched for an hour and he s been tweeting a lot trump s accounts did not show tremendous fealty to the facts here s a sampling of what he said the wall trump we ve already built a lot of the wall rose garden news conference friday the facts he hasn t trump s claim is only supported when counting work done under past presidents and ignoring the fact that fences from prior administrations are not the towering walls he promised the 2006 secure fence act has resulted in about 650 miles 1 050 kilometers of border barrier money approved by congress in march 2018 is to pay for 84 miles 135 km but that work is not done trump has achieved some renovation of existing barrier trump the drugs are pouring into this country they don t go through the ports of entry when they do they sometimes get caught rose garden news conference the facts he s wrong in saying drug smugglers don t or only rarely use official border crossings for their trafficking land ports of entry are their primary means for getting drugs into the country not stretches of the border without barriers the u s drug enforcement administration says the agency said in a november report that the most common trafficking technique by transnational criminal organizations is to hide drugs in passenger vehicles or tractor trailers as they drive into the u s though entry ports where they are stopped and subject to inspection they also employ buses cargo trains and tunnels the report says citing smuggling methods that would not be choked off by a border wall trump the new trade deal we have with mexico and canada what we save on that just with mexico will pay for the wall many times over just in a period of a year two years or three years so i view that as absolutely mexico is paying for the wall rose garden news conference the facts mexico is not paying for the wall and nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost trump is assuming a wide variety of economic benefits will come from the agreement but they can t be quantified or counted on for example he said the deal will dissuade some u s companies from moving operations to mexico and he credits that possibility as a payment by mexico for his wall the deal updates the north american free trade agreement in the main preserving nafta s liberalized environment of low or no tariffs among the u s mexico and canada while making certain improvements for each country trump stated inaccurately that it s brand new it s totally different moreover it s not in effect the deal has yet to be ratified in any member country and its chances of winning legislative approval are not assured trump has argued repeatedly that mexico is footing the bill even while insisting on 5 6 billion from the u s treasury to go toward wall construction his demand and the refusal of democrats to satisfy it are behind the budget standoff that has closed parts of the government syria trump we had a fantastic meeting with the generals and the syria situation i mean i m the only person in the history of our country that could really decimate isis say we re bringing the troops back home over a period of time i never said so quickly but over a period of time cabinet meeting wednesday the facts he s wrong about his past statements regarding the pace of withdrawal in a video posted to his twitter account on dec 19 for instance trump said of the roughly 2 000 troops in syria they re all coming back and they re coming back now trump i read when we pull out oh russia is thrilled russia is not happy you know why they re not happy because they like it when we re killing isis because we re killing them for them and we re killing them for assad and we re killing isis also for iran cabinet meeting the facts russia says it s happy a u s withdrawal opens opportunities for moscow and tehran to increase their influence and may help the syrian government survive as a kurdish led opposition force loses its military ally on the ground russian president vladimir putin says the u s has done the right thing in planning to pull out afghanistan trump the reason russia was in afghanistan was because terrorists were going into russia they were right to be there cabinet meeting the facts his assertion that the soviet union was experiencing a terrorist influx from afghanistan when it invaded in 1979 is out of step with history and his belief that the soviets were right to invade is a stark departure from u s and world opinion the soviets were trying to bolster communists in afghanistan and possibly expand their influence against the united states and the west world condemnation was swift the u n general assembly voted 104 18 to deplore the soviet intervention in afghanistan the u s supported the anti communist rebels giving them shoulder fired rockets to down soviet aircraft the soviets withdrew in 1989 trump russia used to be the soviet union afghanistan made it russia because they went bankrupt fighting in afghanistan cabinet meeting the facts afghanistan was far from the sole reason for the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 the dissolution occurred in a time of ethnic and political troubles economic woes and a series of revolutions that led soviet republics to seek their independence the soviet demise was accelerated by the heavy cost of competing with the west to wield influence around the world including in afghanistan oil prices trump do you think it s just luck that gas prices are so low and falling low gas prices are like another tax cut tweet tuesday trump it s not luck it s not luck i called up certain people and i said let that damn oil and gasoline you let it flow the oil it was going up to 125 if that would ve happened then you would ve had a recession depression cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s not all about him or even mostly about him while americans may end up paying somewhat less for gasoline this year trump s suggestion that he deserves all the credit and averted a u s economic depression is an exaggeration oil prices which peaked oct 3 have been generally falling on the realization that u s sanctions against iran would not create a shortage and on fear that a global oversupply of oil will spill into 2019 if slower international economic growth depresses energy demand the president s supposed let it flow edict did not stop opec and its russia led allies from agreeing last month to cut oil production that initially failed to stop oil prices from sliding further they have since rebounded a few dollars in the past week continued opec production cuts would push prices higher trump has pointed to his positive relations with oil exporter saudi arabia as a so called swing producer with the ability to adjust production up or down relatively quickly it can indeed influence the price of crude but the market is complex canada for example is actually the top source of u s oil imports with saudi arabia second tariffs trump the united states treasury has taken in many billions of dollars from the tariffs we are charging china and other countries that have not treated us fairly in the meantime we are doing well in various trade negotiations currently going on tweet thursday the facts trump is off on two major issues first tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries and while trump s many billions might sound like a lot it s doing little to nothing to improve the federal balance sheet the u s government spent 4 1 trillion last fiscal year and the budget deficit shot up according to trump s own treasury department customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 percent of federal spending mattis trump on jim mattis i wish him well i hope he does well but as you know president obama fired him and essentially so did i i want results cabinet meeting wednesday the facts actually mattis resigned as defense secretary in protest over trump s decision to pull u s troops from syria the retired marine general announced on dec 20 in a resignation letter that he was stepping down after trump s decision to withdraw 2 000 u s troops from syria mattis said he would stay on the job until the end of february three days later trump said he was replacing mattis with the second ranking defense official pat shanahan on jan 1 as to the tenure under obama mattis served as commander of the military s central command he departed a few months earlier than expected in 2013 in part because of disagreements over iran drug prices trump i think you re going to see a tremendous reduction in drug prices cabinet meeting wednesday the facts prices continue to rise administration policies announced last year and currently being completed don t seem to have shifted that trend figures on u s prescription drug price changes compiled by health data company elsevier show that from dec 20 through jan 2 there were 1 179 product price changes of those 30 were price cuts and the remaining 1 149 were price increases with 328 of them between 9 percent and 10 percent all but one of the rest were by lower percentages elsevier spokesman chris capot said more companies will be announcing price increases this month separately a data firm whose software can help patients find the most cost effective medications says its information shows price increases on many commonly used drugs for conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes in the first two days of january prices have increased on more than 250 different products said michael rea ceo of rx savings solutions the average increase is about 6 percent he added immigration trump on the number of immigrants living in the u s illegally i used to hear 11 million all the time it would always stay right at 11 i said does it ever increase or go down no it s 11 nobody knows it s probably 30 35 million people they would flow in mostly from the southern border they d come in and nobody would talk about it nobody would do anything about it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s nowhere close to 30 million to 35 million according to his own homeland security secretary as well as independent estimates the nonpartisan pew research center estimates there were 10 7 million immigrants in the u s illegally in 2016 the most recent data available advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates at a house hearing last month homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen acknowledged the number was somewhere between 11 million and 22 million significantly lower than trump s claim of 35 million according to pew the number of immigrants in the u s illegally reached a height of 12 2 million in 2007 representing about 4 percent of the u s population before declining in part because of a weakening u s economy trump the coyotes are using children to gain access into this country they re using these children they re not with families they re using the children they re taking the children and then they dispose of the children after they re done this has been going on for years this isn t unique to us but we want to stop it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts this does happen though it s not as common as trump suggests by talking about it so often he is referring to adults who come with children they falsely claim to be theirs so that they won t be detained under a no child separation policy but such cases of fraud are rare according to the homeland security department about 500 immigrants were found to be not a legitimate family unit and thus separated upon detention from april 19 to sept 30 of last year that s a small fraction of the 107 000 families apprehended in the last budget year which ended sept 30

news national by staff reporter government s promise to avail foreign currency to the country s largest beverages manufacturer delta corporation to avoid forex pricing is not sustainable analysts have said delta last wednesday announced a new pricing system for all its products pegged in united states dollars in a move meant to keep the company afloat in the face of foreign currency shortages in apparent panic government moved to convene a meeting on thursday night well before delta effected its new forex pricing regime on friday economic analysts and business executives said the move by government to interfere in the delta decision to price its products in the us was tantamount to meddling with market forces and would not work economist and ceo forum chief executive kipson gundani contends that government has no role in business and what it did on delta s issue was akin to price control government has no role in business it is the role of business to do business in other words government is controlling the prices of delta products government is going against the market forces history has shown us that such battles are never won gundani said the obvious will happen delta products will disappear and there will be shortages it is common knowledge that government does not have forex they cannot subsidise everything from fuel to beer and drinks that is going against the basic laws of economics the solution offered by government will not work other analysts said authorities feared that had this pricing regime been left to fly the move could have seen more companies joining the bandwagon as most businesses are experiencing the same acute shortage of foreign currency while this seems to have offered a respite to delta s issue the central bank has however been struggling to provide forex for procurement of fuel drugs wheat and bread makers raw materials the apex bank is currently having a headache in providing two million litres of petrol and three million litres of diesel per day with an estimated weekly requirement of 20 million to 25 million delta company secretary alex makamure said on friday as you have seen in the joint statement that it is written that the reserve bank will endeavour to avail forex so it is an endeavour these are promises as you know the country is facing a serious forex supply so we will be working in the framework of that short supply the beverages manufacturer owes 41 million to foreign suppliers and dividends worth 30 million to anheuser busch inbev the world s largest brewer which holds a 40 stake in delta delta s strategic position in this economy is undoubted and authorities must proffer the best sustainable solution to ensure a conducive operating environment mindful of the fact that when bakers increased the bread price to 2 20 last november the central bank promised in vain to up forex allocation to 80 from 35 to lure them to settle at 1 40 seeing that no forex allocation was coming bread makers are now set to increase prices again zimbabwe national chamber of commerce chief executive christopher mugaga said government could reverse delta s move but at its own peril as that would lead to massive job losses it means delta has reached a tipping point on its ability to continue buying forex on the parallel market if government reverses delta s decision it will mean more job losses and a significant cut on all tax heads to government which includes vat excise tax corporate tax and paye he said therefore delta s stance can be interpreted as the beverage industry which is redollarising faster not the firm since delta is a monopoly given the rate of growth and the size of the consumer facing industry in this economy the impact will be transmitted to ordinary citizens whose salaries are still denominated in rtgs balances this delta move could spell more political friction into 2019 as government will be forced to review its interpretation of 1 1 in the coming monetary policy statement delta directly employs 5 000 workers and has in excess of 20 000 indirect customers it is one of the biggest counters on the local bourse and has invested over us 600 million in plant and equipment vehicles and ancillary services since 2009 in the run up to the festive period the company announced that it had shut down its soft drinks manufacturing plant due to shortages of imported raw materials independent economist eddie cross said legally delta could trade in any of the currencies that are a legal tender and the move to block it was going to drive inflation it means that delta will have to increase its prices in rtgs and buy the foreign exchange it needs to service its external liabilities on the open market other companies are already doing that and this is what is driving the inflation cross said according to fbc bank in its weekly snapshot foreign exchange controls are failing to work in zimbabwe and the country should immediately liberalise the foreign exchange market rbz introduced a number of exchange control measures in the economy which includes centralising the allocation of foreign currency for imports on a priority basis adopting the

sound in zimbabwe and these distortions in the market prices must be addressed immediately other analysts said delta s stance which followed a similar move by simbisa brands late december showed that

like a lot it s doing little to nothing to improve the federal balance sheet the u s government spent 4 1 trillion last fiscal year and the budget deficit shot up according to trump s own treasury department customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 percent of federal spending ___ mattis trump on jim mattis i wish him well i hope he does well but as you know president barack obama fired him and essentially so did i i want results cabinet meeting wednesday the facts actually mattis resigned as defense secretary in protest over trump s decision to pull u s troops from syria the retired marine general announced on dec 20 in a resignation letter that he was stepping down after trump s decision to withdraw 2 000 u s troops from syria mattis said he would stay on the job until the end of february three days later trump said he was replacing mattis with the second ranking defense official pat shanahan on jan 1 as to the tenure under obama mattis served as commander of the military s central command he departed a few months earlier than expected in 2013 in part because of disagreements over iran ___ drug prices trump i think you re going to see a tremendous reduction in drug prices cabinet meeting wednesday the facts prices continue to rise administration policies announced last year and currently being completed don t seem to have shifted that trend figures on u s prescription drug price changes compiled by health data company elsevier show that from dec 20 through jan 2 there were 1 179 product price changes of those 30 were price cuts and the remaining 1 149 were price increases with 328 of them between 9 percent and 10 percent all but one of the rest were by lower percentages elsevier spokesman chris capot said more companies will be announcing price increases this month separately a data firm whose software can help patients find the most cost effective medications says its information shows price increases on many commonly used drugs for conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes in the first two days of january prices have increased on more than 250 different products said michael rea ceo of rx savings solutions the average increase is about 6 percent he added ___ immigration trump on the number of immigrants living in the u s illegally i used to hear 11 million all the time it would always stay right at 11 i said does it ever increase or go down no it s 11 nobody knows it s probably 30 35 million people they would flow in mostly from the southern border they d come in and nobody would talk about it nobody would do anything about it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts it s nowhere close to 30 million to 35 million according to his own homeland security secretary as well as independent estimates the nonpartisan pew research center estimates there were 10 7 million immigrants in the u s illegally in 2016 the most recent data available advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates at a house hearing last month homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen acknowledged the number was somewhere between 11 million and 22 million significantly lower than trump s claim of 35 million according to pew the number of immigrants in the u s illegally had reached a height of 12 2 million in 2007 representing about 4 percent of the u s population before declining in part because of a weakening u s economy ___ trump the coyotes are using children to gain access into this country they re using these children they re not with families they re using the children they re taking the children and then they dispose of the children after they re done this has been going on for years this isn t unique to us but we want to stop it cabinet meeting wednesday the facts this does happen though it s not as common as trump suggests by talking about it so often he is referring to adults who come with children they falsely claim to be theirs so that they won t be detained under a no child separation policy but such cases of fraud are rare according to the homeland security department about 500 immigrants were found to be not a legitimate family unit and thus separated upon detention from april 19 to sept 30 of last year that s a small fraction of the 107 000 families apprehended in the last budget year which ended sept 30 ___ associated press writers josh boak michael balsamo colleen long jill colvin ricardo

investors around the world felt tremors from gaping faults in the global economy on christmas eve 2018 american stocks had their worst december performance since 1931 at the time of the great depression the us stock market has thus entered bear territory when stocks have fallen 20 percent or more from a recent high it seems the us stock market will gyrate with much volatility in the new year according to goldman sachs and cnbc it takes stocks an average of 22 months to recover from a bear market joining the united states with the bears are the major bourses of germany china and japan advertisement and according to a cnn report almost half of us chief financial officers surveyed fear a recession in 2019 the immediate trigger is the new regime of rising interest rates the federal reserve or fed or the us central bank hiked the benchmark rates four times in 2018 that s nine increases since december 2015 two more are due in 2019 the fed s intent is to prevent overheating of the us economy and to normalize interest rates from the lows of the past years for the fed had set the rates near zero in response to the great recession of 2008 2009 add to that yields on the 10 year treasury bonds have risen to their highest levels in seven years this is likely due to fears of inflation all these rate hikes will curb spending families will be less willing to borrow as higher rates hit auto loans and adjustable mortgages firms will be investing less and interest payments will eat into their profit margins the stock market is volatile too as investors shift from stocks to bonds the latter have become more attractive due to their higher yields the regime of higher interest rates will be burdensome for the global economy because of the mess in debt advertisement for the world as a whole the total household corporate and government debt is 247 2 trillion in the first quarter of 2018 that equals 318 percent of global gross domestic product or gdp says the institute of international finance the sum is way over the 177 8 trillion in the first quarter of 2008 before the great recession struck the united states the largest economy on earth is highly indebted and this covers consumers firms the federal government and state governments household debt alone in the united states is around 15 trillion then there is the debt trouble of argentina pakistan turkey and venezuela they all have large debts denominated in us dollars higher interest rates in the united states lead to a stronger dollar i e weaker local currencies hence their dollar debts have become more expensive china deserves special attention because it is the world s second largest economy according to pantheon macroeconomics chinese debt of all kinds amounts to 320 percent of its gdp this was fueled by the state s policy to provide cheap loans to its agencies and select industries and it has a large shadow banking industry china s debt is now much larger than it was 10 years ago china s growth has been slowing its growth of 6 5 percent in the third quarter while high by international standards was below expectations its stock market is shaken both the shanghai composite index and that of shenzhen have sunk to bear levels they have fallen at least 20 percent from their latest peaks the asian giant is also hit by the trade war unleashed by us president donald trump the united states has slapped tariffs on 250 billion in chinese goods while china has hit back with tariffs on 110 billion of american goods higher tariffs make imports cost more and stoke inflation china s slump is affecting the world as the nation is the second largest economy on earth it imports much in crude oil metals and various raw materials because of sliding demand prices of high grade copper which is used for buildings and electronics have been falling in five of the past six months automotive build rates are depressed significantly as well if a big global recession hits countries will likely reply by lowering interest rates or ramping up government spending the problem is they are running out of ammunition despite the interest hikes in the united states rates are still low the benchmark rate is only 2 5 percent and won t likely reach 3 percent until the close of 2019 that s way below the 5 25 percent before the previous crisis struck the european central bank has not yet raised its rates and japan s rates are negative so lowering interest rates will not work for rates already low meanwhile boosting government spending will also be hard due to the grave debt burden

by col rtd dr kizza besigye this write up has been prompted by repeated misinformation and blame game by mr museveni on uganda s chronic energy crisis this has been especially in an attempt to explain the very long delay in completing the bujagali dam project it s important however to look at the whole energy sector because this is the heart of a country s economic growth the sector has had major problems both at the policy and the implementation levels there was no energy policy at all between 1986 and 2002 government only depended on annual policy statements made by the minister to accompany budget estimates the renewable energy policy that encompasses our most vital resources was only made in 2007 this is the policy that deals with river dams solar biomass agriculture and forestry products underground heat geothermal wind and peat accumulation of partially decayed vegetation for 20 years there was no policy the energy policy of 2002 and the renewable energy policy 2007 are themselves significantly deficient in some parts and quite misdirected in others however i have no intention of delving into that now the power sector was fundamentally reformed and largely privatised under the electricity act 1999 before there was any form of energy policy this of course has been the standard practice of the cart pulling the horse this was the law that facilitated the government to hand over the power sector to foreign government bodies under the guise of privatisation it is noteworthy that this colossal government failure occurred at a time when there was no political opposition in parliament when for most part the president was the executive and speaker of parliament the biggest failure and sabotage of the energy sector however was in the conception misconception and implementation of power projects the subversion and corruption evidenced in this sector vividly display mr museveni and his regime s unpatriotic and perfidious intentions uganda s energy resource apart from hydroelectric power and biomass uganda has vast renewable energy resources in the form of solar geothermal and wind these also happen to be the most environmentally friendly sources of energy unfortunately up to now no evaluation of these resources has been done by 2011 kenya was already harnessing 280mw of geothermal power far more than the famed bujagali dam what is more kenya s geothermal output is expected to grow to 800mw by 2018 power projects owen falls nalubaale dam was the first power project it was commissioned progressively from 1954 to 1968 when 10 units had been installed with a total capacity of 150mw the project cost at the time was estimated at 63 million this was at a time when uganda s population was only six million over the turbulent years output of the dam collapsed from the initial 150mw to about 60mw the second power project constituted the rehabilitation of the owen falls dam up rating its capacity from the original 150mw to 180mw rehabilitation of the transmission and distribution lines and capacity building for the defunct ueb the project was approved in march 1985 and the project cost was 73 4 million this is the project that was undertaken during the first years of the nrm regime there is very little information regarding the implementation of this project save for the fact that it s reported to have been completed ten years later in 1996 the third project was initiated under the nrm regime it had three main objectives namely improving the safety of the existing owen falls dam nalubaale expanding power generation by building another dam 1km from the owen falls dam with a capacity of 102mw later changed to 200mw and capacity building for uganda electricity board ueb the planned project cost was 300 million and the project was launched in 1991 an appraisal that was undertaken before the project was started showed that there was a critical risk to the project from low water levels of lake victoria this was tragically ignored government minister hilary onek has also publically stated that he advised government about the water level risk and the advice was ignored gibbs company who designed the owen falls dam 1948 and a british aid agency kennedy and donkin all advised that the extension of the project was not economically justified because of the low water levels it s worth noting that a firm acres of canada which did the feasibility detailed engineering and construction supervision of the project didn t go through competitive bidding it was another bedroom appointment in spite of all the concerns expressed about the low lake water levels the original design of installing four turbines of 34mw each total of 102mw was changed to five turbines of 40mw each total 200mw eventually only three out of the planned five 40mw turbines were installed financed by norway due to the low water levels only two of the three installed turbines were commissioned the third is being used as a transformer for a private jinja thermal plant a company sietco from china which was potentially unqualified and had presented easily verifiable false information was awarded the tender to do the construction civil work the firm didn t have money or technical competence to do the work this was eventually terminated the re bidding process resulted in a four year delay of the project and an additional expenditure of 26 million the project was based on a plan to increase the price of electricity to levels that were clearly unrealistic for the market to bear electricity price was supposed to be doubled immediately 1991 to 4 8 cents unit to be trebled to 7 2 cents unit by january 1993 thereafter it was supposed to increase 5 per year from 1994 till a price of 15 cents unit between 1991 and 1993 the price of electricity for a typical consumer increased from shs 10 per unit to shs 86 per unit because of the changed rate and the fluctuating dollar price the government of uganda signed onto these conditions well knowing that its citizens were among the poorest human beings on earth and that power was vital for human and economic development as a result by 1994 less than 25 of all the ueb bills were paid for between 1991 and 1997 unpaid electricity bills accumulated to shs 71 billion 6 m at the time this spelt doom for ueb and provided the justification for winding it up in spite of increasing electricity prices eight times and getting government capitalization of us 40 million ueb could not meet its debt servicing under the 1999 electricity act that restructured the power sector ueb was divided into three companies for power generation there was the uganda electricity generation company limited uegcl for generating power the uganda electricity transmission company limited uetcl for transmission and the uganda electricity distribution company limited uedcl for distribution eskom a south african government company leased the asserts of uegcl for 20 years with a power purchase agreement ppa that compels the only uganda government owned company uetcl to purchase all power supplied by eskom irrespective of the lake victoria water levels eskom together with a uk company formed the company known as umeme umeme has since entered into dubious agreements with government that have already caused a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars to uganda since their takeover the net effect of the third project was the following that out of the 380mw capacity developed at nalubaale owen 180mw and kiira dams 200mw the actual power output of the two dams now managed by a foreign company is less than 100mw this means that the kiira dam investment was a disastrous waste lake victoria water levels have fallen to disastrous levels the meteoric rise in the price of electricity to levels that is unaffordable by most people an independent evaluation group of the world bank main funder carried out in 2008 concluded that the outcome of the project implemented over a 10 year period was rated as unsatisfactory the second poorest rating the winding up of ueb and handing over the strategic power sector to foreign control the low power output at nalubaale and kiira dams led to a high shortage of electricity that prompted the contracting of thermal power diesel engine generators companies this caused a further rise in the price of electricity the rise was so high that government had to subsidise consumers from taxpayers money it is estimated that government subsidy has been about 100 million per year although about 5 of the population consumes electricity this is a direct contribution to growth of poverty foreign companies that took over electricity generation and distribution sales employ experts from their countries undermining the development of domestic expertise mr museveni blames opposition mps for the country s energy problems saying they delayed the implementation of the bujagali dam project before moving on to bujagali can mr museveni or anyone in government inform ugandans who was responsible for the above disastrous developments and what action was taken on them bujagali dam project the bujagali dam project was a total fiasco the epitome of nrm regime s corruption and incompetence the country will bleed from its effects for very many years the project was conceived around 1994 as a public government private partnership ppp in february 1996 government awarded and signed a contract with aes nile power ltd without competitive bidding with the project cost of 450 million as usual mr museveni was central in negotiating the deal the contract included a power purchase agreement ppa that committed uganda government to buy all the power to be produced at an agreed price these agreements were a tightly guarded secret between government and aes nile power ltd all efforts by civil society organisations and parliament to gain access to these agreements were rejected by government aes nile power then embarked on mobilising the necessary funding for the project meantime in december 1996 aes nile power adjusted the contract sum upwards to us 530 million to which the uganda government agreed right from the award of the contract many local and international environmental ngos presented serious concerns to the government worried about the negative impact of the project the following were their main concerns the environmental cost was too high this included the dangers of over draining lake victoria absence of a cumulative impact assessment of the cascade of dams especially since no environmental impact assessment was done for the second power project destruction of the unique cascading bujagali falls that was a national treasure for tourism among others and destruction of habitats for fish and birds with a serious impact on river nile fisheries nalubaale owen falls dam posed a potent threat to the proposed bujagali dam because its projected lifespan had expired and it was known to be heavily cracked a company of uk divers were contracted to assess the dam s safety but the report was kept secret if nalubaale collapsed the boulders and water released would wipe out the nearby bujagali dam down the river neglect of other sources of energy the bloated project had the effect of stifling development of viable renewable energy options lack of cost benefit analysis generation of power at any cost cannot be uganda s pursuit some observed that bujagali dam was a costly white elephant that increased the nation s debt load and produced little power that few ugandans could afford the ppa between uganda and aes nile power ltd was a closely guarded secret again this made it difficult to ascertain the impact of the dam on uganda s economy it is these ngos concerns that attracted the attention and involvement of mps whom mr museveni has been aggressively and incessantly blaming for uganda s power crisis it ought to be clearly understood however that the involvement of the mps didn t at all occasion the delay of the bujagali dam project three developments caused the delay of bujagali dam namely in 2002 a corruption bribery scandal broke out where aes nile power ltd officials were alleged to have corruptly influenced government officials this led to an investigation by the us justice department based on us foreign corrupt practices act and the world bank fraud and corruption unit the world bank financing was withheld from mid 2002 pending the outcome of the corruption investigations consequently dam construction was suspended in june 2003 two construction firms on the project veidekke and skanska pulled out citing bribery and environmental controversies as the problems in uganda were ongoing aes corp the main shareholder of aes nile power developed problems leading to a drastic collapse of its share value in august 2003 aes corp announced that it was discontinuing the construction and development of aes nile power project in uganda aes wrote off 75 million that it had already invested in bujagali project in june 2002 world bank s independent investigative unit found that the bujagali project violated five operational policies of the bank in november 2002 after the suspension of the project the high court made a historic ruling which declared the ppa a public document and forced the government to make it public an independent review of the ppa between uganda government and aes nile power ltd was carried out after the forced release by prayas energy group the review determined that the project cost was inflated more than double the agreement would make the ugandan people pay 20 40 million extra per year compared to similar projects in other parts of the world the 2003 pull out of the project by aes was therefore a blessing for uganda short lived as it turned out to be bujagali dam was re bidded in 2005 a consortium led by industrial promotions services ips a holding company of the aga khan was awarded the contract ahead of three other consortia it was reported that ips lagged behind the others at the technical evaluation mr museveni and state house were again very involved in deciding the contract award the project partners ips sithe global power usa and the government set up a new company bujagali energy ltd bel to operate and run the project ips and bel signed a power purchase agreement ppa and an implementation agreement with government uegcl respectively these agreements were signed before parliament approved the government s obligation as required by law the project cost was put at 860 million the government advanced bel 90 million to kick start the project the project also inherited the 75million asserts forfeited by defunct aes nile power ltd construction work resumed in 2007 and was planned to be completed in three years the bujagali power project was inaugurated in october 2012 16 years after the initial contract was signed at the inauguration mr nazir juma the chairman of bel reported that the total project cost was 902 million the investigation by a parliamentary ad hoc committee on energy chaired by bududa south jacob oboth oboth showed that the actual cost of the dam project was 1 3 billion the committee recommended a forensic audit of the project bujagali dam even at the official 902 million is the most expensive dam in the world today construction of hydropower plants in africa and other continents cost between 1 0 1 7 per mw capacity bujagali at the officially declared project cost stands at 3 6 per mw if the parliamentary committee findings are correct this will go up to 5 2 per mw worse still whereas the installed capacity of bujagali dam is 250mw due to the low water levels that were known to obtain the actual output of the dam since inauguration has not exceeded 130mw on average the total power generated by the three dams today is just a little more than what the upgraded nalubaale owen falls dam produced yet it s ten times more expensive and the country is saddled with debts from the white elephant projects this is the latest scandal whose extent is still unfolding karuma dam project is supposed to generate 600mw of power it was conceived in the mid 1990s and has been on the drawing board since corruption allegations started even as the project was being drawn up it may be recalled that a norwegian company that had interest in getting the karuma contract allegedly paid a ugandan senior government official a 10 000 bribe karuma dam the bids for karuma dam were eventually invited in august 2010 eight major bidders were shortlisted all the others except three companies two chinese and one iranian were eliminated at the pre qualification stage immediately after this allegations of bribery started they were first published in the east african newspaper it was alleged that the contracts evaluation committee received 1 2 million from the chinese since then court injunctions official investigations court cancellation and repetition of the evaluation process have crippled the procurement process in march 2013 the igg recommended and government has accepted that the project should be re tendered nearly three years on no contractor has been selected in a daily monitor story of april 15 2013 mr museveni is reported to have informed his cabinet that some of his ministers were demanding for a 200 million bribe from a chinese firm aspiring to win the karuma power dam construction contract it has also been reported that mr museveni has now personally taken over the procurement process to fast track it yes hold your breath conclusion theft corruption and dysfunctional government systems and institutions in the energy sector are responsible for the power crisis in uganda mr museveni state house s hand is pervasive in all the project scandals the ugandan people are and will continue paying heavily for the mega scandals in the energy sector this is clearly one of the most disempowering and impoverishing failures betrayals of the museveni regime less than 5 of the population has access to electricity due to the high cost and a very tiny distribution network there s no end in sight to the power crisis in uganda unless a more accountable transparent and patriotic government takes charge what is presented here regarding the energy sector is certainly replicated in all sectors of government this is why roads in uganda are the most expensive to construct and take forever to complete yet they disintegrate in a very short time this is why uganda railways collapsed ict development is poorest in the region water dam reservoirs for dry areas of uganda remain a fantasy this is why in spite of being in government for nearly 30 years and uncountable money spent all social services are in shambles agriculture has collapsed ugandans have no national ids etc recommendations accordingly recommendations need to target the pervasive failures theft and corruption subversion and dysfunction of government and those that have colluded and abated its crimes the following measures are recommended parliament should urgently institute a formal and public inquiry into the grave and glaring cases of corruption abuse of office and misconduct in the implementation of the power projects in uganda the auditor general should carry out a forensic audit of all the power projects parliament should initiate a probe into the role of the world bank and associated institutions in supporting dubious projects that enslave ugandans to paying huge debt burdens where these lenders have acted imprudently or illegally a case should be made for non payment of their loans mps should revive the impeachment proceedings against the president under article 107 a and b they should start by drawing up the many very clear and incontrovertible charges of abuse of office and misconduct including acts of commission and omission as provided for in the constitution unless the mafia like network in government is completely purged the misery of ugandans can only intensify let all ugandans who are informed rally other citizens to say that enough is enough and to demand a better government share this facebook x whatsapp linkedin related
the year 1929 was the beginning of what is now known as the great depression a period of prolonged economic stagnation worldwide that was triggered by the american stock market crash of october 1928 between 1929 and 1933 the global gross domestic product gdp had plunged by 15 per cent and the economic stagnation continued till 1940 or until 1946 depending on how we choose to view gdp itself bulk of the addition to the gdp post 1940 was wartime goods production which neither had a market pricing nor any consumer utility most objective measurements showed a declining standard of living until 1946 as i see it we are set for a repeat of the great depression worse in many ways as i will explain in the years ahead whether it starts in 2019 or a bit later is something that is hard to predict but all the ingredients of a volatile cauldron are already in place an extraordinarily lax monetary policy for more than a decade especially in the us europe and japan simultaneous bubbles in a variety of asset classes equities bonds and real estate untenable public and private leverage within the system government spending that is simply out of control worldwide and a generally clueless population about the prosperity foundational axioms of individual liberty limited government and sound money over the course of this article i am drawing upon the teachings of adam smith von mises and murray rothbard their writings on free markets and its invisible hand economic business cycles interest rates and central banking form the backbone of austrian economics and that s what i have used to draw my inferences recession 101 let me start with what a recession is as that s one of the most misunderstood topics in economics a recession is a cure to the malinvestments made during an economic boom to redirect resources to the parts of the economy where it is needed and away from the overheated bubble sectors while booms and busts are inherent in almost all economic activity the frequency as well as the amplitude are accentuated by the effects of central banking and cheap money there is usually a multiplicity of factors that is associated with the formation of bubbles but the one necessary and perhaps even sufficient condition is loose monetary policy the rest are just the bells and whistles the common thread behind the seemingly disparate bubbles the 2000 nasdaq bubble 2008 housing bubble and the 2019 20 currency bubble we will get to this later is a loose monetary policy the bubbles also tend to get bigger with time just on account of the increased amount of money and credit circulating within the system consequently the inevitable bursts also tend to be more devastating in its consequences perhaps much more importantly the so called corrective actions taken by central banks to mitigate the effects of the bubble burst lay the foundation of the next bubble so the nasdaq 2000 bubble burst and the maestro alan greenspan leaving interest rates at 1 per cent for a few years pretty much caused the 2008 housing bubble if a few years of 1 per cent interest rates could cause the 2008 crisis just imagine what nearly a decade of zirp zero interest rate policy and qe quantitative easing are going to cause when the current all but commodities bubble bursts the year 2008 is going to look like the proverbial sunday school picnic what should the government really do in a recession actually nothing just allow the malinvestments to be liquidated in the markets as andrew mellon the treasury secretary during 1929 advised liquidate labour liquidate stocks liquidate the farmers liquidate real estate it will purge the rottenness out of the system needless to add it was completely ignored by the then supposedly free markets oriented herbert hoover the only legitimate actions that a government should undertake during recessions would be to deregulate cut taxes and reduce government spending to free up capital for private investments a good historical account of such a laissez faire approach and the results thereof can be understood from jim grant s the forgotten depression 1921 the crash that cured itself the current solution of a fiscal stimulus is pure keynesian snake oil that just postpones the day of reckoning while compounding the problems at the same time a good metaphor that can be used to understand recession is that of a drug addict on an artificial high and the withdrawal symptoms while trying to quit the habit the equivalent of the drug is the central bank sponsored cheap money the highs are the asset price booms and the withdrawal symptoms are the equivalent of a market induced recession it s just a necessary cure to clear the system what caused the great depression most of what is popularly believed about the causes of the great depression is just plainly wrong in fact they are deliberately falsified versions of economic history for governments to absolve themselves of the blame and provide a justification to usurp greater powers interested readers can read the murray rothbard classic america s great depression to understand the details summarising the propaganda it is that the stock market crash of october 1928 was a normal business cycle downturn what made the downturn a prolonged major depression was a passive deflationary monetary policy and a laissez faire attitude of the herbert hoover government as ben bernanke summarised in a 2002 lecture in honour of milton friedman regarding the great depression you re right we did it we re very sorry but thanks to you we won t do it again there s remarkable agreement amongst the keynesians and the monetarists on this issue am i saying that bernanke is deliberately lying on the causes of the great depression i wouldn t be surprised if that were indeed to be the case but perhaps a more systemic rationale for such explanations is that the economists who are appointed to positions of power and influence are the useful idiots but as rothbard explains the truth is very different the us fed blew up a stock market bubble during the roaring twenties when the bubble burst as all bubbles eventually do hoover and later franklin roosevelt repeatedly intervened in the market with all kinds of actions including wage and price controls the new deal confiscation of gold and destruction of output to artificially raise food prices the us fed did indeed play a relatively passive role as they should have but the depression was eventually blamed on the deflation the economic truth however is that the deflation made the depression a lot more tolerable than would have been otherwise since most people associate deflations with depressions i should point out that the entire nineteenth century in which the us when it rose from a backward agrarian society to an industrial powerhouse was deflationary the gold standard that produces one of the remarkable objectives of growth with reducing inequalities is deflationary almost by definition the crisis ahead the nature of the crisis that lies ahead for the us economy is quite unlike what we have witnessed in the last few decades at least in a developed economy the bubbles will burst equity bond and real estate and there is some evidence that this process may already have begun in the last few weeks but what prevents the us fed from undertaking another round of qes and zirp to blow some air back into these bubbles perhaps just an increased quantity of qe should do the trick this time around also there doesn t seem to be any major side effects to these qes anyway in the form of inflation why can t jerome powell do just what donald trump suggested and focus on growth firstly i have very little doubts that both the interest rates hikes as well as the current qt quantitative tightening programme will be reversed by the us fed very soon the first signs of recession should be obvious even to the fed early next year and by the middle of 2019 we should well be into the process of returning to zirp as well as qes but unlike the first rounds of qe the effects on asset classes are going to be very different this time around why so as jens o parsson describes in his book dying of money everyone loves an early inflation the effects at the beginning of inflation are all good there is steepened money expansion rising government spending increased government budget deficits booming stock markets and spectacular prosperity all in the midst of temporary stable prices everyone benefits and no one pays which is pretty much what happened from 2008 to 2018 all of the inflation created by the central banks went directly into the good assets of equities bonds and real estate the result of the qes and zirp was one big fat ugly bubble as candidate trump correctly identified as shown in the graph below the valuations of equities is so extreme that on a relative basis commodities are cheaper today than in 1971
the psei started 2019 with a bang rallying by a total of 3 9 percent during the first three trading days of the year the market s strong performance came as a surprise to many because aside from the better than expected philippine inflation report for december news reports from outside the country were largely negative in fact there are increasing signs that global economic growth is slowing down which normally isn t good for the equities markets for example in late december the us fed raised rates by another 25 basis points despite the disappointing performance of the us stock market advertisement on tuesday a survey showed that china s manufacturing sector contracted for the first time in 19 months last december amid a trade war with the united states although analysts were already expecting the manufacturing sector to weaken the survey result was worse than expected the us government also remains in a partial shutdown as president trump refuses to sign any spending package that does not include a budget for a border wall ironically though the growing risk of slower global economic growth turned into an opportunity for emerging markets such as the philippines because of the increasing likelihood of slower global economic growth prices of commodities including oil fell steeply from a peak of more than 70 a barrel in october oil is currently trading at less than 50 a barrel the drop in oil prices is good for the philippines because it frees up income for consumers allowing them to spend money on other goods lower oil price is also favorable to the government enabling it to increase excise taxes on oil without pushing up inflation this in turn should help the government generate more revenue to fund its infrastructure spending programs lower oil and commodity prices should also benefit the private sector as it reduces the cost of doing business helping boost profits the likelihood of slower economic growth in the united states resulted in the significant decline in the us 10 year bond rate from a peak of over 3 2 percent in october the 10 year bond yield is now down to 2 7 percent the dollar has also stopped strengthening after rising steadily for the most of 2018 a weaker dollar and a lower us bond yield should benefit the philippine economy as these should help the peso and domestic interest rates remain stable despite our government s rising budget deficit and the country s widening current account deficit this should prevent a repeat of what happened to the peso and domestic interest rates in 2018 the increasing likelihood of slower global economic growth also increases the possibility that the us fed and the central banks of other developed economies would stop raising rates and put on hold their plans to end their quantitative easing programs this in turn should put an end to the fund outflow that was responsible for the steep sell off of emerging markets in 2018 advertisement although slower global economic growth is logically not good for any country including the philippines the main reason why our stock market is rallying is because investors were bracing for something even worse as implied by depressed valuations of stocks now that numerous risk factors have abated there is room for prices to go back to more normalized levels
while still twisted in an ugly way the us treasury curve flattened out somewhat as the yield on us 10 year treasuries rallied 11 basis points in response to interest rate markets unwinding bets of a fed rate cut in 2019 gold and the yen pulled back on diminished haven demand while emerging markets currencies and their key proxy the australian dollar went on a tear 5 asx spi futures are indicating a very solid 69 point jump for the asx200 this morning according to that contract s last traded price despite being wedged between the dual global concerns of slower global growth and tighter global financial conditions the australian share market has shown resilience recently aside from a temporary tumble on thin liquidity prior to christmas to new multi year lows the asx200 has more or less traded range bound between 5500 5700 for the last month our share market hasn t quite seen the high octane activity lately that wall street has with volumes below average and swings in price action only really spurred by sentiment from us markets there are general signs of consolidation occurring in the index however a break in either direction particularly upon the return of normal trading conditions appears imminent 6 us china trade talks the fortunes of the asx200 on a macro scale will be dictated first by us markets then by the outlook for china the economic calendar presents as quite thin to begin the week providing traders of riskier assets room to manoeuvre if the newswires remain clear of outside noise the primary focus for now will be on the mid level trade talks due to begin between the us and china today major breakthroughs are unlikely in the absence of each nation s heavy hitter but the communications coming out of this week s talks will be crucial evidence is mounting that the trade war is starting to bite exacerbating existing economic challenges for both sides market participants will be hungry for indications that an urgency amongst policymakers is building now to resolve it 7 the markets balancing act where markets head from here remains uncertain volatility will continue to show up this week and throughout the rest of january an easing of fears regarding the state of us economic growth is helpful but it throws up the paradox strong growth implies likely tighter monetary policy which is bad for stocks and riskier assets weak growth implies the possibility of a recession which is bad for stocks and riskier assets there is a middle way as there often is between both poles within which the fed must traverse they may well do just that and keep this bull market afloat in doing so there will be missteps along the way though meaning as has often been said fear and subsequent volatility will spike as market conditions evolve 8 market watch spi futures up 69 points or 1 2 to 5631 as of 9am aedt saturday aud 1 5 to 71 13 us cents on wall st dow 3 3 s p 500 3 4 nasdaq 4 3 in new york bhp 6 1 rio 5 6 atlassian 3 1 in europe stoxx 50 3 ftse 2 2 cac 2 7 dax 3 4 spot gold 0 6 to us1286 05 an ounce at 5pm friday new york time brent crude 2 to us57 06 a barrel us oil 1 9 to us47 96 a barrel iron ore 0 7 to us73 10 a tonne dalian iron ore 0 5 to 508 yuan lme aluminium 1 6 to us1865 a tonne lme copper 3 2 to us5918 a tonne 2 year yield us 2 49 australia 1 79 5 year yield us 2 50 australia 1 93 10 year yield us 2 67 australia 2 23 germany 0 2 us australia 10 year yield gap as of 9am aedt saturday 44 basis points this column was produced in commercial partnership between fairfax media and ig
the prices of soft commodities can be highly volatile as they often double triple or halve in value during their pricing cycles the path of least resistance for the prices of the luxury commodities is a function of the weather and crop diseases in the critical growing areas around the world however the demand side of the fundamental equation supplies an ever increasing addressable market for these products as the population of the world is growing by around twenty million people each quarter since 2000 the number of people inhabiting our planet has increased by over 25 which amounts to over 1 5 billion people more people with more money consume more coffee cocoa sugar cotton and orange juice each day which underpins support for these commodities the composite of five soft commodities sugar coffee cocoa cotton and frozen concentrated orange posted two straight years of gains in 2015 and 2016 at the end of 2017 soft commodities were down just 2 25 on the year in q4 the sector moved 2 23 higher and finished 2018 with a loss of 5 68 as of the close of business on december 31 2018 gluts in markets trade issues when it comes to tariffs and subsidies that distort supply and demand fundamentals and currency movements all lined up to create a year of lower prices for the sector however while coffee and sugar posted double digit percentage losses in 2018 cocoa gained over 27 on the year cotton and fcoj prices moved to the downside compared to their prices at the end of 2017 the dollar index moved 1 05 higher in q4 and was 4 26 higher in 2018 the dollar moved considerably higher against the brazilian real in 2018 brazil is the world s leading producer of three of the five commodities in the sector including sugar coffee and oranges the inverse historical relationship between raw material prices and the u s currency weighed on the sector the dollar is the reserve currency of the world and the benchmark pricing mechanism for most commodities including those of the soft or tropical variety the price of sugar recovered by over 15 during the three month period while coffee lost only 0 59 of its value cocoa was just under 17 5 higher cotton fell by 5 9 while fcoj lost just over 15 coffee and sugar fell to their lowest prices in a decade or longer in september but both recovered from the lows like all agricultural commodities demographics continue to provide an ever increasing base of support for these food products in q4 the world added approximately twenty million people to the global population with wealth rising in the world s most populous county china competition for food continues to increase which puts a strain on supplies as we head into 2019 it will be the weather and crop issues that determine the path of least resistance of prices as demand will continue to favor higher lows however the impact of demand can be slow and steady while supply gluts or deficits tend to shock markets and cause the most significant price moves on both the up and the downside while there are etf etn products for four of the five soft commodities the invesco db agriculture product nysearca dba includes an almost 17 exposure to the three most active in the sector as it holds positions in sugar coffee and cocoa futures contracts sugar review and outlook sugar was 28 02 higher in 2016 and gained 4 96 in 2015 in 2017 the price of sugar lost a total of 22 3 of its value sugar traded in a range of 9 88 to 15 37 cents in 2018 with the low coming at the end of q3 ample supplies of sugar had caused the commodity to make a series of lower highs and lower lows from 2011 through august 2015 when the sweet commodity traded down to 10 13 cents per pound sugar then proceeded to rally making a series of higher lows and higher highs culminating with the highs in late september 2016 at 23 90 cents per pound from late 2016 through the end of september 2018 the sweet commodity moved lower making a series of lower lows reaching a bottom at 9 83 cents per pound on the nearby ice world sugar futures contract in late september as the nearby ice futures contract was expiring in q4 the price of the sweet commodity recovered nearby sugar futures that trade on the ice settled on december 31 at 12 03 cents per pound sugar appreciated by 15 45 in q4 but was 20 65 lower in 2018 compared to the closing price at the end of 2017 sugar traded to the lowest level since q2 in 2008 when it found a bottom at 9 44 cents per pound the low in q3 was at 9 83 cents per pound sugar prices traded as high as 36 cents per pound in february 2011 in countries like the us and the eu the price of sugar is subsidized by the government however the major sugarcane producers brazil thailand and india sell their crops at world market prices even in these countries the government occasionally adopts policies to support sugar producers in brazil the weakness of their currency the real throughout 2018 contributed to a lower sugar price brazilian producers were dumping sugar into a falling market in dollar terms but as the real moved lower the price of sugar in brazilian currency had done much better at the same time lower energy prices decreased demand for biofuels and in brazil ethanol production comes from sugar cane ethanol fell to a new record low at under 1 20 per gallon in q4 the level of the real against the dollar began to recover in late september and sugar caught a bid at the same time crude oil fell from a new high at 76 90 per barrel on october 3 to under 42 36 in late december which was not bullish for the price of sugar after five straight years of surplus conditions the sugar market went into a small deficit in 2015 2016 and that imbalance had increased in the 2016 2017 crop year the price of sugar rose to 23 90 cents per pound in october 2016 which was the peak the higher price caused an increase in production and the deficit turned into a surplus in the sugar market which weighed on the price throughout 2017 and much of 2018 at the same time the brazilian real declined against the u s dollar in 2018 falling from 0 32 to under the 0 24 level which put additional pressure on the sugar price however the bounce in the real was one of the leading reasons that sugar recovered and posted an over 15 gain in q4 source cqg as the chart of the brazilian currency against the dollar shows the real plunged from 0 32 against the dollar in late january of this year to a low of 0 23725 in q3 the plunge in the value of the currency that is the world s leading producer and exporter of free market sugarcane caused the domestic price to remain stable or even rise as the dollar based price declined brazil was able to sell sugar into the market regardless of the low price for the soft commodity which added pressure to the price and sent sugar to a low of 9 83 cents in late september in q4 the real recovered to a high at 0 27880 in late october as a far right wing and anti corruption leader won the presidency the election of jair bolsonaro led to a rebound in the currency against the dollar which provided additional support for the sweet commodity and drove the price to a high at 14 24 cents per pound during q4 the real ran into selling at the highs as the market is now waiting to see if the new leader follows through on his promises from the campaign trail the real declined from the high to the 0 2570 level at the end of the year which pushed the price of nearby ice sugar futures to the 12 cents per pound level sugar production from india and brazil a falling brazilian real and increased output from other producing nations had created a perfect bearish storm for the sweet commodity throughout much of 2018 however prices fell to a level that turned out to be unsustainable on the downside below the 10 cents per pound level in q3 leading to the recovery in q4 source cqg the quarterly chart of ice sugar futures shows that since sugar fell to a low of 2 29 cents per pound back in 1985 the price had made higher lows during periods of oversupply in 1985 there were 4 85 billion people on the earth and at the end of q4 2018 that number stands at over 7 54 billion an increase of over 55 5 over the past thirty three years the number of people on our planet has increased exponentially over the past three decades which has increased demand for all agricultural commodities and sugar is no exception the quarterly chart remains in a downward sloping trend when it comes to price momentum but is heading for oversold territory weather conditions in primary growing regions around the world have created more than enough sugar to satisfy global demand which sent the price to the lowest level in more than a decade however the falling brazilian currency and increased indian subsidies helped sugar move lower in 2018 subsidies and tariffs tend to distort commodities prices as they interfere with supply and demand fundamentals economic theory teaches that commodities flow from those producers with the lowest output costs to consumers around the world those producers whose cost of output is above the price buyers are willing to pay do not survive when prices fall to a level where production declines inventories begin to fall in response to growing demand demand typically increases at lower prices which leads to a decline in inventories when output slows the price action in q3 and rebound in q4 are signs that sugar reached the bottom of its pricing cycle which lead to its recovery meanwhile production subsidies or tariffs interfere with the fundamentals of efficient markets therefore supply and demand analysis become challenging in markets where governments support businesses that are losing money or where they restrict the flow of goods around the world the indian subsidies had created an environment where a government sponsored glut of sugar was flooding the world market and weighing on the price which is an unsustainable situation when government subsidized products flood international markets they damage economic conditions in other nations where governments do not provide aid to producers the current trade issues between the u s and trading partners around the world are an attempt to address this situation and create a level playing field where the most efficient producers can sell to the consumers willing to pay the most the most significant issue when it comes to trade is the dumping or selling subsidized products in markets that make domestic output or manufactured products uncompetitive as we move forward into 2019 technical support for sugar stands at 9 83 cents and 9 44 cents per pound with resistance at 14 24 and 15 49 cents per pound i continue to believe that sugar is a lot closer to the bottom end of its pricing cycle as we head into 2019 and risk reward favors higher prices coffee review and outlook coffee was the number one the best performing commodity of 2014 registering a gain of 43 19 in 2015 it was the worst performing soft commodity coffee futures fell 23 95 in 2015 but recovered by 8 17 in 2016 in 2017 the price of coffee moved 7 92 lower q1 brought more of the same for the java market as the price slipped 6 38 and in q2 it fell another 5 63 and in q3 the coffee futures market added to losses falling another 8 12 in q4 coffee continued to slip despite a brief recovery as it posted a loss of 0 59 for the final three months of the year the price of coffee moved 19 29 lower in 2018 nearby ice coffee futures closed on december 31 2018 at 1 0185 per pound the price range in 2018 was 0 92 on the lows to 1 3135 on the highs coffee did not move outside of the trading range in q4 coffee has been making lower highs and lower lows since november 2016 when the price peaked at 1 7600 per pound source cqg the weekly chart highlights that coffee futures have been in a bear market since november 2016 in q4 2018 coffee violated the pattern of lower highs and lower lows as the price rose to 1 2550 and above a level of technical resistance at the early june high at 1 2495 before turning lower once again meanwhile price momentum on the weekly chart was falling in oversold territory at the end of 2018 coffee is a highly volatile agricultural commodity the demand side of the fundamental equation in the coffee market is compelling based on the ever increasing addressable market however the price pressure has come from a glut of supplies and a weakening currency in the world s leading producer of arabica beans brazil which fostered a continuation of production while coffee recovered to 1 2550 per pound in mid october the price fell back below the 1 level on the nearby ice futures contract in a sign of continued weakness for the soft commodity source barchart as the quarterly chart highlights coffee futures had been making higher lows since 2001 when the price hit lows of 41 5 cents per pound however in q3 the price action negated the pattern of higher lows as the price traded below 1 per pound for the first time since 2006 the low at 92 cents was the lowest since 2005 at under 1 per pound level the downside action in the coffee market threatens to continue into a bearish abyss the next level of technical support on the long term chart below 92 cents is at the 2005 low at 84 45 cents and then at the q4 october 2001 low at 41 50 cents per pound more than half the current price level i continue to believe that coffee is a compelling story as it is near the bottom of its pricing cycle cocoa review and outlook cocoa was the best performer in the soft commodity sector in 2015 in fact cocoa was the only commodity that posted a double digit gain in 2015 and won the gold medal for performance across all of the raw material markets that i cover cocoa was the worst performing soft commodity and the worst performing commodity of all in 2016 posting a loss of 33 79 and the losing continued in 2017 with a decline of 11 01 however in q1 cocoa was not only the best performing soft commodity but it also posted the biggest gain of all of the sectors rising 35 1 for the three month period in q2 the price of cocoa fell 3 13 but in q3 ice cocoa futures put in the worst performance as they declined by 16 92 in q4 the cocoa futures market got back on the winning side with a gain of 17 45 for the final three months of the year cocoa moved 27 7 higher in 2018 making it the best performing soft commodity of the year cocoa also posted the highest gain of all commodities on a year on year basis in 2018 as of the close of business on december 31 2018 nearby ice cocoa futures were trading at 2416 per ton cocoa futures traded in a range of 1836 2914 per ton in 2018 and cocoa futures did not violate the bottom or top end of the trading range in q4 the highs for cocoa futures came in q2 and the lows during q1 source cqg the weekly chart of ice cocoa futures illustrates the significant price recovery that took the soft commodity to highs of 2914 per ton in late april and early may since then the price of cocoa had been in a range from 2000 to 2400 per ton and it closed the year with a move above the top end of the trading range cocoa traded to highs of 3 422 per ton in early december 2015 and then fell to lows of 1769 in june 2017 a 50 retracement of the move from the highs to lows was at 2 595 50 per ton in mid march cocoa reached and exceeded that level and it kept on going reaching a peak of over 2900 per ton however the primary ingredient in chocolate confectionery products left a gap on the weekly chart from 2320 to 2430 per ton which acted as a magnet for the price in q2 in q4 cocoa traded in a 400 range but it broke higher in late december cocoa can be sensitive to moves in the british pound as london is the hub of the physical cocoa market the pound traded to a new low for the year in q4 as there is no deal for brexit with a deadline looming on march 29 2018 price momentum on the daily chart is rising towards overbought territory while the weekly chart crossed higher in neutral territory and the monthly chart declined towards oversold territory cocoa fell from over 3400 per ton in december 2015 to lows of 1769 in june 2017 it then recovered to a high of 2914 one year later and is now trading at just over the 2400 per ton level as we move into 2019 cocoa is another soft commodity where increasing demand underpins the price of the primary ingredient in chocolate confectionery products technical support for cocoa futures is at the recent low at 1982 per ton with resistance at the 2018 peak at 2914 per ton as we move into 2019 a period of consolidation above 2400 could send the price towards 3000 per ton cocoa is in the middle of the trading range but demand and any supply issues in west africa could push the price higher brexit could impact the direction of the pound which could influence the price of cocoa futures over the coming three months cotton review and outlook cotton was the worst performing soft commodity in 2014 it moved 27 33 lower for the year in 2015 the price of cotton appreciated by 4 99 and in 2016 cotton gained 11 65 cotton moved 11 3 higher in 2017 the positive price action continued

profit taking and selling took the price down towards the 70 cents per pound level on the active month futures contract cotton traded in a range from 71 87 cents to 96 50 cents in 2018 and it made a new low during q4 in december nearby ice cotton futures settled on december 31 at 72 20 cents per pound cotton is a highly volatile commodity and in march 2011 cotton traded up to an all time high of 2 27 per pound on supply shortages following the all time high the price moved progressively lower until finding a low at 55 66 cents in march 2016 as the weekly chart highlights the fluffy fiber futures have been rising since october 2017 making higher lows and higher highs in the december wasde report the usda told markets that cotton inventories and production increased which sent the price of the fiber towards the 70 cents per pound level meanwhile the trade issues between the united states and china have weighed on the price of cotton the u s is a producer and china is one of the leading consumers of cotton in the world tariffs and retaliation distort prices and could interfere with the flow of cotton from u s producers to chinese consumers tariffs and subsidies interfere with price dynamics as they distort supply and demand fundamentals a trade deal between the two nations would likely be bullish news for the price of cotton in 2019 source cqg as the quarterly chart highlights cotton has been making higher lows since 2001 when the price traded to lows of 28 20 cents per pound in 2011 a shortage took the price to highs of 2 27 but since correcting to 55 66 cents the fiber has been making higher lows and higher highs cotton is a highly volatile commodity on the futures market and at times suffers from a lack of liquidity during significant price moves the next target on the upside in the cotton market for a long term perspective will be the psychological 1 00 per pound level the results of trade negotiations with china could make or break the price of the fiber over the coming weeks and months frozen concentrated orange juice review and outlook trading fcoj futures is a frantic business i would not recommend it to anyone because of the lack of

the futures market oj is a thin and illiquid market that is dangerous as it is susceptible to price gaps when the price is moving the bottom line and a quick look at lumber two of the five soft commodity prices moved higher in q4 in 2018 coffee and sugar posted double digit percentage losses while cocoa posted a double digit percentage gain cotton and fcoj were lower for the year i will continue to buy dips and sell rallies in many of the commodities in the sector in q1 2019 coffee at below 1 per pound could offer compelling value on a historical basis the potential for supply issues is always a danger when it comes to these agricultural commodities markets and supply issues can cause explosive price moves like the one we witnessed in the cocoa market during the first and second quarters of this year and in coffee and sugar from september through october risk reward favors the commodities that are at lows and multiyear lows when it comes to trade issues cotton continues to be the only soft commodity directly impacted by the tariffs and retaliation as the u s exports the fiber to china therefore cotton could continue to experience wide price variance into 2019 the lumber market added to losses from q3 in q4 in mid may lumber futures traded to another new all time high when the price reached 659 00 per 1 000 board feet surpassing the february peak at 536 20 and the 1993 previous record high at 493 50 source cqg the long term quarterly chart shows that lumber had been moving higher since september 2015 when the price found a bottom at 214 40 per 1 000 board feet lumber had been making higher lows since 2009 when the price trade to 137 90 the wood market gained 28 72 in 2016 and did even better in 2017 rising by 36 lumber continued to post gains in q1 of 2018 of 15 11 and in q2 of 10 39 in q3 the price of lumber plunged as it experienced a 39 50 correction in q4 more selling took the price to a new low for the year at 299 90 and the lumber market lost another 3 46 over the final three months of 2018 the lumber market finished 2018 with a 25 78 year on year loss and the price closed on december 31 2018 at 332 50 per 1 000 board feet 326 50 or 49 54 off of its may peak 2018 lumber is a commodity that had been in the spotlight of the trade issues between the united states and canada a new trade agreement calmed supply fears but higher interest rates and rising mortgage rates have caused the demand for wood to decline additionally construction tends to diminish during the winter months so there is a seasonal element to the market that took it to lows in anticipation of the coldest months of the year lumber is not a liquid market and i would discourage anyone from trading in this market however lumber is a vital benchmark commodity and it behooves all investors to monitor the price action as it provides clues about economic conditions and demand for industrial raw materials the low level of lumber futures going into 2019 could prove unsustainable as the price has moved so far on the downside over the past seven months at the same time if the fed becomes less hawkish and the u s economy continued to grow it is possible that we will see an uptick in the price of lumber as demand increases if new home construction rises moreover any bipartisan legislation for an infrastructure rebuilding program could cause a recovery rally in the lumber market which is deeply oversold interest rates may be rising but they continue to be at historically low levels soft commodities prices are some of the most volatile in all of the sectors of the raw materials asset class these commodities tend to move to the top and bottom ends of their pricing cycles often and the weather conditions around the world along with crop diseases

how a world order ends a stable world order is a rare thing when one does arise it tends to come after a great convulsion that creates both the conditions and the desire for something new it requires a stable distribution of power and broad acceptance of the rules that govern the conduct of international relations it also needs skillful statecraft since an order is made not born and no matter how ripe the starting conditions or strong the initial desire maintaining it demands creative diplomacy functioning institutions and effective action to adjust it when circumstances change and buttress it when challenges come eventually inevitably even the best managed order comes to an end the balance of power underpinning it becomes imbalanced the institutions supporting it fail to adapt to new conditions some countries fall and others rise the result of changing capacities faltering wills and growing ambitions those responsible for upholding the order make mistakes both in what they choose to do and in what they choose not to do but if the end of every order is inevitable the timing and the manner of its ending are not nor is what comes in its wake orders tend to expire in a prolonged deterioration rather than a sudden collapse and just as maintaining the order depends on effective statecraft and effective action good policy and proactive diplomacy can help determine how that deterioration unfolds and what it brings yet for that to happen something else must come first recognition that the old order is never coming back and that efforts to resurrect it will be in vain as with any ending acceptance must come before one can move on in the search for parallels to today s world scholars and practitioners have looked as far afield as ancient greece where the rise of a new power resulted in war between athens and sparta and the period after world war i when an isolationist united states and much of europe sat on their hands as germany and japan ignored agreements and invaded their neighbors but the more illuminating parallel to the present is the concert of europe in the nineteenth century the most important and successful effort to build and sustain world order until our own time from 1815 until the outbreak of world war i a century later the order established at the congress of vienna defined many international relationships and set even if it often failed to enforce basic rules for international conduct it provides a model of how to collectively manage security in a multipolar world that order s demise and what followed offer instructive lessons for today and an urgent warning just because an order is in irreversible decline does not mean that chaos or calamity is inevitable but if the deterioration is managed poorly catastrophe could well follow out of the ashes the global order of the second half of the twentieth century and the first part of the twenty first grew out of the wreckage of two world wars the nineteenth century order followed an earlier international convulsion the napoleonic wars which after the french revolution and the rise of napoleon bonaparte ravaged europe for more than a decade after defeating napoleon and his armies the victorious allies austria prussia russia and the united kingdom the great powers of their day came together in vienna in 1814 and 1815 at the congress of vienna they set out to ensure that france s military never again threatened their states and that revolutionary movements never again threatened their monarchies the victorious powers also made the wise choice to integrate a defeated france a course very different from the one taken with germany following world war i and somewhat different from the one chosen with russia in the wake of the cold war the congress yielded a system known as the concert of europe although centered in europe it constituted the international order of its day given the dominant position of europe and europeans in the world there was a set of shared understandings about relations between states above all an agreement to rule out invasion of another country or involvement in the internal affairs of another without its permission a rough military balance dissuaded any state tempted to overthrow the order from trying in the first place and prevented any state that did try from succeeding foreign ministers met at what came to be called congresses whenever a major issue arose the concert was conservative in every sense of the word the treaty of vienna had made numerous territorial adjustments and then locked europe s borders into place allowing changes only if all signatories agreed it also did what it could to back monarchies and encourage others to come to their aid as france did in spain in 1823 when they were threatened by popular revolt the concert worked not because there was complete agreement among the great powers on every point but because each state had its own reasons for supporting the overall system austria was most concerned with resisting the forces of liberalism which threatened the ruling monarchy the united kingdom was focused on staving off a renewed challenge from france while also guarding against a potential threat from russia which meant not weakening france so much that it couldn t help offset the threat from russia but there was enough overlap in interests and consensus on first order questions that the concert prevented war between the major powers of the day the concert technically lasted a century until the eve of world war i but it had ceased to play a meaningful role long before then the revolutionary waves that swept europe in 1830 and 1848 revealed the limits of what members would do to maintain the existing order within states in the face of public pressure then more consequentially came the crimean war ostensibly fought over the fate of christians living within the ottoman empire in actuality it was much more about who would control territory as that empire decayed the conflict pitted france the united kingdom and the ottoman empire against russia it lasted two and a half years from 1853 to 1856 it was a costly war that highlighted the limits of the concert s ability to prevent great power war the great power comity that had made the concert possible no longer existed subsequent wars between austria and prussia and prussia and france demonstrated that major power conflict had returned to the heart of europe after a long hiatus matters seemed to stabilize for a time after that but this was an illusion beneath the surface german power was rising and empires were rotting the combination set the stage for world war i and the end of what had been the concert what ails the order what lessons can be drawn from this history as much as anything else the rise and fall of major powers determines the viability of the prevailing order since changes in economic strength political cohesion and military power shape what states can and are willing to do beyond their borders over the second half of the nineteenth century and the start of the twentieth a powerful unified germany and a modern japan rose the ottoman empire and tsarist russia declined and france and the united kingdom grew stronger but not strong enough those changes upended the balance of power that had been the concert s foundation germany in particular came to view the status quo as inconsistent with its interests changes in the technological and political context also affected that underlying balance under the concert popular demands for democratic participation and surges of nationalism threatened the status quo within countries while new forms of transportation communication and armaments transformed politics economics and warfare the conditions that helped give rise to the concert were gradually undone yet it would be overly deterministic to attribute history to underlying conditions alone statecraft still matters that the concert came into existence and lasted as long as it did underscores that people make a difference the diplomats who crafted it metternich of austria talleyrand of france castlereagh of the united kingdom were exceptional the fact that the concert preserved peace despite the gap between two relatively liberal countries france and the united kingdom and their more conservative partners shows that countries with different political systems and preferences can work together to maintain international order little that turns out to be good or bad in history is inevitable the crimean war might well have been avoided if more capable and careful leaders had been on the scene it is far from clear that russian actions warranted a military response by france and the united kingdom of the nature and on the scale that took place that the countries did what they did also underscores the power and dangers of nationalism world war i broke out in no small part because the successors to german chancellor otto von bismarck were unable to discipline the power of the modern german state he did so much to bring about two other lessons stand out first it is not just core issues that can cause an order to deteriorate the concert s great power comity ended not because of disagreements over the social and political order within europe but because of competition on the periphery and second because orders tend to end with a whimper rather than a bang the process of deterioration is often not evident to decision makers until it has advanced considerably by the outbreak of world war i when it became obvious that the concert of europe no longer held it was far too late to save it or even to manage its dissolution a tale of two orders the global order built in the aftermath of world war ii consisted of two parallel orders for most of its history one grew out of the cold war between the united states and the soviet union at its core was a rough balance of military strength in europe and asia backed up by nuclear deterrence the two sides showed a degree of restraint in their rivalry rollback cold war parlance for what today is called regime change was rejected as both infeasible and reckless both sides followed informal rules of the road that included a healthy respect for each other s backyards and allies ultimately they reached an understanding over the political order within europe the principal arena of cold war competition and in 1975 codified that mutual understanding in the helsinki accords even in a divided world the two power centers agreed on how the competition would be waged theirs was an order based on means rather than ends that there were only two power centers made reaching such an agreement easier the other post world war ii order was the liberal order that operated alongside the cold war order democracies were the main participants in this effort which used aid and trade to strengthen ties and fostered respect for the rule of law both within and between countries the economic dimension of this order was designed to bring about a world or more accurately the non communist half of it defined by trade development and well functioning monetary operations free trade would be an engine of economic growth and bind countries together so that war would be deemed too costly to wage the dollar was accepted as the de facto global currency the diplomatic dimension of the order gave prominence to the un the idea was that a standing global forum could prevent or resolve international disputes the un security council with five great power permanent members and additional seats for a rotating membership would orchestrate international relations yet the order depended just as much on the willingness of the non communist world and u s allies in particular to accept american primacy as it turns out they were prepared to do this as the united states was more often than not viewed as a relatively benign hegemon one admired as much for what it was at home as for what it did abroad both of these orders served the interests of the united states the core peace was maintained in both europe and asia at a price that a growing u s economy could easily afford increased international trade and opportunities for investment contributed to u s economic growth over time more countries joined the ranks of the democracies neither order reflected a perfect consensus rather each offered enough agreement so that it was not directly challenged where u s foreign policy got into trouble such as in vietnam and iraq it was not because of alliance commitments or considerations of order but because of ill advised decisions to prosecute costly wars of choice signs of decay today both orders have deteriorated although the cold war itself ended long ago the order it created came apart in a more piecemeal fashion in part because western efforts to integrate russia into the liberal world order achieved little one sign of the cold war order s deterioration was saddam hussein s 1990 invasion of kuwait something moscow likely would have prevented in previous years on the grounds that it was too risky although nuclear deterrence still holds some of the arms control agreements buttressing it have been broken and others are fraying although russia has avoided any direct military challenge to nato it has nonetheless shown a growing willingness to disrupt the status quo through its use of force in georgia in 2008 and ukraine since 2014 its often indiscriminate military intervention in syria and its aggressive use of cyberwarfare to attempt to affect political outcomes in the united states and europe all of these represent a rejection of the principal constraints associated with the old order from a russian perspective the same might be said of nato enlargement an initiative clearly at odds with winston churchill s dictum in victory magnanimity russia also judged the 2003 iraq war and the 2011 nato military intervention in libya which was undertaken in the name of humanitarianism but quickly evolved into regime change as acts of bad faith and illegality inconsistent with notions of world order as it understood them the liberal order is exhibiting its own signs of deterioration authoritarianism is on the rise not just in the obvious places such as china and russia but also in the philippines turkey and eastern europe global trade has grown but recent rounds of trade talks have ended without agreement and the world trade organization wto has proved unable to deal with today s most pressing challenges including nontariff barriers and the theft of intellectual property resentment over the united states exploitation of the dollar to impose sanctions is growing as is concern over the country s accumulation of debt the un security council is of little relevance to most of the world s conflicts and international arrangements have failed more broadly to contend with the challenges associated with globalization the composition of the security council bears less and less resemblance to the real distribution of power the world has put itself on the record as against genocide and has asserted a right to intervene when governments fail to live up to the responsibility to protect their citizens but the talk has not translated into action the nuclear non proliferation treaty allows only five states to have nuclear weapons but there are now nine that do and many others that could follow suit if they chose to the eu by far the most significant regional arrangement is struggling with brexit and disputes over migration and sovereignty and around the world countries are increasingly resisting u s primacy power shifts why is all this happening it is instructive to look back to the gradual demise of the concert of europe today s world order has struggled to cope with power shifts china s rise the appearance of several medium powers iran and north korea in particular that reject important aspects of the order and the emergence of nonstate actors from drug cartels to terrorist networks that can pose a serious threat to order within and between states the technological and political context has changed in important ways too globalization has had destabilizing effects ranging from climate change to the spread of technology into far more hands than ever before including a range of groups and people intent on disrupting the order nationalism and populism have surged the result of greater inequality within countries the dislocation associated with the 2008 financial crisis job losses caused by trade and technology increased flows of migrants and refugees and the power of social media to spread hate meanwhile effective statecraft is conspicuously lacking institutions have failed to adapt no one today would design a un security council that looked like the current one yet real reform is impossible since those who would lose influence block any changes efforts to build effective frameworks to deal with the challenges of globalization including climate change and cyberattacks have come up short mistakes within the eu namely the decisions to establish a common currency without creating a common fiscal policy or a banking union and to permit nearly unlimited immigration to germany have created a powerful backlash against existing governments open borders and the eu itself the united states for its part has committed costly overreach in trying to remake afghanistan invading iraq and pursuing regime change in libya but it has also taken a step back from maintaining global order and in certain cases has been guilty of costly underreach in most instances u s reluctance to act has come not over core issues but over peripheral ones that leaders wrote off as not worth the costs involved such as the strife in syria where the united states failed to respond meaningfully when syria first used chemical weapons or to do more to help anti regime groups this reluctance has increased others propensity to disregard u s concerns and act independently the saudi led military intervention in yemen is a case in point russian actions in syria and ukraine should also be seen in this light it is interesting that crimea marked the effective end of the concert of europe and signaled a dramatic setback in the current order doubts about u s reliability have multiplied under the trump administration thanks to its withdrawal from numerous international pacts and its conditional approach to once inviolable u s alliance commitments in europe and asia managing the deterioration given these changes resurrecting the old order will be impossible it would also be insufficient thanks to the emergence of new challenges once this is acknowledged the long deterioration of the concert of europe should serve as a lesson and a warning for the united states to heed that warning would mean strengthening certain aspects of the old order and supplementing them with measures that account for changing power dynamics and new global problems the united states would have to shore up arms control and nonproliferation agreements strengthen its alliances in europe and asia bolster weak states that cannot contend with terrorists cartels and gangs and counter authoritarian powers interference in the democratic process yet it should not give up trying to integrate china and russia into regional and global aspects of the order such efforts will necessarily involve a mix of compromise incentives and pushback the judgment that attempts to integrate china and russia have mostly failed should not be grounds for rejecting future efforts as the course of the twenty first century will in no small part reflect how those efforts fare the united states also needs to reach out to others to address problems of globalization especially climate change trade and cyber operations these will require not resurrecting the old order but building a new one efforts to limit and adapt to climate change need to be more ambitious the wto must be amended to address the sorts of issues raised by china s appropriation of technology provision of subsidies to domestic firms and use of nontariff barriers to trade rules of the road are needed to regulate cyberspace together this is tantamount to a call for a modern day concert such a call is ambitious but necessary the united states must show restraint and recapture a degree of respect in order to regain its reputation as a benign actor this will require some sharp departures from the way u s foreign policy has been practiced in recent years to start no longer carelessly invading other countries and no longer weaponizing u s economic policy through the overuse of sanctions and tariffs but more than anything else the current reflexive opposition to multilateralism needs to be rethought it is one thing for a world order to unravel slowly it is quite another for the country that had a large hand in building it to take the lead in dismantling it all of this also requires that the united states get its own house in order reducing government debt rebuilding infrastructure improving public education investing more in the social safety net adopting a smart immigration system that allows talented foreigners to come and stay tackling political dysfunction by making it less difficult to vote and undoing gerrymandering the united states cannot effectively promote order abroad if it is divided at home distracted by domestic problems and lacking in resources the major alternatives to a modernized world order supported by the united states appear unlikely unappealing or both a chinese led order for example would be an illiberal one characterized by authoritarian domestic political systems and statist economies that place a premium on maintaining domestic stability there would be a return to spheres of influence with china attempting to dominate its region likely resulting in clashes with other regional powers such as india japan and vietnam which would probably build up their conventional or even nuclear forces a new democratic rules based order fashioned and led by medium powers in europe and asia as well as canada however attractive a concept would simply lack the military capacity and domestic political will to get very far a more likely alternative is a world with little order a world of deeper disarray protectionism nationalism and populism would gain and democracy would lose conflict within and across borders would become more common and rivalry between great powers would increase cooperation on global challenges would be all but precluded if this picture sounds familiar that is because it increasingly corresponds to the world of today the deterioration of a world order can set in motion trends that spell catastrophe world war i broke out some 60 years after the concert of europe had for all intents and purposes broken down in crimea what we are seeing today resembles the mid nineteenth century in important ways the post world war ii post cold war order cannot be restored but the world is not yet on the edge of a systemic crisis now is the time to make sure one never materializes be it from a breakdown in u s chinese relations a clash with russia a conflagration in the middle east or the cumulative effects of climate change the good news is that it is far from inevitable that the world will eventually arrive at a catastrophe the bad news is that it is far from certain that it will not richard haass is president of the

weak sales at apple and cargill u s giants of technology and agriculture may be the clearest sign yet that president donald trump s quest to reset world trade carries costs at home and could isolate the united states as the increasingly fragile engine for global economic growth apple a global technology darling loved for its sleek gadgets on wednesday warned of disappointing quarterly revenues because of poor sales in china on thursday privately held grains trader cargill announced worse than expected results out of china china the world s second largest economy likely expanded at more than 6 percent last year reflecting a slowdown from years past and in recent months its most tepid rate since the depths of the global financial crisis a decade ago the u s china trade war threatens a decade old hope among business and economic leaders that rising purchasing power among chinese consumers would support an era of synchronized global growth the sharp slowdown in china and weakness elsewhere also threaten to leave u s consumers whose spending accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity and who so far have been eager to spend in an era of rising household incomes and wages as the chief bulwark against a broader world downturn there is an inconsistency between the u s acting as a locomotive for the world and the objective of the trump administration s policy to reduce the trade deficit that s another reason why it will be challenging for the u s consumer to act as world locomotive said catherine mann global chief economist at citi and the oecd s former chief economist we are looking at this balance between the strong domestic activity and the weaker external activity in the united states germany and elsewhere she said and also the effectiveness of chinese policy to turn the trajectory of the economy there other drivers of u s growth including government and business spending and net exports are all sagging or expected to do so in coming months the u s economy the world s biggest is expected to slow from a very robust 2018 but should remain strong until about mid 2020 when economists polled by reuters expect it to settle at 1 8 percent in october the international monetary fund cut its 2019 global growth forecast to 3 7 percent citing the trade war and in december citi trimmed its prediction to 3 1 percent what was hailed just a year ago as an era when the world s major economies would all grow together has evolved in a more volatile direction with the united states juiced along by tax cuts and government spending while the rest of the world sputters businesses amid uncertainty have held back on the sort of investment that could boost long term growth while governments globally struggle with a combination of high debt levels and mounting infrastructure needs market alarms the u s federal reserve s interest rate increases have caused investors to move in and out of various markets hitting some emerging markets hard it has also helped spark severe volatility in the u s stock market and a months long selloff that analysts said signaled worries over a pending recession apple inc aapl o shares tumbled 9 96 percent on thursday to their lowest level since mid 2017 after the company slashed its sales forecast apple s announcement triggered memories of a technology led market decline in 2000 that preceded a mild recession it s oh so reminiscent said david rosenberg an economist at gluskin sheff associates inc saying it was further evidence of a deteriorating outlook for chinese manufacturing that will weigh on the global economy on thursday one fed official said further planned rate hikes should be halted until that large assortment of global issues gets resolved i would be an advocate of taking no action in the first couple of quarters this year dallas fed president robert kaplan told bloomberg television in december fed policymakers forecast a median of two more hikes this year u s isolation while trump has put a march 1 deadline on striking a trade deal with beijing concerns extend beyond china to europe where a deal for britain s exit from the european union known as brexit has not been agreed with less than three months to go before the march 29 deadline but the impact of china is enormous chinese growth feeds into a variety of global prices such as oil metals and microchips driving investment and spending decisions worldwide evidence is piling up that tension between the world s two largest economies has dampened business confidence and depressed investment it could mark a turn from most of 2018 when many economists and officials said the trump administration s higher trade tariffs had yet to seriously hurt u s growth kevin hassett the white house economic adviser said on thursday the sharp drop in chinese economic growth will hit u s profits but sales for apple and other firms should rebound once a trade deal is struck the u s manufacturing sector has begun to slow and the institute of supply management s survey of corporate purchasing managers on monday showed the largest monthly decline since the depths of the recession in december 2008 a dallas fed quarterly survey of energy firms showed a marked slowdown at the end of 2018 the rest of the world is slowing especially europe and china but the u s has enough momentum said mohamed el erian the chief economic adviser of asset manager and insurer allianz the problem is policymakers are not sensitive enough to spill backs and market volatility could feed back into economic weakness source reuters reporting

robert samuelson the washington post on its 20th birthday the best that can be said of the euro the european currency used by 19 countries is that it has survived it has never achieved its central goals increasing economic growth and strengthening public support for europe in many ways just the opposite has occurred the economy of the eurozone still lags the united states in growth for 2019 growth is forecast at 1 6 percent compared with 2 6 percent for the united states even worse the contentious negotiations over rescuing the eurozone s weaker members greece spain portugal and italy have left a bitter aftertaste debtor countries feel they were treated badly particularly by germany meanwhile the creditors resent having to bail out their poorer neighbors all this looms over europe s present political crisis its rising populism its anger over immigration and the conflict over brexit another euro crisis would make things worse italy seems especially vulnerable with little economic growth and government debt at about 130 percent of its gross domestic product notes rebecca patterson in a report for the bessemer trust a financial services firm the euro s appeal was simple eliminating separate currencies for the european union s member countries would reduce the nuisance of money conversions promote stable exchange rates and stimulate trade at first things went well interest rates dropped sharply especially for weaker borrowers in january 1999 rates on italian 10 year government bonds were virtually the same as rates on similar german bonds although the german economy and its repayment prospects were much better than italy s by contrast italian interest rates had been much higher before the euro the gap or spread between german and italian rates was 5 percentage points in early 1995 other debtor countries got similar relief from higher interest rates the apparent justification for the lower rates was this investors believed that the discipline of a single currency would force many poorer eu countries to improve their economies and less optimistically if they got in trouble they would be bailed out by others the result should have surprised no one there was a credit boom says economist adam posen of the peterson institute german french dutch and belgian banks lent to greek spanish italian and portuguese borrowers money flooded into greek bonds and spanish real estate everyone was happy greece spain and other debtors enjoyed the pleasures of easy money germany and other creditor nations benefited from strong exports the trouble was that the creditors overlent and the debtors overborrowed america s 2007 09 great recession was fatal its side effects including a steep fall in global trade hurt many european borrowers and lenders to stay solvent borrowers had to get government credit from central banks and international agencies or cut spending and raise taxes it was here that the toughest negotiations occurred as lenders and borrowers argued over terms one possible solution was for debtor countries to abandon the euro and revert to national currencies and to do so at conversion rates that favored borrowers this didn t happen almost everyone agreed that ditching the euro would have involved hugely difficult legal political operational and moral issues still it was a possibility if a few countries had jettisoned the euro what would have happened nothing many countries doing likewise a deep global recession none of this occurred in part because no one could confidently answer these questions another reason is that the euro remains popular at home by one survey 74 percent of euro users support it people favor the euro though not the measures needed to make it workable in the end the european central bank bought 2 6 trillion euros worth of bonds nearly 3 trillion at present exchange rates to prop up the currency the story continues eventually we re going to have another u s recession says patterson author of the bessemer trust report then we ll see whether europe s governments banks and businesses can withstand the pressures created by high debt and low economic growth and whether the euro can still survive robert samuelson is a columnist for the washington post
stock markets around the world continue to fluctuate as we step into the new year here are nine financial market forecasts for this year as to whether global market volatility will be short lived or become more severe 1 the united states will suspend its trade war because trump s popularity is slipping and the president has to re establish trade relations with china and other countries in the face of slowing business and economic growth 2 a shares and hong kong shares may have an unexpected uptrend in the first half of the year on the back of prospects of a trade war truce the suspension of interest rate hikes and stimulus policies from the central government all of this will support stock markets in the mainland and hong kong but it does not mean that underlying problems will be solved the crisis will only become more serious in the second half of the year 3 the problem over the uk s exit from the eu is overblown and the pound is seriously undervalued it could be the best performing currency in 2019 once the brexit process becomes clearer 4 argentina s economic crisis seems to be solved but the main reason is because the us dollar s rise has temporarily stopped once the us dollar starts to rise again not only argentina but also emerging markets including asia will have economic and currency crises 5 the fed s pause in raising interest rates will stop the temporary outflow of dollar assets keeping the dollar index at a level of 92 or lower in the first half of the year but it will have a chance to break through the 100 mark by 2020 6 hong kong dollar interest rates will remain stable in the first half of the year however once funds leave hong kong dollar assets in the second half of the year there will be additional risks to the hong kong dollar interest rate which will put more pressure on hong kong dollar asset prices and lead to a vicious circle 7 hong kong property prices will be stable in the first half of the year but once hong kong dollar interest rates increase the local property market will officially enter a period of major adjustment and will not bottom out until 2021 8 hong kong will not lose its status as an independent customs territory this year but trump s use of it as a bargaining chip with china and for his re election bid is a big risk in the future in other words there is still a chance that hong kong may lose its status as an independent customs territory in 2020 which will bring turmoil to the financial markets 9 an inverted yield curve in the bond market does not mean that stocks are in a bear market overall the experience in 2006 suggests that stocks may not enter a bear market formally until next year or the year 2021 andrew wong is an independent commentator

2018 likely will be remembered for achieving solid economic growth a highly volatile stock market and an emerging trade war with china in 2019 we can expect slower growth continued volatility and china to resist significant market based reforms these and other factors combined with an environment of political uncertainty could create greater risks 2018 likely will be remembered for achieving solid economic growth a highly volatile stock market and an emerging trade war with china in 2019 we can expect slower growth continued volatility and china to resist significant market based reforms these and other factors combined with an environment of political uncertainty could create greater risks the u s economy is estimated to have grown by 3 percent in 2018 this rate is based on various components including strong retail and construction sectors and a real estate market that has slowed due to a housing shortage rising mortgage rates and high home prices which have kept some buyers on the curb and consumer spending which represents 70 percent of u s output is reflected in relatively strong but slightly decreasing consumer confidence says the conference board a u s think tank advertising but one of the biggest factors that will impact the u s economy in 2019 is international trade although the changes are minimal and likely to lead to higher priced automobiles the united states mexico canada agreement known as usmca if passed by congress essentially resulting in a modified nafta will help to reduce uncertainty and market volatility but trying to get china to comply with all the demands made by president trump will be unlikely by march 1 the end of the 90 day trade truce agreed to by trump and chinese president xi at the g20 meeting in buenos aires on dec 1 and here s why for decades china has been subsidizing its state owned enterprises thereby giving then an unfair competitive advantage pressuring u s companies to hand over technology in exchange for market access and placing market restrictions on u s companies in addition enforcement of chinese intellectual property protection laws have been weak resulting in lost profits for american firms to adequately address many of these concerns china needs to press ahead with many market based economic reforms it agreed to implement when it joined the world trade organization in december 2001 but the speed at which this might occur if at all could have positive or negative consequences for example beijing should eliminate subsidies from its 100 000 state owned enterprises but to do so too quickly could cause unemployment and social unrest to rise something feared by the ruling communist party on the other hand reforms initiated slowly that in the long run would alleviate trade tensions may not satisfy the white house timetable how trump perceives china s offer in march will determine if it is a win for the administration or a reason to ratchet up the trade war that could turn into a cold war in turn american investors and consumers would be inclined to spend less putting downward pressure on u s economic growth the direction of u s china trade and relations political uncertainty volatility in the stock market or a combination of factors could create new risks affecting the economy as a result 2019 will require american consumers households businesses and investors to operate very cautiously john manzella founder of the manzellareport com is an author and speaker on global business emerging risks and economic trends to contact john visit www johnmanzella com
china s foreign debt has been rising rapidly and that s becoming an increasingly big problem for the country and potentially the world officially china lists its outstanding external debt at 1 9 trillion for a 13 trillion economy that s not a major amount but focusing on the headline number significantly understates the underlying risks short term debt accounted for 62 percent of the total as of september according to official data meaning that 1 2 trillion will have to be rolled over this year just as worrying is the speed of increase total external debt has increased 14 percent in the past year and 35 percent since the beginning of 2017 external debt is no longer a trivial slice of china s foreign exchange reserves which stood at just over 3 trillion at the end of november little changed from two years earlier short term foreign debt increased to 39 percent of reserves in september from 26 percent in march 2016 the true picture may be more precarious china s external debt was estimated at between 3 trillion and 3 5 trillion by daiwa capital markets in an august report in other words total foreign liabilities could be understated by as much as 1 5 trillion after accounting for borrowing in financial centers such as hong kong new york and the caribbean islands that isn t included in the official tally circumstances aren t moving in china s favor the nation s companies rushed to borrow in dollars when there was a 3 percent to 5 percent spread between chinese and u s interest rates and the yuan was expected to strengthen borrowing offshore was cheaper and offered the additional bonus of likely currency gains now the spread in official short term yields has shrunk to near zero and the yuan has been depreciating for most of the past year refinancing debt in dollars has become harder and more risky beijing s policies have exacerbated the buildup of foreign debt to promote xi jinping s belt and road initiative the president s landmark foreign policy endeavor china has been borrowing dollars on international markets and lending around the world for everything from kenyan railways to pakistani business parks with this year and 2020 being the peak years for repayments china faces dollar funding pressure to repay their dollar debts chinese firms will either have to draw from the central bank s foreign exchange reserves a prospect beijing is unlikely to allow or buy dollars on international markets this creates a new set of problems there are only 617 billion yuan 90 billion of offshore renminbi deposits in hong kong available to buy dollars if china was to push firms to bring debt back onshore this would necessitate significant outflows that would push down the yuan s value against the dollar international dollar investors need to be wary of chinese linked investments local government financing vehicles and belt and road borrowers may seem quasi sovereign quality but any shift in the willingness to roll over dollar debt could create a funding crunch with the u s federal reserve raising rates and reducing its balance sheet chinese companies could face paying more for capital in dollars than in yuan bulls have long argued that china s financial risks are contained because of the country s low levels of external debt and large foreign exchange reserves that has changed china s external debt has been increasing by an average of 70 billion per quarter since the beginning of 2017 if it keeps rising beijing will have the unpalatable choice of burning through its reserves or letting the yuan fall both of which would carry additional risks china and the world need to think clearly about this growing dollar debt dependence any cessation of funding could have severe and unforeseen consequences
ever since the bank of canada ratcheted its benchmark interest rate up in the summer of 2017 economists policy makers central bankers and full disclosure even yours truly have been warning canadians to expect more hikes to come as the era of virtually free money seemed to be coming to an end since then the central bank has indeed hiked its benchmark rate five times to its current level of 1 75 per cent and as recently as few weeks ago economists were still forecasting as many as three more hikes by the end of 2019 but the outlook has changed so quickly that now a move in the opposite direction is becoming a real possibility a rate cut trading in investments known as overnight index swaps suggests investors are no longer confident of even one more rate hike this year never mind several says ian pollick head of north american rates strategy with cibc at present there is not a single hike priced for 2019 by pollick s math there s only about a 40 per cent chance of any sort of rate hike this year and some in the market think a cut is on the table it s not difficult to see why while the job market is chugging along and inflation is holding steady around the two per cent level the bank likes to see some dark clouds have started to form on the horizon the price of canadian oil known as western canada select briefly dipped below 15 a barrel this fall a level that by some estimates costs canada s economy as much as 100 million a day while emergency moves to cap production by the alberta government seem to have helped there s no question crude s sudden swoon is hurting the oilpatch and by extension the whole country stephen brown at capital economics predicts the slump in the world price of oil could be enough to take the wind out of canada s economic sails slowing gdp growth to just 1 5 per cent this year well below the two per cent growth the bank of canada was forecasting as recently as october when it nudged its rate up to where it is now in explaining its decision at the time the central bank made it clear that rather than following a predetermined path its decision making would be governed by hard data on how the economy was doing things like are consumers spending money on cars and houses are businesses investing and how is the global picture for free trade looking on all fronts since then the data since then has been unambiguously negative as brown puts it december numbers showed that consumer spending rose by just 1 2 per cent in the third quarter the worst pace in more than four years canadian car sales fell last year for the first time since the financial crisis and the canadian real estate association says it expects home sales to fall to their lowest level in almost a decade this year not to mention escalating global trade tensions that seem to be getting worse by the day add it all up and the path to a rate cut has begun to emerge brown says we would not be surprised if the bank of canada continues to argue that it needs to raise interest rates he said but as it becomes clear that the economy is performing worse than the bank anticipated we expect the bank to drop this line and ultimately cut interest rates at the tail end of this year investors weren t surprised when the federal reserve hiked its interest rate last month but there s growing speculation that the u s central bank could soon move in the opposite direction brendan mcdermid reuters to be fair that s far from a universal view arlene kish an economist with ihs markit agrees that the bank of canada won t feel any obligation to hike further if the data doesn t warrant it but she notes that the dark clouds over parts of canada s economy obscure blue skies elsewhere while alberta and saskatchewan are definitely hurting outside of the energy patch business investment is robust particularly in the tech sector she notes and the jobless rate plunged to a 40 year low in november and stayed there in december even as more people joined the workforce while the data probably isn t enough to warrant a hike when the bank meets next week kish is of the view that higher rates are still on the horizon we are expecting fewer rate hikes this year than previously expected two 25 basis point hikes will be the most likely scenario this year she said in an email this week u s even more likely to cut that s not what the prognosticators are predicting south of the border cibc s pollick notes that investors are pricing a chance of a cut into every single fed meeting this year it s classic end of cycle behaviour he said in an interview the collapse in oil prices downgraded everyone s expectations for inflation including bond traders who only want rate hikes if they work to prevent inflation from eating away at their returns over time central banks don t worry much about investor returns and tend to set their rates to either cool down or heat up the economy as they see fit but investors try to make money by predicting what they think the central bank is going to do and right now they are betting that the u s federal reserve rate will be lower in may 2020 than it is today if inflation is headed lower investors think interest rates have to follow suit which is why trading in u s overnight index swaps has the market betting that the u s federal reserve rate will be lower in may 2020 than it is today the yield on a two year government bond dipped to 2 38 per cent this week less than the current fed rate that means investors think the central bank has to cut rates at some point historically any time the two year government bond rate slips below the fed benchmark a rate cut tends to quickly follow as the chart below shows add it all up and the market is making clear that what was not long ago unthinkable is slowly becoming plausible we ve moved from two hikes in canada to not even one pollick said and from two hikes in the u s to cuts

maclean s author jason kirby wrote this week about canada s housing correction saying canadians are finally getting a taste of what a world with rising interest rates will look like and one thing is painfully clear weâ re not ready for what happens next national home sales are projected to post a double digit decline when the final 2018 numbers come in according to the canadian real estate association what s to blame for this housing correction three factors tougher mortgage stress tests introduced by the federal government to ensure borrowers could qualify at higher interest rates higher interest rates the bank of canada hiked its key interest rate three times to 1 75 percent the inevitable slowdown of our decade long real estate boom up 56 percent in 10 years not surprisingly those closest to the housing market mortgage brokers real estate agents home builders say the federal government is to blame with tighter lending rules keeping well qualified borrowers on the sidelines they say the government regulations were meant to tap the brakes on overheated markets in vancouver and toronto but has caused an unintended ripple across the rest of canada the bank of canada moved quickly to hike rates and try to keep pace with the u s but now they re in a predicament another two or three rate hikes this year as many economists had forecast might cripple a canadian economy that has become increasingly dependent on household spending fail to keep pace with the u s however and risk further weakening of the canadian dollar my take the stress test was always a prudent move to ensure borrowers could afford the inevitable rise in interest rates housing prices were going to fall eventually but the question is whether we ll see a full scale crash in some markets or a soft landing a lot of money has been made in real estate over the years but over the very long term this asset class barely beats inflation think 2 3 percent increases per year a housing correction could help those who were on the edge of affordability but as we ve learned over the last decade trying to time the real estate market is incredibly difficult therefore the decision to buy

world crude oil production and the oil price in april 2012 i published this post about world crude oil production and the oil price in norwegian which was an attempt to describe the developments in the sources of crude oils including condensates tranches of total life cycle costs that is per barrel of oil and something about the drivers for the formation of the oil price rereading the post and as time passed i learnt more and therefore thought it appropriate to revisit and update the post as it in my opinion contains some topics from what i have observed learned and discussed that have been given poor attention and appears poorly understood i will continue to pound the message that oil prices are also subject to the reality of demand is what the consumers can pay for the four big central banks boe boj ecb and the fed expanded their balance sheets with 6 7 trillion following the lehman collapse in the fall of 2008 these liquidity injections are about to end since 2008 most of the advanced economies credit expansions originated from the central banks the lenders of last resort central banks are collateral constrained the consensus about the oil price collapse during the recent weeks is attributed to waning global demand and growth in supplies all eyes are now on opec any forecasts of oil and gas demand supplies and oil price trajectories are not very helpful if they do not incorporate forecasts for changes to total global credit debt interest rates and developments to consumers societies affordability for more than a decade i have carefully studied the forecasts and been involved in numerous fruitful discussions from authoritative sources like the energy information administration eia and the international energy agency iea including the annual outlooks from several of the major oil companies and i did not find that any of these takes into consideration changes to global credit debt levels of total global credit debt and interest rates what determines the oil price may generically be expressed as f oil price supply demand balance direction and pace of global activity developments in consumers affordability the health of oil companies balance sheets oil companies exploration results and the profitability of their resource portfolios fear greed risk aversion taking speculative effects total global credit changes effects from total global debt levels austerity measures monetary policies interest rates geopolitical tensions and events competition from credible alternatives mandated policies aimed at reductions of ghg emissions opec s strategies just to name some in my post the crude oil price and changes to total global private credit debt i continued my attempts to draw attention to the growth in total global debt levels and the central banks low interest policies which incites both demand and supplies and also supports affordability for a high er oil price price evolves from the arbitrage between demand and supplies and a growing supply gap will put downward pressures on the oil price changes in demand need to be viewed in the context of changes in total global debt levels or money stock and interest rates the usual suspects of oil analysts favored by the msm main street media touts their concurrent and simplistic views about weaker demand improved supplies or whatever the theme du jour as reasons for the recent collapse or any movement in the oil price few if any of these analyst ventures beyond and try to explain those mechanisms monetary financial fiscal that really create demand and supplies simplistic described demand originates from the total global money stock and changes to this stock and its circulation velocity a major portion of the global money stock is credit created over several years decades that circulates within and between the economies almost all of this money stock total credit has been is created through simple commercial banks book entries and as this process slows and or reverses it takes money out of this stock and thus circulation this is deflationary the total global amount of money and its circulation velocity becomes the source of demand a deleveraging lowers economic activity as it lowers the stock and circulation of money and will thus also affect demand for oil and its price central banks balance sheets and interest rates bis 84th annual report the expansion of the central banks balance sheets since 2008 creating money out of thin air has in reality been a subsidy of our consumptive lifestyles this happened as the private and public sector had run out of room on their balance sheets and thus had little remaining capacities to take on more debt most households and some companies have experienced a decline in their real disposable income which shrinks their debt capacities norway high oil price high growth in private sector debt norway has been and still is a major world exporter of oil and natural gas while countries importing oil have been using credit debt to sustain grow imports and put up with a higher oil price there has been a strong growth in private credit debt in norway which shows good correlation with the oil price this is a feature of the norwegian economy that is little recognized and which explains much of its recent growth success ref also my post norway s petroleum economy struggles with declining debt productivity figure 3 illustrates that for norway the growth in credit debt during the recent 2 decades has with a time lag correlated closely with the oil price norwegian crude oil extraction peaked back in 2000 2001 and is down more 50 from its peak and will continue to decline the chart above creates the impression that the norwegian non financials have myopic looked at the oil price and its recent history as a proxy collateral from which to assume more debt and not being aware of the decline in the extraction of crude oil the decline in and a sustained lower oil price will set norway up for a triple whammy total revenues from the petroleum production will decline from the combinations of lower price and declining extraction the oil company s capital expenditures are being curtailed and or deferred due to a lack of profitable prospects discoveries to invest in and the companies have little room left from the shrinking potential on their balance sheets for further debt expansion households municipalities and non financial corporations are responding to this reality by slowing down their debt accumulation with this backdrop the norwegian government expects a gdp growth of 2 for fiscal year 2015 world supplies of crude oil and condensates the chart shows that recent years growth in global supplies of crude oil has come from more expensive sources sources for expensive crude oil and condensates oil bitumen primarily from athabasca alberta canada has according to several oil companies and analysts a break even price of us 70 90 bbl light tight oil lto now dominated by the bakken in north dakota and eagle ford in texas has breakeven prices in the range of us 50 90 bbl the spread is due to a wide range of wells productivities oil extraction from areas where combinations of water depth geological formations access to infrastructure and markets size estimates of recoverable reserves requires a break even of us 50 bbl and above oil from developments in their late extraction phase which had their economic life prolonged thanks to the high er oil price and which will continue their oil extraction as long it is economic refer also figure 6 figure 4 shows that supplies of crude oil from conventional reservoirs has been on some plateau since 2005 there are have been temporarily interruptions from some supply sources due to social unrests libya sudan the green columns also include expensive sources for oil like deep water arctic small conventional discoveries that became commercialized with a higher oil price and lots of legacy developments in their late extraction tail phase that had their economic life extended thanks to the higher oil price refer also figure 6 various institutions analysts have estimated that worldwide primarily within opec there are some spare capacities potentials and these estimates show a big spread and are also widely contested full life cycle costs tranches for crude oil figure 5 illustrates how the growth in the oil price gradually brought tranches of costlier oil to the market the figure also illustrates that there is a time lag from when a higher sustained oil price materializes until more expensive oil is brought to the market the timing and contribution from the more expensive tranches are if not accurate believed to be very close to actual developments during the recent decade there is in addition a tiny sliver of oil supplies with full life cycle costs above 80 bbl full life cycle costs should not be confused with estimates of what oil price the oil companies need to become cash flow neutral the market does not care about the costs for the incremental barrel of oil the oil price results from the dynamics of the supply and demand balance in the market as the cheapest tranches of oil depletes and declines the resulting and gradual price growth made it profitable to develop more costlier oil illustrated in figure 5 by the cost tranches oil companies do normally not sanction developments based on the market price but applies a margin for financial resilience that is developments are sanctioned with a price expectation of say 15 20 below the expected future market price a sustained oil price at below 80 bbl will likely and with some time lag slow down halt reduce flows of oil from the most expensive tranches this while the oil supplies from the cheaper costs tranches are being depleted and continues to decline authoritative organizations like eia and iea publishes regularly projections of developments in the oil price and there is ample reasons to believe that most companies and public institutions applies these projections for their planning expensive oil from legacy developments late in their economic life cycle one source of expensive oil that appears to be flying under most radars comes from developments long in their teeth these developments had their economic life prolonged thanks to a higher oil price figure 6 is based upon actual data as of summer 2014 for an oil field in norway and describes this dynamic figure 6 describes conceptually a petroleum development in its later economic life that allows for supplies of expensive oil as long the price allows but at the same time is vulnerable to an abrupt shut down and thus loss of supplies should the price and or flow of oil drop below the field s economic threshold in figure 6 the field will produce as long as the oil price remains above the field s breakeven oil price i have estimated that for crude oil extraction in norway based on data from the norwegian petroleum directorate npd that a sustained crude oil price at us 80 bbl will during a short period within 12 months cause some of the fields now in their tail phase to be shut down thus reducing the flow with an additional estimated 10 kb d or around 1 of present total flows in norway a sustained oil price below 80 bbl will cause more flows to be shut down this will manifest itself through an acceleration in the decline rate the above illustrates the mechanisms following a low oil price that will take out some of the present expensive oil supplies from legacy developments a lower oil price will impair the oil companies financial capacities and thus impair their investment abilities for new capacities developments even if the developments show a low break even price world oil supply and price what may lie ahead the recent collapse in the oil price is caused by a growing gap between supply and demand the more profound reasons for this is a slowdown in the global economy from less credit expansion reduced growth in total global debt levels which some refer to as the most telegraphed correction in history how far the oil price will come down and for how long it will stay low is now anyone s guesses a declining price results from weakening demand while supplies are improving as the effects of this slowdown works its way through the systems it should be expected that the costlier to extract oil will become shut in and costlier developments become deferred while oil companies targets financial performance and resilience improvements of their balance sheets to offset the effects of lower oil prices the theory is that a lower price stimulates demand consumption a global oil demand consumption that remains tepid with declining oil prices is a worrisome indicator about the true state of the global economy a sustained lower oil price continues the depletion of and declines in oil flows from the world s cheap legacy sources refer also figure 5 a lower oil price impairs the abilities of the oil companies whose task it is to supply oil to societies to invest in new capacities at some point in time demand and supplies will rebalance thus establishing a foundation for renewed growth in the oil price oil companies respond to the price signal with their resource portfolios return requirements and the health of their balance sheets what remains to be seen is when and at what level of global oil supplies this happens and if the resulting price growth allows for oil companies with healthy balance sheets and resource portfolios to timely develop sufficient new oil supplies that meet their return requirements the world s evolving demands and not least consumers affordability this time i have found it appropriate to repeat and expand on the statement from the start of this post any forecasts of oil and gas demand supplies and oil price trajectories are not very helpful if they do not incorporate forecasts for changes to total global credit debt interest rates and developments to consumers societies affordability complete oil energy supply considerations should include the health of the oil companies balance sheets their resource portfolios and their requirements for return the best place to hide something from a fool is to put it in a book unknown origin fractional flow by rune likvern
london the us dollar has recently appreciated to its highest level in real terms since the start of 2017 and before that september 2003 dollar appreciation weighed on oil prices in 2018 as prices in some non dollar currencies hit record levels earlier in the year and dampened consumption growth yet there are signs that the dollar s rise may be coming to an end as trade tensions with china weigh and pressure to raise rates dissipates lifting prospects for oil prices to recover for now dollar strength has helped hold down us inflation even as unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in decades but it has contributed to a worsening trade deficit and cut the dollar value of overseas earnings of us based companies the united states is currently running a mix of expansionary fiscal policy tax cuts and increased spending on the military and a less accommodative or contractionary financial policy rising interest rates the consequence is an improvement in the trade off between employment and inflation internal balance but a deterioration in the trade deficit external balance exchange rate movements have suppressed inflation despite the booming economy but at the cost of declining international competitiveness despite tariffs the strong dollar has posed a dilemma for the federal reserve halting interest rates hikes runs the risk of pushing down the real exchange rate and pushing up inflation reagan redux the trump administration and the federal reserve are to some extent re running the policy mix of the reagan administration and the central bank under paul volcker in the 1980s the reagan administrations tax cuts and defence build up coupled with higher interest rates caused the dollar to surge and the trade deficit to soar the reagan administration pressed trading partners to cut exports to the united states especially cars steel and electronics and boost their currencies eventually the white house pushed the fed to adopt a more accommodative policy triggering the departure of the chairman it is worth noting the current us trade represen tative robert lighthizer was the deputy trade representative in the reagan administration when it forced japan to accept voluntary export restraints to curb its exports to the united states the administration went on to press the other major economies to appreciate their currencies and depreciate the dollar as part of the plaza accord in 1985 the strong dollar of the early 1980s worsened the demand destruction and oversupply of oil in the early 1980s and contributed to the price crisis of 1985 and 1986 subsequent dollar depreciation likely helped steady oil prices in the second half of the 1980s at least it did once saudi arabia s oil minister ahmed zaki yamani was replaced and the kingdom abandoned netback pricing and its volume warfare strategy just as japan was the target for us policymakers in the 1980s complaining about unfair trading practices china has become the target in the 2010s published in dawn january 6th 2019
by kenneth rogoff if you ask most central bankers around the world what their plan is for dealing with the next normal size recession you would be surprised how many at least in advanced economies say fiscal policy given the high odds of a recession over the next two years around 40 in the united states for example monetary policymakers who think fiscal policy alone will save the day are setting themselves up for a rude awakening yes it is true that with policy interest rates near zero in most advanced economies and just above 2 even in the fast growing us there is little room for monetary policy to maneuver in a recession without considerable creativity the best idea is to create an environment in which negative interest rate policies can be used more fully and effectively this will eventually happen but in the meantime today s overdependence on countercyclical fiscal policy is dangerously naïve there are vast institutional differences between technocratic central banks and the politically volatile legislatures that control spending and tax policy let s bear in mind that a typical advanced economy recession lasts only a year or so whereas fiscal policy even in the best of circumstances invariably takes at least a few months just to be enacted in some small economies for example denmark with 5 8 million people there is a broad social consensus to raise fiscal spending as a share of gdp some of this spending could easily be brought forward in a recession in many other countries however notably the us and germany there is no such agreement even if progressives and conservatives both wanted to expand the government their priorities would be vastly different in the us democrats might favor new social programs to reduce inequality while republicans might prefer increased spending on defense or border protection anyone who watched the us senate confirmation hearings last september for supreme court justice brett kavanaugh cannot seriously believe this group is capable of fine tuned technocratic fiscal policy this does not mean that fiscal stimulus should be off the table in the next recession but it does mean that it cannot be the first line of defense as altogether too many central bankers are hoping most advanced countries have a considerable backlog of high return education and infrastructure projects albeit most would take a long time to plan and implement if left leaning economists believe that fiscal policy is the main way out of a recession in 2019 or 2020 they should be lobbying for the government to prepare a pile of recession ready projects former us president barack obama wanted to create an infrastructure bank in part for this purpose tellingly the idea never got off the ground likewise many observers advocate bolstering automatic stabilizers such as unemployment benefits europe with much higher levels of social insurance and taxation has correspondingly stronger automatic stabilizers than does the united states or japan when incomes fall tax revenues decline and insurance payments rise providing a built in countercyclical fiscal stimulus but proponents of higher automatic stabilizers pay too little attention to the negative incentive effects that come with higher government spending and the taxes needed to pay for it to be clear like many academic economists i favour significantly raising taxes and transfers in the us as a response to growing inequality but if there were a broad political consensus in favor of moving in this direction it would have happened already a more exotic concept is to create an independent fiscal council that issues economic forecasts and recommendations on the overall size of budgets and budget deficits the idea is to create an institution for fiscal policy parallel to the central bank for monetary policy several countries including sweden and the united kingdom have adopted much watered down versions of this idea the problem is that elected legislatures don t want to cede power especially over taxes and spending one can appreciate why central bankers don t want to get gamed into some of the nuttier monetary policies that have been proposed for example helicopter money or more targeted drone money whereby the central bank prints currency and hands it out to people such a policy is of course fiscal policy in disguise and the day any central bank starts doing it heavily is the day it loses any semblance of independence others have argued for raising inflation targets but this raises a raft of problems not least that it undermines decades of efforts by central

recent articles by zaher baher it is now or we have to wait for a long time sanctions against russia the impact is greater to europe the state and the power of business recent articles about international workplace struggles κοοπερατίβε by tommy lawson may day 2023 by macg chinese workers fight back by macg the people s movement desperately needs working class solidarity international workplace struggles opinion analysis sunday january 06 2019 01 04 sunday january 06 2019 01 04 by zaher baher by zaher baher this article is about the lack of working class support to the people s movement it analyses the current situation that surrounds working class and the factors that may contribute in weakening it almost everywhere in the meantime the article considers the rule of working class as essential and crucial in prevailing any movement or any uprising the people s movement desperately needs working class solidarity for the last four decades we have seen either no support or very little from the working class especially the industrialised sections and big companies to people s movement it is easy to see this phenomenon in the iranian green movement in june 2008 last year 2018 and in the countries of the arab spring we have seen it too in jordan bahrain in turkey s taksim gezi park in 2013 in france in 2005 and in whole parts of iraq including kurdistan since 2005 until the most recent protests and demonstrations in basra in july and september of 2018 there was also no lack of protests in parts of the former communist bloc and more obviously and importantly was the very recent movement of yellow vests protesters in france advanced technologies and globalisation developed the quantity and quality of the working class at least in industrialised countries in this century and were supposed to take us towards the socialist revolution or at least supporting the movements i mentioned above alas what we have seen for the last four decades is not enough support offered i noted the current industrial condition advanced technologies and globalisation as developments which were supposed to be some sort of preparation for the revolution so the problem here is not just that the revolution has not happened but also the working class movement in most of the countries does not exist the current situation of the working class extended to the level of keeping its distance from the people s movement with all the above factors why is there still no revolution i am not trying to answer the question as i have touched on it in my previous articles however here i try to analyse the situation that surrounds the working class to show some facts according to my knowledge and experience i believe the current attitude of the working class that is not offering solidarity to the people s movement is strongly connected with globalisation it is very clear that since the expansion and strengthening of globalisation and which has reached more countries the working class has become weaker and weaker so when did globalisation begin in other words when did the working class become weaker and weaker there is no a broad agreement between economists and historians about the commencement of globalisation some of them think it began in the nineteenth century others suggest the 16th and 17th centuries when firstly the portuguese and spanish and later the dutch and british empires started colonizing countries they believe it began in the 17th century following the establishment of the first multinational corporation called the british east india company founded in 1600 however many scholars agree that modern globalisation started after the 2nd world war when industrialization allowed for the cheap production of household items that more or less developed the economy a step further after the 2nd world war capitalism stepped into a new period and helped globalisation this was the beginning of the founding of several international institutions based in the united states and europe including the united nations general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt north american free trade agreement nafta world trade organization wto finally the european union eu all have been facilitated by advances in technology which have reduced the costs of trade eliminating or reducing tariffs and barriers and the creation of free trade zones the worldwide exchange of new developments in science technology products and mass media alongside the development and growth of international transport telecommunications and electronic communication played a decisive role in modern globalization why did globalisation make the working class passive instead of active the points i mentioned above both advantage and disadvantage the working class in my opinion they benefited capital and capitalism more than the working class in answering the above question i will refer to a couple of important factors firstly modern globalisation changed the entire structure of the working class wherever it reached what remained common between sections of the working class were just the name and selling their physical or intellectual labour and nothing more we can see this phenomenon in the united kingdom uk very clearly it has divided the working class into different categories with different terms and conditions of work no longer is there working class unity even in the same company factory supermarket hospital or local authority when so many different sections have been set up it production department marketing and sales advertising human resources administration retail cashiers porters cleaners and buildings and services maintenance workers and others have different job descriptions terms and conditions of work and salaries this is the reason why we hardly ever see workers and staff in a company or other place of work unite to strike together in support of a particular section of their colleagues there is no doubt that these divisions have played a big role as workers in even a small company can be spread over different unions one might say anti union law in the uk made workers passive in fact had the workers been strong united and engaged in serious action when mrs thatcher the then prime minister of the united kingdom implemented the anti union law she would not have succeeded she did because the working class was weak divided demoralised and became strangers to themselves with the help of the unions and labour party the history of the working class in the 18th 19th and even the first half of the 20th century shows that the working class was more active and united at the time this was because at that time capitalism was relatively undeveloped and modern globalisation did not exist with advanced technologies and a good quality and quantity of working class many revolutionary leaders including karl marx believed was sufficient conditions existed for the revolution to take place so why did this not happen i leave the answer for the readers themselves secondly globalisation created additional developments including more middle managers and robots and growing sectors in retail travel and tourism and leisure and hospitality reports estimate that over 26 of the uk workforce are employed in these sectors according to a recent trade union congress report only about 2 6 million people across the uk work in manufacturing manufacturing has become a smaller part of the uk economy since the 1970s furthermore globalisation has created mass unemployment a huge number of refugees migrants poor people and workers on low or very low wages with no security almost everywhere and not just in europe the united states and other developed industrialised countries globalisation has pushed so many people to the very bottom of society marginalising them the marginalised people who i call proletarians include the unemployed pensioners students single parents whether working or on benefits the disabled and people with special needs people on benefits some small self employed and of course workers the vast majority live in poverty and some of them in absolute poverty we can find many countries in different parts of the world where almost half of the population earn only 1 or 2 a day these people economically socially and financially are much worse off than workers who have got a more or less better paid stable job and most of them live in secure accommodation we can see that everywhere proletarians are the vast majority they are the people whose lives deteriorate day by day and they are struggling they suffer a lot and are between a slow death and a struggle to survive luckily many of them go for a different choice and struggle against the state and system while the vast majority of people in any country are proletarians i believe that either there is no revolution or it will be a social revolution a people s revolution and not just a working class revolution having said that it does not mean that the working class has little role in the socialist revolution in fact without involving the working class whose participation and solidarity are essential either the movement or uprising can be transformed into civil war dominated by fundamentalist right wing groups or contained by authoritarian islamic groups as we have seen during the arab spring or takes so

lambert here my very limited understanding of eu architecture is that the recurring crises to which it is subject are by design intended to bring about the ever closer union but perhaps that design has reached its sell by date by barry eichengreen professor of economics and political science university of california berkeley originally published at the conversation new year s day 1999 saw the largest monetary changeover in history on that date just 20 years ago 12 members of the european union formally adopted a brand spanking new currency the euro today seven additional eu member states use it along with montenegro kosovo andorra monaco san marino and vatican city if survival is the ultimate gauge of success then this grand monetary experiment can be said to have succeeded but as investment advisers say past performance is no guarantee of future results history lesson to understand why it helps to recall the motivations of the euro s founders the first full throated call for a single european currency was in the werner report issued in 1970 its authors feared that the bretton woods system of currency pegs to the dollar was terminally ill and that its collapse would wreak havoc with exchange rates within europe and therefore with the continent s economy the proposal was renewed in 1989 in the delors report which presented a single currency as the capstone of europe s single market and its four freedoms free movement of goods capital services and labor but these economic arguments did not suffice to tip the political balance toward the euro in addition there was the belief of leaders like french president francois mitterrand and german chancellor helmut kohl that a single european currency would apply irresistible pressure for political integration it would lead eventually to their ultimate goal a european political federation not unlike the united states their logic ran as follows to function smoothly monetary union requires banking union in other words a single supervisor for all the banks and a union wide deposit insurance scheme otherwise banks overseen only by their national supervisors would be allowed to undertake cross border lending operations irrespective of the impact on neighboring countries and in the absence of a union wide deposit insurance scheme a run on the banks in one country could infect the banking systems of its neighbors similarly to operate smoothly a monetary union requires an integrated fiscal system like those of political federations such as australia and the united states states that give up their monetary policy to a higher authority can no longer adjust it to changing national conditions they can no longer lower interest rates to spur investment when the national economy is slowing more than those of its partners but if the partners operate an integrated fiscal system the more prosperous members can shift resources to the depressed region substituting for the no longer possible interest rate cuts here s the rub banking union and fiscal union will only be regarded as legitimate if those responsible for their operation can be held accountable for their decisions by citizens that means more power for the european parliament and less for national legislatures it means that monetary integration creates a logic and therefore irresistible pressure for political integration or so the euro s architects believed the fly in the ointment the problem is that the vast majority of europeans as distinct from the elites don t like the idea of giving up their national sovereignty they identify as german or italian first and as european only second if at all they have little appetite for pooling national sovereignty at the european level and 20 years of the euro have done little to change this hence there was no banking union in the first decade of the euro in its absence large amounts of capital cascaded across europe s internal borders banks in germany and france financed all manner of speculative investments in irish and spanish property markets and greece s public debt when in 2008 and 2009 problems developed in the economies on the receiving end of these flows the banks curtailed their lending the irish spanish and greek governments facing new constraints on their borrowing were forced to sharply compress their spending since there was no fiscal union to transfer resources to them from the more prosperous members but rather than advocating the creation such a system nationalistic commentators in germany and the members of the so called new hanseatic league made up of eight northern european union countries warned of the dreaded specter of transfer union in other words they warned that cross country transfers would all go one way and that they would be on the paying not the receiving end in the absence of the political solidarity required for such transfers the crisis countries were forced to double down on spending cuts for them the eurozone was transformed into an engine of deflation and depression the conclusion follows that absent a willingness to contemplate political union banking union and fiscal union are not possible and without them monetary union by itself will not stand still it breathes yet the euro is still with us it has survived for fully 20 years it survived the mother of all stress tests the global financial crisis as the greek irish and spanish crises all showed and as the italian crisis is showing again exiting the euro is even harder than exiting the european union as i explained more than a decade ago abandoning the currency would ignite a full blown financial crisis as depositors frantically liquidated their bank balances and investors dumped their government bonds to avoid seeing their savings devalued each time a european leader such as greece s newly elected prime minister alexis tsipras in 2015 has contemplated abandoning the euro this specter has caused a reversal but neither is the alternative of far reaching institutional reform in the cards at their summit last month european leaders agreed only to modest future steps to build out the monetary union they agreed to create a eurozone deposit insurance scheme but only after problems of nonperforming loans in italy and other countries were resolved which is to say no time soon they agreed to create a euro area fiscal capacity but only after high debts were brought down which means not in this lifetime they agreed to grant the european stability mechanism the rescue fund established in 2012 additional resources and powers but again only after existing bad loan problems are addressed which means at best in the very distant future this agreement falls far short of banking union fiscal union and political union it is an agreement to work toward rather than to establish it will not change the operation of the monetary union stumbling forward so the euro will stumble forward no one will be happy with its operation equally no one will leave progress will be minimal since there is no appetite for the political union needed to support fundamental reforms as a result the euro remains vulnerable to another crisis the next crisis could heighten the perceived urgency of fundamental reforms and lead europe s citizens to accept the modicum of political integration needed to implement them so reformed and restructured the euro would operate better or the next crisis could empower anti elite nationalist anti eu that is to say populist politicians making it impossible to implement even the modest reforms agreed in 2018 in which case the euro will function even less smoothly only one thing is certain history doesn t run in reverse for better or worse and both arguments can be made the euro is here to stay

hey there time traveller this article was published 05 01 2019 1918 days ago so information in it may no longer be current buenos aires like a grand dame fallen on hard times buenos aires was dimmed by economic collapse in between its paris like cafés and wrought iron balconies stood the blight of boarded storefronts on its great boulevards scavengers sifted through dumpsters for anything they could resell that was 2002 when i covered the debt default and currency devaluation that had devastated this nation but it s the fate of the argentines to live in a vicious loop back this month for the first time in 16 years i saw a country stuck in what has now become its natural state crisis as if living a déjà vu i flipped on the tv to once again hear argentine newscasters fretting about bailouts the diving peso and fears of default beggars even more than before panhandled on the same corner by an imposing church on santa fe avenue as others had done years before stores advertised going out of business sales ricardo mazalan the associated press files argentina under the leadership of president mauricio macri received the international monetary fund s largest bailout in history yet around them the jacaranda trees bloomed in the argentine spring the urban gentry kept up appearances well coiffed despite their private struggles as they strolled down streets lined with belle époque buildings young hipsters aired out their beards in the continent s most glorious urban parks this is the rub of argentina it s an italian car of a country on its surface graceful and sleek but under the hood it keeps breaking down in short argentina looks great but it doesn t work as if trapped in bill murray s groundhog day argentina is doomed to a repeating history of financial emergencies you can almost set your watch to it and worryingly the intervals between implosions are growing ever shorter it did not start this way in the 19th century history books questioned whether argentina or the united states would emerge as the new world s great power buoyed by vast european migration and fertile land that made it a global breadbasket argentina had more cars than france and was richer than japan jolted by the great depression argentina emerged from it relatively rapidly only to run into a brick wall named juan perón jonathan brown author of a brief history of argentina argues that perón s rise marked the start of the country s long slow slide right wing big government populism squandered argentina s fortunes on nationalized railroads and ports perón s pro labour policies cultivated devout working class followers but also laid the groundwork for the conversion of his party into an entity that would mirror a corrupt union by the early 1950s a crisis of confidence led to investor flight and soaring inflation later military governments oversaw the repression of the 1970s dirty war but also ever more haphazard economic mismanagement the country battled bouts of damaging inflation in 1955 1962 1966 and 1974 after the restoration of democracy in the 1980s argentina saw a bonanza of public sector hiring bloated budgets and extreme tax evasion a toxic combination that fuelled one of the globe s worst periods of hyperinflation in the 1990s argentina seemed to be back but it was only an illusion as a new class of free spending rich pumped up by borrowed money including from the international monetary fund imf ate and drank their way through what became known as the era of pizza and champagne they were almost indistinguishable from a fat cat political class that bilked the nation out of billions and turned argentina s economy into a ticking time bomb the ensuing collapse of 2002 would rank among the worst financial implosions of modern history overnight savings in pesos lost two thirds of their value unemployment shot above 20 per cent malnutrition unheard of in a nation that once fed the world took root in the devastated interior cristina fernández de kirchner the perónist ex president took the helm a decade ago ushering in a new era of fudged financial data and populism thus the year 2014 brought another recession and debt crisis four years later and now under president mauricio macri argentina sought the largest bailout in imf history to stay afloat but inflation is again soaring the peso is worth nearly a tenth what it was six years ago against the u s dollar as macri tries to undo fernández s populism stripping away for instance heavy subsidies for electricity the argentines are feeling the pain winnipeg free

it s 2019 a huge election year for louisiana and all the political messaging will be asking openly or subliminally who runs this state it s a question the politicians have been forcing you to ask yourself for the past three years as the republican controlled legislature the state house in particular and the republican attorney general have wrestled with the democratic governor to assert party ideology and dominance over governmental policies and practices in louisiana this year voters are not only facing selections for governor and other statewide elected officials but will also be picking their next legislators those men and women will have in addition to their lawmaking duties the added responsibility for drawing new district lines following the 2020 census affecting louisiana political outcomes for at least another decade into the future the potential rewards of that type of influence are immense and so the political ads we ll be seeing and hearing will expand beyond personal snapshots of those offering themselves for service to the state special interest groups are filling their war chests stockpiling their ideological ammunition and prepping to launch their assaults via airwaves and cyberspace these state elections will undoubtedly be the most expensive in louisiana s 207 year history throughout louisiana s statehood the question of who runs this state has been asked often queen sugar and king cotton were the state s earliest economic drivers and while louisiana indirectly benefited from the early to mid 19th century industrial revolution the state also ultimately lost population as a consequence factories grew elsewhere while louisiana grew and exported the raw cotton and sugar that would clothe and sweeten the lives of the nation s expanding population deep beneath louisiana s fertile soil another natural resource awaited as commerce and industry expanded elsewhere so did the demands for ways to fuel it in 1870 a night watchman in shreveport lit a match and accidentally discovered natural gas coming from a recently drilled artesian well in 1901 nine months after and 90 miles east of the first texas oil gusher spindletop an oil well drilled near jennings louisiana also began gushing forth black gold by 1906 the state legislature had passed its first oil and gas laws and in 1909 the first oil refinery in the state what is now the exxon refinery in baton rouge came on line some quarter of a million oil and gas wells have been drilled in louisiana since then though 35 of them some 80 000 ended up as dry holes and this state was a major contributor in fueling the nation s phenomenal growth throughout the 20th century for most of previous century oil and gas interests ruled in and over louisiana the peak of the state s oil production was exactly 50 years ago however in 1969 with more than 728 million barrels produced it has been declining ever since within five years of that production peak several scientific studies were released showing that louisiana s coastal land mass has been declining in direct correlation to its oil and gas production it was dr sandra m gagliano s 1973 study that estimated 39 of louisiana s land loss was due to the industries dredging of canals through the coastal wetlands realizing their influence was waning as their industry s environmental impacts were being documented discussed and disfavored oil and gas concerns developed a new tactic 25 years ago the economic impact study louisiana mid continent oil and gas association released the first of its kind study in 1993 showing the offshore oil and gas industry provided louisiana with a positive economic impact of more than 3 billion each year that report had the desired effect in 1994 the state legislature passed a massive incentive package foregoing state revenue from severance taxes for certain types of wells including wells deeper than 15 000 feet and those that run horizontally and as lmoga s own history of the industry proudly declares oil and gas activity increased sharply after passage of the incentive legislation of course prices for crude oil which had been around 25 per barrel at the start of 1994 went up around then as well increasing to over 45 per barrel by the start of 1997 by november 1998 the price per barrel had plunged again to a low of 17 25 nearly ten years later though in june of 2008 the price per barrel of oil reached an all time high of 161 28 in late august 2014 oil dropped below the hundred dollar per barrel mark continuing to decline to 36 per barrel by early 2016 as of the end of 2018 the price was hanging around 45 per barrel in 1982 just over 42 of louisiana s total state general fund came from mineral revenues oil and gas severance taxes and royalties in the current budget year those sources are barely more than 6 of total state general fund revenue and in the current budget year we the people through individual income taxes and sales taxes we pay provide 74 of louisiana s state general fund revenue yet the power dynamic has not changed to completely reflect the preferences of who is really paying the state s bills from severance tax exemptions to the industrial tax exemption program itep louisiana keeps subsidizing the profitability of these industries because jobs that s the threat they always use if louisiana taxpayers don t give them tax break after tax break they ll take their businesses and jobs elsewhere they won t of course they can t the last time a new refinery was built in the u s was 1977 42 years ago and that was the marathon facility in garyville louisiana other states won t offer them the opportunities to profit that we have as for the overall oil and gas related jobs in louisiana dr loren scott the economist who has been doing the industry s economic impact studies for the past 25 years reported the 2018 jobs total at 44 580 in 2008 it was 53 000 and in 1998 it was nearly 82 000 that s a 46 decline over the past 20 years what the industry seldom says is that advances in computerized controls and automation have eliminated the need for people to actually do many of these jobs in truth these industries have consistently applied for iteps avoiding the payment of local property taxes for up to a decade for improvement projects that actually eliminate jobs rather than creating them up until recently they got those tax breaks nearly automatically louisiana remains a petro colonial state with our good masters consistently seeking rules and laws that favor their status and keep them flush with money to propagandize the people and contribute to the campaigns of candidates who will see the issues in a way that is advantageous for the oil and gas industry consider what we now know of exxon s subterfuges for example in the 1970s even as they were funding lsu s initial research and studies into remedies for louisiana coastal land loss the petrochemical giant was also conducting pioneering research into global climate change yet after one of exxon s senior scientists informed company executives that in 1977 there was general scientific agreement that burning fossil fuels was accelerating the global warming phenomenon exxon continued their climate modeling research but they quit speaking of it openly ultimately in 1982 exxon s scientists determined that significant reduction in fossil fuel consumption would be necessary to curtail future climate change the internal report to exxon executives also noted there is concern among some scientific groups that once the effects of climate change are measurable they might not be reversible bless exxon s heart they didn t tell any of us instead they poured profits into an intentional public campaign of disinformation questioning the science and fact of global warming utilizing the same strategies previously employed by big tobacco regarding smoking and lung cancer and along with koch industries provided climate change denying organizations with tens of millions of dollars in support here in louisiana the oil and gas industry paid lobbyists to argue against alternative energy proposals they ultimately killed off the state s solar energy tax credit program which benefited homeowners and the environment while arguing to keep their own industry s corporate concessions intact they sought and received designations of refineries and now pipelines as critical infrastructure protectable at gunpoint and making protesting those developments a felony they have battled and defeated every piece of proposed legislation to limit or even study industrial groundwater usage and they ve defeated every attempt to require facilities install fenceline air quality monitors even as the oil and chemical companies settled epa lawsuits citing them for decades of excess emissions in violation of the clean air act the industry fought tooth and nail in 2014 to kill the southeast louisiana levee board lawsuit which accused 97 oil gas and pipeline companies of damaging the wetlands they continue to try and buy elections of parish officials in an effort to kill off the 42 coastal land loss lawsuits now pending trial in federal court all this despite the companies having signed agreements before dredging all those coastal canals agreements which promised they would follow state law requiring proper maintenance of the rights of way and eventual restoration of the land to its original condition photo courtesy coalition to restore coastal louisiana this coming year the oil and gas companies and their allied chemical industries all of which would continue their power and control over louisiana will once again be pushing tort reform measures in the legislature these industries are now utilizing portions of their profits to promote the narrative that louisiana is a judicial hellhole because trial lawyers are running the state with the unspoken but implied addendum of into the ground gov john bel edwards is by trade an attorney and he is running for re election this year an opinion piece published in the wall street journal in march of 2018 previewed the tactics oil and gas interests will be using to try and defeat him branding him as a trial lawyer who wants to retain power along with all his trial lawyer friends the author of that commentary allysia finley is rated right for her media bias according to allsides com certainly right wing bloggers and columnists with other publications picked upon her commentary and over the following week amplified it with statements such as the trouble with trial lawyers is that for the most part they suck the life out of the economy and they all re iterated the oil and gas industry s mantra the oil industry is booming in texas while it is stagnant or declining in louisiana blame it on the state and several parishes filling lawsuits against the industry unsurprisingly exxonmobil shell ppg and especially koch industries have been longtime heavy funders of the american tort reform association the group that publishes an annual judicial hellholes report louisiana is usually ranked near the top of this report with accompanying statements such as the pelican state s legal climate has suffered at the hands of powerful trial attorneys and the politicians they have controlled for decades gov john bel edwards a trial lawyer has helped further stack the deck against defendants down on the bayou and louisiana is unlikely to escape this litigiously fevered swamp anytime soon the most recent hellhole report issued dec 26 2018 ranks louisiana number five up from number eight the previous year california is number one followed by florida new york city and st louis missouri then louisiana topverdicts com s most recent list of the 100 highest court awards in civil lawsuits does show california with 33 of the top 100 verdicts florida has 11 on that list but the highest awards and the greatest number in the top 100 42 were in texas including the top two verdicts one was for half a billion dollars with the biggest verdict being for more than 8 billion both of those cases were for business to business breach of contract texas did not make the judicial hellholes list at all louisiana ranked number 5 did not have a single case among the top 100 verdicts yet the oil and gas industry keeps telling us texas is doing things right while louisiana suffers because trial lawyers are the problem texas ironically is also the example these same industry apologists use as an example of successful tort reform initiatives oil and gas isn t the only business sector trying to attribute louisiana s problems to trial lawyers the louisiana association of business and industry has long been engaged in demonizing trial lawyers as the bane of louisiana business while they ve waged a campaign for civil justice reform as they re now calling it labi has long been the primary financial funder of louisiana lawsuit abuse watch which claims to be a citizen watchdog group dedicated to stopping lawsuit abuse that threatens local businesses and jobs all they seem to do though is recycle reports from other questionable sources in furtherance of the campaign for tort reform labi will be making tort reform their top issue during the upcoming 2019 legislative session labi president stephen waguespack who was former gov bobby jindal s executive counsel and is himself a lawyer by trade wrote a column october 3 2018 titled it s time for some 1 800 legalreform in it he said it s all about the incentives created by the state capitol over the years to promote a lawsuit culture in louisiana what has never been honestly discussed with the public are the laws the louisiana legislature has put in place and protected over the years to intentionally incentivize and promote one of the most active lawsuit industries in the entire nation laws that have become strong incentives created by the louisiana legislature to create a robust and competitive business environment for trial lawyers labi will be branding this year s effort to reform civil justice as a pro consumer idea they re already using the high cost of auto insurance in louisiana as their focus blaming it on the law that says lawsuits in auto accidents and any other civil issues must involved claims of 50 000 or more in order to be heard before a jury instead of just a judge this conveniently ignores the 2006 abolition of the louisiana insurance rating commission a body that publicly heard and debated insurance rate hike requests instead those rate increases are decided by the insurance commissioner alone the holder of that office throughout the past dozen years jim donelon has argued all along that the best way to combat louisiana s high insurance rates is to make the state a better place to do business baton rouge business report executive editor j r ball has indicated he s throwing in with the blame the lawyers scenario he wrote on october 10 2018 the folks at truth in accounting a state debt transparency organization say louisiana s fiscal afflictions are merely symptoms of an even more sinister underlying problem too many lawyers what ball didn t do or at least didn t write about is look into truth in accounting which gave louisiana a grade of d sourcewatch org says tia is a right wing 501 c 3 nonprofit and uses the american legislative exchange council s alec s rich states poor states state economic outlook rankings analysis as its database alec which claims to be a membership organization of state legislators instead actually receives 98 of its funding from corporations and corporate foundations alec provides state lawmakers with sample legislation most of which is designed to according to the center for media and democracy undermine environmental regulations and deny climate change support school privatization undercut health care reform defund unions and limit their political influence restrain legislature s abilities to raise revenue through taxes mandate strict election laws that disenfranchise voters among many other issues labi was founded in the mid 1970s with one primary goal to bust the unions through passing the right to work law in the intervening years labi and its affiliated group members have been consistent advocates before louisiana legislative committees in alignment with the alec objectives iterated above and it s a segment of labi s membership that has been working behind the scenes for more than a decade preparing to make their big move toward becoming the next answer to the question of who runs louisiana let s call them the erector set in our next several stories we ll be exploring who what and how they re working to shift the power of state government into their full control
us stocks rose slightly last week masking a violently volatile opening week to the year on wall street the bungee cord action is likely to continue this week especially if there are any developments in trade negotiations surprisingly soft data in both the us and china have raised the stakes for negotiations between the two nations scheduled for this week as delegations prepare to flesh out the deal struck between presidents donald trump and xi jinping on jan 7 and jan 8 in beijing they may hold the fate of the decade old bull market in their hands for now the market mood is skewed towards optimism but skittishness persists after the worst december performance for major indexes in decades ever a wild card the trump administration has become even more unstable vowing an indefinite partial government shutdown as mr trump goes all in in his fight with the democratic house over a border wall the dow jones industrial average slid 660 points on thursday after some of investors december fears were realised in the us the institute for supply management s survey of factory activity showed its most marked deceleration since the onset of the great recession in 2008 more than likely we will see the manufacturing data snap back in the new year it will really snap back if the us and china lay the ground work for a trade truce said phil flynn senior market analyst at the price futures group in a note to clients corroborating the macroeconomic data apple took the almost unprecedented step of lowering its revenue projection for the quarter citing weak demand in china the warning caused shares to drop by more than 10 per cent wiping out tens of billions of dollars of market value nor is apple likely to be the last us multinational to experience this pain many major american companies from restaurateur yum brands to jet maker boeing have credited the chinese market for much of their growth in recent years the other shock came from china where factory activity reportedly shrank to the greatest extent since 2017 these reports momentarily convinced investors that the december selloff was a rational discounting of an economic slowdown rather than an irrational panic as stock bulls had maintained but friday s developments raised the possibility that stock market volatility was a false alarm after all us employers added 312 000 workers to payrolls in december nearly doubling the average economist prediction now the bears were wrongfooted questioning the analysis that us economic growth had passed its peak the dow jones recovered thursday s losses adding 746 points in all economists at brokerage bank of america merrill lynch global research called the jobs report exceptional today s report points to continued strength for consumer spending going forward said boa merrill lynch economists strong job gains coupled with rising wages should act as a tailwind for consumption additionally the decline in gasoline prices helps to support consumption to us wage growth is the most important metric to watch in jobs data these days especially as recessionary fears increase and anxiety around federal reserve fed policy remains high said john lynch chief investment strategist at brokerage lpl financial in a note to clients gains after the jobs report were moderate at first likely because of the implications of wage growth for interest rates inflation often shows up first in wage data and the central bank has promised to be responsive to such data but federal reserve chairman jerome powell speaking publicly after the jobs report hinted that the central bank was not yet concerned about inflation and would remain patient with rate hikes his comments echoed those of dallas fed president robert kaplan who advocated waiting until it becomes clear whether the market rout had foreshadowed any economic slowdown before proceeding with the planned rate hike cycle some slowdown in corporate earnings growth is inevitable for one thing rising wages tend to crimp earnings average hourly earnings grew 3 2 per cent year over year in december the fastest pace of the cycle said mr lynch still that growth rate was below excessive levels that have historically preceded economic recessions other major us corporations may echo apple s sales or earnings warning as first quarter earnings reporting season approaches still the bulls have the momentum in the short term if only because the stock market works like a bungee rope the speed of the drop in december has made big rebounds like friday s likely to continue even if the major indexes like bungee jumpers never regain their former heights portfolio strategists at brokerage boa merrill lynch described the behaviour of global stocks in 2018 as apocalypse dow as former fed chairman ben bernanke said the recent scare is still a blip compared with the 2008 financial crisis and yet according to the bank of america strategists us 20 trillion of stock market value has been wiped out in the last 12 months the record breaking flight of money from stock mutual funds in december was consistent with capitulation the washout that typically happens before markets turn around again the bank of america strategists said
us job creation vaults higher in 2018 the surge in us employment in december was helped by a jump in manufacturing jobs notably for durable goods us job creation rocketed higher last month a jolt of unexpected good news for president donald trump as his economic agenda comes under increasing strain with an unexpectedly strong finish to 2018 the blowout us jobs numbers were a reminder that the world s largest economy remains in good health for the moment sharply contrasting with gloom on global financial markets in recent weeks fears over a slowing world economy last month caused stock prices to tumble and confidence waned among corporations who foresee dwindling demand and weakening sales in 2019 but the december jobs news helped prompt a rebound on wall street with all three major indices rallying after thursday s rout employers added a whopping 312 000 net new positions for the month smashing economists expectations and wages rose steadily gaining 3 2 percent for the year the unemployment rate ticked up by two tenths of a point to 3 9 percent but mostly because the labor force grew as more workers joined the job hunt according to the closely watched report and net job gains in october and november were revised up a combined 58 000 the labor department said job creation last year rose to a monthly average of 220 000 positions far higher than the 182 000 recorded in 2017 but lower than 2014 and 2015 a sign that 2018 was boosted by unusual tax cuts and fiscal stimulus the fresh signal that although wall street may be ailing the real economy is chugging along was sure to delight trump rising interest rates however the new evidence of a strong economy could add to the case for the federal reserve to continue to raise interest rates this year something trump has aggressively and publicly complained about the us unemployment rate ticked up two tenths in december but that was largely due to more workers joining the labor force forecasts from fed officials last month indicated they expect just two rate hikes in 2019 amid signs of weakness rather than three jim o sullivan of high frequency economics said the unemployment rate is already low enough to put upward pressure on labor costs the recent turmoil in markets is raising the likelihood of some slowing ahead although these data provide a reminder of how strong the trend has been before whatever slowing occurs he said wall street forged higher following the jobs news aided by an announcement that us china trade talks were due to resume next week in beijing the rally kicked into high gear and the dow jones industrial average ended with a posting a 3 3 percent gain also helped by federal reserve chairman jerome powell who said the us central bank would be patient in deciding on any further increases in the benchmark lending rates trump faces protracted political battles in 2019 and the danger he could be blamed should the economy stumble amid a government shutdown and a stinging trade war with china hiring last month jumped in healthcare bars and restaurants construction and notably in manufacturing especially for durable goods fabricated metal products and computers and electronics all sectors that complain of lower profits and lost sales due to global trade tensions the report also suggested there was rising hope among job seekers the labor force participation rate a measure of the total supply of employed people and those available and searching for work rose to its highest level since september 2017 at 63 1 percent of the working age population the 3 2 percent wage gains compared to 2017 also meant workers saw increased purchasing power as consumer inflation over the same period was a slower 2 2 percent the sudden jump in hiring could be explained by weather effects as much of the nation experienced unusually cold temperatures during the november survey week while december was unseasonably warm we expected a strong payroll number after the distortions of recent months due to two hurricanes the california fires and the very cold november survey week but this is spectacular said economist ian shepherdson of pantheon macroeconomics advertisement but he cautioned that this pace can t be sustained
spread the love schools open this week against a backdrop of rising school fees and uniform prices that have left most parents and their children stranded fears yesterday as parents rounded off preparations were that many children would either miss school or go with inadequate fees and uniforms as the sums fail to add up the past few weeks have witnessed astronomical and highly unjustifiable price spikes where most school stuff is priced in united states dollars while schools are demanding that a portion of the fees be paid in greenback yet its common knowledge that most people have no access to foreign currency it is unfortunate that calls by government and other stakeholders for schools to review fees to realistic levels have fallen on deaf ears while uniform suppliers have also not taken heed fleecing customers and parents is not a sustainable way of running business this will soon show unless sanity is restored it is common cause that the past few months have witnessed a significant decline in the purchasing power but not to the extent that the schools and uniform suppliers have revised prices they need to hold their heads in shame education is a basic human right and all stakeholders in the sector should do their part in ensuring that no child is denied such we are certainly not oblivious to the rising costs of some raw materials goods and other services but the penchant to profiteer and engage in a self destructive mode by some sectors is quite saddening if not repulsive raising prices induce inflationary pressures in the economy and these will also come back to haunt the very retailers schools and others that have chosen this destructive path the rise in the rate of inflation to 31 percent in october should mean that the pricing issue has become more sensitive hence responsible corporate citizens should not be seen engaging in inflationary tendencies as is the case presently a blazer that fetched between 30 and 50 last term now demands between 250 and 500 based on what of course the first term has never been an easy one for parents as children graduate into primary school or high school but the price spikes have compounded the situation at least some witty parents placed their orders with local tailors savings themselves huge amounts of money but this should have been just an alternative while those that afforded buying straight from shops should have had it as a not so expensive option however mere lament has not changed the situation the suppliers and the schools have not relented but we feel this issue needs to be given active attention the consumer council of zimbabwe should actively engage stakeholders in the education sector and make noise until sanity prevails furthermore we do not advocate for price controls but there is need for government to instil discipline in this sector and many others where consumers are being taken for a ride zimbabwe is renowned for its high literacy levels and issues such as school uniform prices should not be allowed to scuttle plans to maintain this record we are likely to see some students failing to go to school when they open on tuesday maybe delaying by several weeks as parents and guardians scrounge for fees and uniform this would really be a sad day for our country a day lost away from school impacts on students confidence and academic progress as difficult as it maybe to implement consumers should just boycott suppliers that have made wild price increases this will not be practical in instances where specific schools either supply the uniforms or are in partnerships with specific retailers indeed the austerity measures contained in the 2019 national budget are quite painful but better days lie ahead this calls for institutions and individuals that will not make selfish decisions to fleece parents of their hard earned money but requires corporate citizens that seek to provide solutions instead of complicating the situation we implore that sanity prevails in the education sector teachers are parents as well so this whole mayhem with uniforms and prices may affect the discharge of their duties it then becomes a futile situation and yet a win win scenario is more progressive and benefits both the retailer and the customer however the obtaining situation also brings to the fore the need for parents to send children to schools they can afford and those within their zones to cut on transport and other costs in such times parents need to be sober enough to live within their means to cushion themselves against the harsh environment overall as zimbabweans we should pull in the same direction to overcome challenges in the economy this will enable us to collectively deliver a better nation of ourselves and for posterity share this share twitter facebook email linkedin reddit pinterest whatsapp like this like loading
a tumultuous first trading week of 2019 headed towards a calmer close after hitting a 33 months low the bloomberg commodity index managed to climb to record its first weekly gain in five the global market rout was caused by economic and political uncertainty as well as tightening liquidity paused on friday after beijing confirmed that a us trade delegation would visit on january 7 8 hopes for a breakthrough have been raised as the impact of the trade war between the us and china begins to show up in weaker than expected economic data from the world s two biggest economies while us stocks began january having recorded their worst december since the early 1930s the currency market had been a sea of calm at least up until this week the first profit warning in 16 years from apple due to a slowdown in chinese demand sent a shiver through the markets and helped trigger a global risk off wave this combined with an illiquid holiday market in japan saw the japanese yen rip higher the audjpy cross often seen as a proxy for the health of the asian market dropped by 7 per cent before recovering all its losses once tokyo reopened on friday these and other developments helped send the dollar lower for a third week thereby providing some additional support for commodities into this mix of uncertainty and volatility commodities generally managed to kick off 2019 with gains across most sectors the bellwether oil sector led from the front with global growth and demand concerns outweighed by a dramatic december production cut from opec led by saudi arabia brent crude which in late december found support at the critical technical and psychological 50 barrel level was heading for its best week since last april precious metals surged higher for a third week but calmer markets elsewhere and very overbought conditions as revealed by the relative strength index have raised the need for consolidation this phase now seems to have emerged with profit taking seen in gold after it briefly touched 1 300 oz on friday the table below shows how movements of the dollar stocks and bonds have supported renewed demand for safe haven assets such as gold however silver has been the best performer of the two on its historical cheapness to gold going forward developments across these markets will help determine the strength of demand and with that the direction those looking for a longer term bet on gold tend to use exchange traded funds and this sector saw the biggest increase in total holdings last quarter since q1 17 hedge funds finally turned net long at the beginning of december after holding a record net short in comex gold futures back in early october please note that due to the us government shutdown the cftc has not issued any commitments of traders reports since the week of december 18 the cot report provides an important weekly insight into the size and direction of positions held by hedge funds across key futures markets from currencies to bonds and not least commodities the outlook for gold into 2019 looks promising at this stage we believe that it may take some time for stocks to recover with news from the us china trade negotiations and q4 earnings likely to set the short term direction the federal reserve is widely expected to further reduce its current call for another two rate hikes this year the dollar as usual holds the key for gold and at this stage we see the risk of further dollar weakness although it may not fully emerge before the second half of this year after rallying by 138 since august and following its best quarterly performance since q1 17 gold looks set to pause after briefly touching 1 300 oz given the recent strength and changed sentiment towards safe haven assets we suspect a correction could run out of steam before 1 265 oz bulls may only begin to worry on a break below 1 250 oz as the potential for further gains remain elevated crude oil is beginning to show signs of support following the 40 per cent collapse since last october since hitting the key technical and psychological 50 b level last week it has managed to recover strongly due to an improved outlook for both supply and potentially also demand on the supply side the dallas fed in its q4 energy survey said that the region s oil and gas sector growth had stalled amid the sharp oil price decline the anonymous comments from top oil and gas executives provide a good insight into the renewed stress caused by the dramatic price slump us shale oil production growth is likely to slow following the price slump but if the 2014 to 2016 sell off is anything to go by it may take up to six months before the impact becomes visible in the data which for now continue to show year on year growth close to 2 million barrels day while doubts are being raised by us production growth going forward opec responded strongly to the worsening outlook by slashing december crude oil production by the most since january 2017 monthly production surveys from bloomberg and reuters both showed that opec had cut production by around 500 000 barrels to 32 6 million barrels day the slump was led by a voluntary reduction from saudi arabia 420 000 b d and unplanned reductions from iran 120 000 b d and libya 110 000 b d
trump assails fed as the only problem our economy has president donald trump lashed out at the federal reserve on monday after administration officials spent the weekend trying to assure the public and financial markets that jerome powell s job as fed chairman was safe the only problem our economy has is the fed the president tweeted monday they don t have a feel for the market they don t understand necessary trade wars or strong dollars or even democrat shutdowns over borders the fed is like a powerful golfer who can t score because he has no touch he can t putt on wall street stocks had already been down but intensified their fall after trump s tweet markets are facing their worst month in a decade over fears about a u s trade war with china a slowing global economy and chaos in the trump white house by the close of a holiday shortened trading session monday the dow jones industrial average had sunk 653 points for the day 2 9 percent trump s latest tweet attacking the fed was met with concern that any effort to diminish powell or remove him as chairman could destabilize the economy he is seeking open warfare on christmas eve said peter conti brown a financial historian at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania we ve never seen anything like this full blown and full frontal assault this is a disaster for the fed a disaster for the president and a disaster for the economy the president has expressed frustration over the fed s decision to raise its key short term rate four times this year those moves are intended to prevent the economy from overheating at a time of brisk growth and an unemployment rate near a half century low federal reserve chairman jerome powell speak at a news conference in washington wednesday dec 19 2018 the federal reserve is raising its key interest rate for the fourth time this year to reflect the u s economy s continued strength but signaling that it expects to slow hikes next year ap photo susan walsh at a news conference last week powell explained that the rate hikes were evidence of the economy s strength but trump sees the increases which lead to higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses as an economic and political threat the president s attacks are widely seen as an intrusion on the political independence of the fed which exists to determine the flow of money based off economic data on employment and inflation fed independence has long been among the bedrocks of the u s financial markets it ensures that central bankers can make politically unpopular decisions such as fighting high inflation in the 1980s or rescuing banks after the 2008 financial crisis sen richard shelby of alabama a senior republican on the banking committee has cautioned against removing powell i d be very careful doing that shelby told reporters saturday at the capitol the federal reserve is set up to be independent stocks did decline after powell announced this year s fourth rate hike on wednesday but the sell off appeared to reflect concerns that the fed might be moving too fast in its plans to raise rates and to shrink its vast portfolio of bonds given an economic slowdown that is expected in 2019 fed officials voted unanimously to increase rates last week among those voting with powell were three other board members who were chosen by trump richard clarida randal quarles and michelle bowman the president expressed his displeasure monday with the fed after treasury secretary steve mnuchin had tweeted on saturday that powell s job was safe mnuchin also tweeted on sunday that he had checked with the heads of the six largest u s banks to ensure that they had enough liquidity to operate in a stock market that has tumbled sharply since october my sense is the mnuchin tweets don t tell us much about the economy but they provide unusual insight into the chaos inside the white house said joseph brusuelas chief economist at the consultancy rsm rather than instilling confidence it created confusion and raised more questions than it answered foremost among those is how safe is the job of jay powell as chairman of the federal reserve ___ advertisement ap chief congressional correspondent lisa mascaro contributed to this report

a friend sent me this tweet of congress president rahul gandhi and asked me for comments congress built the india growth story modi has used demonetisation and the gabbar singh tax to completely destroy it heâ s an incompetent man who listens to nobody here is my response travesty congress under p v narasimha rao built india s growth story on a set of policy proposals that were prepared before rao took office congress in the 1950s did not do a bad job india s growth was comparable congress in the sixties and in the seventies messed up india big time barring a year or two in between the war with china in itself was a colossal policy failure on the positive side indira gandhi s green revolution was a good example her overture to ronald reagan on inviting american technology companies to set up shop in india opened the way for the it revolution but her negatives far outweighed the one or two good initiatives undermining of institutions institutionalising corruption reversal of federalism etc congress in the eighties indira gandhi on her return did a decent job from 1980 to 1982 initiated economic liberalisation r venkataraman played an important role in that period as the finance minister tried to weaken the iron grip of the state on the country she lost her way from 1983 to 1984 rajiv gandhi meant well and did a few good things from 1985 to 1987 telecom revolution should be credited to him initiated de licensing by allowing broadbanding of licences but lasted only two years lost his way from 1987 until 1989 so out of the 67 years up to 2014 the congress ruled for 54 years not counting the united front coalition years out of those it provided decent governance only in some areas for about 15 to 16 years these 54 years include the five year term of rao from 2004 to 2008 the congress party did not contribute to india s economic growth it rode the global growth wave and india s growth was aided by an unsustainable investment boom facilitated by equally unsustainable capital inflows these investments were largely unproductive too from 2009 to 2014 the costs of the unsustainable growth of the previous five years became manifest they are still being felt and incurred by the country double digit inflation and the collapse of the indian rupee are but two of the testimonies tax terrorism started from the budget of 2012 13 and unfortunately has continued under this government with greater vigour from 2014 to 2018 india suffered monsoon failures and global growth slowdown india had to use the bonanza from the crude oil price crash to repair the country s finances left in utter disrepair by the previous government demonetisation was not thought through thoroughly and implemented badly yet it is possible that its long run benefits outweigh the costs goods and services tax will surely be a long run success story as is the insolvency and bankruptcy framework short term glitches are inevitable in a big country such as this and some of the glitches are due to external technology support from private sector formalisation of the indian economy is sorely needed this government has made crucial beginnings in many important ways in this largely unpopular task the development of the northeastern region of the country and its integration with the rest of the nation will have huge long run dividends for example the recently completed bridge in assam was 21 years in the making in the first 17 years there was scarcely any progress on its construction in sum based on track record incompetence is a charge more easily attached to the leadership of the previous united progressive alliance government there is empirical evidence this article first appeared in the gold standard and has been republished here with permission
washington ap federal reserve chairman jerome powell said friday that he will not resign if asked to do so by president donald trump and that he is prepared to be patient in deciding when to raise interest rates again both of those messages cheered stock market investors who had been worried about trump s repeated attacks on his hand picked choice to lead the nation s central bank and also the fed s seemingly inexorable march to higher rates there is no pre set path for policy powell said during an appearance at a conference of economists in atlanta with the muted inflation readings we have seen coming in we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves private economists viewed powell s comments as a strong signal that the fed which in december had projected another two rate hikes in 2019 may end up deciding to pause hikes for several months with chairman powell s remarks today i would say they will do just one hike or maybe no hikes this year said sung won sohn chief economist at ss economics powell is definitely trying to calm the markets wall street which opened sharply higher after a report showing 312 000 jobs gained in december surged even higher during powell s appearance the dow jones industrial average finished the day up 746 points or 3 3 percent powell called the jobs report very strong and said he was also encouraged by the rise in the labor force participation rate and gains in wages which he said for me at this time does not raise concerns about too high inflation trump has complained that the fed has pushed rates higher despite the fact that there is no evidence that inflation was getting out of control the president s attacks had become so intense that they had raised concerns that he might be considering firing powell a development which could send the market into a tailspin trump would appear to be on shaky legal ground if he tried to fire powell under the law that governs the federal reserve a president can only remove a fed chairman for cause courts in cases that involved other agencies have interpreted that language to not cover policy differences asked if he would resign if trump asked him to do so powell responded with a short no powell s willingness to be flexible on interest rates was welcome news to investors many of whom worried that fed chair risked cutting off the current economic expansion by continuing to raise interest rates despite signs the u s economy was cooling off a little on friday powell said we are always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly if necessary to meet the goals of maximum employment and stable prices powell gave as an example the fact that in 2016 when janet yellen was fed chair the central bank began the year with a projection that it would raise rates four times that year but ended up raising rates only once because the economy hit a soft patch appearing on a panel with his two predecessors yellen and ben bernanke powell also said that the fed could alter its approach to trimming its huge balance sheet if it determines such a change is needed the pace of fed rate hikes and the lowering of the balance sheet which tends to put upward pressure on interest rates had both been concerns of investors in recent months the stock market has seen stomach churning declines since october a development that trump has blamed on the fed s continued rate hikes although the president s trade dispute with china as well as concerns about global economic growth also played a part in the market volatility the fed had increased the size of its balance sheet four fold to a record 4 5 trillion in an effort to push long term interest rates lower but it has been gradually reversing that stance over the past year although the balance sheet still remains above 4 trillion but some investors have worried that that process could push long term rates higher at a time when the economy was slowing powell on friday stressed that the fed was prepared to adjust the pace at which it trimmed the balance sheet if necessary to support economic growth while trump has sent out a number of tweets criticizing powell and calling the fed the biggest threat to the economy powell said that he had not received any direct pressure from the white house asked if he had had any face to face meetings with trump powell said he had not although he said previous fed leaders have had discussions from time to time with previous presidents
mass protests proposed by the combined force of civil servants labour unions and the opposition mdc alliance have plunged president emmerson mnangagwa and his zanu pf party into panic amid fears the unfolding economic crisis could morph into a fully fledged uprising of november 2017 proportions mass protests proposed by the combined force of civil servants labour unions and the opposition mdc alliance have plunged president emmerson mnangagwa and his zanu pf party into panic amid fears the unfolding economic crisis could morph into a fully fledged uprising of november 2017 proportions by everson mushava political observers opined in interviews last week that this could have been the reason why the president cut short his leave zimbabwe is in the throes of a debilitating economic crisis that has sparked widespread labour unrest and general despondency in the populace that has been thrust into poverty and despair owing to the sudden loss of value of the country s surrogate currency the bond note workers salaries were recently devalued four fold by the tacit concession by authorities that the bond note is not equivalent to the united states dollar when the reserve bank of zimbabwe announced that the two currencies could no longer be housed in the same account the announcement immediately sent the bond note spiralling downslope to as much as 1 to 6 against the us dollar as attempts by finance minister mthuli ncube to claim the two still traded at par failed to convince the market prices of goods and services responded accordingly and soon basic commodities were priced four times higher than the previous us dollar rate and even products such as cement which used to cost 10 bond immediately shot up to over 30 bond or usd 10 the situation has not changed to date the workers soon became agitated beginning with doctors who demanded to be paid in us dollars followed by teachers and the rest of the civil service who are now demanding same the government has called a meeting tomorrow with representatives of all civil servants in the hope of stemming what could degenerate into a mass labour unrest which labour unions and the opposition mdc could capitalise on to stage mass protests that they have already planned despite the meeting called by the government tomorrow the zimbabwe teachers association zimta last night formally declared its members would not be reporting for duty when schools open on tuesday they cited the systematic erosion of their salaries sharp rise of prices of basic commodities and transport fares and the charging of many goods in us dollars zimta president richard gundane said government had failed to address any of their grievances and concerns despite previous engagements and discussions our members are unable to report for duty with effect from the 8th of january 2019 due to incapacitation gundane said to enable the teacher to report for work and to subsist we demand payment of salaries in us dollars doctors have been on strike for the past 36 days over similar demands while the zimbabwe congress of trade unions and the mdc have called for protests over the deteriorating economic situation in the country sources said the panicky mnangagwa government was now desperate to find ways to stop imminent unrest in the country as this would make it vulnerable considering the manner in which mnangagwa came into power through a military coup in november 2017 the sources said there were fears that low ranking security personnel feeling the pinch of the economic meltdown might subtly support the protests and render the security situation in the country volatile the government is now panicking there are threats from every corner from its workers demanding salaries in us dollars to industry where companies producing utility goods are demanding payment for goods in the greenback the source said mnangagwa has been projecting himself as a reformed person and it will be difficult for him to use brute force to deal with the protests the ghost of the august 1 shooting is still haunting him and he is desperate for ways to resolve the crisis zanu pf the source added was now desperate to blame mdc leader nelson chamisa who refused to recognise mnangagwa s leadership for the looming unrest saying it is his plot to make the country ungovernable mnangagwa was last week forced to abort his leave to work with his deputy vice president constantino chiwenga to resolve a strike by doctors which has gone beyond a month collapsing the public health sector in the country the striking doctors met first lady auxillia last friday but the meeting failed to bring a solution to the crisis that enters into its 37th day today mnangagwa s return to work came reportedly after a meeting of the joint operations committee largely made up of the security apparatus which recommended his immediate return to avert a situation that has become a security threat caused by the deteriorating situation in the country yesterday soldiers were reportedly manning major hospitals as the crisis in the health sector deepened following the decision by doctors last week to close even the emergency units to maintain pressure on government mnangagwa also fears that the protests could be politicised and force him out of power his spokesperson george charamba who was unreachable last night last week warned opposition parties against getting involved in the doctors strike charamba s warning came after chiwenga last week claimed the doctors strike was now pursuing a political agenda an allegation flatly rejected by the doctors just before the christmas holiday economist and former mdc legislator eddie cross implored the zanu pf leader to immediately resolve the country s economic crisis or risk a military action to topple him from power according to political observers and sources who spoke to the standard yesterday fear was the reason why government has called for a meeting with all labour unions and stakeholders tomorrow teachers had proposed to start their strike tomorrow and sources said tomorrow s meeting was meant to try to pacify the workers and avoid the strike which would likely have far reaching consequences on mnangagwa s rule local government minister july moyo who is the acting labour and social welfare minister together with several cabinet colleagues will meet all labour unions at the national social security authority building in harare tomorrow it is also that fear according to sources that has forced zanu pf youths to release a statement advising mnangagwa to flash out and fire government officials suspected of sabotaging his policies asked to comment on claims that zanu pf was in panic mode party spokesperson simon khaya moyo said i am not spokesperson of the opposition you can ask them they are the ones who are saying so but zanu pf youth league national commissar godfrey tsenengamu yesterday said the ruling party was only concerned that workers grievances were not being raised using proper means and channels he said the youths were opposed to rioting not demonstrations he warned workers to stay out of politics we admit there are economic challenges in the country but if workers decide to take the political route and manipulate the system for regime change it is our duty as zanu pf youths we have an obligation to defend our electoral victory tsenengamu said
by hopewell chin ono today i woke up to the south african sunday times reporting that the zimbabwean industry and commerce minister mangaliso ndlovu has threatened to cancel operating licenses of businesses that are charging for goods in us dollars first of all it is not illegal to charge for goods and services in us dollars the greenback is in the basket of currencies that the central bank rbz sanctioned for legal use in february of 2009 secondly there is a rational explanation to why companies are charging in us dollars for goods and services they are importing raw materials using foreign exchange and the central bank has no hard currency that can be accessed by these businesses when they need to restock how will they restock if they charge for goods and services in a dead currency like rtgs and yet they use foreign exchange to import raw materials or finished goods the reserve bank of zimbabwe clearly stated that the bond note was not a currency and as such nobody can transact with it outside zimbabwe if these businesses transact in rtgs and bond notes they will end up on the black market looking for foreign exchange and we all know that the president said anybody caught on the black market will be thrown into the slammer for ten years finding lasting solutions should be the preoccupation of cabinet ministers and not issuing unhelpful threats intimidation and threats scare away investors foreign direct investment is a coward it will only come where there is economic order sanity and where the rule of law is applied and not rule by law telling a villager that he cannot insist on 4 goats or 1 cow for a tonne of maize will first of all drive maize sales underground and you do not change that with another directive maize production in the village will eventually stop if rule by law continues we all know what happened when robert mugabe tried these scare tactics in 2006 everything shut down and the supermarkets were empty the southerton industrial belt collapsed and to this very day many of the factories have nothing except cobwebs there was also a huge political price to be paid robert mugabe was clobbered at the polls by morgan tsvangirayi and had to resort to brutal violence to retain power we should learn from our history it is the best teacher and nothing else can surpass the lessons it offers repeating the same thing that failed 13 years ago means that we have learnt nothing during the passage of time and also that we have lost 13 years of our lifetime until we understand that fact and we start applying common sense and logic we are not yet open for business i am yet to see anybody who has done more to sabotage the mnangagwa presidency and the government more than the government itself and who leads that government the president himself we are now looking at belarus and kazakhstan for economic respite it shows a very deep level of not understanding the global economy there won t be any bright light from that tunnel if our friends of more than 50 years ago russia and china are not rushing in it should tell you that the patient is ill apply the right medicine and the patient will get better and attract the right suitors otherwise we will end up doing deals that will leave an unbearable and unfortunate economic debt to future generations i will repeat this again there is nobody who has done more to sabotage the government more than the government itself to my zanupf friends be careful that you might be taking part in the last rites of your political party s journey into oblivion by not self correcting the tragic mistakes that have become the hallmark of zanupf the military can only do so much to protect its comrades and interests but at some point nature will refuse to be controlled by guns and tanks you have a small window of opportunity to do the right thing don t allow yourselves to end up in a gaddafi situation because it can happen gaddafi was warned so many times but like many dictatorships before him he too thought that he would last forever nothing lasts forever folks this country is now made up of a youthful majority they have no jobs and those with jobs are striking and not going to work that is a very dangerous ticking time bomb even the fathers and mothers of these youths are tired too the last thing they want to read about in newspapers is a minister issuing empty threats to cover up the government s incompetence the president promised to provide strong leadership during the election campaign where is it sir we were promised that corruption will be a thing of the past and yet the country is choking with it what is the difference then with robert mugabe s rule where the politically connected prospered and the weak suffered in silence perhaps the honorable minister of trade might want to sent that memo to his deputy minister of trade raj modi who has selected products in his supermarkets selling only in us dollars shouldn t charity begin at home or at the trade and commerce ministry in this case shouldn t the deputy trade minister lead by example it simply shows a government that is struggling to come up with a cogent policy framework that is underpinned by the daily realities of life in zimbabwe the president has many sub group and individual interests at play across a society that is trying to do one of the most difficult transitions but he needs to remind these groups and individual interests that it is indeed in their best interest to have a zimbabwe whose economy is working and not a country that is always on the edge of social political and economic tension one day that tension will blow up throwing all manner of unimaginable consequences zimbabwe is not an island it cannot only subject itself to its own internal distortions and contradictions and expect to survive the world we must understand the relatedness of things in politics and the world economy our neighbors and beyond will not come to the sort of party we are putting up at the moment that is why the trade minister finds himself in this embarrassing situation of having to regulate the country s trade and commerce through threats we all need to read about the chinese russian and many post colonial countries in africa and latin america in order to understand how lack of firm leadership unraveled things remembering what countries like rwanda ethiopia tanzania ghana chile nigeria uganda and many others went through before they got to where they are today is critical countries in southern africa might be headed for a post apartheid violent social upheaval if a country like zimbabwe does not manage a relatively peaceful transition from the immediate post colonial administration hopewell chin ono is an award winning zimbabwean

rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y the self described democratic socialist who has become a media sensation is pushing for enactment of a radical plan called the green new deal that would ban the use of all fossil fuels from u s electricity generation agriculture and manufacturing by 2030 the green new deal would dramatically reshape the u s economy and add tens of trillions of dollars to the national debt the radical plan would force families to pay more to heat cool and provide electricity to their homes it would raise the same costs for businesses farmers government and organizations driving up their operating costs and raising the prices for just about all the good and services americans buy click here for justin haskins what you should know about alexandria ocasio cortez s socialist vision for america under the green new deal americans would have to power their homes with renewable energy such as wind and solar power every home and business in the united states would have to be upgraded for state of the art energy efficiency comfort and safety and a slew of massive government social programs and mandates would be created yet despite all these negatives the green new deal has garnered significant attention and support from some members of the media congress and even prominent senators considering 2020 presidential runs cory booker d n j bernie sanders i vt and elizabeth warren d mass click here to get the fox news app in addition to the energy provisions of the green new deal that have received the most attention from left wing pundits and radical environmentalists there is a lot of important information related to this proposal that proponents have deliberately kept out of the spotlight here are five of the most important things you need to know about the green new deal the radical plan would force families to pay more to heat cool and provide electricity to their homes it would raise the same costs for businesses farmers government and organizations driving up their operating costs and raising the prices for just about all the good and services americans buy 1 it includes many radical programs that have nothing to do with so so called green energy supporters of the green new deal spend most of their time talking to the public about the proposal s energy related mandates but some of the costliest parts of the plan are completely unrelated to the energy industry for example ocasio cortez s proposal calls for the creation of basic income programs and single payer health care the green new deal would also establish a federal jobs guarantee one of the few non energy related parts of the plan ocasio cortez has spent significant time advertising and it would include provisions to mitigate deeply entrenched racial regional and gender based inequalities in income and wealth 2 it would do nothing to curb global warming the primary justification given by green new deal proponents for the radical nature of the plan is that it is necessary to slow the rise of human caused climate change which ocasio cortez and other liberals say will cause significant damage to the economy and human health over the next century many scientists say there is no good evidence global warming will be catastrophic or that there s anything humans can do to stop it but even if we were to assume that global warming must be slowed down the green new deal would do nothing to achieve this goal even if the united states were to eliminate all of its carbon dioxide emissions by the start of 2030 something that is likely impossible the increased carbon dioxide emissions of the rest of world would more than offset the reductions in america whether the green new deal is imposed or not global carbon dioxide emissions are going to rise 3 renewable energy costs significantly more than fossil fuels the green new deal would eliminate fossil fuels from all electricity generation and transportation forcing americans to rely largely on expensive and unreliable renewable technologies like wind and solar power the institute for energy research estimates that new solar power generation is nearly five times more expensive than using existing fossil fuel powered electricity wind power is 3 5 times costlier these higher costs would drive up the price of all goods and services not just electricity bills and because all manufacturing would also be required to rely on green power industries in the united states would struggle to match the prices of their foreign competitors forcing some businesses to either close or move overseas 4 the green new deal would empower and give handout to left wing special interest groups and industries some of the most vaguely worded parts of ocasio cortez s green new deal plan are those that promise to increase the power of labor unions and give favors to left wing industries according to the proposal the green new deal would deeply involve national and local labor unions to take a leadership role in the process of job training and worker deployment and it promises the funding of massive investment in the drawdown of greenhouse gases that s a code phrase for giving billions of taxpayer dollars to renewable energy companies 5 it would run up the national debt by tens of trillions of dollars although no one knows exactly how much the green new deal would cost a very conservative estimate is 40 trillion in its first 10 to 15 years the mercatus center estimates the single payer health care proposal supported by ocasio cortez would on its own cost more than 32 trillion ocasio cortez has suggested one way to pay for these gigantic government programs would be to increase the income tax rate for america s wealthiest earners as high as 70 percent but even that radical move would fail to fund the green new deal in ocasio cortez s draft resolution she suggests funding her proposal using the same ways that we paid for the 2008 bank bailout and extended quantitative easing programs the same ways we paid for world war ii and many other wars the federal reserve can extend credit to power these projects and investments in other words ocasio cortez says we should pay for these left wing proposals by running up the national debt by trillions of dollars putting the nation s economy at risk of collapsing click here to read more by justin haskins
in june when he got his first job out of college nick studenski did what most americans are told to do he started saving for retirement the 23 year old from eagan invested heavily in his company s 401 k plan and on the advice of his dad contributed additional money to an individual retirement account in a few months studenski set aside more than 5 000 of his salary in a few weeks more than 20 percent of that money disappeared the dip in share prices and volatility that fueled the worst annual stock market performance in a decade have left tens of millions of investors like studenski shaken if not scared across minnesota and the nation working people have spent several months watching helplessly as big chunks of their investment savings roil in a stew of rising interest rates trade war fears and concern about how long the economy will stay healthy i know people say you don t pull out when it s bad said studenski an economics major with a master s in data analytics but it s tough to stomach logging into your account and seeing it keep going down like many americans studenski has entrusted his investments to mutual fund managers he is not planning to withdraw all his money from the market although he has cut back what he is putting in but like most americans he simply wishes that things would calm down the world of finance and the world at large just seems unhinged he said for investment strategist jim paulsen of the leuthold group in minneapolis panic marked the last two weeks of 2018 trading but people like paulsen see panic as a reason to hunt for bargains not bail out if you sell on panic and buy on optimism you re never going to get ahead paulsen said i would suggest that the average investor not do a lot keep putting the maximum amount in retirement plans that have an employer match he advised what will determine the trend from the current market madness is whether the country goes into a recession analysts say personally said paulsen i don t think we re going to have a recession the normal signs aren t there according to paulsen the great recession of 2008 2012 scared people enough to curtail risky financial behavior instead americans saved money and built household worth the ratio of financial obligations to disposable income is going down not up the federal reserve reports u s labor department statistics show that american employers added a robust 312 000 jobs in december with wages on the rise still as china s economy slows and a tariff war between china and the united states continues some analysts are not as optimistic that the economy is recession proof financial pros have warned for months that after years of strong growth the stock market was due for a correction a fall of at least 20 percent but the recent swings exacerbated by a trade war a ballooning federal deficit and domestic political warfare including a partial government shutdown strain the system and stress those invested in it a commentator on the cnbc business channel described the market as sick with sales of apple iphones down in china and with the company slashing revenue predictions the dow jones industrial average slipped 660 points thursday it bounced back friday based on the strong jobs report and reassurance from the chairman of the federal reserve university of minnesota finance prof rick nelson recalled an adage in looking at the market upheavals in the short term the market reflects expectations in the long term it reflects the actual growth of companies americans are apt to overlook past gains in the face of current losses he said since the end of the great recession the stock market has grown considerably the standard poor s market index was down only about 4 percent in 2018 if you factored in dividends paid to shareholders that same index dropped 37 percent in 2008 nelson said what have people lost since 2015 he asked they haven t lost anything they have made a lot of money the timing of this downturn still matters to those who are about to retire and counting on investment income he continued but the real story is volatility driven by concerns about corporate and government debt whether corporate tax cuts generate one time gains or ongoing benefits and uncertainty about global growth and trade relations with china are by far the biggest factor in the stock market s duress according to russell price chief economist of minnesota based ameriprise financial price says the united states needed to deal with chinese theft of american intellectual property and unfair trade practices but trump s strategy of protective tariffs on china the world s second largest economy and other major trading partners has taken a toll on some u s businesses raising costs and cutting sales on thursday minnesota based agricultural giant cargill reported a double digit dip in profits for the second quarter of its fiscal 2019 compared to 2018 the drop was attributable in part to trade issues in china the greatest risk the trade war poses to the stock market said price is if it dismantles globalization and disrupts international supply chains that s not what americans signed up for when they agreed to contribute significant portions of their pay to market based savings plans nor did they sign up for a market regularly spooked by white house tweets many young investors were teenagers during the great recession which dealt an economic gut punch to their parents and left behind lessons not soon unlearned when they started earning paychecks of their own it made people like amanda schibline 28 cautious about investing a depressing realization greeted her friday when she checked her retirement account and saw it had dropped 13 percent in recent months i was expecting 3 to 5 percent but not double digits said schibline a minneapolis energy efficiency consultant others say the recession taught them not to sweat market gyrations sarah robinson 27 who works at the minneapolis tech company when i work has been stashing 10 percent of her salary in her 401 k and frankly isn t sure how much value it s lost i know what goes down comes back up and vice versa coming through the recession i saw that she said i try not to get too rattled it can still be a jarring lesson for young professionals who ve become used to seeing their retirement accounts climb when st paul resident lauren tott 25 checked her 401 k at thanksgiving it sat at 15 000 evidence of her careful savings since college it had dipped to 13 900 when she last looked two weeks ago that s a huge drop said tott who works in admissions at capella university in minneapolis it has been a little nerve racking the wild swings spurred her to step back her 401 k savings rate from 8 to 6 percent while still maxing out her employer match like others new to investing tott is leaning on parental advice to avoid obsessing over month to month changes it s not about the short term payoff tott said it s the long term bill stevens of stevens foster financial advisors works with many ceos at his bloomington financial planning business he has counseled them to be calm and patient as they wait for the eventual recovery he fully expects this is not a market based on fundamentals he said this is a market based on fear of trade policies and tweeting the fundamentals are ok people are afraid of what more craziness can happen stevens remembers october 1987 when the dow crashed nearly 23 percent in a single day it came back by december but stevens harbors few hopes of such a quick fix in 2019 for studenski similar doubts have him stashing money in the bank now rather than his 401 k and ira i ve certainly lost confidence that putting money into a mutual fund he said is the best way to save jim spencer

muscat a tumultuous first trading week of 2019 headed towards a calmer close after hitting a 33 months low the bloomberg commodity index managed to climb to record its first weekly gain in five the global market rout was caused by economic and political uncertainty as well as tightening liquidity paused on friday after beijing confirmed that a us trade delegation would visit on january 7 8 hopes for a breakthrough have been raised as the impact of the trade war between the us and china begins to show up in weaker than expected economic data from the world s two biggest economies while us stocks began january having recorded their worst december since the early 1930s the currency market had been a sea of calm at least up until this week the first profit warning in 16 years from apple due to a slowdown in chinese demand sent a shiver through the markets and helped trigger a global risk off wave this combined with an illiquid holiday market in japan saw the japanese yen rip higher the audjpy cross often seen as a proxy for the health of the asian market dropped by 7 per cent before recovering all its losses once tokyo reopened on friday these and other developments helped send the dollar lower for a third week thereby providing some additional support for commodities into this mix of uncertainty and volatility commodities generally managed to kick off 2019 with gains across most sectors the bellwether oil sector led from the front with global growth and demand concerns outweighed by a dramatic december production cut from opec led by saudi arabia brent crude which in late december found support at the critical technical and psychological 50 per barrel level was heading for its best week since last april crude oil is beginning to show signs of support following the 40 per cent collapse since last october since hitting the key technical and psychological 50 per barrel level last week it has managed to recover strongly due to an improved outlook for both supply and potentially also demand on the supply side the dallas fed in its fourth quarter energy survey said that the region s oil and gas sector growth had stalled amid the sharp oil price decline the anonymous comments from top oil and gas executives provide a good insight into the renewed stress caused by the dramatic price slump us shale oil production growth is likely to slow following the price slump but if the 2014 to 2016 sell off is anything to go by it may take up to six months before the impact becomes visible in the data which for now continue to show year on year growth close to 2 million barrels day while doubts are being raised by us production growth going forward opec responded strongly to the worsening outlook by slashing december crude oil production by the most since january 2017 monthly production surveys from bloomberg and reuters both showed that opec had cut production by around 500 000 barrels to 32 6 million barrels per day the slump was led by a voluntary reduction from saudi arabia 420 000 barrels per day and unplanned reductions from iran 120 000 barrels per day and libya 110 000 barrels per day while supply reductions may begin to provide some support the demand outlook needs to stabilise as well the previous sell off occurred during a time of rising demand on that basis producers found it relatively easy to trim output and change the direction of oil this time is different with opec and other producers not only having to deal with a renewed pickup in us production which may take months before slowing they also must worry about the global outlook for growth and demand something over which they have no control the fact that china the world s biggest importer of oil and the us the biggest consumer are fighting a trade war is a matter of concern this concern however has yet to be reflected in the official forecasts from opec the eia and the iea during the past six months they have only reduced global demand growth by an average of 100 000 barrels day to 1 4 million having found support at 50 per barrel brent crude oil is now challenging resistance at 57 50 per barrel the november low a break higher could see a return to the previous consolidation area around 60 per barrel the author is the head of commodity strategy at saxo bank
there s plenty of drama in washington d c but arguably the most important political risks for investors in 2019 originate on the other side of the atlantic ocean i m talking of course about brexit specifically the notion of a hard brexit that is looking increasingly likely this is the scenario in which the united kingdom leaves the single market of the european union without a replacement to cooperate closely with the continent via economic and regulatory coordination to nationalists who think any departure from the e u is categorically about sovereignty a hard brexit may not sound so bad who cares about deal making when the point is simply for britain to get its independence back but that mindset displays a willful naiveté over both how capital markets and the global economy function here s why brexit matters more than you think and why march 29 could be one of the most pivotal dates of the year for investors brexit impact on global growth clarity is lacking on trade and regulatory relationships between the u k and the rest of the world some have even posited a scenario in which foreign motorists will need a greencard simply to purchase auto insurance or the u k suffers a shortage in certain medicines but let s stop with conjecture and get to some hard figures the u k government itself has estimated that britain s economy will shrink 3 9 over the next 15 years because of brexit that figure depends on an orderly exit with the withdrawal agreement ratified however a hard brexit would result in an ugly 9 3 decline for the u k economy over the next 15 years that s very bad for britain but clearly also for the rest of the world when the no 5 economy ranked by gross domestic product suffers such a contraction brexit impact on the financial industry one big example of the ripple effect of brexit regards the financial industry and investors around the world in december the leaders of both the securities and exchange commission and the commodity futures trading commission released separate statements that warned of potential disruptions in the words of sec chairman jay clayton the potential adverse effects of brexit are not well understood and in the areas where they are understood are underestimated that should tell you right away that brexit is not just a u k e u issue if america s top market regulators are sounding the alarm there are a host of issues investors in the u s and elsewhere are seeking clarity on but the biggie is equivalency in a nutshell this is where nations allow foreign financial institutions to do business within their borders with a limited amount of red tape with the old rules of equivalency in question some banks feel they won t be able to do business in europe unless they physically do business there already we ve seen an influx of some 800 billion euros 912 billion of assets to the german financial hub of frankfurt as a result meanwhile shares of u k financial institutions like lloyds banking group hsbc and royal bank of scotland have plummeted between 20 and 30 in the past 12 months because of the prospect of lost business brexit impact on trade policies problems with equivalency are just one manifestation of the knee jerk nationalistic trend that makes brexit so dangerous for investors tariffs are being threatened across europe to china to the u s and most nations have become increasingly self serving that may appeal to a bloc of angry voters but all respected economists agree it is terrible for business both locally and around the globe for instance the international monetary fund has warned that a trade war between the u s and china risks making the world a poorer and more dangerous place and as a result of such tensions the imf has projected global growth to hit 3 7 in 2019 down from an estimate of 3 9 in july if britain does not take steps to roll back its brexit folly and make a repudiation of its hasty move away from cooperation with europe we may see further harmful economic policies in the coming year either because of emboldened but naïve nationalists or via retaliatory tariffs brexit impact on multinational stocks moving to a more tangible and immediate impact for investors simply look at the british pound which is at its lowest level vs the u s dollar since april 2017 the resulting weakness in the u k currency and flight to quality has resulted in eager buyers of comparatively safer treasury bonds and dollar backed assets that has similarly pushed the u s dollar up to its highest levels since early 2017 unfortunately the dollar s strength could come at a terrible time for u s investors that s because a strong dollar hurts the financial performance of companies that do a lot of business overseas a segment of the market that is already in big trouble thanks to trade war talk think of names like caterpillar inc and cummins inc both of which used to do a brisk business in china but whose shares have crashed more than 20 in the past year with the federal reserve on a path to tightening its monetary policy there s unlikely to be much relief for multinational stocks like cat and cmi in 2019 that suffer the one two punch of a currency headwind and hostile trade policies brexit impact on sentiment last but most importantly let s not forget the animal spirits on wall street that have been decidedly tame lately after a volatile 2018 many investors are already leaning toward risk off investments and with a frantic rush in the u k to figure things out before the brexit deadline in march it s unlikely many investors are going to stick their necks out again anytime soon you can t blame bearishness on brexit alone as the decade long bull market has run out of gas for a host of reasons but trouble in the u k is undeniably powering a negative feeback loop that will keep investors wary for some time so what s the trade that means a rather boring but defensive portfolio adjustment away from growth oriented equities and multinational stocks and toward short term bonds and gold while bond funds may seem like a bad bet amid expectations of higher interest rates that is far less of a risk in bonds with shorter durations and thanks to a steady increase in rates you can actually find decent yield out there right now short term investment grade corporate bond funds such as the vanguard short term corporate bond etf or the ishares short term corporate bond etf both offer 30 day yields of about 3 7 and have declined only about 1 in the past 12 months despite a steady increase in rates there s a lot of reason to expect that stability to continue in 2019 as for gold the asset s safe haven status speaks for itself with the metal recently hitting a six month high after a rally of about 8 from its summer lows source marketwatch
washington ap federal reserve chairman jerome powell said friday that he will not resign if asked to do so by president donald trump and that he is prepared to be patient in deciding when to raise interest rates again both of those messages cheered stock market investors who had been worried about trump s repeated attacks on his hand picked choice to lead the nation s central bank and also the fed s seemingly inexorable march to higher rates there is no pre set path for policy powell said during an appearance at a conference of economists in atlanta with the muted inflation readings we have seen coming in we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves private economists viewed powell s comments as a strong signal that the fed which in december had projected another two rate hikes in 2019 may end up deciding to pause hikes for several months with chairman powell s remarks today i would say they will do just one hike or maybe no hikes this year said sung won sohn chief economist at ss economics powell is definitely trying to calm the markets wall street which opened sharply higher after a report showing 312 000 jobs gained in december surged even higher during powell s appearance the dow jones industrial average finished the day up 746 points or 3 3 percent federal reserve chairman jerome powell speaks at a conference friday jan 4 2019 in atlanta powell said that he will not resign if asked to do so by president donald trump a message that heartened investors who had been concerned by trump s repeated attacks on his hand picked choice to lead the nation s central bank ap photo annie rice powell called the jobs report very strong and said he was also encouraged by the rise in the labor force participation rate and gains in wages which he said for me at this time does not raise concerns about too high inflation trump has complained that the fed has pushed rates higher despite the fact that there is no evidence that inflation was getting out of control the president s attacks had become so intense that they had raised concerns that he might be considering firing powell a development which could send the market into a tailspin trump would appear to be on shaky legal ground if he tried to fire powell under the law that governs the federal reserve a president can only remove a fed chairman for cause courts in cases that involved other agencies have interpreted that language to not cover policy differences asked if he would resign if trump asked him to do so powell responded with a short no powell s willingness to be flexible on interest rates was welcome news to investors many of whom worried that fed chair risked cutting off the current economic expansion by continuing to raise interest rates despite signs the u s economy was cooling off a little on friday powell said we are always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly if necessary to meet the goals of maximum employment and stable prices powell gave as an example the fact that in 2016 when janet yellen was fed chair the central bank began the year with a projection that it would raise rates four times that year but ended up raising rates only once because the economy hit a soft patch appearing on a panel with his two predecessors yellen and ben bernanke powell also said that the fed could alter its approach to trimming its huge balance sheet if it determines such a change is needed the pace of fed rate hikes and the lowering of the balance sheet which tends to put upward pressure on interest rates had both been concerns of investors in recent months the stock market has seen stomach churning declines since october a development that trump has blamed on the fed s continued rate hikes although the president s trade dispute with china as well as concerns about global economic growth also played a part in the market volatility the fed had increased the size of its balance sheet four fold to a record 4 5 trillion in an effort to push long term interest rates lower but it has been gradually reversing that stance over the past year although the balance sheet still remains above 4 trillion but some investors have worried that that process could push long term rates higher at a time when the economy was slowing powell on friday stressed that the fed was prepared to adjust the pace at which it trimmed the balance sheet if necessary to support economic growth while trump has sent out a number of tweets criticizing powell and calling the fed the biggest threat to the economy powell said that he had not received any direct pressure from the white house asked if he had had any face to face meetings with trump powell said he had not although he said previous fed leaders have had discussions from time to time with previous presidents asked if any future meeting with trump was scheduled powell said i have no news on that nothing is scheduled federal reserve chairman jerome powell speaks at a conference friday jan 4 2019 in atlanta powell said that he will not resign if asked to do so by president donald trump a message that heartened investors who had been concerned by trump s repeated

u s employers hired the most workers in 10 months in december while boosting wages pointing to sustained strength in the economy that could ease fears of a sharp slowdown in growth the upbeat employment report from the labor department on friday stood in stark contrast with reports this week showing chinese factory activity contracting for the first time in 19 months in december and weak manufacturing across much of europe concerns about the u s economy heightened following surveys showing sharp declines in consumer confidence and manufacturing activity last month which roiled financial markets both were seen as more red flags that the economic expansion now in its ninth year and the second longest on record is losing steam the jump in payrolls in december would seem to make a mockery of market fears of an impending recession said paul ashworth chief economist at capital economics in toronto this employment report suggests the u s economy still has considerable forward momentum nonfarm payrolls surged by 312 000 jobs last month the largest gain since february as employment at construction and leisure and hospitality locations snapped back after being restrained by unseasonably cold temperatures in november job gains were reported across all industries with the exception of the information sector which shed employment for the second straight month data for october and november were revised to show 58 000 more jobs added than previously reported the economy created 2 6 million jobs last year compared to 2 2 million in 2017 average hourly earnings rose 11 cents or 0 4 percent in december after gaining 0 2 percent in november that lifted the annual increase in wages to 3 2 percent matching october s rise which was the largest in 9 1 2 years wages advanced 3 1 percent on a year on year basis in november employers increased hours for workers pushing the average workweek up to 34 5 hours from 34 4 hours in november the unemployment rate increased to 3 9 percent from near a 49 year low of 3 7 percent in november as a strong labour market pulled some 419 00 jobless americans from the sidelines fewer workers worked part time for economic reasons in december the labour force participation rate or the proportion of working age americans who have a job or are looking for one rose two tenths of a percentage point to 63 1 percent the highest level since september 2017 the strong employment report likely keeps the federal reserve on course to continue raising interest rates this year deepening its rift with wall street and president donald trump who has chastised the fed and its chairman jerome powell repeatedly for the rate increases speaking at an american economic association event with former fed chiefs janet yellen and ben bernanke on friday powell sought to placate jittery financial markets powell said the u s central bank was always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly if necessary he also said he would not resign if trump asked him to so the fed raised rates four times in 2018 the central bank last month forecast two rate hikes this year and signalled its tightening cycle is nearing an end in the face of financial market volatility and slowing global growth u s financial markets are projecting no rate hikes in 2019 in the latest signal that investors see little room for the fed to lift rates any further yields on 2 year u s treasury notes on thursday dropped below the fed s policy rate for the first time in more than a decade u s stocks rallied on the employment report on friday and extended gains after powell s comments the dollar surrendered earlier gains against a basket of currencies and u s treasury yields rose this should at least for today mute expectations that the fed is off the table completely this year said omair sharif a senior economist at societe generale in new york the december jobs gain pushed total u s employment above 150 million jobs for the first time the labor department has not been affected by the partial shutdown of the u s government and will continue to publish economic data complied by its statistics agency the bureau of labor statistics data releases from census bureau and bureau of economic analysis have been suspended during the shutdown which started on dec 22 amid demands by trump for 5 billion 3 9 billion in funding for a wall on the u s mexico border the robust labour market especially strengthening wage growth suggests the economy will continue to expand this year despite the ebb in consumer confidence continued weakness in the housing market and cooling manufacturing activity strong job gains coupled with rising wages should act as a tailwind for consumption said michelle meyer chief economist at bank of america merrill lynch in new york growth forecasts for the fourth quarter are around a 2 6 percent annualised rate with risks tilted to the downside amid the fading stimulus from the trump administration s 1 5 trillion tax cut package a trade war with china and policy uncertainty in washington the economy grew at a 3 4 percent pace in the third quarter it needs to create roughly 100 000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working age population job growth averaged 220 000 per month in 2018 it is expected to slow to around 150 000 per month this year as workers become more scarce anecdotal evidence has been growing of companies experiencing difficulties finding workers and raising wages to retain and attract employees the government shutdown if it extends beyond next week could weigh on january payrolls employment at construction sites rebounded last month with companies hiring 38 000 employees after adding no workers in november manufacturing payrolls rose by 32 000 jobs in december retailers hired 23 800 more workers professional and business services employment increased by 43 000 jobs last month and government payrolls rose 11 000

star tribune minneapolis mn jan 06 in june when he got his first job out of college nick studenski did what most americans are told to do he started saving for retirement the 23 year old from eagan invested heavily in his company s 401 k plan and on the advice of his dad contributed additional money to an individual retirement account in a few months studenski set aside more than 5 000 of his salary in a few weeks more than 20 percent of that money disappeared the dip in share prices and volatility that fueled the worst annual stock market performance in a decade have left tens of millions of investors like studenski shaken if not scared across minnesota and the nation working people have spent several months watching helplessly as big chunks of their investment savings roil in a stew of rising interest rates trade war fears and concern about how long the economy will stay healthy i know people say you don t pull out when it s bad said studenski an economics major with a master s in data analytics but it s tough to stomach logging into your account and seeing it keep going down like many americans studenski has entrusted his investments to mutual fund managers he is not planning to withdraw all his money from the market although he has cut back what he is putting in but like most americans he simply wishes that things would calm down the world of finance and the world at large just seems unhinged he said for investment strategist jim paulsen of the leuthold group in minneapolis panic marked the last two weeks of 2018 trading but people like paulsen see panic as a reason to hunt for bargains not bail out if you sell on panic and buy on optimism you re never going to get ahead paulsen said i would suggest that the average investor not do a lot keep putting the maximum amount in retirement plans that have an employer match he advised what will determine the trend from the current market madness is whether the country goes into a recession analysts say personally said paulsen i don t think we re going to have a recession the normal signs aren t there according to paulsen the great recession of 2008 2012 scared people enough to curtail risky financial behavior instead americans saved money and built household worth the ratio of financial obligations to disposable income is going down not up the federal reserve reports u s labor department statistics show that american employers added a robust 312 000 jobs in december with wages on the rise still as china s economy slows and a tariff war between china and the united states continues some analysts are not as optimistic that the economy is recession proof financial pros have warned for months that after years of strong growth the stock market was due for a correction a fall of at least 20 percent but the recent swings exacerbated by a trade war a ballooning federal deficit and domestic political warfare including a partial government shutdown strain the system and stress those invested in it a commentator on the cnbc business channel described the market as sick with sales of apple iphones down in china and with the company slashing revenue predictions the dow jones industrial average slipped 660 points thursday it bounced back friday based on the strong jobs report and reassurance from the chairman of the federal reserve university of minnesota finance prof rick nelson recalled an adage in looking at the market upheavals in the short term the market reflects expectations in the long term it reflects the actual growth of companies americans are apt to overlook past gains in the face of current losses he said since the end of the great recession the stock market has grown considerably the standard poor s market index was down only about 4 percent in 2018 if you factored in dividends paid to shareholders that same index dropped 37 percent in 2008 nelson said what have people lost since 2015 he asked they haven t lost anything they have made a lot of money the timing of this downturn still matters to those who are about to retire and counting on investment income he continued but the real story is volatility driven by concerns about corporate and government debt whether corporate tax cuts generate one time gains or ongoing benefits and uncertainty about global growth and trade relations with china are by far the biggest factor in the stock market s duress according to russell price chief economist of minnesota based ameriprise financial price says the united states needed to deal with chinese theft of american intellectual property and unfair trade practices but trump s strategy of protective tariffs on china the world s second largest economy and other major trading partners has taken a toll on some u s businesses raising costs and cutting sales on thursday minnesota based agricultural giant cargill reported a double digit dip in profits for the second quarter of its fiscal 2019 compared to 2018 the drop was attributable in part to trade issues in china the greatest risk the trade war poses to the stock market said price is if it dismantles globalization and disrupts international supply chains that s not what americans signed up for when they agreed to contribute significant portions of their pay to market based savings plans nor did they sign up for a market regularly spooked by white house tweets many young investors were teenagers during the great recession which dealt an economic gut punch to their parents and left behind lessons not soon unlearned when they started earning paychecks of their own it made people like amanda schibline 28 cautious about investing a depressing realization greeted her friday when she checked her retirement account and saw it had dropped 13 percent in recent months i was expecting 3 to 5 percent but not double digits said schibline a minneapolis energy efficiency consultant others say the recession taught them not to sweat market gyrations sarah robinson 27 who works at the minneapolis tech company when i work has been stashing 10 percent of her salary in her 401 k and frankly isn t sure how much value it s lost i know what goes down comes back up and vice versa coming through the recession i saw that she said i try not to get too rattled it can still be a jarring lesson for young professionals who ve become used to seeing their retirement accounts climb when st paul resident lauren tott 25 checked her 401 k at thanksgiving it sat at 15 000 evidence of her careful savings since college it had dipped to 13 900 when she last looked two weeks ago that s a huge drop said tott who works in admissions at capella university in minneapolis it has been a little nerve racking the wild swings spurred her to step back her 401 k savings rate from 8 to 6 percent while still maxing out her employer match like others new to investing tott is leaning on parental advice to avoid obsessing over month to month changes it s not about the short term payoff tott said it s the long term bill stevens of stevens foster financial advisors works with many ceos at his bloomington financial planning business he has counseled them to be calm and patient as they wait for the eventual recovery he fully expects this is not a market based on fundamentals he said this is a market based on fear of trade policies and tweeting the fundamentals are ok people are afraid of what more craziness can happen stevens remembers october 1987 when the dow crashed nearly 23 percent in a single day it came back by december but stevens harbors few hopes of such a quick fix in 2019 for studenski similar doubts have him stashing money in the bank now rather than his 401 k and ira i ve certainly lost confidence that putting money into a mutual fund he said is the best way to save 202 662 7432 612 673 4751 ___ c 2019 the star tribune minneapolis visit the star tribune minneapolis at www startribune com distributed by tribune content agency llc
here s our summary of key events over the holiday that affect new zealand with news equity markets suddenly come into fair winds at the end of last week wall street closed up 3 5 on the day juiced up by good us jobs data and comments by the us federal reserve chairman the vix pulled back american december payrolls came in up 312 000 in the month with some positive revisions higher for the two previous months the outcome beat market expectations of 180 000 handily their participation rate stayed at a low 61 2 and their unemployment rate rose slightly to 3 9 average hourly earnings rose 3 2 and slightly more than expected all up this is a positive jobs survey also helping is that one regional fed official is now suggesting the next rate move may be lower and in the meantime the fed should sit on the sidelines jay powell sort of echoed those comments later but played them down after the strong jobs report more help came when it was been confirmed that china and the united states will hold vice ministerial level trade talks in beijing early this week as the two countries face pressure to end a trade war but weekend talks to resolve the government shutdown achieved nothing so when markets open again they may not be so sanguine for example one consequence of the shutdown is that immigration and customs officers aren t being paid it is no crisis yet but could quickly turn into one there is a high chance they won t do that work unpaid so flights ships and truck movements at the us borders may soon grind to a halt and orders for heavy duty trucks in the usa fell back to the lowest level in 17 months in december as a long surge in fleet expansion that has fueled big factory backlogs ran out of steam meanwhile canada also reported jobs data and that was mildly positive coming in at about expectation their jobless rate remained at an all time low and staying with the theme german annual unemployment figures for 2018 fell to record lows though the number of job seekers increased from november to december of last year also unexpectedly positive is data for china s services sector the caixin services pmi rose to 53 9 and in solidly expansionary territory in december the us equivalent dipped but is interestingly at about the same level as the chinese one china has cut its reserve ratio requirement for banks by 100 bps as part of their credit loosening to

witnessed increased concentration across a range of industries the washington post highlights a topical paper that measures the effect of u s companies increasing market power on inequality in a world where individuals or households can be both consumers and shareholders the impact of market power on inequality depends in part on the relative distribution of consumption and corporate equity ownership across individuals or households according to the team of researchers behind the new study which includes a member of the australian parliament with a phd in economics they find that monopolistic pricing takes a bite out of every income group s share of national income with the notable exception of the top 20 percent whose incomes rise in effect companies are using their market power to extract wealth from poor and middle class households and deposit it in the pockets of the wealthy to the tune of about 3 percent of national household income in 2016 u s corporations buying power the wall street journal s heard on the street column reports that regulators are becoming increasingly interested in large companies power relative to their employees and suppliers so far no antitrust case has been brought on behalf of labor and very few challenges have been made in modern times on the broader grounds of a company s buyer power over labor goods or services but this appears to be changing the justice department s case against the merger of health insurers anthem and cigna last year included its first ever citation of their increased buyer power over doctors and hospitals as a stand alone argument that deal was ultimately blocked on traditional concerns about customers however concern about dominant buyers or so called monopsonies as opposed to dominant sellers or monopolies has bubbled up from the academic world to become a leading theme of the federal trade commission s current hearings on whether antitrust practice is working such hearings are

headlines from the portland press herald report that asylum seekers from africa and central america are arriving in droves overwhelming portland city services it seems that maine is unique and now famous for its generosity providing benefits that no other state provides but fewer than 22 percent of asylum seekers nationwide are found eligible for refugee status from 2011 to 2016 the denial rate for applicants from el salvador was 82 9 percent honduras 80 3 percent for guatemala it was 77 2 percent angola 67 7 percent and for the democratic republic of the congo 43 percent despite the claims of refugee advocates 95 percent of migrants move for economic reasons not violence according to the international monetary fund due to the overwhelming number of applications it takes nearly two years before applicants learn if they meet the requirements to stay during this two year period they will largely rely on mainers to support them but the big question is will those who don t meet refugee status return home or will they join the illegal population purchase fraudulent documents to get jobs and maybe have a citizen baby which entitles them to many benefits including housing and medicaid and then lobby for amnesty and citizenship there is a pattern there since democrats control both legislative houses and the governorship maine will probably increase benefits and legal aid to help the current situation seems reasonable and humane another pattern so what is next advertisement maybe it is time to rethink refugee asylum policies in the book refuge rethinking refugee policy in a changing world alexander betts and paul collier experts on refugee displacement recommend a new response to failed states while the media focuses on individual asylum applicants and their personal stories 25 million people are currently crossing international borders looking to move into a new country when rich countries give citizenship to a handful of lucky winners they create problems for themselves and the sending nations these policies invite migration especially from educated professionals the people most needed to rebuild failed states our policies have also led to a staggering problem with refugee fraud with implications for human trafficking victims as well as national security the obama administration in operation fiction writer brought charges against multiple immigration law firms for coaching refugee applicants in phony stories the current system was created after world war ii shocked by the rejection of jews trying to escape hitler lawmakers at that time wrote refugee laws allowing individuals to apply for asylum and make the case they were fleeing for their lives due to persecution from their government according to the un high commissioner for refugees in 2017 only 7 5 percent of refugee applications submitted for resettlement were deemed urgent or emergency nevertheless many people have compelling reasons for leaving a failed state besides a threat to their lives collier and betts call for an international response creating economic zones in contiguous countries with similar language culture and religion through development assistance and trade deals to promote economic growth for both migrant and host populations neighboring states have provided the lion s share of support over the years just as turkey accepted millions of syrians and neighboring states provide the best location for the majority of refugees who will eventually need to return and rebuild their country the rebuilders truly need and deserve america s support that plan also entails the best use of u s tax dollars helping more people at less cost and removing the financial incentive for human trafficking gangs and the danger in long travels advertisement quoting paul collier the fate of refugees does not really depend on whether a few thousand more come to the rich societies what matters is what happens to the millions refugee policy should provide safety to a limited number of people who are targeted for persecution by their government on account of their race religion nationality etc but refugee policy was never intended to help people move from another country so they could earn more money or escape problems like domestic violence crime and political corruption everyone needs to do the work of putting their own country in order migrants from guatemala el salvador and honduras might take a look at panama and costa rica to see the changes they need to make people aren t leaving those countries jonette christian is a member of mainers for sensible immigration policy she lives in holden send questions comments to the editors
spread the love mass protests proposed by the combined force of civil servants labour unions and the opposition mdc alliance have plunged president emmerson mnangagwa and his zanu pf party into panic amid fears the unfolding economic crisis could morph into a fully fledged uprising of november 2017 proportions by everson mushava political observers opined in interviews last week that this could have been the reason why the president cut short his leave zimbabwe is in the throes of a debilitating economic crisis that has sparked widespread labour unrest and general despondency in the populace that has been thrust into poverty and despair owing to the sudden loss of value of the country s surrogate currency the bond note workers salaries were recently devalued four fold by the tacit concession by authorities that the bond note is not equivalent to the united states dollar when the reserve bank of zimbabwe announced that the two currencies could no longer be housed in the same account the announcement immediately sent the bond note spiralling downslope to as much as 1 to 6 against the us dollar as attempts by finance minister mthuli ncube to claim the two still traded at par failed to convince the market prices of goods and services responded accordingly and soon basic commodities were priced four times higher than the previous us dollar rate and even products such as cement which used to cost 10 bond immediately shot up to over 30 bond or usd 10 the situation has not changed to date the workers soon became agitated beginning with doctors who demanded to be paid in us dollars followed by teachers and the rest of the civil service who are now demanding same the government has called a meeting tomorrow with representatives of all civil servants in the hope of stemming what could degenerate into a mass labour unrest which labour unions and the opposition mdc could capitalise on to stage mass protests that they have already planned despite the meeting called by the government tomorrow the zimbabwe teachers association zimta last night formally declared its members would not be reporting for duty when schools open on tuesday they cited the systematic erosion of their salaries sharp rise of prices of basic commodities and transport fares and the charging of many goods in us dollars zimta president richard gundane said government had failed to address any of their grievances and concerns despite previous engagements and discussions our members are unable to report for duty with effect from the 8th of january 2019 due to incapacitation gundane said to enable the teacher to report for work and to subsist we demand payment of salaries in us dollars doctors have been on strike for the past 36 days over similar demands while the zimbabwe congress of trade unions and the mdc have called for protests over the deteriorating economic situation in the country sources said the panicky mnangagwa government was now desperate to find ways to stop imminent unrest in the country as this would make it vulnerable considering the manner in which mnangagwa came into power through a military coup in november 2017 the sources said there were fears that low ranking security personnel feeling the pinch of the economic meltdown might subtly support the protests and render the security situation in the country volatile the government is now panicking there are threats from every corner from its workers demanding salaries in us dollars to industry where companies producing utility goods are demanding payment for goods in the greenback the source said mnangagwa has been projecting himself as a reformed person and it will be difficult for him to use brute force to deal with the protests the ghost of the august 1 shooting is still haunting him and he is desperate for ways to resolve the crisis zanu pf the source added was now desperate to blame mdc leader nelson chamisa who refused to recognise mnangagwa s leadership for the looming unrest saying it is his plot to make the country ungovernable mnangagwa was last week forced to abort his leave to work with his deputy vice president constantino chiwenga to resolve a strike by doctors which has gone beyond a month collapsing the public health sector in the country the striking doctors met first lady auxillia last friday but the meeting failed to bring a solution to the crisis that enters into its 37th day today mnangagwa s return to work came reportedly after a meeting of the joint operations committee largely made up of the security apparatus which recommended his immediate return to avert a situation that has become a security threat caused by the deteriorating situation in the country yesterday soldiers were reportedly manning major hospitals as the crisis in the health sector deepened following the decision by doctors last week to close even the emergency units to maintain pressure on government mnangagwa also fears that the protests could be politicised and force him out of power his spokesperson george charamba who was unreachable last night last week warned opposition parties against getting involved in the doctors strike charamba s warning came after chiwenga last week claimed the doctors strike was now pursuing a political agenda an allegation flatly rejected by the doctors just before the christmas holiday economist and former mdc legislator eddie cross implored the zanu pf leader to immediately resolve the country s economic crisis or risk a military action to topple him from power according to political observers and sources who spoke to the standard yesterday fear was the reason why government has called for a meeting with all labour unions and stakeholders tomorrow teachers had proposed to start their strike tomorrow and sources said tomorrow s meeting was meant to try to pacify the workers and avoid the strike which would likely have far reaching consequences on mnangagwa s rule local government minister july moyo who is the acting labour and social welfare minister together with several cabinet colleagues will meet all labour unions at the national social security authority building in harare tomorrow it is also that fear according to sources that has forced zanu pf youths to release a statement advising mnangagwa to flash out and fire government officials suspected of sabotaging his policies asked to comment on claims that zanu pf was in panic mode party spokesperson simon khaya moyo said i am not spokesperson of the opposition you can ask them they are the ones who are saying so but zanu pf youth league national commissar godfrey tsenengamu yesterday said the ruling party was only concerned that workers grievances were not being raised using proper means and channels he said the youths were opposed to rioting not demonstrations he warned workers to stay out of politics we admit there are economic challenges in the country but if workers decide to take the political route and manipulate the system for regime change it is our duty as zanu pf youths we have an obligation to defend our electoral victory tsenengamu said the standard share this share twitter facebook email linkedin reddit

on the train into work the other day a billboard for a department store proclaimed every day is black friday caught my eye while that term has come to mean in our consumer age that no holds barred post thanksgiving shopping friday it actually was first coined to describe the crash of the u s gold market on sept 24 1869 that s when two of the original vulture capitalists jay gould and jim fisk tried to gobble up all of the country s gold in hopes of driving up the price for the shiny commodity through the roof in hopes they would reap obscene profits what it did was collapse the markets and sew financial ruin for a nation already deep in debt and still recovering from the civil war all these years later rest assured we have the 21st century versions of gould and fisk busy scheming the next boom and bust cycle they did so well off of the great recession indications we are on the precipice of yet another one of these market downturns that our economic system apparently is fueled by there s always mass suffering and dislocation and a small group that prospers makes a killing last friday the new york times warned of an ominous event in the government bond market when the yield investors could get for investing in long term five year treasury notes fell below what they could get from just a three month treasury normally in a more stable period like when there s not a lunatic in the oval office and the federal government is not in a prolonged shutdown the folks that need to make money with money are given a financial incentive to park their money over the longer term in government bonds when short term notes are king it means the market has decided now is as good as its going to get and that things look bleak for earning for the broader market down the road the front page new york times jan 4 story headlined companies hint that investors are right to fret about growth laid out the contours of this treasury bond market inversion known as an inverted yield curve and the volatile global stock markets that prompted it while there are any number of reasons for investors to be wary of the future including the growing mountain of global debt run away militarism creeping totalitarianism and climate catastrophe they were myopically focused on the disclosure by apple s ceo timothy cook that the darling of wall street was going to have to lower their sales forecast for the first time in 16 years evidently even for multi national masters of the universe like apple the one two punch of a slow down in the chinese economy and an ongoing trade war between that country and the u s proved problematic trump won an election by telling rustbelt americans he could restore the halcyon days of u s economic global hegemony by beating up on china but as it turned out the world was already too interconnected foreign sales in places like china make up 45 percent of the revenues for the s p 500 the american stock market index for the most valuable publicly traded companies apple was punished for its disclosure as the company s stock price plummeting by ten percent and the its market value dropping from 1 1 trillion to 675 billion it recovered a little bit on friday as the broader stock market surged back upward in reaction to a solid jobs report for december the so called smart money seemed immune to trump babbling on about how the government shutdown over his mexican wall could go on for months or even years invariably the thing that gets the attention of markets and those that seek to rule them is interest rates and profit growth forecasts the seas could swallow island nations whole but the burning questions for these folks is what is the price of money today tomorrow next year ad infinitum back in the fall a sell off in the bond market was sparked by the growing realization among investors that there was likely to be an economic slowdown as a consequence of the federal reserve raising interest rates after almost a decade of keeping them artificially low to ease the u s out of the great recession this so called quantitative easing is when a central bank like the federal reserve buys government securities to keep interest rates artificially low while increasing the money supply and in the process floods financial institutions with liquidity to spark increased lending ever since we have been treated to these dynamic swings in the stock market as investors try to sort out which narrative they want to follow one week the business press credits trump with creating a pro business climate and the next he s a bull in a china shop undermining the post world war ii architecture that helped spawn profitable corporate behemoths with often more at stake overseas then here at home for the two years trump has been in office wall street has been perfectly happy benefiting from his slash and burn approach to environmental regulation roasting marshmallows on the california wildfires with a posse like steve mnuchin and wilbur ross riding shotgun for trump vulture capitalists were confident their ilk would rule the beltway roost and keep any nascent progressive revolt in check that could brew with the newly elected congress they gorged themselves on every bit of the trump gop 1 5 trillion dollar corporate tax cut with record ceo pay and billions of dollars in phony baloney stock buybacks that in the short term goosed stock prices ever upward churning profits instead of investing in their physical plant or workforce buttressing a longer term sustainability but all the current capitalist market rewards is the accumulation of money for the purpose of making more money irrespective of the collateral damage that s done to people or the planet in the process so no matter how crazy trump behaves as long as jerome powell chairman of the federal reserve whispers in the ear of markets that he is not on a fixed path of raising interest rates and their confidence in the future is restored but what if after all these years since the original black friday writers like naomi klein are right to suggest this free market capitalist system upon which we have organized our entire civilization actually puts our planet s very survival at risk how can we continue to satisfy the markets s insatiable greed for profits if it means destroying the essential resources that sustain life like air and water that science tells us are finite perhaps its time to sunset the dystopian black friday roller coaster and set our sights on a new post growth economic prosperity model
mexico city president andres manuel lopez obrador launched an ambitious plan saturday to stimulate economic activity on the mexican side of the u s mexico border reinforcing his country s commitment to manufacturing and trade despite recent u s threats to close the border entirely mexico will slash income and corporate taxes to 20 percent from 30 percent for 43 municipalities in six states just south of the u s while halving to 8 percent the value added tax in the region business leaders and union representatives have also agreed to double the minimum wage along the border to 176 2 pesos a day the equivalent of 9 07 at current exchange rates lopez obrador who took office on dec 1 said the idea is to stoke wage and job growth via fiscal incentives and productivity gains u s president donald trump has repeatedly complained that low wages in mexico lure jobs from the u s mexico committed to boost wages during last year s negotiations to retool its free trade agreement with the u s and canada speaking from ciudad juarez a manufacturing hub south of el paso texas lopez obrador said saturday he agrees with trump that mexican wages should improve he decried for instance that mexican auto workers earn a fraction of what their u s counterparts take home topping out at just 3 an hour versus a typical wage of 23 an hour in the u s yet the economic plan comes at a delicate moment for the border region trump threatened as recently as last week to close the u s mexico border entirely if democrats refuse to allot 5 6 billion to expand the wall that separates the two countries economy minister graciela marquez noted saturday that the border region targeted for economic stimulus accounts for 7 5 percent of mexico s gross domestic product and in recent years she said the 43 municipalities included in the plan have boasted combined economic growth of 3 1 percent above the national average of 2 6 percent for the six years through 2017 much of that robustness owes to trade and proximity with the u s the world s biggest economy we have to take advantage of this locomotive that we have on the other side of the border she said marquez expressed optimism that the stimulus plan will direct more mexican and foreign investment into the border region the plan for the border region is part of what lopez obrador calls curtains of development to shore up different corridors of the country so that mexicans stay rather than migrating in search of better economic prospects
stress testing banks has become de rigueur for central banks since the global financial crisis and new zealand s banks have passed repeated tests over a number of years with flying colours in addition these days new zealand s major banks are required to conduct their own stress tests on a continuous basis and to share those results with the prudential supervisor although the results aren t made public the last time the central bank conducted such a test itself was in 2017 when it looked at the big four banks in conjunction with the australian prudential regulation authority apra and the banks passed doomsday type scenarios with ease and capital to spare the scenario the reserve bank used was indeed dire house prices plummeted 35 percent commercial property fared even worse with a 40 percent decline in values unemployment shot up to 11 percent and the fonterra payout to dairy farmers averaged 4 90 per kilo of milk solids for three years below break even for the average farmer on top of that the regulator overlaid an industry wide scandal relating to bad behaviour in mortgage lending such as customers successfully suing the banks for poor lending practices and failure to abide by the responsible lending code like previous stress tests this exercise suggests the major new zealand banks can as a group absorb large losses in a downturn while remaining solvent the reserve bank concluded at the time of course it added the proviso that no stress test can predict the actual impact of a severe downturn in real life but note that phrase like previous stress tests new zealand s big four banks asb bank bank of new zealand anz bank and westpac all owned by australia s big four banks have passed many such severe tests with apparent effortlessness they were acknowledged as among the world s strongest banks through the gfc to put the latest test s scenario in a real life context new zealand house prices fell about 15 percent after inflation less than half the test scenario through the gfc and the unemployment rate peaked at 6 7 percent the last time house prices in new zealand fell anywhere near the magnitude of the test scenario was in the second half of the 1970s during the oil price shock the price fall was about 40 percent in an economy which was arguably very different rampant inflation no floating currency and robert muldoon s rule by fiat with price freezes and carless days for example the last time new zealand s unemployment rate was above 11 percent was in 1991 92 following former finance minister ruth richardson s catastrophic mother of all budgets but the house price fall later that decade was less than 3 percent as for a dairy downturn the reserve bank ran a stress test in late 2015 to find out what would happen if the dairy payout fell to 3 a kilo of milk solids and remained under 5 until the 2019 20 season and that land prices fell 40 percent over that period the conclusion the banking system is robust to a severe dairy stress test the reserve bank concluded it s against that backdrop that the reserve bank has suggested the big four banks should have to effectively double their tier 1 equity capital during the next five years that will mean the big four banks would need to increase their tier 1 capital by 12 8 billion and replace another 6 2 billion of preference shares because they will no longer count as tier 1 capital the central bank estimates the four banks could get there by retaining about 70 percent of their average 4 4 billion of annual earnings over the next five years reserve bank governor adrian orr and his predecessors had been foreshadowing the idea that the banks probably needed to hold more capital from as long ago as last year so the market was well prepared to expect a raising of capital requirements nevertheless the magnitude of what it thinks is necessary is shocking international ratings agencies aren t given to hyperbole fitch described the reserve bank s proposals as radical highly conservative relative to international peers and that they go well beyond the international norm long time banking journalist tony boyd wrote in the australian financial review that the move will inevitably raise borrowing costs and that orr risks forcing new zealand companies to seek alternative sources of capital outside the banking systems pushing people into the arms of less heavily regulated lenders boyd says new zealand doesn t have a great record of protecting depositors in non banks pointing to the 6 billion of finance company losses apra already supervises the big four australian banks which all operate in new zealand with group level capital requirements he says orr is clearly not satisfied with this oversight even though apra is well known for having capital requirements tougher than those in most western countries and no depositor in australia has lost money however another journalist writing in the australian newspaper adam creighton described orr s move as a breath of fresh air that came out of the blue he was writing in the context of the endless scandals emanating from australia s royal commission into financial services former reserve bank official michael reddell is concerned about the apparent lack of consultation with apra ahead of the mid december release of the proposals it seems surprising to me that the reserve bank could propose something so radical without a genuine prior discussion with the regulator of the banks who dominate the new zealand financial system reddell wrote in his croaking cassandra blog the reserve bank estimates the australian owned banks account for about 88 percent of new zealand s banking system searching the reserve bank s consultative document for references to apra it seemed telling that the bank referred a couple of times to the possibility of aligning with apra standards around the idea questionable of introducing new capital requirements so far in excess of those apra imposes reddell said there is a suggestion that the governor has a bit of chip on his shoulder about australia and australian banks whether that is true or not if the indications of lack of prior consultation are correct it isn t good enough orr was national bank s chief economist in the 1990s and then westpac s chief economist between 2000 and 2003 he was the reserve bank s deputy governor and head of financial stability then chief executive of the new zealand superannuation fund before taking the central bank s top job in march last year macquarie equities has suggested that the new capital requirements are so onerous that it could lead to the australian banks selling some or all their new zealand subsidiaries if that meant the banks became listed on nzx many a new zealander might think that would be a jolly good thing but a paper put out by the federal reserve bank of philadelphia last year suggests that one outcome of requiring banks to hold more capital would be a much more concentrated loan market it would mean large banks grow larger putting pressure on small banks to merge or close as large banks market power increases they extract higher profits by raising loan rates which tighten credit and depresses the economy s output clearly new zealand s banking sector is already highly concentrated on the other hand if the tier 1 capital requirement before 2007 had been 6 percent rather than its actual 4 percent minimum large us banks would have had enough capital to cover their losses at the peak of the 2008 09 crisis the paper says that would have avoided a financial sector meltdown and the severely depressed economic activity and large scale government intervention that followed still it s an awful long way from 6 percent to the 16 percent level our central bank is proposing the reserve bank s consultation paper does make it clear that deciding optimum levels of bank capital is a balancing act if banks in new zealand fail some of us might lose money and some of us might lose jobs it says in the non technical summary it notes the proposed changes might lead to higher borrowing costs and lower returns to bank shareholders however there would also be indirect costs on all of society that may be harder to see that would negatively impact the well being of all new zealanders in the end we would all bear the cost of bank failures in one way or another it says this is why we want to make the chances of this happening very small so small that a banking crisis in new zealand shouldn t happen more than once in every two hundred years but it s an open question as to whether the reserve bank has the balance right businessdesk comments from our readers no comments yet add your comment your name your email not displayed to the public comment

fireworks erupt in london as the uk enters the year when brexit could become a reality and face a long term hangover photo leon neal getty images crystal ball gazing is fraught having spent more than a decade doing forecasts i know its pitfalls i would certainly not like to be in the forecasting business right now because 2019 is one of the hardest years to predict in recent decades not since 2012 dawned to an intensifying euro crisis has the outlook been as worrying brexit and an increasingly unrestrained narcissist in the white house are two wild cards that simply cannot be predicted financial fragilities trade wars and italy s precariousness are just some of the other major risk factors complicating matters further are gathering signs of slowdown in european and the us economies from my forecasting days decelerating growth was hard to deal with a soft patch in the data can be just that or it can be the beginning of the end of a period of growth nobody can ever be sure which with all those uncertainties and caveats in mind here are some thoughts on the economic outlook for ireland and its main partners as the new year begins the irish economy because of the particular difficulties of forecasting right now lets start with the worst case scenario and work back from that ireland faces three enormous risks to the economy a no deal brexit a transatlantic trade war and the re eruption of the euro crisis if italy goes greek if all three of these risks were to materialise in 2019 one does not really want to contemplate the consequences suffice to say that everything would change if even one of these risks materialises then there is a strong possibility that it will be enough to halt growth in the irish economy as such the chances of recession in 2019 are high more positively the economy is strong and still lean it has plenty of momentum going into the new year there have been only a few signs of weakness such as falls in spending on plant and machinery excluding purchases of planes for leasing in the second and third quarters of last year and consumer confidence being well down on where it was a year ago but there are far more signs of continued strong growth domestically if the external risks don t materialise a very big if the economy should expand in 2019 the public finances the government has budgeted for yet another deficit this year instead of moving into a healthy surplus which would have provided a cushion in any downturn efforts to improve the underlying position of the state s finances have been abandoned in recent years in fact it is worse than that if the plans contained in the budgets of two three and four years ago had been stuck to the government would be safely in the black and the ship of state would be much better prepared to navigate the dangerous and uncharted waters which we are entering with the public finances still profoundly weak it would not take much of a slowdown to push the deficit over the 3pc of gdp threshold that eurozone countries are not supposed to breach if we get a no deal brexit shock at the end of the current quarter the deficit could crash through that threshold later in the year and keep rising while the eurocrats in brussels would almost certainly give ireland leeway the rules allow for exceptional circumstances the bond trading herd would be less forgiving it cares little about the causes of economic deterioration its interest is whether or not it will be repaid it would look at the state s indebtedness one of the highest in the world on a per capita basis and dump irish government debt borrowing costs would rise and with a lot of debt to be rolled over this year and next this would make the budgetary position even worse nobody should be surprised if the budget in nine months time is one of austerity the uk economy british gdp growth surged in the third quarter of 2018 and job creation continues apace if britain goes into a recession owing to brexit it is like ireland at least starting from a reasonably good position but like ireland the range of outcomes for the uk economy over the next year is very wide a no deal brexit would almost certainly cause a recession and probably a deep one at that but so unprecedented is it for a large and complex economy such as britain s to cut so many ties with the market it is so integrated into that nobody knows how much disruption it would cause if on the other hand a no deal exit can be avoided the british economy could continue to grow at a decent clip the reduction in uncertainty might even accelerate growth it would almost certainly cause sterling to appreciate that would be particularly beneficial for ireland s tourism sector and the nation s exporters the eurozone economy having grown in an uninterrupt fashion since 2013 culminating in near boom conditions in 2017 the european economy began cooling a year ago by the end of 2018 indicators were beginning to cause concern more and more data showed the eurozone economy running out of steam in the weakest countries such as italy many indicators were showing no or negative growth from the third quarter economies rarely grow at a steady pace so it is perfectly possible the euro area will perk up again in the coming months nor will brexit be much of an issue it should be added for most continental countries the value of trade with the uk is equivalent to low single digits of their gdp even if this trade were to be severely disrupted the overall economic impact would be small ireland along with the netherlands belgium malta and cyprus are exceptions owing to their unusually close links to the british economy the us economy a month ago this column looked in some detail at the us economy and concluded that it was on course for another year of growth in 2019 despite growing concerns that a recession was on the way the past four weeks have brought a further downturn in sentiment as new data have shown further signs of slowdown talk of an american recession is gathering again economic forecasters never know for sure whether such dips herald a downturn or whether they are mere pauses for breath let s hope it s the latter not least because of the political consequences if donald trump were under attack at home over a failing economy he might be more tempted to find foreign distractions

it s now time to re strategise for a better nigerian nation we don t have to wait until we are choked with anger as a result of unfulfilled promises bidwell nsofor the dollar is the standard unit of money used in the united states of america canada australia new zealand and other countries of the world in the financial markets the value of the us dollar is used in comparing the value of different types of money from around the world thereby making it a powerful currency of exchange even when human memory is an enviable sieve today after forty years i can still unburden myself to readers about an unforgettable experience which has not dimmed it was during the world festival of arts and culture festac 77 held in two nigerian cities lagos and kaduna that i came for the first time in close contact with the sum of one hundred american dollars then the joy that welled up in my mind was indescribable as it knew no bounds excitedly i concluded in my mind that i had hit gold but much later after changing it into nigerian naira that joy in me waned why then naira was more powerful than the dollar the issue here is that the difficulty in addressing the rising exchange rate of the dollar has now become one of the biggest economic problems of the country which like other problems has defied any known solution based on the ephemeral happenings in the country from one administration to the other it won t be out of place to whip up fervor that is geared towards seeking peaceful solutions to the country s endemic poverty and other perennial problems whether it has to do with the much touted restructuring of the country or some other issues there is this urgent need to re strategise the arab spring and the perestroika in the ussr during late 1990s are typical examples of what could happen when people are pushed to the wall today hardship has made many nigerians to start selling their valued properties at very ridiculous prices just to make ends meet in life any condition that turns a strong and healthy man into the woman of the house against his will is demeaning unacceptable and condemnable the most important thing now is for our next leaders to come up with catalysts for economic recovery and prosperity that will stop this dozing giant of africa from sliding into a precarious coma and perhaps into oblivion the electorate on their part should not fold hands and watch things go wrong they should work with the intention of moving nigeria to a comfortable level of recovery with a tinge of pleasure added to it

americans that could help for the green new deal proposed by a group of left wing democrats in an interview on cbs 60 minutes programme ms ocasio cortez suggested the new tax rate should apply to americans earning more than 10m a year noting that similar rates existed in america a few decades ago the top tax rate was above 90 per cent during the 1950s and while it has slowly descended it remained as high as 50 per cent for much of president ronald reagan s tenure in the 1980s american households that earn more than 600 000 annually currently pay a 37 per cent tax rate down from the 39 6 per cent rate they paid before the republican tax law passed in 2017 conservatives have pushed for lower taxes on the rich as a spur to economic growth while liberals see potentially untapped revenue that could fund their key social spending priorities such as medicare for all and free college tuition there s an element where yeah people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes ms ocasio cortez told cbs how much revenue could new taxes on the rich really raise we looked at the numbers enlisting the help of a number of tax experts including mark mazur a former treasury department official now at the tax policy centre a centrist think tank joel slemrod a tax expert at the university of michigan and ernie tedeschi an economist who served in barack obama s treasury department 720 bn decade ms ocasio cortez s suggestion for nearly doubling taxes on people earning more than 10m in 2016 the latest year for which government data is available approximately 16 000 americans earned more than 10m each these are not in fact the 1 per cent many on the left like to talk about they are a much smaller slice fewer than 0 05 per cent of all us households it s difficult to estimate precisely how much more in taxes the government could wring from this ultra elite collectively their total taxable income amounted to 405bn in 2016 and they paid about 121bn in federal income taxes they also face state and local taxes which raise their overall tax burdens as she noted to 60 minutes ms ocasio cortez s idea for a 70 per cent tax rate on those earning more than 10m would only kick in beyond the first 10m in income so this new tax rate would do nothing to add to the amount of federal revenue on the first 160bn 16 000 people multiplied by 10m in taxes this group paid but that leaves about 244bn in taxable income for those earning more than 10m a year if this entire pool was taxed at 70 per cent instead of the 39 6 per cent they paid in 2016 the federal government would bring in an additional 72bn annually or close to 720bn over 10 years according to mr mazur the real number is probably smaller than that because wealthy americans would probably find ways around paying this much higher tax recommended how the 116th congress is making history you d certainly see some people under that system change their behaviour to avoid the higher rate which could significantly impact how much revenue it generates mr mazur said adding that the effect would be hard to estimate the exercise also assumes capital gains would be taxed at this much higher rate this 720bn in a decade is not nearly enough to fund medicare for all which has been estimated to increase government outlays by about 30tn over a decade while also zeroing out premiums and deductibles paid by americans still it could fund a number of other measures it could come close to funding the entirety of bernie sanders free college tuition plan 800bn fund president barack obama s plan to get close to universal pre kindergarten 75bn forgive more than half the student debt in america 1 4tn cover democratic leaders plan for boosting teacher pay and school funding 100bn or come close to funding a 1tn infrastructure plan and of course higher income tax rates on the top 16 000 households is not the only way to raise taxes on rich americans world news in pictures show all 50 1 50 world

the american government currently raises tax revenue primarily through payroll taxes and income taxes and gets a smaller chunk from estate taxes and corporate taxes it has not adopted a kind of tax that exists in some european countries a wealth tax wherein the federal government takes a chunk based on household wealth rather than income norway for instance in 2016 taxed at a rate up to 0 70 per cent for all wealth over 1 4m kroner 162 568 france s wealth tax in 2017 hit assets above 1 3m 1 4m mr slemrod of the university of michigan said in an email that the wealthiest 1 per cent of americans own roughly one third of the 107tn in wealth in america this group collectively holds about 20tn in wealth above 10m per household from there the calculation of wealth tax is simple a 1 per cent wealth tax on the wealthiest 1 per cent of households above 10m could raise about 200bn a year or 2tn over 10 years mr tedeschi the former obama official found a 0 5 per cent wealth tax on the top 1 per cent could raise at most 3tn over 10 years but this too would probably change americans behaviour and perhaps lead them to try shifting their wealth overseas and the economists say the actual amount of revenue is likely lower than their estimates suggest and this is assuming there are no exemptions to what is considered wealth such as housing assets plus this approach would require americans to give the internal revenue service a full accounting of all the assets they own under law something that could be required under law but may prove difficult to evaluate in 1990 the federal government did try something similar by placing excise taxes on sales of yachts expensive automobiles jewellery and other things consumed by rich people but that effort came right before a minor recession leading to the repeal of the taxes the difficulties of monitoring and compliance are huge mr mazur said of the wealth tax but it could be done and raise a lot of money 3tn decade doubling income taxes on the top 1 per cent in 2012 the economists peter diamond of the massachusetts institute of technology and emmanuel saez of the university of california at berkeley published a paper arguing the optimal top tax rate is 73 per cent in 2018 that would raise the tax rate on income above 600 000 from 37 per cent to 73 per cent but back then it meant increasing the top rate from 39 6 per cent to 73 per cent the irs says that americans earning more than 600 000 annually compose the richest 0 9 per cent of families so we ll use that for shorthand for the 1 per cent in 2016 this richest 0 9 per cent earned about 1 7tn in taxable income and paid about 530bn in taxes these americans would have to pay an additional 320bn every year in taxes if the top tax rate went up to 70 per cent according to calculations based on irs data mr mazur the former treasury official noted this estimate was probably high because the wealthy would probably find ways to try to shelter themselves from higher taxation such as by buying tax exempt bonds other economists found similar results mr tedeschi the former obama economist put the number at about 300bn annually meanwhile raising tax rates for the top 1 per cent to 57 per cent would raise about 1 7tn over a decade while raising it to 83 per cent would raise 3 8tn over that period mr tedeschi found support free thinking journalism and attend independent events you can get a hell of a lot of a money from taxing the 1 per cent said edward wolff a tax expert at new york university the congressional budget office also recently estimated that raising taxes on the two highest income brackets by 1 percentage point would net 123bn over 10 years that would be for everybody who earns more than 200 000 annually the cbo also found that a 0 1 per cent financial transactions tax on wall street would raise an additional 780bn over 10 years while returning the corporate tax rate to 35 per cent would raise an additional 1tn over a decade the republican tax law of 2017 lowered that rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent but americans outside the top 1 per cent would probably pay at least part of both these taxes mr tedeshi said overall just including a new wealth tax and significantly higher income taxes the federal government could probably raise an additional 2 trillion to 3 trillion a decade by taxing the 1 per cent alone according to mr tedeschi the washington post
president uhuru kenyatta greets opposition leader raila odinga at harambee house in nairobi in january the country was wallowing in the miasma of economic turbulence political turmoil and social strains which threatened the very existence of the republic as we have known it since 1963 and before central bank governor dr patrick njoroge boldly admitted in an interview with cnn that the economy was in bad shape because of the political upheaval panic sells by foreign investors triggered a 30 minute halt at the nse with huge sales at safaricom equity and east africa breweries causing a dip in share prices across several counters while the country sank further in turmoil her neighbours uganda tanzania and ethiopia were attracting huge investments estimated to be in billions of shillings in march 9 the public gesture of reconciliation between uhuru kenyatta and raila odinga and their desire to move the country forward following the year long electioneering campaigns in 2017 was a relief to kenyans who had been wondering on the way forward the national super alliance nasa leader raila odinga in march said that his handshake with president uhuru kenyatta was painful but a worthy

was some optimism though exuded by lawyer paul mwangi and ambassador martin kimani who were tasked by uhuru and raila to jointly oversee the bid to unite and heal kenyans and with it kenyans were being granted a blank cheque for brand new beginnings for the republic it was a chance for the country to stoke up fresh ethos to sustain us through a new era of inclusiveness unity peace and happiness following the handshake investors had confidence to undertake businesses in the country which in turn promoted the president s big four agenda in march british high commissioner to kenya nic

that was the talk of nyanza for weeks raila who was recently appointed the african union s high representative for infrastructural development had been waiting for the uhuru visit to confirm to his supporters that their reconciliation was real therefore no economy can thrive in the face of political chaos and anxiety
iran s central bank has proposed slashing four zeros from the rial state news agency irna reported on sunday after the currency plunged in a year marked by an economic crisis fueled by us sanctions a bill to remove four zeros from the national currency was presented to the government by the central bank yesterday and i hope this matter can be concluded as soon as possible irna quoted central bank governor abdolnaser hemmati as saying proposals to remove four zeros from the currency have been floated since 2008 but the idea has gained strength as the rial lost more than 60 percent of its value in 2018 despite a recent recovery engineered by the central bank in defiance of us sanctions the currency was trading at about 110 000 rials per us dollar on the unofficial market on sunday according to foreign exchange websites president donald trump reimposed us sanctions on iran last year after pulling out of world powers 2015 nuclear deal with tehran washington has vowed maximum pressure on iran s economy to force it to accept tougher limits on its nuclear and missile programs iran has ruled this out rial weakness disrupted iran s foreign trade last year and helped boost annual inflation fourfold to nearly 40 percent in november the weak currency and galloping inflation have been a complaint of sporadic street protests since late 2017 after approval by the government the proposed currency plan would have to be passed by parliament and approved by the clerical body that vets legislation before it takes effect
economist paul krugman wrote in 1994 that the soviet union s economic expansion was based on perspiration rather than inspiration the three pillars of economic growth are labour capital and total factor productivity a variable evaluating technological progress an agrarian nation starting from a low base can march ahead simply by drawing on its surplus labour and investing in heavy industry however as resource pools run dry the only path towards more growth is through raising total factor productivity tfp flashback to 1979 when us president jimmy carter declared a crisis of confidence in an address to the people months earlier cia analysts had said the soviet union was twice as strong as the us even as early as the 1950s and 1960s the soviet union was seen as an all powerful industrial machine politicians and economists even proclaimed that a one party communist regime may be capable of materially outperforming western democracies by 1991 all the cassandras were proved wrong yet apart from china s alleged tactical and operational offensives against the us which could be addressed by targeted countermeasures does beijing really constitute an existential strategic threat for america will we all soon be paying tribute to the son of heaven of a rejuvenated and all powerful red celestial empire leapfrogging the west into technological oblivion a radio broadcast of orson welles the war of the worlds in 1938 provoked panic across the united states about an imminent martian invasion the war of the worlds could be the subtitle for a plethora of alarming policy reports and statements coming from washington dc referring to a chinese invasion not a martian one in us politics and its technological ecosystem china s tfp growth has faltered in the post 2008 period the massive stimulus that beijing unleashed in the wake of the global financial crisis saved the global economy and preserved the growth rate but undercut domestic productivity improvements the meteoric rise of investments as a percentage of gross domestic product has even led to china s output to capital ratio the wealth produced for every dollar invested falling below that of the us a paradox as developing countries usually have higher untapped potential in greenfield investments if china is to continue to grow it needs to empower its innovation ecosystem it needs to inspire the innovators and entrepreneurs by creating an open society able to attract the world s best and brightest chinese and non chinese alike with its population ageing fast china s population dividend is running dry and it is only by unleashing the human capital dividend that the country can sustain its growth unfortunately liberal reforms may clash with the chinese communist party s imperative for strong state owned enterprises and restrictions on civil liberties the trade off will not be easy to reconcile to be sure china s recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence quantum communications with european collaborators and 5g networks are foundational for the country s technological ascendancy however as james lewis of the centre for strategic and international studies pointed out china s new burst of innovative energies came at the end of a period of relative political openness even if one considers the optimal scenarios china s economy as a share of global gdp may soon reach its climax at around 20 per cent and this will be less than half of the share the us enjoyed in the aftermath of the second world war when it designed the structure of the global liberal order china must also face an increasingly complex geo economic environment surprisingly given the polarisation in washington there seems to be a meeting of minds that the us china commercial relationship is unbalanced and needs to be fixed even elizabeth warren a staunch progressive and fierce trump critic once declared that beijing has weaponised its economy us senator elizabeth warren a fierce trump critic believes beijing has weaponised its economy despite the polarisation in washington there seems to be a meeting of minds that the us china commercial relationship is unbalanced and needs to be fixed photo reuters america has time and again renegotiated its economic relations with key trade partners in 1971 richard nixon shocked the world by unilaterally imposing a tariff on all imports a blow to european exporters in 1985 ronald reagan coerced japan into agreeing to the plaza accord to depreciate the us dollar it is difficult to foresee how beijing could resist a de facto plaza accord an economic iron curtain in henry paulson s words if the us prolongs its protectionist measures add to this a potential slowdown in the european economy and chinese exporters may see their two major export markets evaporate this will not cause a chinese economic doomsday but it will undercut growth by affecting investments and the people s animal spirits the average chinese today is only one sixth as rich as the average american but even a china with a larger nominal gdp than that of america would still be outranked by the combined resources of the us and its allies while the us is surrounded by friends china is not equally fortunate it lacks access to oceans hindered by island chains allied to the us and cannot project blue water force some may quote president xi jinping s speech at the 19th party congress that china could serve as a model for other countries as evidence of an existential threat for america yet it is hard to see exactly how a chinese model could apply to other nations and if the belt and road initiative is a vehicle for china s global hegemony then it will be an expensive venture with risky returns unlike the soviet union china does not export autocratic politburos central party schools and other red institutions any communist party attempt to export its domestic polity will be self defeating as it will turn the doves in america into outright hawks and unify the western camp china s political economy and its insurmountable geographical restrictions naturally undercut its alleged hegemonic aspirations the party s ability to sacrifice current consumption for future gain cannot resolve the key problem of inter generational resource allocation let alone boost productivity it is thus the decay of america s domestic political culture which must influence the strategic outlook of americans neither the martians nor the chinese are coming but the demagogues may have already arrived another multitrillion dollar war of choice and another wall street meltdown and america s social contract could be irreparably broken this is america s existential threat vasilis trigkas is an onassis scholar and research fellow in the belt

selloff on apple s nasdaq reduced revenue outlook on a slowing chinese economy us stocks finished higher ahead of the weekend for a second week after december s three week losing streak friday s rally was among the steepest in the last decade stocks were boosted by a variety of catalysts including signs that the us economy is still robust via the monthly release a suddenly attentive fed which seemed to be signaling the possibility of slower and us china trade talks that remain on track with the return of risk on sentiment treasuries weighed on the which in an uncharacteristic move fell together with and the short and longer term drivers boost markets equities spiked on friday after nonfarm payrolls showed that 312 000 new jobs were added in december signaling the us economy remains in good shape that number was almost 90 better than expectations the rose from 3 7 to 3 9 percent on the face of it a rising unemployment might be considered a negative but since so many workers were returning to the workforce based on the added jobs in this case it s actually positive perhaps however the most positive metric in the release was which grew by 3 2 percent from a year ago tying with october s wage growth numbers for the largest year over year increase since april 2009 consumer spending supports about 66 of us making it a key economic force while monthly releases buoyed stocks short term fedspeak will potentially have a longer lasting impact on equities to calm markets fed chair jerome powell backpedaled on his interest rate trajectory the fed chief said the central bank will be patient with normalization emphasizing that there is no preset path for higher rates or adjusting the balance sheet the fed boss made a rare observation about the market saying the us economy is in strong shape he further noted that he believes the market is pricing in downside risks that aren t visible yet while expressing confidence in ongoing growth powell brushed off responsibility for the recent equity rout shifting the blame instead to smart money which may be acting on insight dragging the herd behind it he also said the fed is listening very carefully to the market after repeatedly saying previously that the fed disregards market volatility both with regard to the state of the economy or the fed s path to tightening a third driver was the us team headed to china for

especially the longer term moving averages often when they squeeze out they explode one way or another but typically with great volatility the closed higher by 3 28 ahead of the weekend up 3 18 for the week and 6 84 for the two week period that would make the small cap index the leader of this rally both on a weekly basis as well as during the two week rebound that fact is at odds with the market narrative that blamed the trade war as a key driver for selloffs when the trade dispute escalated similarly during the same period while the us and china seemed to have their best run of trade talks the russell should have been the laggard as the safe haven anti trade dispute proxy technically the index managed to climb back above the 200 wma growth peaks yield curve keeps flattening overall while growth remains robust it has likely peaked as seen via the jobs report with its seventh largest monthly increase over the nearly 10 year expansion as well the results for the previous two months were revised upward bringing the three month pace of jobs created to a healthy 254 000 average finally after years of lethargic growth wages jumped by 0 4 percent last month for a 3 2 yoy gain the fastest pace since 2009 however all this occurs on the heels of historically low interest rates and with the business cycle ending the persistently flattening yield curve as measured by the yield differential between the and treasury notes also reflects investors outlook for the end of growth the technicals which often indicate reversals before the fundamentals already show most global stock indices are in a bear market in the us the nasdaq indices and the russell 2000 are in bear markets while the s p and dow have managed to barely keep from falling to the accepted 20 standard for a bear market nevertheless both remain in downtrends with volatility levels suggesting they re already in bear territory trump adviser kevin hasset who is chairman of the white house council of economic advisers noted friday that while typically an inverted yield curve is a recession indicator this time it s not reliable since qe has depressed yields on the long end of the curve while this

beijing ap american officials are due in beijing monday for talks aimed at easing the u s china trade battle that threatens to hobble global economic growth the talks are going ahead despite tension over the arrest of a chinese tech executive in canada on u s charges related to possible violations of trade sanctions on iran the two governments have expressed interest in a settlement but have given no indication that their stances have shifted after several tit for tat tariff increases last year presidents donald trump and xi jinping agreed dec 1 to postpone further hikes the two countries hope to have positive and constructive discussions said a chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang the trade war has its roots in american anxiety about china s emergence as a competitor in telecoms solar power and other technologies and complaints by washington europe and other trading partners that beijing s tactics violate its market opening obligations china s leaders have offered to narrow its politically sensitive trade surplus with the united states by purchasing more soybeans natural gas and other american exports but they reject pressure to scrap technology initiatives they see as a

american goods slowing down customs clearance for u s companies and suspending issuance of licenses in finance and other industries trump and xi agreed to a 90 day postponement of more tariff increases due to take effect jan 1 but economists say that is too little time to resolve the sprawling disputes that bedevil u s chinese relations the decision to hold this week s talks at a deputy

that 37 percent of 200 manufacturers surveyed said they have shifted out of china over the past 12 months it said the threat of u s tariff hikes was the dominating factor for nearly half while others

president uhuru kenyatta greets opposition leader raila odinga at harambee house in nairobi in january the country was wallowing in the miasma of economic turbulence political turmoil and social strains which threatened the very existence of the republic as we have known it since 1963 and before central bank governor dr patrick njoroge boldly admitted in an interview with cnn that the economy was in bad shape because of the political upheaval panic sells by foreign investors triggered a 30 minute halt at the nse with huge sales at safaricom equity and east africa breweries causing a dip in share prices across several counters while the country sank further in turmoil her neighbours uganda tanzania and ethiopia were attracting huge investments estimated to be in billions of shillings in
