in my last post i looked at the risk premiums in the us markets and you may have found that focus to be a little parochial since as an investor you could invest in europe asia africa or latin america if you believed that you would receive a better risk return trade off for some investors in countries with investment restrictions the only investment options are domestic and us investment options may not be within their reach in this post i will address country risk and how it affects investment decisions not only on the part of individual investors but also of companies and then look at the currency question which is often mixed in with country risk but has a very different set of fundamentals and consequences country risk there should be little debate that investing or operating in some countries will expose you to more risk than in other countries for a number of reasons ranging from politics to economics to location as globalization pushes investors and companies to look outside of their domestic markets they find themselves drawn to some of the riskiest parts of the world because that is where their growth lies drivers and determinants in a post in early august 2019 i laid out in detail the sources of country risk specifically i listed and provided measures of four ingredients life cycle as companies go through the life cycle their risk profiles change with risk dampening as they mature countries go through their own version of the life cycle with developed and more mature markets having more settled risk profiles than emerging economies which are still growing changing and generally more risky high growth economies tend to also have higher volatility in growth than low growth economies political risk a political structure that is unstable adds to economic risk by making regulatory and tax law volatile and adding unpredictable costs to businesses while there are some investors and businesses that believe autocracies and dictatorships offer more stability than democracies i would argue for nuance i believe that autocracies do offer more temporal stability but they are also more exposed to more jarring discontinuous change legal risk businesses and investments are heavily dependent on legal systems that enforce contracts and ownership rights countries with dysfunctional legal systems will create more risk for investors than countries where the legal systems work well and in a timely fashion economic structure some countries have more risk exposure simply because they are overly dependent on an industry or commodity for their prosperity and an industry downturn or a commodity price drop can send their economies into a tailspin any businesses that operate in these countries are consequently exposed to this volatility the bottom line if you consider all four of these risks is that some countries are riskier than others and it behooves us to factor this risk in when investing in these countries either directly as a business or indirectly as an investor in that business measures if you accept the proposition that some countries are riskier than others the next step is measuring this country risk and there are three ways you can approach the task a country risk scores there are services that measure country risk with scores trying to capture exposure to all of the risks listed above the scores are subjective judgments and are not quite comparable across services because each service scales risk differently the world bank provides an array of governance indicators from corruption to political stability for 214 countries whereas measures a composite risk score for each country with low high scores corresponding to high low country risk b default risk the most widely accessible measure of country risk markets in financial markets is country default risk measured with a sovereign rating by moody s s p and other ratings agencies for about 140 countries and a market based measure sovereign cds for about 72 countries the picture below provides sovereign ratings and sovereign cds spreads across the globe at the start of 2020 click to enlarge c equity risk while there are some who use the country default spreads as proxies for additional equity risk in countries i scale up the default spread for the higher risk in equities using the ratio of volatility in an emerging market equity index to an emerging market bond index to estimate the added risk premium for countries click to enlarge note that the base premium for a mature equity market at the start of 2020 is set to the implied equity risk premium of 5 20 that we estimated for the s p 500 at the start of 2020 the picture below shows equity risk premiums by country at the start of 2020 click to enlarge looking back at these equity risk premiums for countries going back to 1992 and comparing the country erp at the start of 2020 to my estimates at the start of 2019 you see a significant drop off reflecting a decline in sovereign default spreads of about 20 25 across default classes in 2019 and a drop in the equity risk relative to bonds company risk exposure to country risk the conventional practice in valuation which seems to ascribe to all companies incorporated and listed in a country the country risk premium for that country is both sloppy and wrong a company s risk comes from where and how it operates its businesses not where it is incorporated and traded a german company that manufactures its products in poland and sells them in china is german only in name and is exposed to polish and chinese country risk one reason that i estimate the equity risk premiums for as many countries as i need them in both valuation and corporate finance even if every company i analyze is a us company valuing companies if you accept my proposition that to value a company you have to incorporate the risk of where it does business into the analysis the equity risk premium that you use for a company should reflect where it operates the open question is whether it is better to measure operating risk exposure with where a company generates its revenues where its production is located or a mix of the two for companies like coca cola ko where the production costs are a fraction of revenues and moveable i think it makes sense to use revenues using the company s 2018 19 revenue breakdown for instance the equity risk premium for the country is for companies where production costs are higher and facilities are less moveable your weights for countries should be at least partially based on production at the limit with natural resource companies the operating exposure should be based upon where it produces those resources thus aramco s armco equity risk premium should be entirely based on saudi arabia s since it extracts all its oil there but royal dutch s rds a rds b will reflect its more diverse production base put simply the exposure to country risk does not come from where a company is incorporated or where it is traded but from its operations analyzing projects investments if equity risk premiums are a critical ingredient for valuation they are just as important in corporate finance determining what hurdle rates multinationals should use when considering projects in foreign markets with l oreal otcpk lrlcf for instance a project for expansion in brazil should carry the equity risk premium for brazil whereas a project in india should carry the indian equity risk premium the notion of a corporate cost of capital that you use on every project is both absurd and dangerous and becomes even more so when you are in multiple businesses the currency effect when the discussion turns to country risk it almost always veers off into currency risk with many conflating the two in their discussions while there are conditions where the two are correlated and draw from the same fundamentals it is good to keep the two risks separate since how you deal with them can also be very different decoding currencies interest rates and exchange rates when analyzing currencies it is very easy to get distracted by experts with macro views providing their forecasts with absolute certainty and distractions galore from governments keeping their currencies stronger or weaker and speculative trading to get past this noise i will draw on the intrinsic interest rate equation that i used in my last post to explain why interest rates in the united states have stayed low for the last decade intrinsic riskfree rate inflation real gdp growth that identity can be used to both explain why interest rates vary across currencies as well as variation in exchange rates over time risk free rates if you accept the proposition that the interest rate in a currency is the sum of the expected inflation in that currency and a real interest that stands in for real growth it follows that risk free rates will vary across currencies getting those currency specific risk rates can range from trivial looking up a government bond rate to difficult where the government bond rate provides a starting point but needs cleaning up to complex where you have to construct a risk free rate out of what seems like thin air 1 government bond rates there are a few dozen governments that issue ten year bonds in their local currencies and the search for risk free rates starts there to the extent that these government bonds are liquid and you perceive no default risk in the government you can use the government bond rate as your risk free rate it is that rationale that we use to justify using the swiss government s swiss franc 10 year rate as the risk free rate in swiss francs and the norwegian government s ten year krone rate as the riskfree rate in krone it is still the rationale though you are likely to start to get some pushback in using the us treasury bond rate as the risk free rate in dollars and the german 10 year euro as the risk free rate in euros the pushback will come from some who argue that the us treasury can choose to default and that the german government does not really control the printing of the euro and could default as well while i can defend the practice of using the government bond rate as the risk free rate in these scenarios arguing that you can use the nigerian government s naira bond rate or the brazilian government s real bond rate as risk free is much more difficult to do in fact these are government s where ratings agencies perceive significant risk even in the local currency bonds and attach ratings that reflect that risk moody s rates brazil s local currency bonds at ba2 and india s local currency bonds at baa2 in my pursuit of a risk free rate in currencies like these where there is no aaa rated entity issuing a bond i compute a risk free rate by netting out the default spread riskfree rate in currency government bond rate default spread for sovereign local currency rating using this approach on the indian rupee and the brazilian real riskfree rate in rupees on january 1 2020 indian government rupee bond rate on january 1 2020 default spread based on baa2 rating 6 56 1 59 4 95 riskfree rate in brazilian r brazilian government r bond rate on january 1 2020 default spread based on ba2 rating 6 77 2 51 4 26 extending this approach to all countries where a local currency government bond is available we get the following risk free rates click to enlarge note that these estimates are only as good as the three data inputs that go into them first the government bond rates reported have to reflect a traded and liquid bond clearly not an issue with the us treasury or german euro bond but a stretch for the zambian kwacha bond second the local currency rating is a good measure of the default risk a challenge when ratings agencies are biased or late in adjusting third the default spread given the ratings class is estimated without bias and reflects the market at the time of the assessment 2 synthetic risk free rates if you have doubts about one or more of three assumptions needed to use the government bond approach to getting to risk free rates don t fear because there is an alternative that i will call my synthetic risk free rate to use this approach let s start with a currency in which you feel comfortable estimating a risk free rate say the us dollar if the key driver of risk free rates is expected inflation the risk free rate in any other currency can be estimated using the differential inflation between that currency and the us dollar in the short cut you add the differential inflation to the us t bond rate to get a risk free rate local currency risk free rate us t bond rate inflation rate in local currency inflation rate in us dollars in the full calculation you incorporate the compounding effects of the differential inflation this approach can be used in almost any setting to estimate a local currency risk free rate including the following currencies with no government bonds outstanding there are more than 120 currencies where there are no government bonds in the local currency the country borrows from banks and the imf not from markets without a government bond rate the approach described above becomes moot currencies where the government bond rate is not trustworthy there are currencies where there is a government bond with a rate but an absence of liquidity and or the presence of institutions being forced to buy the bond by the government that may make the rates untrustworthy i don t mean to cast aspersions but i seriously doubt that the zambian kwacha bond whose rate i specified in the last section has a deep or wide market pegged currencies there are some currencies that have been pegged to the us dollar either for convenience much of the middle east or stability ecuador while analysts in these markets often use the us t bond rate as the risk free rate there is a very real danger that what is pegged today may be unpegged in the future especially when the fundamentals don t support the peg specifically if the local inflation rate is much higher than the inflation rate in the us it may be more prudent to use the synthetic risk free rate instead of the us t bond rate as the risk free rate the key inputs here are the expected inflation rate in the us dollar and the expected inflation rate in the local currency the former can be obtained from market data using the difference between the us t bond rate and the tips rate but the latter is more difficult while you can always use last year s inflation rate but that number is not only backward looking but subject to manipulation i prefer the forecasts of inflation that you can get from the imf and i have used those to get expected risk free rates in other currencies using the us t bond rate as my base risk free rate and you can find them at this link currency choice having belabored the reasons for why riskfree rates vary across currencies let s talk about how to pick a currency to use in valuing a company the key word is choice since you can value any company in any currency though it may be easiest to get financial information on the company in a local currency an indian company can be valued in us dollars indian rupees or euros or even in real terms and if you are consistent about dealing with inflation in your valuation the value should be the same in every currency at first sight that may sound odd since the risk free rate in us dollars is much lower than the risk free rate in indian rupees but the answer lies in looking at all of the inputs into value not just the discount rate in fact inflation affects all of your numbers with high inflation currencies the damage wrought by the higher discount rates that they bring into the process are offset by the higher nominal growth you will have in your cash flows and the effects will cancel out with low inflation currencies any benefits you get from the lower discount rates that come with them will be given back when you use the lower nominal growth rates that go with them in practice there is perhaps no other aspect of valuation where you are more likely to see consistency errors than with currencies and here are some scenarios casual dollarization in casual dollarization you start by estimating your costs of equity and capital in us dollars partly because you do not want to or cannot estimate risk free rates in a local currency you then convert your expected future cash flows in the local currency and convert them to dollars using the current exchange rate that represents a fatal step since the inflation differentials that cause risk free rates to be different will also cause exchange rates to change over time purchasing power parity may be a crude approximation of reality but it is a reality that will eventually hold and ignoring can lead to valuation errors that are huge corporate hurdle rates i have long argued against computing a corporate cost of capital and using it as a hurdle rate on investments and acquisitions and that argument gets even stronger when the investments or acquisitions are cross border and in different currencies if a european company takes its euro cost of capital and uses it to value hungarian polish or russian companies not correcting for either country risk or currency differentials it will find a lot of bargains mismatched currency frames of reference we all have frames of reference that are built into our thinking based upon where we live and the currencies we deal with having lived in the us for 40 years and dealt with more us companies than companies in any other market i tend to think in us dollar terms when i think of reasonable high or low growth rates while that is understandable i have to remember that when conversing with an indian analyst in mumbai whose day to day dealings in rupees the growth rates that he or she provides me for a company will be in rupees consequently it behooves both of us to be explicit about currencies my expected growth rate for infosys infy in us dollars is 4 5 or my cost of capital in indian rupees is 10 when making statements even though it is cumbersome one of the side costs of globalization is that you can no longer assume especially if you are a us investor or analysts that the conversations that you will be having will always be on your currency terms presumably dollars understanding how currencies are measurement tools not instruments of risk or asset classes will make that transition easier conclusion in this post i looked at two variables country and currency that are often conflated in valuation perhaps because risky countries tend to have volatile currencies and separated the discussion to examine the determinants of each and why they should not be lumped together i can invest in a company in a risky country and i can choose to do the valuation in us dollars but only if i recognize that the currency choice cannot make the country risk go away in other words a russian or brazilian company will stay risky even if you value it in us dollars and a company that gets all of its revenues in northern europe will stay safe even if you value it in russian rubles youtube video original post editor s note the summary bullets for this article were chosen by seeking alpha editors

published friday 21 february 2020 print disqus richard rick mills ahead of the herd minsky moment refers to the idea that periods of bullish speculation will eventually lead to a crisis wherein a sudden decline in optimism causes a spectacular market crash named after economist hyman minsky the theory centers around the inherent instability of stock markets especially bull markets such as the current one that has been in place for over a decade as investopedia defines it a minsky moment crisis follows a prolonged period of bullish speculation which is also associated with high amounts of debt taken on by both retail and institutional investors the levy economics institute of bard college describes his seminal theory as follows minsky held that over a prolonged period of prosperity investors take on more and more risk until lending exceeds what borrowers can pay off from their incoming revenues when overindebted investors are forced to sell even their less speculative positions to make good on their loans markets spiral lower and create a severe demand for cash an event that has come to be known as a minsky moment there are five stages in minsky s model of the credit cycle displacement investors get excited boom bullish speculation the mania euphoria extended credit to evermore dubious buyers profit taking insider trader aka smart money cashes out bust panic two examples of minsky moments are the asian debt crisis of 1997 blamed on speculators who put so much pressure on dollar pegged asian currencies that they eventually collapsed and the 2008 financial crisis which started with the failure of the government to regulate the financial industry including the us federal reserve s inability to curb toxic mortgage lending triggering a wave of mortgage defaults and margin calls as billions in assets were sold to cover debts is the current us stock market and global economy approaching a minsky moment that pops it if so safe haven assets like gold and silver will surely go ballistic hence the title of today s article a minsky moment is coming for gold let s take a look at where we are in minsky s model of the credit cycle us economy fake and real yet you wouldn t know there s anything wrong judging from the us economy unemployment is at its lowest in 50 years wages last year grew by 3 1 on average and stock markets keep rolling along although us stocks dropped tuesday and apple s shares took a 2 hit owing to coronavirus related production problems the dow s p 500 and nasdaq are all up significantly year to date turns out much of this is fake news marketwatch reported us companies cut back on investment last year due to reduced exports and disruptions to the global economy from the us china trade war for example spending on new equipment offices software etc rose just 1 3 in 2019 well short of the 6 4 and 4 4 of 2017 and 2018 while business investment excluding housing is predicted by america s biggest banks to double this year to 2 4 that will be offset by an expected 0 5 slowdown in consumer spending high us stock market performance is masking another economic indicator that has fallen to its lowest level since 2016 the purchasing managers index the ihs markit pmi in january fell to a three month low from 52 4 in december to 51 7 barely holding above 50 any reading below 50 indicates poor economic conditions firms noted a slower improvement in operating conditions and slack domestic and foreign demand from clients and while there are grounds for optimism regarding a trade war resolution the coronavirus has thrown a spanner into the phase 1 trade agreement signed on jan 15 china s promise to purchase an additional 200 billion worth of us goods including agricultural products is now in considerable doubt beijing is reportedly being urged to invoke force majeure a clause allowing the two parties to consult one another if a natural disaster or force beyond its control delays either party from meeting its obligations under the agreement the possibility of moving forward on a phase 2 agreement also seems unlikely in light of all the supply chain interruptions caused by the pandemic to these trade resolution obstacles we can add the fact that the trump administration has just granted its commerce department sweeping powers to slap tariffs on countries it decides are manipulating their currencies to the detriment of the united states and its exporting companies buybacks as we have written share buybacks are a relatively new phenomenon for most of the 20th century they were illegal because they were considered to be a form of stock market manipulation but that all changed in 1982 when the sec legalized them since then buybacks have been a popular tool for management to stuff cash back into the company indirectly by reducing the share float purchasing company stock generally inflates the share price and boosts earnings per share a key metric on which ceo bonuses are calculated after the sec changed the rules to allow buybacks hundreds of companies starting using them in 1997 buybacks surpassed dividends as the main way companies redistribute funds to investors buybacks are the main reason for the extraordinary rise in the s p 500 since 2009 according to a blog by evergreen gavekal a registered investment advisor ria while there is nothing inherently wrong with share repurchases reducing a company s outstanding shares makes each dollar of earnings more valuable on a per share basis which is good for investors the problem is that companies are borrowing at an alarming rate in order to repurchase their own shares evergreen gavekal explains as the high profile economist david rosenberg has repeatedly pointed out there is a 4 trillion trifecta occurring presently during the twenty teens the fed has created 4 trillion of to be blunt bogus bucks or bbs and those bbs have been used to fund 4 trillion of other bbs as in buybacks and yet another 4 trillion has been taken out in additional corporate debt a third bb bubble bonds kind of a strange coincidence isn t it to elevate debt to dangerous levels to enable share repurchases which usually lowers profits because of the increased interest costs is the antithesis of judicious corporate stewardship again this likely won t become an issue until the next recession a full blown one not just of the earnings and industrial variety but when that occurs the trap door will fly open and the plethora of corporate bodies left twisting in the wind will be a gruesome sight when companies are repurchasing shares at one of the highest levels ever relative to the size of the us economy and also compared to cash flow they are almost certainly destroying long term value for their shareholders not only is shareholder value being destroyed through copious share buybacks there is also record insider selling going on according to the sec insiders typically sell five times as much stock in the eight days after a buyback announcement as ordinary days the big picture view of this situation is that we have companies repurchasing their shares at a fever pitch while insiders are dumping said shares at an equally feverish rate states the blog adding that the death knell of buybacks could be the high corporate debt levels compared to the rest of the economy us companies are currently sitting on nearly 10 trillion in debt close to half 47 the value of the rest of the economy alternatively they could be canceled by legislation should the democrats gain power in november s elections if something were to happen to stop or restrict the practice the minsky moment would almost certainly come about via a stock market crash the likes of which we may not care to envision inflection in our recent article we said we believe the global economy has reached an inflection point global growth has slowed compounded by trade wars the slowdown in china and the latest threat the coronavirus what will it take to push it over the edge we ll get to that but first consider the defensive stance being taken by gold backed etfs and central banks according to the world gold council global gold backed etfs and similar products added 61 tonnes t or net inflows of us 3 1bn in january across nearly all regions boosting holdings to new all time highs of 2 947t central banks worried about economies cooling and low inflation were buying gold by the truckload and pursuing monetary stimulus in the form of interest rate cuts and or massive bond buying programs like we went through with quantitative easing in the us europe and japan that worked pretty well after the financial crisis when the world economy was more or less back on track with no tit for tat tariffs impeding international trade and the us dollar still carrying enough heft and respect to enjoy exorbitant privilege this time is different we have an unpredictable president in the white house that has already done much damage to the world economy hurt the relationship between the us and china and now appears heading towards a global currency trade war wherein everybody dukes it out over who can devalue and out export the other the outcome is a gradual race to worthless and america s trading partners punting the dollar and replacing it with a basket of currencies likely remember all that central bank gold buying backed by gold so what might be the hair trigger that causes the us stock market bubble to pop and gold to soar it s impossible to know for sure but we can take a few educated guesses based on what we know is happening in the global economy as we write pandemic effects all eyes are on the coronavirus and its economic repercussions particularly on the chinese economy and the economies of china s closest trading partners quarantines done to contain the outbreak have had an impact on global supply chains including mined commodities earlier this month china s copper buyers asked chilean miners to delay shipments due to port shutdowns ocean freight carriers are refusing to dock in china same as airlines have canceled flights some mining companies have had trouble delivering supplies due to transportation blockages and delays china s home prices have fallen and large swathes of chinese industry have not re opened after chinese new year because migrant workers afraid to return to the cities are staying in their home villages the loss of these workers shoppers has dented china s increasingly consumer oriented economy although coronavirus is mostly confined to hubei province and wuhan the city of 11 million people known to be the epicenter medical experts are not ruling out the virus fanning out beyond the 24 countries currently affected bloomberg ran a story saying it could infect a shocking two thirds of the globe traders are reportedly piling into hedges if the contagion becomes a disaster for the global economy which is already limping along in its january update the imf lowered its 2020 global growth forecast by one tenth of a percentage point to 3 3 following last year s 2 9 the lowest in a decade in japan gdp has fallen a precipitous 6 3 nearly twice as much as the predicted 3 7 catalyzed by poor weather and a hike in the sales tax notably the coronavirus was not a factor in the dismal figure meaning the outbreak could take an even worse toll on the world s third largest economy last year germany slipped into a manufacturing recession and the largest economy of the eurozone area does not appear to be improving the guardian reported the german economy flat lined to 0 growth in the fourth quarter side swiped by lower exports on account of trade tensions and a slowdown in consumer and government spending if the coronavirus continues to be a problem many are expecting the fed will step into lower interest rates the impact of the virus on the global economy is going to be significantly more than what people are expecting and when the global economy goes south the fed steps in bnn bloomberg quoted tony farren managing director at broker dealer mischler financial in stamford connecticut one signal of a potential reduction beyond the 1 to 2 quarter point cuts already priced into the market is the spread between 2 and 10 year treasury yields currently at the flattest level since november a yield curve inversion when short term yields push higher than long term yields is a predictable recession indicator shipping collapse one of the most alarming sign of the world economy s malaise is the baltic dry index chart from 2500 in september the bdi has plunged over 80 to 434 meaning the cost of shipping is one sixth what it was 5 months ago according to hellenic shipping news rates for capesize bulk vessels are less than a third of breakeven and the bdi is fast approaching the 290 points of february 2016 the worst of all time currency rule the trump administration is going down a very dangerous road with its new currency rule that imbues the us commerce department with incredibly strong powers to invoke across the board trade protectionism from countries all the way down to individual companies the way we see it buying gold or silver bullion is one of the best ways to take a defensive position during what could be the beginning of an all encompassing trade war and a truly global and a round of highly competitive currency devaluations wherein the winner is the biggest loser some industries and us at aoth believe this aggressively protectionist stance will lead to currency wars and turn the 6 trillion per day global currency market into a new battleground for trump s trade wars goods benefiting from weak currencies representing each and every one of america s trading partners could be recipients of duties or countervailing duties equal to the difference between the weaker currency and the us dollar in other words eliminating that country s currency advantage while china is the obvious target of us tariffs and rule changes strengthening the commerce department s hand in dealing with currency complaints there are many other countries and individual businesses commerce has in its sights last year the treasury department came out with a report that recommended 21 trading partners should face scrutiny over their currencies they include china germany japan south korea ireland italy malaysia vietnam and singapore these trading nations and even their individual businesses that import goods into the us are now vulnerable to being tariffed on targeted imports an amount that will make imports sell for more than their us counterpart geopolitical risk other potential catalysts aka minsky moment for gold are geopolitical in a project syndicate article economist nouriel roubini points to white swan events they are knowable versus unknowable out of the blue black swans that could turn the current boom and bubble into a crash and burst white swans include the us rivalries with china russia iran and north korea these countries all have an interest in challenging the us led global order and 2020 could be a critical year for them owing to the us presidential election and the potential change in us global policies that could follow under president donald trump the us is trying to contain or even trigger regime change in these four countries through economic sanctions and other means similarly the four revisionists want to undercut american hard and soft power abroad by destabilizing the us from within through asymmetric warfare if the us election descends into partisan rancor chaos disputed vote tallies and accusations of rigged elections so much the better for america s rivals a breakdown of the us political system would weaken american power abroad arguably the us political system is already broken which substantially ups the chance of some kind of clash with one of these four powers a dysfunctional polarity of views that has become the norm in us politics we have written before on how this extreme polarization is killing america the real disaster is the fact that partisanship is preventing legislators from working together to solve important issues like addressing the ways that climate change is set to wreck us coastal cities or reforming mining legislation to make america less dependent on foreign suppliers of critical minerals we ve noticed the partisanship the bickering the impasses the sheer hatred of the other side is worse under trump who certainly fanned the flames of discord to get elected and continues to blow on them knowing that divide and conquer is his best path to re election in 2020 things aren t much better with the democratic party though the division within the dems has been evident since the first debates last summer as a slew of candidates duked it out over how far the party should migrate to the left to win back the white house there are still eight candidates vying for their party s nomination as they head into the texas primary roubini thinks conflict between the us and russia china iran or north korea could occur through some form of cyberwarfare russian hackers are known to have interfered in the 2016 election the same thing could happen again in 2020 possibly from china as retribution for the us being a trade irritant the four may also gang up western financial systems such as the swift platform used by banks and financial institutions to clear international monetary transactions the current arms buildup between the us china and russia precipitated by the us pulling out of the 1987 inf treaty due to russia breaking its terms could easily trigger a war especially if china is pushed into a corner due to economic weakness and is looking for a scapegoat taiwan hong kong vietnam and us naval positions in the east and south china seas are all potential hot spots that could lead to military confrontation roubini writes that combined with persistent trade barriers that are keeping the chinese economy weak could result in china dumping us treasuries if there was ever a minsky moment this would be it but instead of selling treasuries and converting dollars into renminbi causing the latter to rise choking off chinese exports roubini points out the chinese could instead convert their dollars into gold this would both add to its central bank gold reserves something china continues to do while hurting the us economy in a sell off scenario the capital gains on gold would compensate for any loss incurred from dumping us treasuries whose yields would spike as their market price and value fell so far china and russia s shift into gold has occurred slowly leaving treasury yields unaffected but if this diversification strategy accelerates as is likely it could trigger a shock in the us treasuries market possibly leading to a sharp economic slowdown in the us debt meanwhile in november total us debt surpassed 23 trillion for the first time with just under 17 trillion held by the public and 6 trillion in government loans reaching 23 trillion in debt on halloween is a scary milestone for our economy and the next generation but washington shows no fear the hill quoted michael peterson ceo of the fiscally conservative peter g peterson foundation piling on debt like this is especially unwise and unnecessary in a strong economy he added the country is accumulating about the same amount of debt as its annual economic output each year another trillion dollars gets added to the national debt rising interest rates compound the problem in 2008 interest on the national debt was 253 billion and consumed 8 5 of the federal budget in 2019 the government had to put aside 376 billion in debt interest a third of the real defense budget and more than spending on education agriculture transportation and housing combined by 2026 the interest is projected to be 762 billion and take up 12 9 of the budget according to its latest projections the congressional budget office says debt to gdp will reach 150 by 2047 well past the point where financial crises typically occur the budget deficit is also likely to rise nearly tripling from 2 9 of gdp to 9 8 in 2047 the growing debt burden is not just a us phenomenon it s global in the first quarter of 2019 world debt hit 246 5 trillion reversing a trend that started in the beginning of 2018 of reducing debt burdens when global debt reached its highest on record 248 trillion this can t go on forever it s not a stretch to envision a scenario whereby the world s reserve currency the us dollar collapses under the weight of unmanageable debt triggered say by a mass offloading of us treasuries by foreign countries that currently own about 6 trillion of us debt this would cause the dollar to crash and interest rates would go through the roof choking consumer and business borrowing import prices would skyrocket too the result of a low dollar hitting consumers in the pocket book for everything not made in the usa business confidence would plummet mass layoffs would occur growth would stop and the us would enter a recession all the countries that sold their treasuries would then face a major slump in demand for their products from american consumers their largest market eventually companies in these countries would begin to suffer plus all other nations that trade with the us like canada and mexico before long the recession in the us would spread like a cancer to the rest of the world this of course is a likely scenario to gold enthusiasts who invest and believe in gold for its utility as a store of value when everything else ie fiat currencies fails indeed holders of dollars would find their once powerful greenback reduced to monopoly money people with gold would be the only ones left with any purchasing power to pay bills and buy day to day goods and services conclusion consider what happened to gold when iran countered the assassination of its top military commander with missile strikes against two iraqi bases housing us troops gold futures jumped to a six year high of 1 613 30 an ounce as fear and uncertainty over what comes next had investors piling into the precious metal think of that as a dress rehearsal for what could really cause a spike in gold including but not limited to the collapse of the us dollar underneath a mounting pile of debt the end of stock buybacks responsible for much of the air inside the decade long us stock market bubble an escalation of the trade war between the us and china made worse by new tariff levying powers granted to the us commerce department or even a shooting war that erupts out of a geopolitical conflict such as hong kong taiwan or chinese territorial ambitions in the south china sea this article has presented some of the minsky moment scenarios that could set the gold price on a tear the likes of which we ve never seen i d like to end this article here after presenting you not with the disease we suffer but with its symptoms consequences and take the following up in another article all the effort and planning imaginable cannot make paper money work there is no way paper can be improved as money whenever governments are granted power to purchase their own debt they never fail to do so eventually destroying the value of the currency ron paul the case for gold as investors the best way to protect ourselves against a global or regional depending on where you live calamity that even a large cache of us dollars could fail to provide is to own gold

expected pmi news it is off about 0 35 in late morning turnover it had gained about 4 8 in the previous two weeks the s p 500 staged an impressive rally as once again the pullback was bought however us shares are trading lower with the s p 500 trading near yesterday s lows asia pacific bond yields tumbled partly as catch up and partly driven by local data european bond yields are a little lower and the 10 year us treasury yield has fallen below 1 50 for the first time since last september the us dollar is mostly softer with the australian and new zealand dollars being the main exceptions nursing about a 0 3 loss although the yen s typically drivers appeared to break down earlier this week relationships appeared to return to status quo ante with lower us treasury yields and weakness in equities underpinning the yen whose roughly 0 3 gain is leading the majors gold is on fire it is at new 7 year highs near 1635 to bring this week s gain to about 50 a little more than 3 oil prices are lower and the wti for april delivery is halving this week s gains to about 1 4 asia pacific the steepness of japan s q4 contraction 1 6 quarter over quarter and the disruption of supply chains of people chinese tourists and goods supply chains have fanned fears that the recovery is put off until q2 the preliminary pmi though it does not have a long history has a somber message manufacturing stands at 47 6 down from 48 8 here the weakness was exacerbated mild strength in services 51 0 turned south in a big way 46 7 the composite reading fell to 47 0 from 50 1 the fragile recovery from q4 was shattered boj governor kuroda quickly said it was not time to think of additional stimulus separately japan s january cpi figures were little changed the headline year over year rate slipped to 0 7 from 0 8 while the core rate excludes fresh food did just the opposite the australian dollar has been sold aggressively as growth concerns escalated given the wildfires and the disruption caused by the coronavirus the february pmi confirmed these investor fears even though the manufacturing pmi actually rose 49 8 vs 49 6 the decline in the services pmi 48 4 vs 50 6 more than offset it the composite fell to 48 3 from 50 2 last year it averaged 50 5 though it was below the 50 boom bust level in november and december south korea s trade figures for the first 20 days of february give a sense of the dramatic disruption taking place south korea s average daily shipments during the period were 9 3 lower than a year ago overall exports to china were off 3 7 even though there were more working days imports from china dropped by 19 overall south korean exports rose 12 year over year but this figure is distorted by the calendar effect which added three working days compared to a year ago the dollar tested jpy112 20 yesterday and pulled back to around jpy111 50 today the jpy111 30 area corresponds with a 38 2 retracement objective of this week s surge however the intraday technicals warn that the washout may not be completed and that the north american market may retest the jpy112 00 area there is a 625 million option struck there that expires today it is the third consecutive weekly advance for the dollar the longest since october the australian dollar is down for the fourth straight session the last time it finished the north american session with a gain was

0 65 the greenback briefly traded above cny7 04 for the first time since mid december europe the eurozone flash pmi was better than expected still the soft data can only drop so much for the sentiment after the large collapse in the real sector industrial output in december german manufacturing contraction slowed and the february pmi manufacturing pmi rose to 47 8 from 45 3 the service pmi softened to 53 3 from 54 2 the compositing reading ticked to 51 1 from 51 2 which was still better than the decline economists had forecast in france the manufacturing pmi disappointed falling to 49 7 from 51 1 the services pmi was resilient rising to 52 6 from 51 0 this resulted in the composite improving to 51 9 from 51 1 the aggregate figures for the eurozone were better than expected and new orders edged higher despite softer foreign demand the resilience of the labor market is also a constructive sign the manufacturing pmi was at 47 9 in january and is now at 49 1 a year ago it was at 49 3 the services pmi rose to 52 8 from 52 5 and matches the year ago level the composite was expected to slip to 51 0 from 51 3 in january but instead rose to 51 6 in february 2019 it was at 51 9 the uk preliminary february pmi is consistent with recent data suggesting that after stagnating in q4 the british economy is faring better at the start of 2020 the manufacturing pmi moved back above the 50 boom bust level to 51 9 which was better than expected the services pmi slipped to 53 3 from 53 9 the net effect was to leave the composite unchanged at 53 3 economists had forecast a decline the euro is trading just inside yesterday s range just above 1 08 the euro is off about 0 25 for the week it has risen in only one week so far this year and that was the last week of january it has carved out a range this week of roughly 1 0780 1 0850 a meaningful low does not seem to be in place sterling is also trading inside yesterday s ranges it has met offers in front of 1 2930 and the intraday technicals warn of downside risk in the north american session initial support may be near 1 2880 america it is not simply that asia and europe have been hit by adverse developments but the us data has generally surprised on the upside the contrast divergence helps explain the dollar s strength and the dollar index is approached 100 which it has not traded above since april 2017 on tap today is the pmi and existing home sales two fed governors clarida and brainard and two regional presidents kaplan and mester speak canada reports december retail sales and they are likely too old to have much impact that said a small gain is expected at the headline level dragged down a bit by flagging auto sales the us dollar briefly dipped below cad1 3215 yesterday to make a new low for the month before reversing higher to reach almost cad1 3270 it is consolidating in a narrow range down to roughly cad1 3245 on the week the canadian dollar has outperformed the other majors but the swiss franc and is down less than 0 1 against the greenback us dollar gains above the cad1 3280 area would improve its technical tone the mexican peso has extended yesterday s nearly 1 5 decline the us dollar has poked above mxn19 00 after trading near mxn18 55 yesterday it has traded above mxn19 00 a few times this year but has not closed above it since the first half of last december we do not think that the underlying dynamics have changed and that the setback in the peso will offer new opportunities for the carry plays however given the increased volatility participants will likely wait for next week

our balance sheet and outlook for 2020 after our prepared remarks we will open the call for your questions our full year 2019 results reflect the continued execution of our strategy to drive long term cash flow growth and shareholder value we did this in three ways by organically growing our core business by completing and integrating strategic acquisitions and by developing advanced temperature controlled warehouses we are very pleased with our results on all fronts and ended the year with a portfolio that contains in excess of 1 billion refrigerated cubic feet this significant growth is even more notable in light of our ability to maintain our financial flexibility and low leverage for the full year 2019 we grew total revenue by 11 2 and total company noi by 17 9 this was driven by growth in our warehouse segment revenue and noi of 17 and 19 5 respectively these strong results came from our recent acquisitions and organic growth i m also very pleased to report that our global warehouse same store pool generated total revenue growth and noi growth of 3 5 and 5 1 respectively on a constant currency basis we delivered same store noi growth that was approximately 160 basis points higher than our same store revenue growth and we believe this highlights the strength of the americold operating platform now let me discuss our acquisition and development activity in more detail in 2019 we acquired 27 facilities which added approximately 170 million cubic feet to our portfolio for a total of 1 4 billion this comprised of portfresh holdings a single facility and development land parcel in savannah georgia cloverleaf cold storage a 22 facility portfolio that was previously the fifth largest cold storage operator in the u s lanier cold storage a two facility operator outside of atlanta and mhw group a two facility operator in chambersburg pennsylvania and perryville maryland with respect to these 2019 acquisition we remain focused on integration we spent much of the second half of 2019 in transitioning cloverleaf s sg a functions to our headquarters and are on track to capture the expected synergies for all four transactions we are focused on implementing our commercial business practices to drive revenue growth and rolling out the americold s operating system to drive efficiency gains we are very pleased with our progress to date transitioning these acquisitions onto our platform and expect that we will fully capture the upside from these investments by year three of our ownership we are off to a strong start in 2020 we acquired newport cold a single facility located in st paul minnesota for 56 million additionally we expanded our infrastructure and presence in canada through the completion of our acquisition of nova cold logistics which consisted of four facilities in toronto calgary and halifax for approximately 257 million us dollars finally we announced today that americold will be entering into a strategic joint venture with superfrio a leading temperature controlled storage operator in brazil brazil is a key market in the global food chain as it is a leading exporter of beef poultry and other commodities this joint venture provides an attractive entry point in a high consumption market with a population of 210 million people in the world s ninth largest economy superfrio is the leading operator in the country and is very similar to americold in their strategic approach to running their business superfrio currently operates in 16 locations comprised of 35 million cubic feet under the terms of the agreement americold will acquire 15 of superfrio for approximately 28 million us dollars superfrio is currently owned by patria an experienced brazilian based private equity firm affiliated with blackstone the company is executing an acquisition and development growth plan in the brazilian market we will co invest at our pro rata share americold will have a foot on superfrio s storage and retains the exclusive option to acquire the remaining 85 of the company starting in 2023 we are investing with a best in class local market operator in superfrio and partner in patria both of which have strong market knowledge of brazil we are excited to expand our global platform with this and our canadian investments now turning to our development pipeline we delivered our state of the art expansion project in chicago at the end of the second quarter 2019 we are now fully focused on ramping the project with stabilization our expectation is unchanged from last quarter we expect this asset to continue to ramp throughout 2020 and deliver its underwritten stabilized returns in fiscal year 2021 we will continue to update you on our progress also during the fourth quarter we completed two of the expansion projects that we purchased as a part of our cloverleaf acquisition at chesapeake virginia and north little rock arkansas in the first quarter of 2020 we also delivered the expansion project in columbus ohio we believe we are on track to achieve stabilization at each of these facilities over the first 12 months we continue to make progress on the rest of our active development pipeline which consists of two projects currently under way in savannah and atlanta totaling approximately 33 million cubic feet and representing approximately 211 million of investment now i d like to take a moment to update you on our activities in australia at this time we are not moving forward with the development contemplated under the previously announced letter of intent we executed with the top customer this is because the scope of the project materially changed let me emphasize that we maintain a good relationship with this customer that we have served for over 30 years we continue to work with them on their future supply chain needs and to that end we are announcing a new 42 million us dollar expansion project in auckland new zealand this expansion will add 4 6 million cubic feet to an existing facility that exclusively houses the same customer we have signed a definitive agreement under which they will anchor the new expansion with room to upsize in the future construction is scheduled to start at the second quarter of 2020 with completion in the second quarter of 2021 and stabilization is expected one year thereafter as this agreement demonstrates we have plenty of opportunities to grow our customer base over the long term at this time our development pipeline remains robust with over 1 2 billion of potential opportunities all of this external growth was supported by our strong low levered balance sheet throughout 2019 we remain good stewards of capital we de risked our growth by proactively raising capital to fund acquisitions and development with forward components where possible we issued private placement debt and now benefit from multiple investment grade credit ratings which reduced our cost of capital we transformed our shareholder base and increased our flow through the successful secondary offering completed by our legacy financial sponsors who have fully exited their investment additionally we launched an atm program to further diversify our capital sourcing option as we stand now at the start of 2020 market conditions underpinning the temperature controlled storage industry remain attractive demand growth is tied to population and consumption growth along with customer driven shifts in supply chain optimization strategies this is coupled with the continued shift toward and consumer preferences toward healthy perishable food which increases the need for temperature controlled storage we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends with our outsized market share in our fully integrated infrastructure from a supply perspective barriers remain high for new development over the course of many years we have invested millions of dollars in technology process and infrastructure in our facility just as important is our deep relationship with our customers who trust us to maintain the integrity of their brand our customer centric focus and leading supply chain innovation combined with our portfolio that has the right assets in the right locations will serve us well as we deliver consistent and profitable growth over the long term before i turn the call over to marc i d like to comment on a few exciting internal developments here at americold as an organization we continue to focus on our corporate responsibility to serve the public good by maintaining the integrity of the food supply and reducing weight further we remain committed to sustainability as we seek to reduce our energy consumption in 2018 the global cold chain alliance awarded 56 of our facilities gold and silver certification as a part of their energy excellence recognition program we are pleased to announce that in 2019 the gcca has certified an additional 76 facilities we now have 132 sites certified by the gcca which represents 77 of our warehouse segment portfolio i m very pleased with our team s dedication to this important sustainability effort from a personnel standpoint we continue to promote safety for our americold associates as a top priority 2019 was another exceptional year in terms of record low incidents at our facilities this is our fifth consecutive year of reduction and we are very proud of our industry leading safety performance additionally we continue to ensure our bench of executive talent is deep and positions us for growth over the course of 2019 we made several key executive hires and welcomed three new directors to our board during the first quarter of 2020 we announced the hiring of rob chambers as chief commercial officer to head our business development efforts rob was most recently at a publicly traded logistics company prior to that he was here with us at americold as vice president of commercial finance where he was instrumental in developing our commercial business rules and underwriting process rob will lead global business development and focus on growing and expanding our customer base we are excited to have rob back on our team in summary 2019 was another exciting and transformative year here at americold we are very grateful to our entire team for their efforts to lead innovation in our industry continue to serve our customers drive same store growth complete acquisition and execute on our development we are off to a great start in 2020 i ll now turn the call over to marc who will provide more details on our quarterly results balance sheet and outlook for 2020 marc smernoff executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you fred and good afternoon everyone today we will provide updates on our actual performance as well as certain metrics on a constant currency basis i will also provide details on our guidance for 2020 for the fourth quarter we reported total company revenue of 486 million and total company noi of 138 million which reflects a 16 9 increase and a 26 8 increase year over year respectively core ebitda was 109 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 an increase of 28 8 year over year this was driven by our 2019 acquisitions and solid growth within our core portfolio our core ebitda margin grew by 208 basis points to 22 4 please note our strong core ebitda growth and margin improvement overcame the following factors the j curve associated with implementing and aligning our recent acquisitions to the americold operating system and practices the start up expenses related to our recent development projects and the currency translation impact of the strengthening of the u s dollar for the fourth quarter 2019 we reported net income of 21 million compared to net income of 3 million for the same quarter of the prior year our fourth quarter core ffo was 65 million or 0 33 per diluted share our fourth quarter affo was 60 million or 0 30 per diluted share as a reminder the full definition and reconciliation of core ebitda core ffo and affo to reported net income can be found in our supplemental for the fourth quarter of 2019 global warehouse segment revenue was 384 million which reflects growth of 25 6 year over year global warehouse segment noi was 130 million which reflects growth of 28 9 global warehouse segment margin was 33 8 for the fourth quarter an 86 basis point increase compared to the same quarter of the prior year this increase in margin was primarily due to improvements in our core business accretive acquisitions same store economic occupancy growth and the benefit of the americold operating system at year end 251 million of our rent and storage revenue was derived from customers with fixed commitment storage contract as compared to 244 million at the end of the third quarter of 2019 and 220 million at the end of 2018 for the fourth quarter of 2019 40 6 of rent and storage revenue was generated from fixed commitment storage contract on a combined pro forma basis which is a 60 basis point increase over the sequential quarter as of december 31 2019 our global portfolio consisted of 178 facilities two more than we reported at the end of the third quarter 2019 due to the acquisition of the pennsylvania and maryland facilities completed in november we ended the year with 167 facilities in our global warehouse segment portfolio and 11 facilities in our third party managed segment portfolio now i will turn to our same store results in the global warehouse segment for the fourth quarter 2019 our same store global warehouse segment revenue was 308 million which reflects growth of 3 4 year over year and 4 5 on a constant currency basis same store global warehouse noi was 107 million which reflects growth of 9 1 year over year and 10 on a constant currency basis same store global warehouse noi margin increased 182 basis points to 34 8 drilling into these results a little further for the fourth quarter same store global rent and storage revenue grew by 1 year over year or 1 8 on a constant currency basis this was driven by improvements in economic occupancy partially offset by business mix and the impact of the strength of the u s dollar our same store economic occupancy was 84 6 which reflects an increase of 112 basis points from the prior year our same store rent and storage noi grew by 1 4 year over year or 2 2 on a constant currency basis same store global rent and storage noi margin increased 30 basis points to 69 3 the noi growth and margin expansion was a result of continued portfolio management combined with our efforts to grow our fixed commitment storage contracts and disciplined cost controls through the americold operating system of our power and facility related costs same store global warehouse services revenue for the fourth quarter increased 5 2 year over year or 6 5 on a constant currency basis this revenue increase resulted from a favorable mix which generated 6 9 growth in our same store warehouse services revenue for a throughput pallet on a constant currency basis our same store global warehouse services noi increased 85 8 year over year or 88 on a constant currency basis driven by cost control embedded within the americold operating system better pricing and a more favorable customer mix finally the same store warehouse services noi margin was 9 4 for the quarter an expansion of 406 basis points driven by the same factors within our global warehouse segment we had no material changes to the composition of our top 25 customers who on a pro forma basis account for approximately 60 and of our global warehouse revenue and who have been with us on average for over 30 years additionally our churn rate was approximately 3 of total warehouse revenue a 40 basis point reduction from the prior year end we continue to focus on customer service and active portfolio management as we seek to optimize our customer mix and retain customers over the long term corporate sg a totaled 33 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to 28 million for the comparable prior year quarter this increase is primarily a result of additional investments made to support our expanded development pipeline the sg a absorbed with our recent acquisitions net of realized synergies higher stock compliance costs and increased stock compensation expense additionally we incurred total cost of 10 million for the fourth quarter as shown in the acquisition litigation and other line within our statement of operations which primarily reflects m a related professional fees litigation costs and severance costs finally we believe the best way to measure our success is on an annual basis due to the seasonal nature of our business to recap our full year 2019 growth total revenues were 1 78 billion and global warehouse segment revenues were 1 38 billion an 11 2 and 17 increase respectively total contribution or noi was 478 million an increase of 17 9 global warehouse segment noi was 448 million an increase of 19 5 for the same store pool global warehouse segment revenue grew 1 9 or 3 5 on a constant currency basis and same store segment noi grew 3 9 or 5 1 on a constant currency basis core ebitda was 367 million an increase of 19 7 or 21 on a constant currency basis net income was 48 million core funds from operation was 220 million or 1 19 per diluted share and affo was 215 million or 1 17 per diluted share using a weighted average share count of 184 million now let me update you on our development and acquisition activity in aggregate we spent 211 million in 2019 on expansion and development capital including 56 million in the fourth quarter mostly related to spending at our atlanta major market expansion and our savannah georgia newbuild we delivered our automated expansion project in chicago in late second quarter and two of the expansions that we acquired as part of cloverleaf in late fourth quarter we delivered the third acquired development project in ohio shortly after year end in our supplemental we have provided additional disclosure on expected yields and target stabilization dates for these projects also at the end of 2019 we acquired two facilities in pennsylvania and maryland for 54 million post quarter end we completed the previously announced acquisition of nova cold logistics in canada for 337 million canadian dollars which translates to approximately 257 million us dollars also we completed the acquisition of newport gold in minnesota for 56 million again we have enhanced the disclosure in our supplementals and now outline our expected net entry noi yield and our expected year three yield at stabilization today we also announced that we d be entering into a strategic joint venture with brazil based superfrio whereby we ll invest 118 million brazilian real which translates to approximately 28 million us dollars or a 15 ownership in the business this transaction will result in an implied 9 forward noi yield for the entire in place business which we expect to improve through accretive acquisitions and development in that market we believe this valuation reflects the quality of the operator and the facilities and our exclusive call rights to purchase the remainder of the business in 2023 we expect to fund our pro rata share of the joint venture s acquisition and development activity over the next two years which we expect to be up to 127 million brazilian real or approximately 30 million us dollars the investment is accretive on a leverage neutral basis and we intend to fund it with cash on hand we will not hedge our currency exposure at this time and we expect to close the transaction in the first quarter finally regarding our customer in australia as fred mentioned we are starting a new expansion project in new zealand with this customer for 65 million new zealand dollars or approximately 42 million us dollars also with regard to the projects for which we will not be moving forward our customer is expected to reimburse us for certain development costs that have been capitalized including our cost for the purchase of land in sydney now turning to our balance sheet as of december 31 2019 total debt outstanding was 1 9 billion of which 76 was in an unsecured structure and 92 was at a fixed rate our real estate debt has a weighted average remaining term of 6 3 years and carries a weighted average contractual interest rate of 4 23 at quarter end we had total liquidity of approximately 1 4 billion and we had no activity on our atm program our net debt to pro forma core ebitda was approximately 4 2 times which demonstrates our commitment to prudent balance sheet management as we maintain modest leverage while executing our growth plans pro forma for the closing of our nova cold and newport acquisitions on january 2 and the initial upcoming superfrio investment and our new zealand development our total liquidity is approximately 1 billion consisting of the revolver availability cash on hand and approximately 136 million of equity forwards from our september 2018 offering we used our april 2019 forwards to fund a portion of the nova cold acquisition on january 2 which increased our fully diluted shares outstanding to approximately 205 million our pro forma net debt to core ebitda was approximately 4 5 times as a result of these transactions i d like to remind you that our recent acquisitions the initial brazilian joint venture investment and remaining development savannah atlanta and just announced the auckland new zealand projects are all fully funded at this point now i d like to take a moment to provide our outlook for 2020 first i d like to discuss the integration of the 32 facilities that we have acquired since the start of 2019 as well as our development activity both of which have a meaningful impact on our 2020 expectations first by the end of 2019 we have taken action to eliminate all 10 million in total cost savings that we expected to realize from the cloverleaf integration the capture of these synergies is reflected in our sg a guidance second let me note that we continue to incur meaningful expenses as we work to bring all of our recent acquisitions on to the americold operating platform we view these costs as critical to achieve our targeted yields stabilization by the end of year three and believe the work we do in 2020 will set the stage for long term growth given the size of these acquisitions relative to our overall portfolio none of which are in our same store pool we have incorporated this impact into our guidance finally during 2020 we expect to continue to incur start up expenses in our completed developments as we hire and train employees bring down temperature calibrate our systems and automation where applicable and onboard new customers we typically expect this ramp period to stabilization to take 12 months as we previously mentioned on our last call we expect our chicago project will take between 12 and 18 months during part of this period our operational expenses including our start up expenses may exceed the revenue generated from that site this is reflected in our guidance with this in mind for the full year we expect affo per share in the range of 1 22 to 1 30 our assumptions are as follows global warehouse segment same store revenue growth to range between two and 4 on an actual and constant currency basis global warehouse segment same store noi growth to be 100 to 200 basis points higher than the associated revenue growth managed and transportation segment noi in the range of 28 to 31 million total sg a expense of 135 to 140 million current income tax expense of 11 to 13 million deferred income tax benefit of 1 to 3 million non real estate depreciation and amortization expense of 66 to 68 million total recurring maintenance capital expenditures in the range of 65 to 75 million development starts of 75 to 200 million and finally please refer to our supplemental for currency translation rates embedded in this guidance please keep in mind that the ranges for these metrics do not include the impact of acquisitions dispositions or capital markets activity beyond which has been previously announced lastly in 2020 we have revised our methodology around our same store pool which will reflect 136 facilities at the beginning of the year our revised definition now requires that for a facility to be in the same store pool it must meet that definition at the beginning of the year now let me turn the call back to fred for some closing remarks fred boehler chief executive officer thanks mark since the start of 2019 we have closed six acquisitions completed four development projects started three additional development projects and entered into a new joint venture as we move into 2020 we are starting with strong momentum and we will continue to expand our platform to position americold for our customers around the globe we would like to welcome the many new associates to the americold family who joined us as a part of our recent acquisition and i d like to thank all of our team members for their continued hard work and dedication to our success finally we thank our shareholders for their continued support as we focus on driving growth and creating value through 2020 and beyond thanks again for joining us today and we will now open the call for your questions operator questions answers operator thank you our first questions come from the line of nate crossett of berenberg capital markets please proceed with your question nate crossett berenberg capital markets analyst hey guys good evening and i guess just question on the sydney project what does it mean when you say the scope of the project changed i mean that was a 600 million potential project it sounds like that tenant is going to be at this other location so what s the total scope of that new project i guess fred boehler chief executive officer yeah i think if you go back gosh it s been a year and a half almost two years now and we entered into an loi with this particular customer and it was more than one site it was multisite it was looking at their supply chain once we entered that loi we start to get into detailed design and as we get on through detailed design things kind of changed and shifted and remember that we continue to do the current work for them today this was talking about potentially getting into a new infrastructure if you will for the future and we ve gone through several different iterations with them and as i sit here today we look at it and we say we re probably not going to proceed in the way that was originally intended however we continue to work with them as evidenced by the newbuild that we re doing over in auckland new zealand for them with a new 15 year commitment anchoring that facility and then we continue to work with them around the rest of australia if you will but at this time we know that that s not going to be like what we originally had hoped and we ll continue to work with them as we move forward nate crossett berenberg capital markets analyst ok so when we that s helpful so if we re thinking about the drivers of growth this year is it more just m a and same store and margin improvement because it looks like there s less development capex spend that you re guiding to we all know the trends in this space seem to be good but i would have thought there have been more kind of new starts or development capex spend if there was a lot of new demand out there for cold storage fred boehler chief executive officer right it s hard to comment on timing in specific and so we ve been guiding 75 to 200 million in new starts for the last two years here our pipeline is still in excess of 1 2 billion we have several great projects that are out there and i know that some of those will come to fruition here it s a matter of timing and again the size and the scale of those differ depending on the particular customer that we re building for another key attribute and a reminder to everyone is we don t build on spec and so most of our builds most of our development projects are driven by real customer demand and engagement with those customers and as a result that timing can kind of move around a bit marc smernoff executive vice president and chief financial officer one thing i would just add to that as it relates to external growth we also don t provide guidance on m a so as you ve heard us say over the time that m a in our industry can be somewhat lumpy that s not to say we re not active having already completed two transactions this year but there is no further guidance than what s been put forth in the overall guidance fred boehler chief executive officer fair enough i ll get back in the queue thanks operator our next question comes from the line of a emmanuel korchman of citi please proceed with your question emmanuel korchman citi analyst hey everyone maybe fred or marc just following up on that you talked about the pipeline of development can you talk about what your pipeline on acquisitions looks like and split that between u s opportunities and international ones fred boehler chief executive officer yeah i mean what i would say is kind of what we always say the pipeline of acquisition opportunities is plentiful both in existing countries as well as the potential to expand into others we work with and talk to a lot of different folks and i think i ve joked before you got to kiss a lot of frogs to find the right one that we re looking for and remember we re not just acquiring to get big we re pretty picky and choosy if you will in terms of identifying the right acquisitions that we know that can be fully integrated into our enterprise so those are going to be lumpy i can t comment on size and scale of those because it s so unpredictable in terms of when or if those will come to fruition emmanuel korchman citi analyst great and just switching to guidance we do appreciate the added line items that you ve given us i am going to be annoying for a second and say what you haven t given us is the payout ratio so what you used to give us you don t give us so how do we think about the dividend and the payout ratio in comparison to the new affo per share guidance that you have given us marc smernoff executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah yeah absolutely our board evaluates our position on a quarterly basis and determines the dividend so we would expect further guidance around the dividend to be announced later this quarter consistent with prior years emmanuel korchman citi analyst but i guess just as you think about the guidance for the year and sort of cash flow allocation what level are you assuming in the guidance that you ve given marc smernoff executive vice president and chief financial officer at this point i think especially given the robust development pipeline that fred mentioned we would expect payout ratios to be consistent with prior periods roughly in that 65 to 68 operator our next questions come from the line of michael carroll of rbc capital markets please proceed with your question michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst yeah thanks i just want to go back to the woolworths project in australia so what is that customer plan on doing right now if they don t want to have the i guess the three large automated facilities do they still have i guess growing needs for temperature controlled space are you going to be providing that for them fred boehler chief executive officer yeah remember as a reminder we currently have all of their infrastructure for the bulk of their temperature control needs so we continue to operate those facilities and like i said we re kind of exploring other alternatives so is it for example hypothetically is it better to build a single greenfield automated facility or is it better to expand on to an existing facility or is it better to add a conventional facility instead of automation so all three of those things continue to be explored but we have the bulk of their business today and we ll continue to do so as we have for the last 30 years michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst ok and then should we expect i guess some smaller projects to be announced because obviously they had a pretty big growth strategy before that seems to be off the table but should we still expect and when i know they did what a 40 million project in new zealand is there other 40to 50 million projects on tap for the rest of this year fred boehler chief executive officer potentially our pipeline is over 1 2 billion michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst ok great and then just last one for me can you talk a little bit about your plans with brazil i mean how much do you want to or can you scale in that market or do you plan on just making this initial investment with that joint venture partner and see where that goes currently fred boehler chief executive officer yeah we re really excited about this partnership with patria down there in brazil superfrio is one of the leaders in there and they re very much like us they use the same operating systems have a lot of similarities in terms of customer base and how they commercialize that business so we really like that platform down there it s currently 16 sites and as we mentioned they ve got growth expectations both from a development and from an acquisition standpoint the marketplace down there is very similar to what we see here in the u s it s very fragmented so there are lots of opportunities and again they ll go about it pretty much the same way that we do here and we ll continue that partnership over the next two years and we have that ability to buy it out in 2023 operator our next questions come from the line of dave rodgers of baird dave rodgers baird analyst i wanted to ask about the physical occupancy and the trends there you had been trending lower in the first three quarters of the year year over year in the fourth quarter on the same store basis you did that back up so can you talk a little bit about kind of what your expectations are for physical occupancy as you move into next year the 2 to 4 revenue guidance does that assume some increase in occupancy and rate and can you kind of talk about where that occupancy increase would come from fred boehler chief executive officer yeah i think the number we reported this quarter was the economic occupancy remember we continue to shift our business and you saw the progress in the fixed commitment economic occupancy yes we continue to expect it to pick up we like where it settled into the fourth quarter as you ll recall we don t really want it to get that much higher because then you start to drive inefficiency within the operations which actually results in less cash flow so we re trying to drive four wall cash flow as our primary focus and you can see that we re doing that regardless of what the physical occupancy might be and that s just a function of how we commercialize our business so rate throughput fixed commitment so yes we expect that it will continue to make progress as we do our portfolio management and onboard new customers and then of course open up new capacity to our development opportunities dave rodgers baird analyst i guess just looking to that answer fred with 2 to 4 revenue guidance on the same store do you expect most of that then to come through rate if you re happy with where occupancy is today fred boehler chief executive officer yeah again i think there s lots of occupancy opportunities because of the seasonality of our business right so we re always trying to find ways to find off cycle type of business that we can put into facilities that maybe have a lower physical occupancy during the summer for example so we believe that there s still whitespace to fill most of our occupancy is driven by key markets during the fourth quarter so actually if you look at core markets where our major distribution points are getting product to the consumer during the most critical time of the year those markets are and during the fourth quarter as we ve talked about those are pushing 90 92 right so the number we re quoting is across our entire enterprise so we do have sites that have lower physical occupancy during the fourth quarter than the 85 yes marc smernoff executive vice president and chief financial officer and dave just to reiterate as you ve heard us say before we re working on maximizing the mix as fred said that drives the most four wall cash flow there so if there s one metric more than anything other not rate then occupancy is how do we drive actual four wall cash flow dave rodgers baird analyst great and then maybe just a follow up on that is there a mechanism where you would take out patria has there been a predetermined price for that and the second is can you just comment on the income tax expense and deferred benefit in the 2020 guidance versus what you did in 2019 and the reason for the change there fred boehler chief executive officer yeah so just on the first part in terms of the takeout of patria yes as we said we have the exclusive option to buy out the other 85 of the business because we ve bought in at 15 come 2023 marc smernoff executive vice president and chief financial officer and then as it relates to the taxes so the taxes reflect growth in the overall business as well as our recent acquisition into canada which obviously we will be paying corporate level tax for our operations in canada at that level consistent with what we pay in australia so the combination of tax reflects growth of our core businesses abroad where we do pay cash taxes dave rodgers baird analyst thank you operator our next questions come from the line of ki bin kim of suntrust robinson humphrey please proceed with your question ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst going back to the australia development for 600 million i was wondering if you can just provide a little more detail behind it because it was a big deal it was an important catalyst for your company and your stock so i m just curious how much is the scope change did you lose any of that business for the three buildings to competing developers or other owners was it a point of pricing or just something very different than that fred boehler chief executive officer it s a combination of things quite frankly they do own their own wide network they brought up a fully automated facility that they were tied up with they ve had some other things going on their business changes that i can t really comment on but you can read the press on them they ve made a lot of divestitures and some other adjustments to their business and then just during this time horizon no 1 i just want to remind everybody it was a letter of intent it wasn t a binding contract it is an intent to work with each other so we did not lose the business to anybody else that wasn t what was at play but over the course of the two years automation costs certainly increased steel prices went up so construction costs in australia land costs in australia all of that kind of factored into if you will the dances we are going through detailed design and negotiation so no we haven t lost the business we have all the business and proceed continuing to as i mentioned we ll continue to work with them and again that strong pipeline that we have i m confident that we ll have additional ways to put capital to work ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst so you re saying the three buildings that were originally contemplated there isn t another party doing part of that business is that a fair fred boehler chief executive officer there are not three automated buildings going up for this customer ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok and is that micro fulfillment center part of the reason at all just going a different route instead of like a centralized warehouse maybe doing that or was that part of the equation at all fred boehler chief executive officer no that s i mean kind of a separate process i know they are experimenting with micro fulfillment but remember that micro fulfillment s done in the back end of the store and doesn t really supply it doesn t really change the supply chain in terms of the physical distribution centers so i can t comment further on what they may be doing and that s probably something for you to look at ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok and it sounds like in the comments though you left yourself a little bit of an opening that you might do further development business with them could you just expand upon that fred boehler chief executive officer yeah i mean again i would say that we have a pipeline of 1 2 billion they are a part of that we just announced the 42 million that s that we re going to put to work in auckland which is on their behalf so we currently house them in several facilities across new zealand often being the largest one we re expanding that site to support their growth and we ve entered into a definitive agreement not an roi a definitive contract for 15 years for them to be the anchor on that expansion so i think that just shows the continuing working relationship that we have with them and our partnership with them as we continue to move forward ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst i see but it s not like there s a chance for the development to happen again in australia that s not what you meant right fred boehler chief executive officer there s always a chance we continue the the conversations have not been called out i guess is the way that i would describe it so there isn t an end we just don t see it happening right now so we re just kind of taking that off and hopefully it develops into something into the future but we can t control that 100 we re kind of at their timing and at their mercy when it comes to that ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok thank you guys operator our next questions come from the line of michael mueller of jp morgan please proceed with your question michael mueller j p morgan analyst yeah hi if we start off with your affo guidance and the capex and then back out the non real estate depreciation and the tax benefit we get about 1 21 to 1 32 is that your core ffo guidance for the year marc smernoff executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah what we did is we provided the core reconciling items and that s not inconsistent with our thought i think mike the key thing we really do want to emphasize about our business since we believe affo is the best metric is to understand our overall business just because there s a significant operational component as well as true cash capex in the business that we want to make sure is being captured which isn t necessarily captured in either the navy definition of ffo or even our adjusted definition of core so we view as the most relevant metric for our business that best approximates the cash flow we generate to be our adjusted funds from operation michael mueller j p morgan analyst got it yes it s just the ffo numbers get reported a lot and obviously come up in discussions quite a bit so fred boehler chief executive officer yes michael mueller j p morgan analyst ok and the second question was for brazil what s the magic about 2023 what happens then where you can buy it out fred boehler chief executive officer marc marc smernoff executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah yeah it s we re investing with a private equity investor that has a finite life of their funds and so we re working with them and we have a plan with them to grow the business through that period and that was an ideal day for us to make a decision and as fred mentioned earlier we have an exclusive call right if we want to purchase in the rest of the business michael mueller j p morgan analyst got it ok thank you operator our next questions comes from the line of bill crow of raymond james please proceed with your question bill crow raymond james analyst good evening guys i apologize for asking one more on australia as you underwrite the health of the tenant has anything changed with them is the scope changing because their outlook has changed fred boehler chief executive officer no absolutely not they re the premier grocer in that marketplace their business continues to be strong so no no underwriting concerns there whatsoever bill crow raymond james analyst that s fine i think seasonality came up earlier and i m just wondering if you could help us think about the seasonalities evolves into 2020 should we consider that kind of the same contribution per quarter that we saw in 2019 would play out again in 2020 or has that changed because of your acquisitions fred boehler chief executive officer no it s pretty much the same pattern i mean there s some commodities that have different types of patterns but like ice cream or like some of the harvest if you will the vast bulk of our product follows the same cyclicality every single year fourth quarter kind of the end of third quarter fourth quarter is the busy time of the year for us that s when all the volume is getting pushed out to support thanksgiving and christmas and i think you saw that in our fourth quarter results and if you go back a year ago you see the same thing bill crow raymond james analyst all right and then two quick financial questions for you g a continues to ramp up and given the j curves we re dealing with and postponed developments and different things i m just i m trying to get my arms around the pace at which it s ramping up vis a vis that what it s delivering to the bottom line and at the top end of your guidance i think it d be about 8 5 increase in 2020 so at what point do you get to the size of the headquarters that you need so we don t see g a continued ramp up at this rate that s four or five times cpi marc smernoff executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah no absolutely and i think there s two things around that just to understand so we maintain a lot of our own in house development resources so the engineering teams our project management offices that are working on our development project we have a tremendous as we just announced we have effectively four completed projects where we don t even have the benefit of the stabilized earnings yet in our stream so those will be ramping up throughout this year and really beginning to stabilize in 2021 and beyond and then we have other development projects under way so i think what you see and this is typical of development you see those costs come on in advance and then you get the benefit as those projects ramp and reach stabilization which you ll then start to see the g a leverage especially as you re looking at as a percentage of revenue bill crow raymond james analyst all right and then finally for me since we spent an hour last quarter talking about a 3 million healthcare cost the 10 million acquisition litigation and other charge if you could give us some details on that and i think it s 40 million bucks for the year so how do we think about what was in there for the fourth quarter and what happens going forward marc smernoff executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah if you turn if you look at page 22 of our supplement it s broken out the vast majority of that 40 million bucks for the year is m a related costs specifically for professional fees success fees to bankers synergies related to rationalizing the headcount from the cloverleaf facility so we have a lot of severance costs which we see down in the line below and then litigation which is disclosed in our 10 k but we did settle one outstanding litigation case that we had in the quarter which was roughly the 3 million charge you see in q4 bill crow raymond james analyst ok thanks marc operator our next questions come from the line of emmanuel korchman of citi emmanuel korchman citi analyst marc just a couple of guidance follow ups you spoke about the forward drawdowns that you ve taken so far how do we think about the rest of the timing of the forward drawdowns marc smernoff executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so our capital plan does not have a drawdown the forward to meet the guidance now as fred mentioned we have a significant amount of both development and m a opportunities we are looking at so we may draw that down to support those growth opportunities as we move forward emmanuel korchman citi analyst so in the past i think you ve given us the share assumption in your guidance number what is that share assumption for the year and now for 2020 marc smernoff executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah roughly as i mentioned pro forma for having completed the acquisitions we completed this january we mentioned that we had roughly 205 million shares outstanding emmanuel korchman citi analyst and there s nothing beyond that assuming the guidance number marc smernoff executive vice president and chief financial officer there s regular dilutive impact of your annual equity grants with these emmanuel korchman citi analyst ok and then a follow up on bill s question or joke the should we think about any other sort of outside costs on healthcare or other that would be we d be tapping just thinking this year s and replicating for next year marc smernoff executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah no look as i said one of the things and i think we mentioned this on q3 and it gave us guidance or comfort we re really proud like we delivered 3 5 same store revenue growth on a constant currency basis net 5 1 and those overcame as we said we would the headwind we saw in healthcare throughout the year as well as the unfavorable comp we had in the first quarter as it relates to workers comp and so those actual those results i gave you are the actual results they re not pro forma for those items so as we mentioned one of the reasons you hear us say over and over and over again please look at our business on a full year basis it does reflect out the seasonality and usually those types of expansion when you look on a full year basis will be normalized through the overall business operator our next question comes from the line of ki bin kim of suntrust robinson humphrey please proceed with your question ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks i promise it s not a question about australia so can you just talk about the business trends that you re seeing just if you can expand on those and it was interesting to see your economic obviously pick up a little bit for the first time in a while what kind of drove that do you think that s sustainable into 2020 and conversely your same store revenue growth for your rent revenue growth decelerated a little bit i don t want to split hairs here but if you can talk about what drove that marc smernoff executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah you usually don t see that expand too much in the fourth quarter because you re already we re already established if you will so yes and speaking specifically this is some of what the impact of mix will be within our business so you can see we ll have different mix and as we said we focus on mix and profiles that maximize cash flow so sometimes you ll that will manifest our occupancy sometimes it will manifest through the throughput of the business that we re doing and i think if you look the real headwind on the rate on occupancy in the fourth quarter was actually fx so if you look on a constant currency basis the rate continued to grow so we had some headwind from the strength of the u s dollar fred boehler chief executive officer but the business as a whole continues to be strong so the same fundamentals that we ve talked about over the last two years remain there our churn rate is extremely low so we re providing outstanding customer service customer satisfaction we continue to expand our penetration with customers through these acquisitions and commercialize them onto our americold standards as well as continuing to roll out the americold operating system so business fundamentals are continue to be strong consumption population growth continues to remain steady and we continue to feed off of the trends that you see in the industry toward fresh and healthy products so yes the pipeline hasn t flinched we continue to have over 1 2 billion worth of development opportunities so yes i d say that the business and the industry as a whole is strong ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst and on g a guidance for 2020 how much of that is real cash dollars increasing versus capitalization of g a rolling off marc smernoff executive vice president and chief financial officer there s very limited g a that we capitalized in the year it s probably less than 2 million or so a year that is capitalized into our development projects so it s not a lot of g a rolling from what was been capitalized or not remember we ve completed as fred mentioned a significant number of acquisitions since the beginning of 2019 that reflects the impact of those businesses onboarding because some of those acquisitions two were platform acquisitions in new markets where we didn t operate so obviously part of what we re investing in is those strong teams in those markets where we hope to partner with them and grow those businesses operator we have reached the end of the question and answer session i will now turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks fred boehler chief executive officer great thank you and thanks everyone for joining us we are very excited about what we were able to accomplish in 2019 and just to reiterate some of those things the strong same store sales results of three and a half and 5 1 showed that we continue to show great leverage in our business and we re excited about being able to continue that as we head into 2020 the six acquisitions seven development projects the new jv that we just entered into and a strong development pipeline just really sets us up well for 2020 so very excited heading into 2020 and just to like to thank all of you for your continued support operator duration 67 minutes call participants scott henderson investor relations fred boehler chief

last september 6 million people joined youth led climate protests all around the world from new zealand to indonesia from brazil to the united states fed up with years of international inaction on the greatest threat to our civilization young people and their allies are again planning to rally in massive numbers this coming april on the 50th anniversary of earth day unwilling to accept anything but unprecedented massive action on a planetary scale many of these activists are calling for a green new deal to save our planet and our future a systemic overhaul of the global economy so that it works for all not just the wealthy few what is needed is a global green new deal based on genuine international solidarity and climate reparations this sort of international solidarity action hearkens back to the anti globalization movement of 20 years ago when unions environmentalists and social movements came together to call attention to the devastating effects of globalization and free trade imposed by multilateral institutions like world trade organization wto the international monetary fund imf and the world bank the turn of the century protests in seattle and elsewhere put a spotlight on what is now often referred to as the washington consensus a decades long coordinated drive to impose market centered economic and political strategies upon countries everywhere the transformative power of the anti globalization movement lay in its demonstration of the interconnections of social labor and environmental struggles across borders and ability to unite people in high income countries and low and middle income countries against a common enemy however much of this energy was subsequently diverted to opposing the wars in iraq and afghanistan surviving the 2008 financial crisis and confronting white supremacy and fascism in the age of donald trump activist scrutiny of the multinational institutions that govern the global economy has waned but now as the global climate crisis escalates and calls for a green new deal grow stronger there is an opportunity to revitalize this spirit of international solidarity to develop a new international economic consensus and new multilateral institutions based on ecological sustainability reparative justice and the common good investing in disaster in 1944 during the penultimate year of world war ii representatives from 44 countries met at bretton woods new hampshire to discuss how to establish global peace and security through international economic cooperation out of this meeting the imf and world bank were created and the seeds of what was to become the wto system sown but with leadership and control in the hands of the united states and its close allies these institutions soon became tools in the larger geopolitical struggles of the cold war moreover with the emergence of the washington consensus in the 1980s they became weapons in an ideologically driven effort to install free market economic policies around the world spreading economic liberalization opening massive new markets for western goods shifting public assets and services into private hands and delivering previously unattainable natural resources into the hands of large multinational corporations as nobel prize winning economist and former chief economist of the world bank joseph stiglitz said in 2002 institutions like the imf had been thoroughly overrun by market fundamentalism one of the key methods deployed by the world bank and imf in particular were the infamous structural adjustment programs saps these programs conditioned international economic assistance on deep structural changes to a client country s political and economic system specifically deregulation privatization and cuts in public spending all too often the economic development and growth promised by the institutions failed to materialize leaving many countries impoverished embittered and indebted to western interests a centerpiece of these structural adjustment programs was the privatization of publicly owned assets and infrastructure according to author sharon beder loans conditioned on privatization jumped from 13 in the 1980s to 70 in 2000 this was especially true in the energy and utility sectors which constitute core public goods and integral points of intervention to tackle the climate crisis for instance during the 1990s both the world bank and the asian development bank a regional multilateral development bank promoted energy sector privatization between 1998 and 2005 over half of the 115 so called developing countries had either privatized or corporatized their state owned utility and more than a third had opened up markets to independent power producers the implications for the environment and the climate have been profound bolivia is a cautionary example during the 1980s and 1990s the world bank imf and inter american development bank played a prominent role in sponsoring economic restructuring and liberalization of the country s energy sector this included partial privatization of the bolivian state owned oil company shares of which were bought by international energy corporations including shell and enron as well as legal regulatory and administrative shifts that enabled massive foreign direct investment into the country s energy and utility sector this resulted in the significant growth of oil and gas exploration and extraction operations and the construction and renovation of numerous hydrocarbon export pipelines all of which devastated local communities and regional environments like the chiquitano forest as researcher derrick hindery wrote in 2004 contrary to neoliberal rhetoric that these would boost the economy and deepen democracy economic and political restructuring led to a reduction in state revenues massive social unrest and eased access to natural resources resistance to structural adjustment including mass protests against the world bank directed attempt to privatize the city of cochabamba s water utility was one of the causes of evo morales landslide presidential election victory in 2005 morales decisively broke with the imf and the world bank reasserted public control over key economic sectors and decisions including its energy utilities and presided over an unprecedented period of economic growth inequality reduction and improved living standards however the bolivian economy largely remained reliant on the extraction and exploitation of oil gas and minerals last year morales was overthrown by a right wing coup raising the prospect of a return to market fundamentalism and corporate control over strategic resources that could catalyze further environmental destruction this is especially concerning given that bolivia holds some of the world s largest reserves of lithium instrumental to building the batteries needed for electric cars and electricity storage an industry morales had plans to develop for the benefit of bolivians as opposed to western corporations the world bank and imf s actions have led to significant social unrest in many other countries in 2000 the government of ecuador agreed to privatize 18 distribution utilities in exchange for imf funding but public outcry successfully stopped the privatizations similarly in guatemala the privatization of electric utilities in the 1990s has led to poor service high prices and repeated bouts of protests in india and indonesia corruption in new private power markets formed in the 1990s has also sparked widespread unrest and in costa rica an imf supported attempt to privatize the country s popular electric and telecoms utility was defeated in 2000 due to major protests and upheaval today costa rica s publicly owned electric system a network that includes a national public utility working in coordination with local cooperative and municipal utilities is the only one in the world to run an entire country on virtually 100 percent renewable energy what s more any revenue from costa rica s national utility is used to support other social services in recent years the world bank imf and wto have ostensibly begun to change their tune they are increasingly professing concern about climate change as well as economic and social inequality for instance the world bank claims to have implemented an institution wide effort to mainstream climate considerations into all development projects sensing the changing political and economic winds post financial crisis and stung by criticisms from the anti globalization movement and their own manifest failures these organizations are eager to claim that the washington consensus era is firmly in the past however as many observers have noted the actions of these institutions fall far short of their rhetoric despite expressing concern over climate change the wto has done almost nothing to challenge fossil fuel subsidies on unfair trade grounds despite being asked to do so by twelve member nations in 2017 in fact recent research has found that while several cases of subsidies for renewable energy development had been challenged at the wto level in the past decade no fossil fuel subsidies have the world bank s fossil fuel exclusion policy has already fallen far behind those of its peers such as the european investment bank which has excluded nearly all fossil fuel finance more generally the climate crisis is inseparable from the free market economic policies and history of imperialism that continue to underpin the world bank and imf s outlook on international development president barack obama s power africa program which the world bank helped fund is an instructive example nominally intended to expand energy access in sub saharan africa it ultimately operated as a way for u s companies like general electric to capture the african energy market by selling gas turbines and grid infrastructure these companies heavily lobbied the u s government and multilateral development banks to shy away from renewable technologies and direct close to 7 billion of financing to american corporations not only does such behavior greatly expand stranded fossil fuel assets in the global south which must be retired before the end of their intended lives but the revenues from the billions invested are largely retained by multinational corporations not the countries the program was supposed to benefit furthermore a recent survey of loans made to 26 countries in 2016 2017 found that the imf continues to condition borrowing on fiscal consolidation cutting spending and or raising taxes and the privatization of public goods or services in 2018 the un s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights philip alston blasted both the imf and world bank for continuing to aggressively promote privatization despite ample evidence that it involves the systematic elimination of human rights protections and further marginalization of the interests of low income earners and those living in poverty a new bretton woods just as with world war ii today we face a global crisis the moral equivalent of war without rapid and transformative changes to our energy transportation and agricultural systems among others the world is on track to eclipse warming of 1 5 degrees celsius 2 7 degrees fahrenheit within the decade blowing past collectively agreed climate targets at the current pace estimates suggest as much as 6 degrees fahrenheit of warming by 2100 simply put this level of warming would be catastrophic for human civilization and the planet in the united states and europe plans for a green new deal are the subject of increasing political discussion while national and regional action is extremely important climate change is a global threat and what is ultimately needed is an effective global response one that existing international institutions agreements and approaches have demonstrated themselves woefully incapable of delivering what is needed is a global green new deal based on genuine international solidarity and climate reparations western imposed free market solutions must be replaced with respect for local and indigenous strategies wholesale privatization ditched in favor of democratic forms of public and community ownership western led extraction exchanged for reparative payback for damages to the global south and open access to technologies and leadership by those responsible for the crisis supplanted with control and power exercised by those most affected by it to address rising inequality and begin to rectify decades of destructive neoliberalism the global green new deal must be not only effective but also equitable it must recognize the outsized role global north countries played in causing the climate crisis both in their own actions and in imposing socially and ecologically destructive market fundamentalism around the world a major tenet of this global green new deal needs to be the creation of a new international economic paradigm underpinned by a new or substantially transformed multilateral architecture with the capacity and will to truly deliver this means either dramatically overhauling institutions like the imf world bank and wto or designing new institutions to take their place as richard kozul wright and kevin gallagher have recently stated to make a global green new deal work many of the multilateral programs that have accumulated over decades will have to be culled and a new generation of smarter institutions will have to be established in other words the global green new deal can be our generation s bretton woods it is a moment with tremendous potential to construct new or radically reformed international institutions that provide support aid and investment on the basis of fundamentally different values and conditions than before as calls for such a new bretton woods get louder including most recently from former un official rachel kyte it is imperative the movement for a green new deal does not simply seek to tinker at the edges of a fundamentally broken economic and imperialist model it is a chance to create real international economic and environmental cooperation rooted in local experience culture ownership and control the washington consensus is dead and should now be buried once and for all in its place a new form of global solidarity and new multilateral institutions must rise to confront the intersecting crises we now face and to build a lasting internationalism and an economics focused on nurturing people and planet not on extractive exploitation by the global elite there is a world to win or to lose the stakes could hardly be higher

if the unprecedented political and economic crisis continues for another six months policymakers in lebanon would have to ask the international monetary fund for a bailout package having a stamp of approval from the imf and its accompanying conditions and timetables to achieve reforms and economic targets would also send a positive signal to the international community and the financial markets garbis iradian chief middle east and north africa economist at the institute of international finance iif told media on friday in riyadh if in the next six months the situation does not improve they will most likely have to ask for an imf bailout mr iradian said there should be a political consensus for that though he said adding political factions for their own reasons have so far opposed an imf bailout a shortage of foreign currency reserves he said is one of the main factors driving the need for an imf supervised programme the foreign reserves at the central bank are limited so it all about availability of foreign exchange last month the iif estimated lebanon will require a 8 5bn bailout package from the imf to break its economic impasse and help it meet its financing needs and restore growth the country s long time parliamentary speaker nabih berri however has claimed that citizens who have been protesting since october would reject an imf bailout programme that would most likely require the country to float its currency forcing a major devaluation it would also mean higher taxes and austerity measures he said an imf team is already in lebanon until february 23 for consultations with officials how the lebanese policymakers plan to tackle the ongoing political and economic turmoil is on top of the washington based lender s agenda the imf said in a statement on tuesday the imf will take stock of recent macroeconomic developments and provide broad technical advice on policies to deal with the macroeconomic challenges facing the economy gerry rice the imf s director of communications and spokesman said in the statement despite its economic woes worsening lebanon has not yet requested financial assistance from the imf the country reached out to the fund earlier this month seeking technical advice as it faces a looming deadline to repay 1 2 billion dh4 4bn in eurobonds that hit maturity on march 9 another 700 million is due in april and 600m in june on tuesday fitch ratings said lebanon s financial position points to a likely restructuring of its debt and financial sector the economic turmoil faced by lebanon is a result of a long history of failed attempts to develop a sustainable economic policy and if lebanon is to take first steps to recovery it needs a viable economic programme which could get the international monetary fund imf backing these failures reflected fundamental political economy factors and institutional weaknesses mr iradian said in a report released earlier on friday such domestic factors exacerbated by a challenging external environment led to a steady erosion of confidence in lebanon and ultimately to the current crisis the lebanese economy has entered its third consecutive year of negative growth and its public debt has risen to unsustainable levels in the period from 2011 19 real gdp growth averaged only 0 5 per cent the current account deficit exceeded 21 per cent of gdp and the fiscal deficit reached 9 per cent of its gross domestic product public debt increased to unsustainable levels rising from 131 per cent of gdp in 2012 to 164 per cent of gdp at end 2019 according to the latest iif report with interest payments alone accounting for 53 per cent of government revenues in 2019 the fiscal accounts are stretched too thin to pursue productivity enhancing social and infrastructure investment the iif s mr iradian said the lebanese pound has already lost more than a third of its value against the us dollar in the black market the unemployment rate may have risen to over 20 per cent and the poverty rate to around 40 per cent the average inflation is expected to increase to about 20 per cent in 2020 due to the pass through effects of the massive black market exchange rate depreciation of the lebanese currency the imposition of temporary capital controls by banks in november 2019 was vital to avert a meltdown of the financial sector but lasting capital controls can create additional headwinds to a recovery of economic activity he added
cautious optimism over afcfta trading under the african continental free trade agreement afcfta begins on july 1 the trade deal is expected to open the wider african market for local manufacturers creating a market of 1 2 billion people with a combined gdp of about 2 5 trillion however five months to its implementation manufacturers are cautiously optimistic they fear without addressing the dearth of infrastructure and market information asymmetry they may not be competitive under the deal assistant editor chikodi okereocha reports the momentum is building up across the 55 african countries manufacturers anticipation of the phenomenal opportunity for increased global competitiveness promised by the african continental free trade agreement afcfta is palpable as trading under the historic agreement takes off in about five months precisely july 1 but while manufacturers in other african countries are hopeful and gearing up to compete under a liberalised african market nigerian manufacturers appear less excited by the prospects of leveraging the trade deal to become globally competitive the nation learnt that manufacturers optimism over the soon to be implemented afcfta may have indeed been measured largely due to fears that the country s decrepit infrastructure and market information asymmetry may hurt their chances of benefiting optimally from the agreement the manufacturers association of nigeria man president mansur ahmed confirmed this fear when he said as the continent awaits the take off of afcfta in july the federal government must address the supply side constraints of lack of infrastructure if the gains of the afcfta must be realised ahmed who spoke at the 2020 man annual media luncheon in lagos also said policies and regulations must be business friendly in order to assist businesses to grow and ultimately enhance competitiveness and boost the economies of nigeria and other partnering african countries afcfta seeks to create a continental trade bloc of 1 2 billion people with a combined gross domestic product gdp of about 2 5 trillion the deal seen as an important milestone in promoting africa s regional integration and helping to increase intra african trade commits countries to removing tariffs on 90 per cent of goods and to liberalise services its main objective was to create a single continental market for goods and services with free movement of business persons and investments president muhammadu buhari signed the agreement on july 7 last year in niamey niger republic at the 12th extraordinary session of the assembly of the african union au on afcfta it was signed after 16 months of foot dragging during which the government said it needed to thoroughly consider the deal and country wide sensitisation and consultation of stakeholders the delay in signing the deal came after members of the organised private sector ops particularly manufacturers opposed the move they had warned the federal government not to sign the policy document as doing so will cripple the economy and leave more nigerians unemployed many of them expressed fears that the deal will be injurious to the nation s industrial sector and the economy generally they argued for instance that the agreement will turn nigeria into a dumping ground for imported foreign goods they insisted that the likely negative impacts of the agreement on private businesses and the economy far outweigh its supposed benefits however proponents of the free trade deal kicked their heels in insisting that afcfta the world s largest free trade area since the creation of the world trade organisation wto in 1994 will for instance boost intra african trade by about 60 per cent by 2022 currently intra african trade is put at just 16 per cent of its total trade compared with 19 per cent in latin america 51 per cent in asia 54 per cent in north america and 70 per cent in europe african countries according to experts are not trading among themselves their fundamental role in global trade has been to provide raw commodities in exchange for manufactured goods for instance the president of african export import bank afreximbank prof benedict oramah said africa is the continent that trades the least with itself despite the strong relationship between intra regional trade and industrial development and economic progress oramah who spoke at a meeting of man in lagos said afcfta is expected to bring the share of intra african trade to 22 per cent by 2022 up from about 16 per cent it will also bring total intra african trade to about 250 billion from about 160 billion speaking on from commodities to a global manufacturing hub the road ahead for nigeria the afreximbank boss added that since manufactures account for about 60 per cent of total intra african trade intra regional trade in manufactures can rise to more than 150 billion by 2022 while noting that the opportunity for african manufacturers is therefore phenomenal oramah specifically said that the preferences that afcfta offers can make nigerian manufactured goods more competitive in many african markets and can also make it possible for integration into regional and global supply chains he said a cotton yarn producer in nigeria can for example become a supplier to a fabric manufacturer in senegal replacing yarn imports from asia and as capacity is gained in the context of intra regional trade manufacturers can expect to gradually become competitive globally that is not all the president of the premier institution driving african integration and trade also said the rising middle class in the country and africa as well as the rapid urbanisation will expand demand for manufactured goods according to him it is projected that nigeria s urban population will reach 264 million by 2030 which is equal to 15 per cent of the projected population in that year these will spur demand for critical infrastructure housing processed food fast moving consumer goods fmcgs and a host of other light manufactures it is the manufacturing industry that will supply these items related to the foregoing is the gradual exit of china from labour intensive light manufacturing today nigeria and africa import 1 billion and 43 billion of light manufactures from china as china shifts to more capital intensive manufacturing due to rising labour costs those goods have to be supplied by somebody nigeria and indeed the entire african continent will have themselves to blame if this projected supply gap is filled from outside the continent oramah said dearth of infrastructure others given the fragile nature of nigeria s economy it is doubtful if the manufacturing sector is in any position to fill the projected supply gap with the economy lacking in key infrastructure the sector is too fragile to become competitive under the afcfta or even withstand competition from other countries ahmed perhaps put the situation in perspective when he said we cannot achieve competitiveness without the provision of infrastructure such as good road networks and electricity not only within african countries but also across the borders there is also the aspect of provision of soft infrastructure like visa tariffs and foreign exchange that will help ease the process of carrying out business transactions between countries we must address all these issues since the afcfta is not just about trade in goods but also trade in services according to him modern industry competitiveness depends to a great extent on provision of adequate and efficient infrastructure from the availability of power and energy to transport and logistics the role of infrastructure cannot be overemphasised in trade and economic development on the continent he said for instance while pointing out that transportation is vital to enhancing competitiveness in trade the man chief said due to poor infrastructure it will cost a business owner in nigeria more to transport goods from lagos to kano than it will cost a chinese business owner to transport the same goods from china to lagos the man boss also said electricity is a vital input for manufacturing process to the extent that it constitutes up to 40 per cent of production cost he therefore said increasing the tariff of this core input will have drastic negative effect on the gross national product gnp gdp disposable income consumption consumer price index employment and government revenue from corporate taxation and others there is also the aspect of provision of soft infrastructure like visa tariffs and foreign exchange that will help ease the process of carrying out business transactions between countries we must address all these issues since the afcfta is not just about trade in goods but also trade in services however the lack of infrastructure is not peculiar to nigeria the problem cuts across most if not all the 55 african countries the continent s infrastructure needs according to afreximbank is between 130 and 170 billion yearly with a financing gap in the range of between 70billion and 110 billion yet nigeria s share of the continent s huge infrastructure gap is mind boggling for instance the financial derivatives company fdc said the country requires 15 billion about n4 59 trillion worth of investments yearly for 15 years to adequately develop her infrastructure nationwide the research firm in its bi monthly economic and business report for february 2018 said nigeria s under investment in infrastructure has left it with a core stock of infrastructure of just 20 per cent to 25 per cent of gdp compared to an average of 70 per cent of the gdp for more advanced middle income countries of similar size the fdc said bridging this gap will require investing about 15 billion yearly for the next 15 years asking given the government s limited access to international debt revenue constraints and competing priorities the major question is where will funding be sourced the firm said one of the biggest constraints to nigeria s competitiveness economic growth and diversification is the crippling infrastructure deficit estimated at 300 billion about n30 trillion by the african development bank afdb when considered that nigeria according to the vice president prof yemi osinbajo spent n2 7 trillion on infrastructure in 2016 and 2017 fiscal years for instance the challenge infrastructure gap poses to nigeria s competitiveness in global trade comes into bold relief the senior manager intra african trade initiative afreximbank gainmore zanamwe said because of the poor state of trade related infrastructure and weak transit and logistics infrastructure transport costs are 63 per cent higher in africa compared to the average in developed economies zanamwe also said poor trade facilitation was responsible for the low intra african trade according to him it takes up to 12 days to clear goods in some african borders as compared to an average of two days in developed countries and costs around 450 per day he added that because of supply side constraints the continent s level of industrialisation remained low and as a result the range of goods available for trade is limited and this gap is then filled by other countries outside the continent zanamwe listed other constraints to include lack of internationally accredited quality infrastructure and harmonised trade standards low implementation of regional trade commitments and limited access to trade finance among others

keynote speech by philip r lane member of the executive board of the ecb at the 2020 us monetary policy forum introduction i would like to thank chicago booth for inviting me to speak at the 2020 u s monetary policy forum sponsored by the initiative on global markets at the university of chicago booth school of business new york new york the focus of this year s us monetary policy forum the analysis of unconventional monetary policies is relevant for many economies including the euro area that said while central banks face many common challenges the evolution of economic financial and monetary conditions in the euro area was also specifically influenced by both the euro area sovereign debt crisis that followed the global financial crisis and the european policy responses to these crises as a result the euro area is at a different point in the monetary policy cycle than other jurisdictions the post crisis monetary policy of the ecb shares many similarities with that of the federal reserve having largely exhausted the conventional space for moving its policy instrument the short term policy rate the ecb turned to a broad set of unconventional measures in pursuit of its statutory objective however there are important differences between the unconventional measures taken by the federal reserve and the ecb in particular the ecb moved into negative territory with its policy rate employed targeted refinancing operations to promote credit growth and customised its asset purchase programme app to the specific context of the euro area our understanding of the propagation mechanisms of these measures and their efficacy in supporting the economy and the inflation process is steadily deepening in my remarks today i will discuss our experience with the non standard measures in our monetary toolbox and explain our monetary policy reaction function in the current below target inflation environment the nature of our reaction function is spelled out in our forward guidance which provides a unified framework across our different policy instruments with the guidance on the rate path at its centre and facilitates automatic adjustment in market conditions in response to shocks that are assessed as influencing the future path of interest rates the case for unconventional measures in a low interest rate environment interest rates in advanced economies have been on a broad downward path for more than three decades and remain close to historical lows as has been highlighted in many studies the drivers of this long term pattern largely boil down to demographics productivity and the elevated net demand for safe assets as a result the real neutral interest rate r has declined across advanced economies for the euro area recent eurosystem estimates point to r at zero or even below zero which is a marked decline since the early 2000s see chart 1 estimates of r for the united states show a similar trend but remain at a higher level than in the euro area while the factors that have reduced r are beyond the control of the central bank the fact that the level of r is lower has significant implications for monetary policy the short term policy interest rate hits the zero bound more often and when it does so remains at the lower bound for a longer time a recent ecb staff paper shows that in a scenario where r falls from 2 percent to zero the incidence of hitting the zero bound almost doubles lower real rates reduce the available policy space to counter low inflation this may increase the time it takes for inflation to return to target and this delay may be compounded if a prolonged period of low inflation also erodes inflation expectations chart 1 econometric estimates of euro area real neutral interest rate percentages per annum sources brand c bielecki m and penalver a eds 2019 the natural rate of interest estimates drivers and challenges to monetary policy occasional paper series no 217 ecb and all works cited in footnote 7 notes ranges span point estimates across models to reflect model uncertainty and no other source of r uncertainty the dark shaded area highlights smoother r estimates that are statistically less affected by cyclical movements in the real rate of interest than the other estimates depicted here the ecb s monetary policy toolbox the governing council s monetary policy reaction function is laid out in our forward guidance on the path of our policy instruments together with the forward guidance on the rate path at the centre this provides a coherent framework for the various non standard measures which the ecb has deployed negative interest rates asset purchases and targeted long term refinancing operations tltros forward guidance initially expressed in qualitative terms the ecb s rate guidance has evolved over time with the current formulation made explicitly conditional on a set of criteria regarding the inflation outlook the cross country experience with forward guidance indicates that its effectiveness can differ considerably depending on the type of conditionality attached to the policy rate path in particular time based guidance provided over relatively short horizons appears to be rather ineffective in reducing market uncertainty conversely the evidence indicates that rate forward guidance over long horizons or state based guidance is more effective in reducing the sensitivity of asset prices to macroeconomic news the state contingent formulation links the governing council s expected interest rate path to at least two conditions regarding the inflation outlook first inflation has to robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to but below 2 percent within our projection horizon second this convergence needs to be consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics the first condition is forward looking inflation has to be seen to be converging to a level sufficiently close to 2 percent well before the end point of the horizon this is the meaning of robust convergence the second condition is backward looking we have to see the robust convergence in future inflation confirmed and verified in actual measures of underlying inflation importantly the decision we took last september has established a unified framework for our forward guidance across policy instruments that links the horizon of both our net asset purchases and reinvestments to our forward guidance on the rate path net purchases are expected to continue until shortly before we start raising the key ecb rates and reinvestments are expected to run for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates whereas the forward guidance on the rate path acts on the expectations component of longer term rates the asset purchases especially affect term premia as i will discuss in more detail later on evidence suggests that the enhanced forward guidance we introduced last september is well understood by market participants the interest rate lift off dates in survey based measures largely coincide with the time at which inflation expectations two years ahead the horizon of the ecb eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections are around levels close to but below 2 percent this indicates that the link between our interest rate forward guidance and the inflation threshold is understood more than that thanks to its state contingent nature our rate guidance provides an automatic stabilisation mechanism that steers rate expectations and expectations about our asset purchases as a function of the evolving inflation outlook in practice we have seen this automatic stabilisation function of our forward guidance operate effectively with market expectations for a first increase of the policy rate accommodating short term volatility in the inflation outlook for example the january 2020 bloomberg survey pointed to a later lift off date of the second quarter of 2022 blue vertical line in chart 2 in comparison with the bloomberg survey of april 2019 yellow vertical line in chart 2 which coincided with the slight decline in consensus economics expectations for annual inflation in the euro area yellow and blue diamonds in chart 2 chart 2 inflation as projected by consensus economics and survey implied lift off date percentage changes sources consensus economics and bloomberg notes vertical lines denote expected lift off dates reported in the april and january bloomberg surveys diamonds denote expectations for average annual inflation rates in each year between 2019 and 2029 reported in the consensus economics surveys the latest observation is for january 2020 in addition to serving as an automatic stabiliser for policy rate expectations the interest rate forward guidance is also the anchor for expectations of the net asset purchase and reinvestment horizons as these measures are tightly linked to the interest rate lift off changes in the inflation outlook that trigger a reappraisal of the lift off date should therefore also affect the expected end date of net asset purchases and reinvestments thereby stabilising the long end of the yield curve in fact this tight link is reflected in the positive co movement between short and long term interest rates in response to news that affects the macroeconomic outlook chart 3 while the automatic stabilisation function embedded in the forward guidance accommodates any short term volatility in the outlook the governing council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner in line with its commitment to symmetry chart 3 scatterplot of the contribution of demand factor to short term rates x axis versus long term rates y axis percentage points source ecb calculations note the latest observation is for 14 february 2020 overall the available evidence suggests that the ecb s rate forward guidance has been and continues to be an effective monetary policy tool and that the transmission of forward guidance to financial conditions and the economy has remained stable over time in part this reflects the strong explicit conditionality embedded in the ecb s evolving rate forward guidance statement as well as the interaction with asset purchases and other instruments negative interest rates within our forward guidance framework the negative interest rate policy has played a key role in enhancing this automatic stabilisation by lowering the effective lower bound there was no playbook to guide the 2014 decision to push the deposit facility rate which the ecb pays on bank excess reserves into negative territory subsequent cuts including the latest in september 2019 have brought the deposit facility rate to 0 5 percent a corollary of relaxing the lower bound constraint has been that the propagation of negative interest rates through the term structure of interest rates is qualitatively different and more powerful than traditional interest rate cuts occurring in positive territory the difference comes from two effects the primary mechanism is the way in which expectations about the future path of monetary policy are reflected in market interest rates when the central bank reduces the overnight interest rate to very low levels if the central bank reduces its policy rate to zero and makes it clear that it will not lower its policy rate any further then this declared and self imposed non negativity restriction influences rate expectations among market participants looking to the future they will see rate increases as being more likely than rate decreases as a result the predictive density of the future rate path will tend to be skewed upward and interest rates at longer maturities will tend to decline by less than the reduction of the policy rate by contrast under a negative interest rate policy where future rate cuts are possible the distribution of rate expectations is more symmetric putting downward pressure on longer maturity interest rates rate expectations can even be skewed downwards if the negative rate policy is flanked by communication that the interest rate might be reduced further in this vein the ecb s forward guidance has reinforced the negative interest rate policy by stating that the governing council expects the ecb s key interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels for an extended period of time chart 4 eonia forward curve and its risk neutral density before the negative interest rate policy left side and after its introduction right side percentages per annum source rostagno et al op cit notes risk neutral densities as of 29 january 2013 left side and 5 september 2014 right side derived from options on euribor futures the mean and the percentiles are shifted to the eonia space by subtracting the euribor3m ois3m spot spread the forward curve distribution in january 2013 was rather steep and truncated in positive territory which reflected the view of market participants that rates could not fall below zero and only increase this mechanism is illustrated in chart 4 once the deposit facility rate was brought to a negative level in june 2014 and further reduced in september 2014 the forward curve became markedly flatter and the distribution of expectations more symmetric with a mild inversion over short to medium term maturities and no truncation in positive territory see chart 4 right side an additional mechanism through which negative rates affect lending conditions is by discouraging cash hoarding and providing an incentive to banks to rebalance towards an alternative use for their funds even as rate expectations are constant evidence shows that the improving financing conditions stemming from negative interest rates are feeding their way into the real economy through increased bank loans there is also evidence that negative rates have increased corporate investment firms with large holdings of liquid assets that are exposed to negative deposit rates have increased investment compared with firms with small holdings of liquid assets that are less affected by negative deposit rates see chart 5 this effect is economically significant and estimated to boost corporate investment by as much as 1 percentage point per annum chart 5 investment growth of firms exposed to negative deposit rates annual percentage changes source altavilla c et al op cit notes average investment for corporate clients of banks whose average non financial counterparty deposit rate has been negative

red line of the distribution investment orthogonal to firm fixed effects normalised to 1 in 2014 the latest observation is for 2018 that the effects of an interest rate cut are more powerful in negative territory can also be seen when considering the footprint on the term structure using high frequency financial market data tick data to identify monetary surprises ecb analysis shows that the transmission is more powerful than that of a standard interest rate cut in positive territory since its effect on the yield curve extends to longer maturities with a maximum effect around medium term maturities see chart 6 chart 6 estimated effect of policy rate surprises standard policy rate surprise left side and policy rate surprise in negative territory right side basis points source based on altavilla c brugnolini l gürkaynak r s motto r and ragusa r 2019 measuring euro area monetary policy journal of monetary economics vol 108 pp 162 179 note surprise impact normalised to 10 basis points for the six month maturity moreover as banks tend to consider risk free interest rates with short to medium term maturities as the reference rates for pricing loans to non financial corporations the pronounced effects of the negative interest rate policy also propagate through the bank lending channel our negative rate policy has contributed to a significant decline in lending rates to non financial corporations since 2014 which in turn has translated into higher loan volumes channelled to the real economy the bank based nature of the euro area economy lends itself to a swift transmission of interest rates to the economy at the same time there is a clear friction in the pass through of negative rates to depositors especially to retail customers see chart 7 taken in isolation this friction weighs on bank net interest income and profitability chart 7 share of deposits carrying a negative rate percentages sources ecb and ecb calculations notes deposit rates on outstanding amounts as reported by individual banks for each of the available product categories weighted by outstanding amounts household deposits also account for deposits held by non profit institutions serving households the latest observation is for december 2019 that said the overall impact of the negative interest rate policy extends beyond the mechanical effects on interest rate margins negative rates especially in combination with the other elements in our policy package support the overall level of economic activity this leads to higher lending volumes and lower impairment provisioning while interest rate cuts also generate capital gains on existing securities holdings and improve wholesale funding conditions for banks from 2014 to 2018 the aggregate impact of non standard measures was positive for the profitability of the banking system see chart 8 chart 8 bank return on assets since 2014 and impact of non standard measures in any event the very substantial differences in return on equity across different regions with broadly similar monetary conditions see chart 9 suggest that other factors such as market structure and efficiency are more important in determining the overall profitability of the banking system accordingly any comprehensive analysis of the determinants of the profitability of the euro area banking system should not focus excessively on the mechanical effect of the limited pass through of negative policy rates to retail deposit rates chart 9 annual bank return on equity percent sources s p mi snl financial and ecb calculations notes dotted green line excludes the impact of changes in taxation in the united states scandinavian countries include denmark norway and sweden the latest observation is for 2018 nonetheless the governing council is closely monitoring the risk that the impact of negative rates on bank profitability may impair the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy moreover the ecb decided last september to introduce a two tier system for remunerating excess liquidity holdings with the aim of supporting the bank based transmission of monetary policy the interest rate on such holdings is now tiered with excess liquidity holdings up to six times the minimum reserve requirements receiving zero interest and holdings beyond that level remunerated at the deposit facility rate of 0 5 percent the implementation of the tiering policy has been smooth on the one side it has reduced the direct cost of negative interest rates for banks and thereby helped sustain the pass through of low policy rates to bank lending rates while on the other side money market rates have continued to be well aligned with the policy rate thereby preserving the positive contribution of negative rates to the accommodative stance of monetary policy finally we are alert to the possibility that there may be a level for the policy rate below which a policy easing would have perverse effects and in fact lead to a tightening of bank credit conditions the reversal rate the ongoing pass through of easing measures to lower lending rates and continued credit growth indicates that the reversal rate is not currently binding for the euro area while measured credit growth is decelerating this reflects the demand for bank loans mirroring the slowdown in the economy and there are no signs of supply side restrictions due to banks seeking to retrench from lending in fact bank credit standards in the euro area have been either loosening or steady around very supportive levels since 2014 in line with this since the introduction of negative rates banks have consistently reported in the ecb s bank lending survey that they view negative rates as supportive of credit creation targeted longer term refinancing operations tltros are an effective tool for providing credit easing and are particularly useful if there is a risk of the bank based transmission mechanism becoming impaired banks can use tltros to refinance with the ecb over an extended horizon and at very favourable conditions provided that they meet the lending targets set by the ecb under the second and third rounds of the programme tltro ii and iii borrowing rates in the tltros can be as low as the deposit facility rate which is currently set at 0 5 percent tltros lower bank funding costs via two distinct channels direct and indirect the funding cost relief is direct for those banks that use tltro financing instead of more expensive market funding in addition the tltros have indirectly contributed to favourable funding conditions on capital markets through the scarcity effects generated by reduced bond issuance from banks that replace market based funding with tltro borrowing the effectiveness of tltros can be analysed by comparing the change in lending rates between those banks that participated in the operations and those that did not the comparison shows that participating banks granted significantly more favourable rates to their corporate clients than their non participating counterparts which suggests a sizeable easing of financing conditions for firms especially in vulnerable countries see

euro area countries asset purchase programme finally by linking the horizon of the app both in terms of net purchases and the reinvestment policy to the forward guidance on policy rates expectations on the purchase horizon of the app adjust in line with the inflation outlook and automatically regulate term premia the transmission of our asset purchases in the euro area has been similar to the transmission of other central banks asset purchases in their respective jurisdictions with the most pronounced effects at longer maturities while negative interest rates and forward guidance have primarily been transmitted through the expectations component of interest rates asset purchases have primarily operated through the term premium component this is due to asset purchases affecting interest rates mainly by reducing the interest rate or duration risk borne by investors holding long term bonds the duration risk extraction channel by purchasing securities with a relatively long maturity the central bank frees up risk bearing capacity among investors and fosters a rebalancing of their portfolio towards other more risky types of assets including investment in productive capital in the euro area our net asset purchases and reinvestment policy have led to substantial duration risk being withdrawn from the market in the order of 20 percent of the duration equivalent stock of current public debt in the four largest euro area economies see chart 11 based on a term structure model that incorporates the duration channel we can track the time varying effect of the app on term premia as expectations on the purchase horizon change over time at present the app is estimated to be compressing euro area ten year sovereign yields by more than 100 basis points see chart 12 we are confident that the effects of our asset purchases continue to feed through to euro area financial conditions and support a more accommodative monetary policy stance the experience we have built up over the last five years does not indicate that asset purchases entail diminishing returns over time this is corroborated by recent research applied to the us experience which suggests that once anticipation effects are taken into account the later rounds of large scale asset purchases undertaken by the federal reserve remained powerful chart 11 outstanding quantity of duration pspp and other investors chart 12 impact of pspp on euro area sovereign term premia over time the macroeconomic effect the contribution of our measures to the overall easing of euro area financial conditions has been notable across the entire term structure overall the combined effect of negative interest rates forward guidance and the app is estimated to have peaked at around 140 to 150 basis points in long term rates between 2016 and 2018 see chart 13 chart 13 impact of non standard measures on the sovereign yield curve these improved financing conditions have made a considerable contribution to the macroeconomic performance of the euro area a counterfactual exercise indicates that in the absence of our unconventional measures growth employment and inflation would have been considerably lower more specifically the estimated average annual contribution of the unconventional measures to euro area inflation is between 0 3 and 0 5 percentage points see chart 14 the estimated level of real gdp at the end of 2019 without the package of unconventional measures is between 2 5 and 3 0 percentage points lower than the observed level and employment is estimated to be about 2 5 million lower in the absence of the measures chart 14 no measures counterfactual percentage points source ecb calculations note the boxplot depicts a range of assessments comprising the eurosystem staff assessment based on a suite of models and the assessment documented in rostagno m et al op cit by contrast the role of fiscal policy in supporting the euro area economy has been limited see charts 15 17 while the current mildly expansionary fiscal stance is providing some support the more fiscal policy contributes to boosting long term growth potential and providing cyclical stabilisation the quicker will be the effects of monetary policy interventions on inflation and the economy in this regard it is worth keeping in mind that the macroeconomic impact of fiscal policy is particularly strong in an environment in which inflationary pressures are muted and the expected interest rate path is not very steep chart 15 euro area fiscal stance and change in the output gap chart 16 contributions to euro area real gdp growth chart 17 government balances conclusion let me conclude globally central banks have been confronted with large and persistent shocks stemming from the financial crisis and the long term trend decline in the equilibrium real interest rate these factors have constrained conventional monetary policy space and required a profound expansion of the policy toolbox in order to ensure the effectiveness of monetary policy our forward guidance on interest rates which makes the evolution of our policy rates contingent on the robust convergence of inflation to our aim captures our monetary reaction function in the current environment of low inflation and low interest rates our forward guidance links the various unconventional monetary policy instruments together within a coherent framework and is proving effective in guiding adjustment in the expected path for policy rates and longer term bond yields in response to the changing outlook as i have demonstrated the ecb has been willing and able to calibrate the combination of its unconventional policy instruments in directions and on a scale that gives sizeable support to the economy and continues to support the convergence of inflation to our aim at the same time if fiscal policy were to play a more supportive role alongside monetary policy it would lead to a faster return of inflation to our objective and contribute to raising the equilibrium real interest rate thereby alleviating the constraints on monetary policy finally the long term trends that are being discussed at this conference give all central bankers pause for thought in terms of their strategy and instruments in this vein we announced last month the launch of a comprehensive review of our monetary policy strategy which we expect to be concluded by the end of the year
opinions of friday 21 february 2020 columnist professor newman kwadwo ifs impact of the rising public debt unsustainability of the public debt one major problem of ghana s rising public debt has to do with its sustainability both currently and in the medium term in 2015 when ghana signed up to a three year imf extended credit facility program for an amount of 918 million the fund s debt sustainability analysis classified the country as at high risk of debt distress on account of the level of the public debt four years later the country s debt situation had not improved the world bank and the imf have maintained ghana as a high risk of debt distress country after their latest debt sustainability analysis concluded that the country s risks of external and overall debt distress continue to be high and the country s public debt level has breached its sustainability threshold the fund s october 2019 debt sustainability analysis also found the country s medium term debt path to be high reflecting lower gdp growth a higher fiscal deficit due largely to energy sector costs and debt service over the medium term although there is marked improvement in the solvency ratios following the rebasing of the gdp the debt service ratios continue to breach their respective benchmarks reflecting the underlying vulnerabilities currently ghana is classified as the only country in sub saharan africa that is at risk of high debt distress implying that the country is accumulating so much debt that it may not be able to repay the bank of ghana also declared that ghana s public debt stock is unsustainable and the large foreign investor component makes the economy vulnerable interestingly the economic commission for africa eca also reached the same conclusion as the imf and world bank when it listed ghana among 11 countries in the sub region that are at high risk of debt distress ghana s classification as a high debt distressed country implies that there is serious concern about the country s ability to meet its debt obligations this concern comes at a time when the country s total public debt stands at gh 234 0 billion and the government has set aside over gh 19 billion in the 2020 budget to pay interests alone interest payments have become one of the biggest government expenditure bill and more than capital expenditure the fear is that any further fiscal slippage will have adverse impact on the country s debt dynamics which will have serious implications for investors confidence in the economy in addition ghana still faces high financing costs in both domestic and external markets as interest rates on the international financial market remain susceptible to actions of the us federal reserves rapid increase in debt servicing cost a major impact of ghana s rising public debt has to do with the cost of servicing the debt amortization and interest payment which rose significantly in the 11 year period ending 2019 making ghana one of the african countries with the highest debt services and posing a serious problem for fiscal management total debt servicing increased from gh 1 1 billion 3 6 of gdp in 2008 to gh 107 6 billion 31 1 of gdp which was equal to the country s total external debt during the period the bulk of the amortization totaling gh 13 5 billion 53 6 was made in 2017 2019 period total interest payment on the government debt jumped from gh 6 5 billion in 2009 2012 to gh 36 billion in 2013 2016 and then to gh 39 9 billion in 2017 2019 over the eleven year period ending 2019 ghana paid a total of gh 82 5 billion 76 7 of total debt servicing cost as interest on public debt table 3 bank of ghana summary of economic and financial data various issues interest payment as a percentage of total tax revenue averaged 40 2 during the 2009 2019 period while total debt servicing cost averaged 42 3 this means that since 2009 for every one cedi collected as tax revenue 40 2 pesewas was used to pay interest on public debt also for every one cedi collected as total revenue 42 3 pesewas was used to service the public debt table 3 in fact 2019 was the sixth successive year that total interest payments on public debt was bigger than total government capital expenditure suggesting that interest payments will probably have to be financed through additions to public debt or at the expense of other key government expenditures if the government does not slow down the rate of borrowing the 2020 budget allocates over gh 19bn to pay interests on government debt and is one of the biggest items on the government s expenditure bill and more than the allocation for capital expenditure there is also the rising energy sector debts which the government described in july 2019 as in a state of emergency ghana s public debt profile and associated servicing costs are expected to rise more so as the country heads into the crucial 2020 elections cycle with rising public demand for improvement in living conditions according to the minister of finance the 2019 budget set aside gh 18 6 billion to pay for interest on borrowed funds in the 2020 budget the minister projected that interest payment will hit gh 21 7 billion this means that if the economy does not expand to accommodate the rising debt servicing costs it could impact negatively on the debt to gdp ratio which stood at 62 1 in 2019 risk of capital flight and currency depreciation another worrisome aspect of ghana s public debt is that a larger portion of it is held by foreigners posing serious risks to the country s balance of payments and external vulnerability as at end 2018 foreign investors were holding 30 of the country s domestic bonds and about 64 9 of the entire public debt was in the hands of foreign investors by march 2019 this had worsened to 67 2 making ghana the highest external holding of public debt in africa the increased reliance on foreign investors has come at a cost to the country as their presence has heightened exposure to shifting market sentiment and exchange rate risk ghana s newly incurred public debt is also mainly in the form of non concessional external foreign currency debt against this background there is the possibility of capital flight if non resident holders of the country s debt find other economies attractive for investment also with foreigners holding more of the local bonds ghana has become vulnerable to investors changes of confidence and also exposed to foreign exchange risks the ghanaian economy has thus become more vulnerable to foreign investor sentiments and should any panic situation causes capital flight the non resident holders will sell off their investments in addition to the risk of capital flight ghana is at constant risk of currency depreciation if non residents keep holding a large portion of the domestic debt thus a possible non resident withdrawal from the ghanaian domestic bond market due to an appreciation of the us dollar effects of the us tightened monetary policy or a rise in the federal interest rates creating a preference for investing in us assets will run the risk of weakening the cedi exchange rate with serious implications for the size of the external debt counted in cedis ghana will also have to face high financing costs on internal and external markets in the context of a strong usa dollar and the rise in global bond yields in fact the ratio of ghana s short term private capital inflows to net international reserves rose by more than 200 above the standard benchmark in 2019 suggesting that there is a real prospect of payment default which could be triggered by any shock to external financing conditions already there are significant capital flow reversals ongoing and foreign participation in domestic bonds has started declining vulnerabilities in the ability to service debt ghana s ballooning debt stock against persistent shortfalls in revenue mobilization have created vulnerabilities in the country s ability to service its debt revenue shortfalls continue to pose significant rigidity on the governments ability to fully fund and finance most capital projects that will boost economic growth and the wellbeing of ghanaians as a result ghana has to resort to borrowing to finance its capital projects consequently debt service expenditure has increased sharply since 2013 and by 2019 the ratio had reached 50 7 this means that for the first time in nearly two decades debt servicing expenditure absorbed over 40 of total government revenue compounding the problem is the exposure to foreign exchange related valuation which also affected the country s fiscal strength posing a significant constraint to the country s sovereign credit profile afolabi 2019 collateralization of future revenues another serious concern about ghana s rising public debt is the collateralization of future revenues government is currently borrowing on account of future revenues the getfund proceeds are going to drop significantly because a lot of it would have to finance the us 1 5 billion that the government is raising to support the fund mineral royalties are also going to disappear because the money will be used to finance the us 750 million of royalty income for the next 10 to 15 years that has been mortgaged there is also the mortgaging of some minerals that are yet to be produced such as the sino hydro us 2 billion bauxite deal for which revenues that are supposed to come to the state have already been earmarked for infrastructure spending this financing strategy involving debt collateralization and revenue monetization has the potential to encumber revenue over the medium term conclusion the rapid increase of ghana s debt together with the changes in its structure and design features make the debt unsustainable pointing to another systemic sovereign debt crisis moreover external and foreign currency denominated debt has become predominant exposing the country to swings in global market conditions the share of commercial debt is also rising due mainly to the constant issuing of eurobonds in recent years the imminence of another debt crisis in less than two decades after a major debt relief points to the fact that progress has not been sufficient to address the structural issues that constrain sustainable development financing in ghana the growing public debt is not supported by commensurate investment in capital expenditure the inability of the government to raise sufficient domestic revenue to finance its activities means the government s large borrowing needs continue to crowd out credit to the private sector leaving the country exposed to investor sentiments the recent financial sector clean up continues to create fiscal costs while longstanding losses in the energy sector have spilled over to government financing needs still there are some downside risks including the 2020 election related spending pressures and potential debt rollover difficulties due possibly to loss of investor confidence or a tightening of global financial conditions ghana s debt management in 2020 and the medium term needs to remain flexible in the light of the uncertain global environment liability management operations should aim at smoothening the domestic redemption profile going towards the 2020 elections to limit refinancing risks and increasing buffers transparent regular and consistent market communication including improved coordination and visibility of debt issuance across state owned entities will also facilitate the management of a possible turbulence professor newman kwadwo kusi is the executive director of institute for fiscal studies ifs
as china s economy struggles to recover from the damage of the coronavirus it may be in more danger from excessive stimulus measures than from the epidemic itself some experts say china s regulators have been trying to budge the stalled economy from its standstill with a barrage of liquidity measures relying more heavily on stimulus steps than at any time since the global financial crisis of 2008 2009 since january the people s bank of china pboc has been pumping funds into state banks through a variety of streams including reverse repurchase operations which allow temporary sales of securities with buyback commitments and medium term lending facilities with reduced rates for loans so far in february the pboc has channeled 1 7 trillion yuan u s 243 billion through the reverse repo agreements alone at the same time the government has pledged to extend more tax and fee cuts which totaled 2 3 trillion yuan u s 329 5 billion last year as well as 537 billion yuan u s 76 9 billion in targeted loan programs for small and medium sized enterprises on feb 9 the pboc pledged 300 billion u s 43 billion in loans to banks to support epidemic control on thursday the pboc lowered its one

january new yuan denominated loans rose by a relatively restrained 3 4 percent from a year before to 3 34 trillion yuan u s 475 5 billion but the m2 measure of broad money supply jumped 8 4 percent it

in washington even before the spread of the coronavirus contagion china s economic growth in 2019 recorded a 29 year low of 6 1 percent dropping sharply from 6 6 percent in 2018 the decline raised the stakes for stimulus measures to keep this year s growth from falling below 6 percent the minimum that was previously thought to be needed to reach the doubling gdp goal the government has already cut itself some statistical slack with an estimate that the goal can be reached with gdp growth of no less than 5 5 percent china daily said this week the lower estimate suggests that the national bureau of statistics nbs has found a way to declare that the decade of doubling requirement will be met despite the economic damage from the epidemic doubling gdp is just manipulating numbers policy s the thing scissors said but even the minimum growth of 5 5 percent this year may be beyond reach without rapid recovery and enormous stimulus this week moody s investors service slashed its forecast for 2020 growth from 5 8 percent to 5 2 percent according to a bloomberg economics estimate on monday china s economy was running at 40 to 50 percent of capacity during the previous week while the impact of the epidemic has only added to the challenge the threat of inflation may limit how far the stimulus can go january readings of the consumer price index cpi taken largely before the epidemic was widely reported rose 5 4 percent year on year topping the government s 3 percent target for 2019 for the fourth month in a row food prices soared 20 6 percent driven largely by pork which climbed 116 percent from a year before the report came as a reminder that the government was still grappling with its previous health crisis of african swine fever before the coronavirus became the focus of concern the government has been releasing supplies of frozen pork from its reserves to keep inflation in check but since the extent of the reserves has not been disclosed only the government knows how long this can go on unpredictable results the outcome for the economy may depend on whether decreased demand exceeds depressed production the results are unpredictable but the january cpi in virus stricken hubei province may provide a clue the province reported a 5 5 percent increase in consumer inflation slightly higher than the national figure despite government efforts to increase supplies scissors suggests that the recovery and its costs will be shaped by longer term policies the core chinese economic problem is sustained oversupply scissors said debt accumulation results from this as does labor and land misallocation and unnecessarily weak innovation the virus outbreak has depressed both consumption and production it s not clear if it will worsen oversupply but production oriented stimulus is china s standard response to shocks he said china s problem with food prices may be a temporary exception the price spike is a tentative sign of demand outpacing supply at least in a few

as china s economy struggles to recover from the damage of the coronavirus it may be in more danger from excessive stimulus measures than from the epidemic itself some experts say china s regulators have been trying to budge the stalled economy from its standstill with a barrage of liquidity measures relying more heavily on stimulus steps than at any time since the global financial crisis of 2008 2009 since january the people s bank of china pboc has been pumping funds into state banks through a variety of streams including reverse repurchase operations which allow temporary sales of securities with buyback commitments and medium term lending facilities with reduced rates for loans so far in february the pboc has channeled 1 7 trillion yuan u s 243 billion through the reverse repo agreements alone at the same time the government has pledged to extend more tax and fee cuts which totaled 2 3 trillion yuan u s 329 5 billion last year as well as 537 billion yuan u s 76 9 billion in targeted loan programs for small and medium sized enterprises on feb 9 the pboc pledged 300 billion u s 43 billion in loans to banks to support epidemic control on thursday the pboc lowered its one year loan prime rate from 4 15 percent to 4 05 percent last week the ministry of finance said it had also accelerated the issuance of 1 85 trillion yuan u s 265 billion in local government bonds in january new yuan denominated loans rose by a relatively restrained 3 4 percent from a year before to 3 34 trillion yuan u s 475 5 billion but the m2 measure of broad money supply jumped 8 4 percent it is difficult and perhaps pointless to tally the total of all these liquidity moves since the estimate seems likely to change before the ink is dry regulators are said to be planning another cut in the reserve requirement ratio rrr for banks among other stimulus solutions the central government will continually launch new supportive measures in terms of fiscal and tax policies said finance minister liu kun according to state media the same appears to be the case for central bank policies pumping up the economy but the mounting mass of stimulus measures has raised concerns about the rising cost of an economic recovery particularly since the communist party of china cpc is still sticking by its longstanding pledge to double the gross domestic product of 2010 by the end of this year how seriously does the government take the promise to double china s gdp on feb 17 the official english language china daily left little room for doubt achieving this year s economic growth related goals has become as important as containing the spread of the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak the paper s website said but pumping up the economy with more credit could raise financial risk and create further damage over a longer period the fear is worsening a debt burden that has spent the past two years campaigning to whittle down the wall street journal said some economists warn that the cost of pumping up a recovery to meet the doubling of gdp goal is too high the real economic damage won t come from the coronavirus but the stimulus that follows read a headline from china based financial news outlet caixin on a commentary by alicia garcia herrero chief asia pacific economist for the french investment bank natixis it seems clear to me that no effort will be spared to achieve a high enough growth target to achieve this goal garcia herrero wrote on the website bruegel org the bigger the shock now the larger the policy expansion will be needed to achieve the growth target the result may be an extension of china s economic crisis more debt for a highly indebted country like china can only mean lower potential growth down the road garcia herrero said president xi signaled his determination to meet economic targets despite the epidemic which is likely to decimate first quarter growth xi demanded resolute efforts from party committees and governments at all levels to win the people s war against the epidemic and urged them to strive to achieve this year s economic and social development goals and tasks the official xinhua news agency quoted him as saying at a meeting of the cpc politburo standing committee on feb 12 a man wearing a protective mask walks in front of an electronic display board in the lobby of the shanghai stock exchange building in shanghai china

chinese finance minister liu kun who also serves as president of the people s bank of china answers a question during a press conference on promoting the stable and sustainable development of the chinese economy in beijing sept 24 2019 as china s economy struggles to recover from the damage of the coronavirus it may be in more danger from excessive stimulus measures than from the epidemic itself some experts say china s regulators have been trying to budge the stalled economy from its standstill with a barrage of liquidity measures relying more heavily on stimulus steps than at any time since the global financial crisis of 2008 2009 since january the people s bank of china pboc has been pumping funds into state banks through a variety of streams including reverse repurchase operations which allow temporary sales of securities with buyback commitments and medium term lending facilities with reduced rates for loans so far in february the pboc has channeled 1 7 trillion yuan u s 243 billion through the reverse repo agreements alone at the same time the government has pledged to extend more tax and fee cuts which totaled 2 3 trillion yuan u s 329 5 billion last year as well as 537 billion yuan u s 76 9 billion in targeted loan programs for small and medium sized enterprises on feb 9 the pboc pledged 300 billion u s 43 billion in loans to banks to support epidemic control on thursday the pboc lowered its one year loan prime rate from 4 15 percent to 4 05 percent last week the ministry of finance said it had also accelerated the issuance of 1 85 trillion yuan u s 265 billion in local government bonds in january new yuan denominated loans rose by a relatively restrained 3 4 percent from a year before to 3 34 trillion yuan u s 475 5 billion but the m2 measure of broad money supply jumped 8 4 percent it is difficult and perhaps pointless to tally the total of all these liquidity moves since the estimate seems likely to change before the ink is dry regulators are said to be planning another cut in the reserve requirement ratio rrr for banks among other stimulus solutions the central government will continually launch new supportive measures in terms of fiscal and tax policies said finance minister liu kun according to state media the same appears to be the case for central bank policies pumping up the economy but the mounting mass of stimulus measures has raised concerns about the rising cost of an economic recovery particularly since the communist party of china cpc is still sticking by its longstanding pledge to double the gross domestic product of 2010 by the end of this year how seriously does the government take the promise to double china s gdp on feb 17 the official english language china daily left little room for doubt achieving this year s economic growth related goals has become as important as containing the spread of the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak the paper s website said but pumping up the economy with more credit could raise financial risk and create further damage over a longer period the fear is worsening a debt burden that has spent the past two years campaigning to whittle down the wall street journal said some economists warn that the cost of pumping up a recovery to meet the doubling of gdp goal is too high the real economic damage won t come from the coronavirus but the stimulus that follows read a headline from china based financial news outlet caixin on a commentary by alicia garcia herrero chief asia pacific economist for the french investment bank natixis it seems clear to me that no effort will be spared to achieve a high enough growth target to achieve this goal garcia herrero wrote on the website bruegel org the bigger the shock now the larger the policy expansion will be needed to achieve the growth target the result may be an extension of china s economic crisis more debt for a highly indebted country like china can only mean lower potential growth down the road garcia herrero said president xi signaled his determination to meet economic targets despite the epidemic which is likely to decimate first quarter growth xi demanded resolute efforts from party committees and governments at all levels to win the people s war against the epidemic and urged them to strive to achieve this year s economic and social development goals and tasks the official xinhua news agency quoted him as saying at a meeting of the cpc politburo standing committee on feb 12 a man wearing a protective mask walks in front of an electronic display board in the lobby of the shanghai stock exchange building in shanghai china feb 14 2020 credit associated press more stimulus needed but economists say that more stimulus will be needed to stage a recovery from the current crisis than was the case with the sars virus in 2002 2003 because economic growth has weakened significantly since then if only people would grasp this point said derek scissors an asia economist and resident scholar at the american enterprise institute in washington even before the spread of the coronavirus contagion china s economic growth in 2019 recorded a 29 year low of 6 1 percent dropping sharply from 6 6 percent in 2018 the decline raised the stakes for stimulus measures to keep this year s growth from falling below 6 percent the minimum that was previously thought to be needed to reach the doubling gdp goal the government has already cut itself some statistical slack with an estimate that the goal can be reached with gdp growth of no less than 5 5 percent china daily said this week the lower estimate suggests that the national bureau of statistics nbs has found a way to declare that the decade of doubling requirement will be met despite the economic damage from the epidemic doubling gdp is just manipulating numbers policy s the thing scissors said but even the minimum growth of 5 5 percent this year may be beyond reach without rapid recovery and enormous stimulus this week moody s investors service slashed its forecast for 2020 growth from 5 8 percent to 5 2 percent according to a bloomberg economics estimate on monday china s economy was running at 40 to 50 percent of capacity during the previous week while the impact of the epidemic has only added to the challenge the threat of inflation may limit how far the stimulus can go january readings of the consumer price index cpi taken largely before the epidemic was widely reported rose 5 4 percent year on year topping the government s 3 percent target for 2019 for the fourth month in a row food prices soared 20 6 percent driven largely by pork which climbed 116 percent from a year before the report came as a reminder that the government was still grappling with its previous health crisis of african swine fever before the coronavirus became the focus of concern the government has been releasing supplies of frozen pork from its reserves to keep inflation in check but since the extent of the reserves has not been disclosed only the government knows how long this can go on unpredictable results the outcome for the economy may depend on whether decreased demand exceeds depressed production the results are unpredictable but the january cpi in virus stricken hubei province may provide a clue the province reported a 5 5 percent increase in consumer inflation slightly higher than the national figure despite government efforts to increase supplies scissors suggests that the recovery and its costs will be shaped by longer term policies the core chinese economic problem is sustained oversupply scissors said debt accumulation results from this as does labor and land misallocation and unnecessarily weak innovation the virus outbreak has depressed both consumption and production it s not clear if it will worsen oversupply but production oriented stimulus is china s standard response to shocks he said china s problem with food prices may be a temporary exception the price spike is a tentative sign of demand outpacing supply at least in a few areas shortages are certainly a problem but they are a short term problem the long term problem remains deflationary pressure scissors said
with not much on the economic calendar to enthuse markets next week the virus and its impact on economies globally is likely to remain the primary driver of risk sentiment still there are some important indicators worth keeping an eye on overall there s little to suggest that the dollar s relentless rally is about to end as the us economy is much better positioned than its rivals to weather any slowdown in china that said the more the dollar climbs the greater the risk of verbal intervention by the white house or the fed king dollar reigns supreme the dollar has overwhelmed the competition lately smashing through the euro commodity currencies and even the defensive japanese yen as investors insulate their portfolios from the virus fallout and cut their exposure to economies that will be hardest hit from a severe slowdown in china that means the us economy is the place to be in as america has a smaller exposure to china in terms of exports compared to europe or japan hence any chinese shock might be felt less in the us which explains the powerful rotation towards us assets the upcoming economic data are unlikely to change this dollar friendly narrative durable goods orders for january will be released on thursday alongside the second estimate of gdp for q4 before personal income and spending numbers coupled with the core pce price index all for january hit the markets on friday what can turn this narrative around admittedly not much the last few weeks have seen market expectations for fed rate cuts grow with more than one and a half cuts now priced in by year end but the dollar has only moved higher in the meantime and the more concerns about the virus impact on foreign economies intensify the more the dollar is likely to shine since the us economy is better protected from a slowdown in china and us authorities have policy room to react to any shock unlike europe or japan however there is a wild card in all this verbal intervention if the white house or better yet the fed start expressing concerns about the strength of the dollar and the negative effect that might have on exports then the reserve currency might correct lower still unless they threaten actual fx intervention to weaken it which is very unlikely merely voicing concerns probably wouldn t be enough to keep the dollar down for long can yen sink further the traditionally safe haven japanese yen came under unexpected selling pressure lately plummeting to near 10 month lows versus the us dollar amid fears that japan s economy might take a much bigger hit from the virus epidemic than initially projected recent economic data has been dire gdp contracted by a shocking 1 6 on a quarterly basis in q4 exports declined year on year for the 14th straight month in january and machinery orders slumped by 12 5 in the same period all this turns the spotlight on next week s preliminary industrial output print and retail sales report for january both of which are key indicators of japanese growth another set of dismal numbers could add fuel to concerns that the world s third biggest economy is headed for a technical recession and by extension raise speculation that the bank of japan might resort to more unorthodox stimulus measures to support growth as for the yen what has been most striking about its recent plunge is that the move was purely fx based it wasn t reflected in the bond market and relative interest rates divergences like this one usually correct meaning that eventually the two will probably recouple the question is whether it will be the yen that will move back higher as it plays catch up to the bond market or whether relative rates will move higher to meet the yen more often it s the fx market that recouples with rates so the yen might ultimately recover aussie and kiwi to seek halt to slide from domestic data with investors pinning their hopes on governments and central bankers to come to the rescue to limit the economic damage from the coronavirus the rba and the rbnz are the obvious candidates to deliver rate cuts hence the risk sensitive australian and new zealand dollars aren t moving in tandem with stocks and remain the worst performing majors this year in australia the main releases are fourth quarter estimates on construction work done wednesday and capital expenditure thursday which should give clues on what to expect from forthcoming q4 gdp figures in new zealand quarterly retail sales will be watched on monday as well as trade data and the anz business outlook survey for january on thursday in canada gdp data for q4 will see the light on friday alas all these figures might be seen as somewhat outdated even if fourth quarter data were stellar the situation on the ground might be very different now for these export heavy economies with china the world s biggest consumer of commodities being paralyzed in recent weeks hence investors might wait for february data to get a clearer picture of how these economies are faring as for the battered aussie and kiwi as long as markets remain so focused on virus risks any recovery in both currencies will probably remain short lived investors seem to be revaluating the impact and duration of this shock on china increasingly pricing in a more prolonged slowdown that would inevitably hurt australia and new zealand two of china s biggest suppliers of raw materials for a sustainable rally to be able to materialize markets might need concrete signs that this epidemic has come under control and that the worst in terms of an economic slowdown is behind us sadly we might still be far from that point german data unlikely to turn euro s fortunes around in euro land monday will bring the release of germany s ifo business survey for february before preliminary inflation numbers for that month come into focus friday the single currency has taken a beating lately as the eurozone and especially german manufacturers rely on chinese demand to absorb their exports thus a severe hit to chinese growth might translate into weaker growth for the eurozone which is barely growing already meanwhile monetary policy is almost exhausted so the ecb can t do much more to support the economy and it seems that a recession must be on the horizon before eurozone governments finally decide to spend more to boost growth until markets get strong signals that a big spending package is on the way there s not much to stop the euro s epic downfall supporting this view while euro dollar has collapsed already speculative positioning on the euro is far from extreme short so there s room for further declines as more leveraged funds come aboard the euro pain train that said a note of caution given how much and how fast euro dollar has plunged already any piece of positive news for the euro or negative news for the dollar could trigger a bigger than usual corrective rebound as several traders take profits on their prior short positions

as china s economy struggles to recover from the damage of the coronavirus it may be in more danger from excessive stimulus measures than from the epidemic itself some experts say china s regulators have been trying to budge the stalled economy from its standstill with a barrage of liquidity measures relying more heavily on stimulus steps than at any time since the global financial crisis of 2008

january new yuan denominated loans rose by a relatively restrained 3 4 percent from a year before to 3 34 trillion yuan u s 475 5 billion but the m2 measure of broad money supply jumped 8 4 percent it

of 2019 grupo financiero galicia has shown good result in a very challenging and volatile macro environment keeping liquidity solvency and profitability metrics at high levels we are now ready to answer the questions that you might have thank you questions and answers operator thank you we ll take our first question from alonso garcia of credit suisse alonso garcia credit suisse analyst good morning everyone and thank you for taking my question my first question is regarding your expectations for loan growth and deposit growth compared to your inflation expectations this year considering then the base of course is lower but also that the macroeconomic conditions in argentina remain uncertain for this year and my second question is on the inflation adjusted accounting that you re reporting this year what sort of roe level do you expect for 2020 and what do you think i know it s hard but what do you think would be a reasonable and sustainable roe under this inflation accounting thank you pablo firvida investor relations officer okay hi alonso in terms of the loan growth in this environment of lower interest rate and also we re forecasting some recovery in gdp toward the second half of the year and as you said coming from very low starting levels we are forecasting loans growing around 10 percentage points of our inflation so with an inflation of 40 that is our current number the loans could end up growing around 50 this year deposits sometimes lower perhaps inflation plus 5 in that order when we speak about that was the first question when we speak about the inflation adjustment we informed in the press release in the last page that the what would have been the net worth and the net income of 2019 if inflation adjustment was applied that number makes the roe at around 20 to 21 in real terms it s important to see that the nominal roe was around 56 the inflation was around 53 8 so really the real roe has nothing to do with the difference between nominal and inflation for next year depending on the inflation and also the monthly inflation because it s very sensitive on each month we could be thinking in lower nominal roe and somewhat lower real roe but really the adjustment is very difficult to forecast mainly considering this volatility in the monthly readings alonso garcia credit suisse analyst very clear thank you very much pablo firvida investor relations officer you re welcome operator thank you we ll now move to our next question from carlos gomez of hsbc carlos gomez hsbc analyst hi good morning i wanted to ask you about the measures to limit credit card interest rate and the offsetting reduction in reserve requirements that you experienced do you have a preliminary calculation as to the impact that this might have on your result and second i would like to know what do you expect your tax rate to be for this year and whether you can confirm that it should be a tax on the inflation adjusted earnings thank you pablo firvida investor relations officer hi carlos the regulation that came the day before yesterday at night they put a cut for financing with interest before with credit cards the cap is 55 that can be compared with around 75 that was the previous number but i asked the it was a formula that took asset base the average cost of personal loans and that rate was coming down already really the number we should be comparing with is around 71 and now 55 of course that has a negative impact but when we take into account the less reserve requirement we have to have a non remunerated that leaves an equivalent amount in deposits it s really a percentage of the consumption of a program called but really this improvement in reserve requirement or the yields in this reserve requirement is kind of offsetting the reduction in interest rate perhaps something marginally negative but really we can assume it s almost equal carlos gomez hsbc analyst okay that s helpful in terms of credit cards what would what happens to tarjeta naranja the regulation of the price would be the personal loans plus 25 and therefore it would be 71 up pablo firvida investor relations officer this change doesn t apply in non bank credit cards so now yes the gap will be the former one up to 1 25 times the weighted average cost of personal loans in the system with some technicality is that some public sector banks are not included in that number but basically net asset is not affected by this cap in terms of income tax the effective tax will be or the nominal income tax rate will be 30 it was to be reduced to 25 but there was a loan that gets in the same level at 30 and we calculate the income tax considering inflation adjustment carlos gomez hsbc analyst thank you thank you very much pablo firvida investor relations officer you re welcome carlos operator thank you we have another question comes from brian flores of citi brian flores citi analyst hi thank you for the opportunity to ask the question we saw some deterioration on your npls and i was wondering if you are guiding for any figure for 2020 and what are the drivers behind your guidance thank you pablo firvida investor relations officer okay hi brian we saw an increase in npls this quarter mainly at the bank level from 4 to the coverage is at 110 healthy we saw an improvement in npls in the level of naranja this quarter had the particularity of one commercial case white products retailer in which we had to provision ars1 billion without that npls would have been i would say similar and also the cost of risk while the cost of risk instead of being 5 1 closer to 3 9 so going forward with this forecasted growth in loans plus a recovery in the economy sequentially in the second quarter npls to be improving and toward the end of the year this 4 4 that i was mentioning should be compared with around 3 8 brian flores citi analyst very clear thank you pablo firvida investor relations officer you re welcome operator thank you we ll move to our next question it is coming from ernesto gabilondo of bank of america ernesto gabilondo bank of america analyst hi good morning pablo thanks for the opportunity to make questions a follow up in the interest rate cap on credit cards how much is the average interest rate of your credit card portfolio and what do you think will be the reduction from the one that you re charging to the one that the central bank is proposing thank you pablo firvida investor relations officer when you look at the stock of loans related to credit cards in december it was around ars95 6 billion but that includes everything from the float or a lot of financing with no interest lending with installments also a rural credit card that we have so really out of that the amount is subject to financing with this card interest rate that was reduced was something lower than ars10 billion ars9 point something billion the reduction as i said was something between or will be actually because it will begin in march from levels of 71 to 55 and we will be offsetting that with a higher yield on part of the reserve requirement that now we don t have to constitute or we will not have a zero yield ernesto gabilondo bank of america analyst okay perfect understood thank you very much pablo firvida investor relations officer you re welcome ernesto operator and our next question comes from santiago petri of franklin santiago petri franklin analyst hello pablo hi good afternoon the question is related to financial margin could you please split what will be the net interest margin from this consolidated financial margin and how do you see this net interest margin and financial margin going into 2020 with all the attention on the central bank to reduce rates thank you pablo firvida investor relations officer hi santiago when we speak about the nim we see some compression going forward that will be offset with this volume increase when we speak about nims of 20 the breakdown is something around 28 in pesos and 2 in dollars so the breakdown between pesos and dollars it s important also this gap between or the evolution or the different evolution between leliq and badlar lately leliq was going down faster than badlar but putting everything together with a 100 basis point reduction in nims we would need around 5 growth in loans in order to offset that really in a lower industry rate environment typically margins compress but volumes rebound and the sustainability and the needs of the financial system for the medium term santiago petri franklin analyst okay thanks thanks a lot pablo firvida investor relations officer you re welcome thank you operator it appears we have no further questions sir pablo firvida investor relations officer okay ian thank you well thank you all for attending this call if you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact us thank you good morning and good afternoon for the ones duration 26 minutes call

cutting costs drawing fdi and encouraging an entrepreneurial culture are all part of the transformation riyadh is determined to bring about for many years saudi arabia s economy was defined by a pretty simple equation the quantity of oil it produced multiplied by the price per barrel since the fall of energy prices however the math has become trickier to prevent the oil market from collapsing further the opec countries led by saudi arabia last year renewed their decision to cap production essentially deciding to sell less for a better price but for the world s second largest oil producer this quota policy combined with unexpected attacks on oil facilities and tankers slowed gdp growth to less than 1 recent overall saudi growth was considerably lower than what had been hoped for by riyadh says harry broadman managing director and chair of the emerging markets practice at berkeley research group that in and of itself is no emergency given the relatively low oil price environment as well as production outages due to attacks on oil facilities the saudi economy actually weathered the year quite well says ravi bhatia director of sovereign ratings at s p global ratings its biggest strength is its spare capacity which gives it the ability to quickly react to changes in oil prices the imf in the october 2019 world economic outlook predicts saudi arabia s growth will pick up in 2020 as oil gdp stabilizes and solid momentum in the non oil sector continues the kingdom s de facto ruler crown prince mohammed bin salman nevertheless wants to shake off oil dependency and write a new chapter for the royal family and his subjects vision 2030 the prince s master plan encompasses a national strategy of economic diversification fiscal adjustment and foreign investment four years after the reforms began change is taking root while oil and oil products still account for 79 of exports non oil sector growth has increased year on year from 0 2 in 2016 to 2 9 in 2019 much of this growth however relies on state resources the kingdom s non oil economy is still highly dependent on public sector spending which in turn is sourced by petroleum revenues says broadman while the kingdom has been making admirable progress it remains caught in a multidimensional trap of heavy reliance on petroleum for national income fiscal revenues and exports fiscal consolidation by its conservative estimate the finance ministry expects the budget deficit to widen this year to almost 50 billion or 6 4 of gdp compared to 4 7 in 2019 analysts note that riyadh would need oil prices above 70 a barrel to balance its budge meanwhile the kingdom continues efforts to reduce public spending and boost state revenues saudi arabia s 2020 budget at 272 billion amounts to a 2 5 drop from 2019 s estimated actual spending of 279 billion in july 2019 riyadh announced a new public procurement law in an effort to streamline government spending reduce corruption expand opportunities for small business and inspire confidence the law seeks to allocate and manage financial resources effectively provides more transparency in all tenders and procurement procedures finance minister mohammed al jadaan said in a july 16 ministry press release other reforms include new taxes subsidy cuts a restructuring of public sector wages and frequent adjustments to gasoline water and electricity prices while it is too soon to judge the overall impact of these policies the first results are starting to show the introduction of a 5 value added tax in 2018 for example generated more revenue than expected and the imf is urging the government to raise it to 10 with economic transformation ahead saudi arabia s biggest companies are increasingly motivated to cut costs and improve efficiency in key sectors of the economy stakeholders are reorganizing their assets to better compete internationally and fund the national transition effort the kingdom s crown jewel saudi aramco is a prime example of this strategy last march it bought a 70 stake in sabic from the public investment fund pif the 69 1 billion megadeal was part of aramco s diversification strategy but it also injected new liquidity into the pif allowing it to fuel further development projects and create jobs this is a win win win transaction and a transformational deal for three of saudi arabia s most important economic entities said yasir al rumayyan managing director of the pif in a press release saudi has done a lot to remove red tape and create opportunities for stronger saudi companies to expand and consolidate their respective sectors says indranil ghosh ceo of tiger hill capital a london based investment management and advisory firm there has been a lot of activity in sectors like banking health care pharmacy chemicals food water management and education three of saudi arabia s most promising fintechs geidea paytabs unifonic founded in 2008 geidea is one of the pioneers of fintech in the kingdom the company provides cashless solutions including software and hardware such as payment terminals in 2018 abu dhabi based asset management firm gulf capital acquired 51 of geidea for more than 267 million this digital payment solution targets mainly smes it offers a customizable payment gateway and dashboard to businesses looking to develop their presence online founded in 2014 and headquartered in neighboring bahrain the company has offices in seven countries and processes over 160 currencies it raised 20 million dollars in 2017 the biggest funding round for a mena fintech at the time what started out as a mass service management system provider is now saudi arabia s biggest cloud communications company providing voice and messaging services to a wide range of customers the startup boasts over 5 000 corporate clients including uber aramex toyota samsung carrefour and hsbc in 2018 unifonic closed a 21 million funding round in series a led by saudi venture capital stv foreign investment wanted a population of 34 6 million with high consumer purchasing power makes saudi arabia a naturally attractive destination for global investors thus far the saudi market has been difficult to penetrate but with foreign investment now a new priority the kingdom is gradually opening up foreign direct investment fdi flows had already picked up in 2019 and there will be more foreign investment and foreign acquirers as the saudi market opens in an increasing number of sectors says ghosh between 2018 and 2019 five foreign banks including citigroup goldman sachs and sumitomo mitsui were allowed to enter saudi arabia several international lenders are on the waiting list to encourage fdi the authorities are introducing new competition franchise and bankruptcy laws last june the capital market authority cma relaxed restrictions on foreign ownership of listed saudi companies for the first time in decades international investors are permitted to acquire majority shares in key sectors of the economy such as telecommunications insurance and banking although a range of restrictions remain in place last year ftse and msci added the saudi stock exchange tadawul to their emerging market indexes the tadawul first opened to foreigners just five years ago last year s 25 6 billion ipo of saudi aramco also marked a milestone albeit with a lot of the investment flowing from neighboring countries it will do a lot for saudi s credibility as a home for transparent investable companies ghosh says promoting entrepreneurship saudi arabia is looking for entrepreneurs as well as investors today small and medium sized enterprises smes account for 97 of the kingdom s businesses the authorities want to increase smes contribution to gdp from their current 22 to 35 by 2030 to encourage business creation riyadh last april licensed more than 20 international venture capital firms to enter the market it has also set up two large funds of funds the 747 million saudi venture capital company and the 1 1 billion jada fund of funds the kingdom now provides all startups with a license allowing 100 ownership of their saudi entity at a cost of approximately 500 a year for five years to develop an ecosystem you need components such as capital talent and private and public sector support says ahmed aljabreen venture partner mena at 500 startups a silicon valley tech fund that entered the saudi market in 2017 and has made 20 investments thus far these components are all available in saudi arabia which is quite rare to find he adds i firmly believe that in a few years we will be seeing this ecosystem thriving honestly opportunities in such an early ecosystem are abundant you can practically look at every industry and see opportunities there sectors with the best growth prospects include fintech especially payments wealth management and transfer e commerce and transport the government is particularly keen on supporting innovation in financial services and has set a goal of increasing cashless transactions to 70 by 2030 to make this a reality the saudi arabian monetary authority sama the kingdom s central bank is adapting regulations to fit the fast pace of change induced by online banking and has created a regulatory sandbox for entrepreneurs to try out their ideas similarly the cma now operates a dedicated fintech lab with 12 unemployment among saudi nationals its lowest rate in more than three years saudi arabia hopes the new startup ecosystem can provide jobs for its fast growing and often restive youth population however fostering entrepreneurship in a country that has long lived off rents from its oil bounty is a tall order oil remains the backbone of the saudi economy but the regime is pushing reform and starting to see results the pace and success of transformation will depend on stakeholders dedication and on the geopolitical context regional turmoil could slow riyadh s progress toward realizing its ambitions with important spillover to other gulf countries alternatively a successful transformation in saudi arabia could send benefits rippling outward high hopes for saudi born

as china s economy struggles to recover from the damage of the coronavirus it may be in more danger from excessive stimulus measures than from the epidemic itself some experts say china s regulators have been trying to budge the stalled economy from its standstill with a barrage of liquidity measures relying more heavily on stimulus steps than at any time since the global financial crisis of 2008 2009 since january the people s bank of china pboc has been pumping funds into state banks through a variety of streams including reverse repurchase operations which allow temporary sales of securities with buyback commitments and medium term lending facilities with reduced rates for loans so far in february the pboc has channeled 1 7 trillion yuan u s 243 billion through the reverse repo agreements alone at the same time the government has pledged to extend more tax and fee cuts which totaled 2 3 trillion yuan u s 329 5 billion last year as well as 537 billion yuan u s 76 9 billion in targeted loan programs for small and medium sized enterprises on feb 9 the pboc pledged 300 billion u s 43 billion in loans to banks to support epidemic control on thursday the pboc lowered its one year loan prime rate from 4 15 percent to 4 05 percent last week the ministry of finance said it had also accelerated the issuance of 1 85 trillion yuan u s 265 billion in local government bonds in january new yuan denominated loans rose by a relatively restrained 3 4 percent from a year before to 3 34 trillion yuan u s 475 5 billion but the m2 measure of broad money supply jumped 8 4 percent it is difficult and perhaps pointless to tally the total of all these liquidity moves since the estimate seems likely to change before the ink is dry regulators are said to be planning another cut in the reserve requirement ratio rrr for banks among other stimulus solutions the central government will continually launch new supportive measures in terms of fiscal and tax policies said finance minister liu kun according to state media the same appears to be the case for central bank policies pumping up the economy but the mounting mass of stimulus measures has raised concerns about the rising cost of an economic recovery particularly since the communist party of china cpc is still sticking by its longstanding pledge to double the gross domestic product of 2010 by the end of this year how seriously does the government take the promise to double china s gdp on feb 17 the official english language china daily left little room for doubt achieving this year s economic growth related goals has become as important as containing the spread of the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak the paper s website said but pumping up the economy with more credit could raise financial risk and create further damage over a longer period the fear is worsening a debt burden that has spent the past two years campaigning to whittle down the wall street journal said some economists warn that the cost of pumping up a recovery to meet the doubling of gdp goal is too high the real economic damage won t come from the coronavirus but the stimulus that follows read a headline from china based financial news outlet caixin on a commentary by alicia garcia herrero chief asia pacific economist for the french investment bank natixis it seems clear to me that no effort will be spared to achieve a high enough growth target to achieve this goal garcia herrero wrote on the website bruegel org the bigger the shock now the larger the policy expansion will be needed to achieve the growth target the result may be an extension of china s economic crisis more debt for a highly indebted country like china can only mean lower potential growth down the road garcia herrero said president xi signaled his determination to meet economic targets despite the epidemic which is likely to decimate first quarter growth xi demanded resolute efforts from party committees and governments at all levels to win the people s war against the epidemic and urged them to strive to achieve this year s economic and social development goals and tasks the official xinhua news agency quoted him as saying at a meeting of the cpc politburo standing committee on feb 12 a man wearing a protective mask walks in front of an electronic display board in the lobby of the shanghai stock exchange building in shanghai china feb 14 2020 credit associated press more stimulus needed but economists say that more stimulus will be needed to stage a recovery from the current crisis than was the case with the sars virus in 2002 2003 because economic growth has weakened significantly since then if only people would grasp this point said derek scissors an asia economist and resident scholar at the american enterprise institute in washington even before the spread of the coronavirus contagion china s economic growth in 2019 recorded a 29 year low of 6 1 percent dropping sharply from 6 6 percent in 2018 the decline raised the stakes for stimulus measures to keep this year s growth from falling below 6 percent the minimum that was previously thought to be needed to reach the doubling gdp goal the government has already cut itself some statistical slack with an estimate that the goal can be reached with gdp growth of no less than 5 5 percent china daily said this week the lower estimate suggests that the national bureau of statistics nbs has found a way to declare that the decade of doubling requirement will be met despite the economic damage from the epidemic doubling gdp is just manipulating numbers policy s the thing scissors said but even the minimum growth of 5 5 percent this year may be beyond reach without rapid recovery and enormous stimulus this week moody s investors service slashed its forecast for 2020 growth from 5 8 percent to 5 2 percent according to a bloomberg economics estimate on monday china s economy was running at 40 to 50 percent of capacity during the previous week while the impact of the epidemic has only added to the challenge the threat of inflation may limit how far the stimulus can go january readings of the consumer price index cpi taken largely before the epidemic was widely reported rose 5 4 percent year on year topping the government s 3 percent target for 2019 for the fourth month in a row food prices soared 20 6 percent driven largely by pork which climbed 116 percent from a year before the report came as a reminder that the government was still grappling with its previous health crisis of african swine fever before the coronavirus became the focus of concern the government has been releasing supplies of frozen pork from its reserves to keep inflation in check but since the extent of the reserves has not been disclosed only the government knows how long this can go on unpredictable results the outcome for the economy may depend on whether decreased demand exceeds depressed production the results are unpredictable but the january cpi in virus stricken hubei province may provide a clue the province reported a 5 5 percent increase in consumer inflation slightly higher than the national figure despite government efforts to increase supplies scissors suggests that the recovery and its costs will be shaped by longer term policies the core chinese economic problem is sustained oversupply scissors said debt accumulation results from this as does labor and land misallocation and unnecessarily weak innovation the virus outbreak has depressed both consumption and production it s not clear if it will worsen oversupply but production oriented stimulus is china s standard response to shocks he said china s problem with food prices may be a temporary exception the price spike is a tentative sign of demand outpacing supply at least in a few areas shortages are certainly a problem but they are a short term problem the long term problem remains deflationary pressure scissors said copyright â 1998 2018 rfa published with the permission of

as china s economy struggles to recover from the damage of the coronavirus it may be in more danger from excessive stimulus measures than from the epidemic itself some experts say china s regulators have been trying to budge the stalled economy from its standstill with a barrage of liquidity measures relying more heavily on stimulus steps than at any time since the global financial crisis of 2008 2009 since january the people s bank of china pboc has been pumping funds into state banks through a variety of streams including reverse repurchase operations which allow temporary sales of securities with buyback commitments and medium term lending facilities with reduced rates for loans so far in february the pboc has channeled 1 7 trillion yuan u s 243 billion through the reverse repo agreements alone at the same time the government has pledged to extend more tax and fee cuts which totaled 2 3 trillion yuan u s 329 5 billion last year as well as 537 billion yuan u s 76 9 billion in targeted loan programs for small and medium sized enterprises on feb 9 the pboc pledged 300 billion u s 43 billion in loans to banks to support epidemic control on thursday the pboc lowered its one year loan prime rate from 4 15 percent to 4 05 percent last week the ministry of finance said it had also accelerated the issuance of 1 85 trillion yuan u s 265 billion in local government bonds in january new yuan denominated loans rose by a relatively restrained 3 4 percent from a year before to 3 34 trillion yuan u s 475 5 billion but the m2 measure of broad money supply jumped 8 4 percent it is difficult and perhaps pointless to tally the total of all these liquidity moves since the estimate seems likely to change before the ink is dry regulators are said to be planning another cut in the reserve requirement ratio rrr for banks among other stimulus solutions the central government will continually launch new supportive measures in terms of fiscal and tax policies said finance minister liu kun according to state media the same appears to be the case for central bank policies pumping up the economy but the mounting mass of stimulus measures has raised concerns about the rising cost of an economic recovery particularly since the communist party of china cpc is still sticking by its longstanding pledge to double the gross domestic product of 2010 by the end of this year how seriously does the government take the promise to double china s gdp on feb 17 the official english language china daily left little room for doubt achieving this year s economic growth related goals has become as important as containing the spread of the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak the paper s website said but pumping up the economy with more credit could raise financial risk and create further damage over a longer period the fear is worsening a debt burden that has spent the past two years campaigning to whittle down the wall street journal said some economists warn that the cost of pumping up a recovery to meet the doubling of gdp goal is too high the real economic damage won t come from the coronavirus but the stimulus that follows read a headline from china based financial news outlet caixin on a commentary by alicia garcia herrero chief asia pacific economist for the french investment bank natixis it seems clear to me that no effort will be spared to achieve a high enough growth target to achieve this goal garcia herrero wrote on the website bruegel org the bigger the shock now the larger the policy expansion will be needed to achieve the growth target the result may be an extension of china s economic crisis more debt for a highly indebted country like china can only mean lower potential growth down the road garcia herrero said president xi signaled his determination to meet economic targets despite the epidemic which is likely to decimate first quarter growth xi demanded resolute efforts from party committees and governments at all levels to win the people s war against the epidemic and urged them to strive to achieve this year s economic and social development goals and tasks the official xinhua news agency quoted him as saying at a meeting of the cpc politburo standing committee on feb 12 a man wearing a protective mask walks in front of an electronic display board in the lobby of the shanghai stock exchange building in shanghai china feb 14 2020 credit associated press more stimulus needed but economists say that more stimulus will be needed to stage a recovery from the current crisis than was the case with the sars virus in 2002 2003 because economic growth has weakened significantly since then if only people would grasp this point said derek scissors an asia economist and resident scholar at the american enterprise institute in washington even before the spread of the coronavirus contagion china s economic growth in 2019 recorded a 29 year low of 6 1 percent dropping sharply from 6 6 percent in 2018 the decline raised the stakes for stimulus measures to keep this year s growth from falling below 6 percent the minimum that was previously thought to be needed to reach the doubling gdp goal the government has already cut itself some statistical slack with an estimate that the goal can be reached with gdp growth of no less than 5 5 percent china daily said this week the lower estimate suggests that the national bureau of statistics nbs has found a way to declare that the decade of doubling requirement will be met despite the economic damage from the epidemic doubling gdp is just manipulating numbers policy s the thing scissors said but even the minimum growth of 5 5 percent this year may be beyond reach without rapid recovery and enormous stimulus this week moody s investors service slashed its forecast for 2020 growth from 5 8 percent to 5 2 percent according to a bloomberg economics estimate on monday china s economy was running at 40 to 50 percent of capacity during the previous week while the impact of the epidemic has only added to the challenge the threat of inflation may limit how far the stimulus can go january readings of the consumer price index cpi taken largely before the epidemic was widely reported rose 5 4 percent year on year topping the government s 3 percent target for 2019 for the fourth month in a row food prices soared 20 6 percent driven largely by pork which climbed 116 percent from a year before the report came as a reminder that the government was still grappling with its previous health crisis of african swine fever before the coronavirus became the focus of concern the government has been releasing supplies of frozen pork from its reserves to keep inflation in check but since the extent of the reserves has not been disclosed only the government knows how long this can go on unpredictable results the outcome for the economy may depend on whether decreased demand exceeds depressed production the results are unpredictable but the january cpi in virus stricken hubei province may provide a clue the province reported a 5 5 percent increase in consumer inflation slightly higher than the national figure despite government efforts to increase supplies scissors suggests that the recovery and its costs will be shaped by longer term policies the core chinese economic problem is sustained oversupply scissors said debt accumulation results from this as does labor and land misallocation and unnecessarily weak innovation the virus outbreak has depressed both consumption and production it s not clear if it will worsen oversupply but production oriented stimulus is china s standard response to shocks he said china s problem with food prices may be a temporary exception the price spike is a tentative sign of demand outpacing supply at least in a few areas shortages are certainly a problem but they are a short term problem the long term problem remains deflationary pressure scissors said copyright 1998 2018 rfa published with the permission of

of 2019 grupo financiero galicia has shown good result in a very challenging and volatile macro environment keeping liquidity solvency and profitability metrics at high levels we are now ready to answer the questions that you might have thank you questions and answers operator thank you we ll take our first question from alonso garcia of credit suisse alonso garcia credit suisse analyst good morning everyone and thank you for taking my question my first question is regarding your expectations for loan growth and deposit growth compared to your inflation expectations this year considering then the base of course is lower but also that the macroeconomic conditions in argentina remain uncertain for this year and my second question is on the inflation adjusted accounting that you re reporting this year what sort of roe level do you expect for 2020 and what do you think i know it s hard but what do you think would be a reasonable and sustainable roe under this inflation accounting thank you pablo firvida investor relations officer okay hi alonso in terms of the loan growth in this environment of lower interest rate and also we re forecasting some recovery in gdp toward the second half of the year and as you said coming from very low starting levels we are forecasting loans growing around 10 percentage points of our inflation so with an inflation of 40 that is our current number the loans could end up growing around 50 this year deposits sometimes lower perhaps inflation plus 5 in that order when we speak about that was the first question when we speak about the inflation adjustment we informed in the press release in the last page that the what would have been the net worth and the net income of 2019 if inflation adjustment was applied that number makes the roe at around 20 to 21 in real terms it s important to see that the nominal roe was around 56 the inflation was around 53 8 so really the real roe has nothing to do with the difference between nominal and inflation for next year depending on the inflation and also the monthly inflation because it s very sensitive on each month we could be thinking in lower nominal roe and somewhat lower real roe but really the adjustment is very difficult to forecast mainly considering this volatility in the monthly readings alonso garcia credit suisse analyst very clear thank you very much pablo firvida investor relations officer you re welcome operator thank you we ll now move to our next question from carlos gomez of hsbc carlos gomez hsbc analyst hi good morning i wanted to ask you about the measures to limit credit card interest rate and the offsetting reduction in reserve requirements that you experienced do you have a preliminary calculation as to the impact that this might have on your result and second i would like to know what do you expect your tax rate to be for this year and whether you can confirm that it should be a tax on the inflation adjusted earnings thank you pablo firvida investor relations officer hi carlos the regulation that came the day before yesterday at night they put a cut for financing with interest before with credit cards the cap is 55 that can be compared with around 75 that was the previous number but i asked the it was a formula that took asset base the average cost of personal loans and that rate was coming down already really the number we should be comparing with is around 71 and now 55 of course that has a negative impact but when we take into account the less reserve requirement we have to have a non remunerated that leaves an equivalent amount in deposits it s really a percentage of the consumption of a program called but really this improvement in reserve requirement or the yields in this reserve requirement is kind of offsetting the reduction in interest rate perhaps something marginally negative but really we can assume it s almost equal carlos gomez hsbc analyst okay that s helpful in terms of credit cards what would what happens to tarjeta naranja the regulation of the price would be the personal loans plus 25 and therefore it would be 71 up pablo firvida investor relations officer this change doesn t apply in non bank credit cards so now yes the gap will be the former one up to 1 25 times the weighted average cost of personal loans in the system with some technicality is that some public sector banks are not included in that number but basically net asset is not affected by this cap in terms of income tax the effective tax will be or the nominal income tax rate will be 30 it was to be reduced to 25 but there was a loan that gets in the same level at 30 and we calculate the income tax considering inflation adjustment carlos gomez hsbc analyst thank you thank you very much pablo firvida investor relations officer you re welcome carlos operator thank you we have another question comes from brian flores of citi brian flores citi analyst hi thank you for the opportunity to ask the question we saw some deterioration on your npls and i was wondering if you are guiding for any figure for 2020 and what are the drivers behind your guidance thank you pablo firvida investor relations officer okay hi brian we saw an increase in npls this quarter mainly at the bank level from 4 to the coverage is at 110 healthy we saw an improvement in npls in the level of naranja this quarter had the particularity of one commercial case white products retailer in which we had to provision ars1 billion without that npls would have been i would say similar and also the cost of risk while the cost of risk instead of being 5 1 closer to 3 9 so going forward with this forecasted growth in loans plus a recovery in the economy sequentially in the second quarter npls to be improving and toward the end of the year this 4 4 that i was mentioning should be compared with around 3 8 brian flores citi analyst very clear thank you pablo firvida investor relations officer you re welcome operator thank you we ll move to our next question it is coming from ernesto gabilondo of bank of america ernesto gabilondo bank of america analyst hi good morning pablo thanks for the opportunity to make questions a follow up in the interest rate cap on credit cards how much is the average interest rate of your credit card portfolio and what do you think will be the reduction from the one that you re charging to the one that the central bank is proposing thank you pablo firvida investor relations officer when you look at the stock of loans related to credit cards in december it was around ars95 6 billion but that includes everything from the float or a lot of financing with no interest lending with installments also a rural credit card that we have so really out of that the amount is subject to financing with this card interest rate that was reduced was something lower than ars10 billion ars9 point something billion the reduction as i said was something between or will be actually because it will begin in march from levels of 71 to 55 and we will be offsetting that with a higher yield on part of the reserve requirement that now we don t have to constitute or we will not have a zero yield ernesto gabilondo bank of america analyst okay perfect understood thank you very much pablo firvida investor relations officer you re welcome ernesto operator and our next question comes from santiago petri of franklin santiago petri franklin analyst hello pablo hi good afternoon the question is related to financial margin could you please split what will be the net interest margin from this consolidated financial margin and how do you see this net interest margin and financial margin going into 2020 with all the attention on the central bank to reduce rates thank you pablo firvida investor relations officer hi santiago when we speak about the nim we see some compression going forward that will be offset with this volume increase when we speak about nims of 20 the breakdown is something around 28 in pesos and 2 in dollars so the breakdown between pesos and dollars it s important also this gap between or the evolution or the different evolution between leliq and badlar lately leliq was going down faster than badlar but putting everything together with a 100 basis point reduction in nims we would need around 5 growth in loans in order to offset that really in a lower industry rate environment typically margins compress but volumes rebound and the sustainability and the needs of the financial system for the medium term santiago petri franklin analyst okay thanks

2019 financial performance and provide our 2020 sales and earnings outlook and then we ll open up the call for questions we are pleased with our fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results as we delivered comparable store sales growth adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per share that all exceeded our expectations total fourth quarter sales increased 20 7 to a record 527 million from 436 7 million last year for the full year our total sales increased 19 6 from last year to a record 2 billion which is almost triple our 2015 sales of 784 million moving on to earnings we reported fourth quarter fiscal 2019 gaap diluted earnings per share of 0 34 a 100 increase from 0 17 in the fourth quarter of 2018 our fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 30 to 0 26 from 0 20 in the fourth quarter of 2018 exceeding our expectations of 0 20 to 0 21 per share for the full year we reported gaap diluted earnings per share of 1 44 up 29 7 from 1 11 per share in 2018 our full year fiscal 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 18 6 to 1 15 from 0 97 per share in 2018 we are pleased to be able to report that our full year adjusted fiscal 2019 earnings per share exceeded our initial 2019 guidance of 1 07 to 1 12 which we think is a great result considering the long term scalable growth investments that we continue to make over the fiscal year as well as difficulty presented as we were forced to navigate a challenging trade environment and macroeconomic headwinds in the first half of 2019 let me now discuss some of the drivers of our fourth quarter and full year 2019 sales and earnings growth and how we are thinking about 2020 as a reminder the pillars to achieving our long term sales and earnings growth targets are one opening large warehouse stores in new and existing markets two growing our comparable store sales three expanding our connected customer experience and four investing in our pro and commercial customers additionally we are introducing a fifth pillar investing in free design services let me now discuss some of the progress we are making on each of these strategic growth initiatives first opening new large warehouse stores we opened seven new stores in the fourth quarter of 2019 bringing the total number of warehouse stores that we operate to 120 stores up 20 from the 100 warehouse stores in 2018 we continue to believe that we have a unique store model in the retail industry as we have been able to successfully grow our store base at a 20 compounded annual growth rate over the last seven years at a time of significant industry consolidation as we look to the first quarter of 2020 we expect to open five new warehouse stores one of which opened january 13 in la quinta california later this month we ll open a store in sacramento california the remaining planned store openings are expected to be in the mid to late march for the full year we expect to open 24 new warehouse stores with 40 of those openings in new markets and 60 in existing markets which is the same percentage mix that we opened in 2019 additionally we expect to open a small 12 000 square foot design studio in dallas texas the design studio represents a test for us where we will see an opportunity to increase our market share in densely populated higher income areas where we re not able to fit a large format store our research tells us that these are mostly new untapped customers beyond 2020 we remain excited about the strong pipeline of new stores that we have lined up which we believe will allow us to sustain 20 unit growth over the next several years with that in mind i want to thank our real estate construction visual merchandising and operating teams for their excellent execution in 2019 moving on to our second pillar growing comparable store sales our fourth quarter fiscal 2019 comparable store sales grew 5 2 which was slightly above the top end of our guidance of 4 to 5 growth when we exclude the impact of new store cannibalization we are pleased that our fourth quarter comparable store sales increased in the low double digit range from last year this increase in our fourth quarter comparable store sales reflected a good balance between 2 8 growth in comparable store transactions and 2 3 growth in our comparable stores average ticket we were also pleased to see our comparable stores transaction growth accelerated to 2 8 from 1 8 growth in the third quarter of 2019 for the full year our 2019 comparable store sales increased 4 and increased 6 2 we exclude the houston market excluding new store cannibalization and the houston market our comparable store sales grew in the low double digit range for fiscal 2019 a very healthy rate and these comparable store sales accelerated in the second half of 2019 the increase in our comparable store sales in fiscal 2019 was driven by 1 9 growth in comparable store transactions and 2 1 growth in comparable stores average tickets we are pleased with our comparable store sales exit growth rate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and with the start of fiscal 2020 as trevor will discuss we are forecasting stronger annual comparable store sales and total sales growth in 2020 when compared to 2019 turning to our sales performance within some of our merchandising categories for the fourth quarter among our six merchandising categories four experienced comparable store sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2019 consistent with prior quarters our strongest total and comparable store sales growth continues to come from our laminate and rigid core luxury vinyl plant category where we have an industry leading assortment fourth quarter total sales in the category increased 36 7 to 120 4 million and accounted for 22 8 of our sales up 260 basis points from 20 2 last year to build on this growth in january we launched our new exclusive new core performance flooring which we believe is the most durable scratch dent and pet proof resistant rigid core vinyl flooring in the market new core performance is at our best price point and is another example of how we are driving value and sustained growth through our innovation strategies we are so confident in the product that it comes with a lifetime residential and 15 year commercial warranty as we discussed throughout 2019 we put a lot of emphasis around growing our installation accessory sales we implemented a new incremental bonus program for our store associates laid out the department in a more logical fashion brought in new compelling products and focused on training all of which paid off in 2019 the category was our second best comping category for the year and fourth quarter we estimate this is an area where we are underpenetrated relative to the market and believe that as a one stop destination for hard surface flooring we can make further enhancements to increase our market share moving on to decorative accessories where we experienced a marked acceleration in our fourth quarter sales from the third quarter of 2019 total sales grew 25 5 to 101 5 million and accounted for 19 3 of sales up 80 basis points from last year the category is benefiting from the successful execution of our 2019 merchandise reset which included new trend forward stock keeping units that customers expect from us we expect to build on this growth in 2020 as we add additional trend forward stock keeping unit fourth quarter comparable store sales in our wood and tile categories were below last year as we discussed in our third quarter 2019 earnings conference call we are working through some near term product transition challenges in tile our largest category as we diversify our countries of origin this transition has led to some near term merchandising out of stocks in this important category which we are correcting we expect our merchandise in stock rates to return to normal over the next several months in wood we will be updating our assortments to be more trend forward and will further improve our job lot in stock positions which we believe will improve our performance we are continuing to build on our successful strategies to drive incremental growth by adding adjacent merchandising categories in store and online this includes vanities and vanity tops bath accessories custom countertops syncs and shower doors for example we now have bathroom vanities in 32 stores or 27 of the store base at year end we expect them to be in all stores in 2020 we are pleased with the early results and we ll continue to build out our trend forward assortments with exclusive styles and delivery options while we will always be a hard surface flooring retailer and our adjacent merchandise programs are currently small in isolation that represent incremental scalable adjacent growth opportunities and help us meet the demand we see from our pro and diy customers across all merchandising categories we continue to see the strongest growth at the better and best price points and are pleased with our merchandise margin expanding the connected customer experience is our third pillar of growth we continue to see robust growth in both traffic and conversion from our successful connected customer strategies in the fourth quarter our e commerce sales accelerated to 66 growth from 54 growth in the third quarter of 2019 as a result our e commerce sales accounted for 11 4 of our fourth quarter sales up 310 basis points from 8 3 last year for the full year our e commerce sales increased 61 2 and accounted for 10 1 of our sales up 250 basis points from 7 6 in 2018 we believe that our growth in e commerce sales is the direct result of strategies we have implemented to inspire and educate through our website we have also aligned the sales process with our stores so that we can make the consumer purchase journey simpler more streamlined and more engaging while removing friction from the purchase process a few recent enhancements include adding measurement calculators for square footage motor sealant and moldings making it easier to determine the materials needed for a flooring project a room visualizer which is personalized by room experience and integrated with our shopping cart to tender project online while it s too early to measure the visualizer s potential impact we are excited about how it will enable us to customize content and product and we believe it s best in the in end in 2020 we intend to build on these strategies to make further performance improvements to our website and further harness data to determine where the customer is in the purchase decision that said our stores remain key to executing our e commerce strategy as we continue to see approximately 85 of our web orders picked up in the store when combined with our brick and mortar attributes like unique in stock products at everyday low prices large visually appealing stores free design services and knowledgeable sales associates to help we believe our overall brand experience is hard to match this is validated by our 2019 market research which shows 77 of consumers who shop at floor decor ultimately purchased from us our fourth pillar of growth comes from investing holistically in our pro and commercial customers as we have discussed in the past investing in our pro customers to drive loyalty and brand advocacy is a strategic priority of ours as we look to increase our share of wallet with our existing pros as well as engage with pros that do not currently shop with us it all starts with the local store that serves our pros and is enhanced with important enablers which include our pro premier points based rewards program our pro partner services and our pro app we build on these offerings with the launch of our pro private label credit card in 2020 collectively all of our programs are important touchpoints with our pros that will enable us to drive personalized engagement through our crm platform in 2020 and beyond we are also making important investments in our commercial team where our market share is still very minor but growing nicely let me speak to how each of these are contributing to growth first our pro premier rewards program which launched companywide in the third quarter of 2018 continued to experience robust growth we had exceptional enrollment growth in 2019 and saw strong year over year growth in average earned and redeemed points our pro premier members say they spend an average of 10 more after signing up with the program to add further context the average pro premier rewards members spend three times more than a nonmember so we will continue to build on the program s growth by increasing awareness of its benefits and driving engagement in 2020 we continue to be pleased with the growth in the number of pros that are using our program which was launched in 2018 we recently launched a schedule pickup check in feature on the app that could be one of the most utilized features of the app we had over 40 000 pros download the pro app in 2019 and we expect app usage to continue to grow as we continue to build out our awareness features and functionality we are leveraging our crm investments in pro across all customers and have obtained a wealth of data about our customers such as average spend length of time between shopping visits when and how customers buy installation accessories and much more for both diy and pro customers we can now place both pro and diy customers in deciles to better understand their spend identify opportunities as well as focus on our best customers and find lost customers to see if we can get them back while we are in our infancy with crm in the fourth quarter we ran our first campaign to drive higher pro engagement and sales using incremental points and the results were compelling at a higher roi we are just getting started but are very confident in the intelligence we are gathering so that we can improve our knowledge of our customers and how to serve them better separately we continue to build out our commercial sales infrastructure with regional account managers or rams these are professional sales associates that reside outside our stores with the sole focus to sell to commercial clients by leveraging our incredible assortment supply chain and large stores we ended 2019 with 13 rams and have plans to add about eight more in 2020 in strategic locations these investments are very accretive as there is no capex or working capital investments and builds off of the store and dc infrastructure already in place while our commercial sales remain small in isolation relative to our total sales we were pleased that the segment s 50 sales growth exceeded our internal plan and continues to far exceed our total sales growth lastly we re calling out separately a new fifth pillar of growth which is our free design service offering we are seeing significant traction in several important engagement metrics including growth in the number of design appointments growth in average ticket and conversion rates we are delighted to see that we had almost 150 000 appointments in 2019 and experienced a significant increase in conversion in 2019 when compared with 2018 the improvement is the direct result of growing the number of designers in our stores while at the same time providing them with the tools measurement goals and processes they need to be successful as we have discussed in the past when a designer is involved our conversion rate is much higher our average ticket is three to four times greater than the company average our gross margin rate is higher and our customer satisfaction scores are higher we intend to build on this growth by testing in home design consultation in 2020 i will now turn my comments to how we are thinking about the macro environment and geopolitical factors that affect our industry and the company let me first discuss that we are taking precautionary measures for our associates in china as they and the country managed through the coronavirus outbreak first we asked our associates in our asia sourcing office to minimize any travel by working from home after they return from the chinese lunar new year second we suspended associate travel to and from china and southeast asia in february and march finally we do anticipate that the travel restrictions imposed by the chinese government and overall concerns about the spread of the virus will likely lead to some production delays as a result our asia sourcing office is regularly following up with all of our suppliers to better understand their production schedules and any potential delays we believe our inventory receipt flow leaves us in a good position to manage any near term supply chain disruption that said this is a fluid event that we like many others are monitoring closely moving on to the impacts of tariffs as many of you know on november 7 2019 the u s trade representative ustr made a ruling to retroactively exclude certain flooring products imported from china from the section 301 tariffs that were implemented at 10 beginning in september 2018 and increased to 25 in june 2019 in addition on november 20 2019 u s customs issued chapter 99 exclusions for each unique article number identified under the november 7 2019 ustr ruling the granted exclusions apply to certain click vinyl and engineered products that we have sold and continue to sell all of these exclusions were granted retroactively we are entitled to a refund from the u s customs and border protection for the applicable section 301 tariffs previously paid on these goods while tariff refund claims are subject to the approval of the u s customs we currently expect to recover approximately 19 3 million related to the section 301 tariff payments in 2020 we like many others are pleased that the decline in mortgage rate interest rates and continued economic growth has served to reverse the slide in year over year existing home sales one of the macroeconomic metrics along with home price appreciation and age of housing stock that impact our industry as many of you know existing home sales began to reverse their year over year decline in july of 2019 and were up 10 8 in december of 2019 albeit against a 10 1 decline in december 2018 we have also been encouraged that home prices have continued to show modest appreciation finally the median age of owner occupied homes is currently 40 years which supports home improvement spending to repair and improve the aesthetics of homes so we believe we are entering 2020 with a more favorable economic backdrop when compared to the beginning of 2019 that said we watch many housing metrics but rely mostly on our company specific growth drivers which we believe will lead to mid single to high single digit comparable store sales growth over the long term as we think about 2020 and beyond we continue to believe that we will grow our market share in hard surface flooring through our ongoing innovation strategies and by offering consumers easy affordable and updated stylish flooring solutions and services before i turn the call over to trevor i would like to say how excited we were to announce the promotion of lisa laube president of floor decor as many of you know lisa is a terrific leader who has been instrumental in the company s success since joining in early 2012 and her influence can be seen throughout our company as part of the change we also announced new multiyear employment agreements with me and our executive leadership team which further demonstrates our commitment to the company to support the next chapter of the company s aggressive long term growth strategy we are also further aligning our executive compensation philosophy with our long term vision and intend to tie more of our executives compensation to the achievement of our long term corporate financial performance objectives which we expect to discuss in greater detail in our annual proxy statement let me close by saying that we believe our fiscal 2019 results continue to validate the strength of our value proposition in the hard surface flooring industry i would like to thank all of our associates for their hard work and their exceptional service to our customers i ll now turn the call over to trevor to discuss more of the details of our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2019 results and our 2020 sales and earnings growth outlook trevor lang executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks tom i m going to concentrate my comments on some of the changes among the major line items in our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter income statement balance sheet and statement of cash flows and then discuss our outlook for 2020 tom already discussed our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2019 sales results so i will start with our fourth quarter and full year gross margin results our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter gross margin rate expanded 220 basis points to 43 6 from 41 4 in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to our 14 million or 270 basis points in expected section 301 tariff refunds primarily related to rigid core vinyl tariffs that we have paid since september of 2018 as disclosed in more detail in our 10 k 3 million or 0 02 per share of the 14 million benefited our gross margin starting on november 20 the date which u s customs lowered the tariff rate from 25 to 0 this was obviously not contemplated when we gave our guidance in early november the remaining 11 million was for periods from september 2018 through november 20 2019 and we have backed this out of our adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the earnings release as it is unique immaterial and the majority of this benefit does not relate to our fourth quarter results the favorable tariff refund benefit was partially offset by higher distribution costs of approximately 4 million worth approximately 30 basis points due to the opening of our new baltimore distribution center our supply chain did an incredible job again opening this new 1 5 million square foot distribution center and is operating fantastically in the short term that it has been opened this is just one more example of the significant investments that we are making to support our long term sales and earnings growth this new facility expands our distribution center capacity by 50 and will serve about one third of our store base importantly it should allow us to replenish one third of our stores faster and at a lower domestic transportation cost for a long period of time before i move on to expenses let me provide some more detail about how the section 301 tariff recoveries or refund payments are impacting our balance sheet and income statement from a balance sheet perspective and subject to the approval of u s customs we expect to recover 19 300 million related to section 301 tariff refund payments within the next 12 months as of december 26 2019 our balance sheet receivables include this expected recovery from u s customs and border protection from an income statement perspective in the fourth quarter of 2019 we recognized a benefit of 14 300 000 14 million as a reduction of cost of sales as previously discussed as well as 300 000 as a reduction of interest expense additionally we reduced our year end inventory on hand by 5 million which is reflected as a reduction in our balance sheet inventory as we look to 2020 we plan to reinvest the remaining 5 million in cost on hand inventory toward driving market share turning to our fourth quarter 2019 expenses our fourth quarter selling and store operating expenses increased 24 1 to 147 900 million from 119 100 million last year and deleveraged 80 basis points the deleverage is entirely from our new store growth as our comping stores obtained nice leverage in the fourth quarter as we have discussed in prior quarters our new store selling and operating expenses as a percentage of sales are approximately 50 higher than our stores opened greater than a year which results in near term operating expense deleverage that said we are pleased that our comparable store selling and administrative expenses leveraged approximately 50 basis points in the fourth quarter as we leveraged all major expense items on increasing sales our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter general and administrative expenses increased 12 2 to 34 million from 30 300 million last year and leveraged 40 basis points to 6 5 from 6 9 last year the improved leverage came mostly from comparing against the 5 800 million lease impairment charge we took in 2018 related to the exit of our miami distribution center included in our 2019 fourth quarter general and administrative expenses are the final cost related to relocation to our new store support center including lease termination costs and minor costs related to the closure of our former miami distribution center in total the store support center and miami distribution center exit costs were 2 400 million compared with 5 800 million last year excluding these costs our fourth quarter general and administrative expense ratio deleveraged 40 basis points to 6 from 5 6 in the fourth quarter of last year primarily from higher depreciation and occupancy costs related to our new store support center which we will leverage over time as we grow our fourth quarter pre opening expenses declined 27 1 to 6 million from 8 300 million last year and leveraged 80 basis points on a year over year basis favorable pre opening expense leverage is primarily due to an enhanced store opening process which shortens the period of time it takes to open new stores thereby lessening pre occupancy costs we opened seven stores in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to five stores opened and one relocation in 2018 among the new store opening three were new markets and four were in existing markets in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to three in new markets and two in existing markets in 2018 fourth quarter net interest expense declined 40 4 to 1 700 million from 2 800 million last year on lower average debt compared with last year and interest income earned during the quarter related to tariff recoveries and excess cash on hand our fourth quarter tax provision was 5 100 million compared to 2 600 million last year and flat on a year over year on a rate basis our lower tax rate continues to be primarily due to the recognition of higher excess tax benefits related to stock options turning to our growth and profitability our fourth quarter fiscal 2019 adjusted ebitda margin rate increased 100 basis points to 11 2 from 10 2 last year primarily due to the improvement in our gross margin rate the 220 basis point increase in gross margin rate coupled with a 20 7 total sales growth led to our adjusted ebitda growing 32 1 to 58 800 million from 44 500 million last year and exceeded our guidance of 52 100 million to 54 million our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter gaap net income increased 97 4 to 35 300 million from 17 900 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 our gaap diluted earnings per share increased 100 to 0 34 from 0 17 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 our non gaap fourth quarter adjusted net income increased 29 5 to 27 million from 20 800 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 30 to 0 26 from 0 20 in fiscal 2018 exceeding our guidance of 0 20 to 0 21 per share we ended the fourth quarter with 105 400 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding compared with 103 800 million last year moving on to our fiscal 2019 balance sheet and cash flow in fiscal 2019 our total net inventory grew 110 900 million or 24 to 581 900 million from 471 million last year excluding the inventory required to support our new distribution center in baltimore our total inventory would have increased only 14 comparing favorably with our total sales growth of 19 6 our comparable store inventory increased only 3 4 from last year as discussed on the last call we have some opportunities in the wood and tile business to improve in stocks our in stock position has improved since the end of last year and assuming no significant shipping issues due to the coronavirus we believe our in stock will improve in the second quarter we are pleased that we generated 204 700 million in operating cash flow in fiscal 2019 which exceeded our required growth capital of 196 million we remain in a very strong financial position as of december 26 2019 we had 306 500 million and unrestricted liquidity consisting of 27 million in cash and cash equivalents and 279 500 million immediately available under borrowing under our abl facilities moving on to capital expenditure allocation our fiscal 2019 capital expenditures increased 29 5 to 196 million from 151 400 million in 2018 slightly below our recent guidance of 203 million to 213 million the growth is primarily related to the increase in new stores opened or were under construction during fiscal 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal 2018 we also opened our new baltimore dc and invested in our new store support center for fiscal 2019 approximately 62 of our capital expenditures were for new stores 20 were for information technology e commerce investments and our new store support center relocation the remainder of our existing capex was for store remodels and distribution center investments as we look to fiscal 2020 our total capital expenditures are planned to be between 255 million to 265 million and are expected to be funded primarily by cash flow generated from operations under our borrowings under our abl facility more specifically we intend to make the following capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 the growth in our capital spending reflects the planned opening of 24 new warehouse stores in fiscal 2020 which represents another 20 unit growth year for us additionally we plan to start construction on 12 warehouse stores that are expected to open in the early part of fiscal 2021 compared with nine warehouse stores in fiscal 2020 we did make the strategic decision to take on more of the new construction cost in 2020 to improve the timing of our store openings and lower our rent costs capital expenditures associated with these projects are expected to be approximately 188 million to 194 million in fiscal 2020 we also will invest more in existing store remodeling projects and distribution centers in fiscal 2020 using approximately 50 million to 52 million of cash we plan to invest in our information technology infrastructure e commerce and other store support center initiatives using approximately 17 million to 19 million of cash now turning to our fiscal 2020 annual sales and earnings guidance as a reminder 2020 will be a 53rd week and my discussion will be on a comparable 52 to 52 week basis as you saw in our earnings release we are moving to annual sales and earnings guidance which is more closely aligned with industry practices as many other companies we believe this change will give us more flexibility to manage our business throughout the year toward our long term goals let me now discuss some of the details of our fiscal 2020 outlook we expect net sales for fiscal 2020 to be in the range of 2 450 billion to 2 475 billion or increased 20 to 21 in fiscal 2019 this would be greater than 19 6 growth we reported in fiscal 2019 our outlook is based on various assumptions including opening 24 new warehouse stores comparable store sales growth of 5 5 to 6 5 versus 4 growth in 2019 our plan assumes fiscal 2020 comparable store sales are fairly consistent throughout 2020 moving on to how we re thinking about fiscal 2020 gross margins expenses and adjusted ebitda even with taking on the cost to increase our distribution center capacity by 50 with our new baltimore distribution center opened in november 2019 we are planning on gross margin to be flat to up 10 basis points if you remove the 14 million benefit from our fourth quarter 2019 due to expected tariff refunds previously discussed we are planning on improving gross margins by 70 to 80 basis points for fiscal 2020 on a quarterly and gaap basis gross margin is planned to improve sequentially relative to the same quarter last year throughout the first three quarters of 2020 due to improved product gross margins and reversing tariffs from 2019 and as we begin to leverage our new baltimore distribution center the first quarter gross margin will start out with minimal improvement due primarily to the new baltimore dc being opened this year and not being opened last year the fourth quarter of 2020 gross margin is planned down entirely due to the 14 million tariff refund received in the fourth quarter of 2019 on the expense side we plan to modestly deleverage due entirely to new stores as it relates to selling and store operating expenses we have also made the decision to invest more into store employees including investments in our commercial sales teams and we ve decided on to take on more of the rising cost of healthcare we believe these are good long term investments in our people the opening expenses are planned to deleverage 20 basis points to almost entirely due to opening more new stores earlier in 2021 thereby we expect to take more of the pre opening expenses for those stores in 2020 versus 2021 most of this deleverage will come in the fourth quarter of 2020 the first quarter of 2020 pre opening expenses are planned to increase about 50 due to the planned opening of five new stores in q1 2020 versus three new stores in the first quarter of 2019 opening new stores more equally throughout the year has been a long term goal for us and this should benefit us in fiscal 2021 we are planning on general and administrative expenses staying around 6 throughout 2020 2020 interest expense is planned to decline about 30 from 2019 due to capitalizing interest on capital expenditures as well as a lower cost of debt on our recent debt amendment announced on wednesday we expect our adjusted ebitda to grow 23 to 27 in 2020 to approximately 300 million to 308 million we look forward to continued expansion in our adjusted ebitda margin rate to 12 to 12 4 in 2020 from 11 9 in 2019 and 11 2 in 2018 importantly we continue to see a path toward increasing our ebitda margin rate to the low teen range over the immediate term and growing it 15 to 30 basis points thereafter toward our long term target of mid teens fiscal 2020 diluted earnings per share are expected to be 1 31 to 1 37 excluding the 53rd week diluted weighted average shares is estimated to be approximately 106 million and our fiscal 2020 tax rate is estimated to be 23 3 as outlined in our earnings press release today fiscal 2020 is a 53 week for us we estimate the incremental sales associated with this additional week to be worth 34 million to 35 million and the incremental diluted earnings per share to be approximately 0 03 to 0 04 we are planning on strong sales and profit growth again in 2020 looking beyond 2020 if we assume today s favorable macroeconomic backdrop as modest growth remains intact and there are no exogenous events like unfavorable trade policies we believe our fiscal 2021 sales and profit should grow at a faster rate than 2020 as we leverage important investments like our new baltimore dc and store support center in closing i would just like to say that our entire leadership team is proud of how we performed in 2019 and we look forward to fiscal 2020 we believe our best days lie ahead of us i would like to personally thank all of our associates for the great work they re doing every day to democratize hard surface flooring while serving their colleagues and all of our customers we would now like to turn the call over to questions questions answers operator our first question comes from the line christopher horvers with jp morgan please proceed with your question christopher horvers j p morgan analyst thanks good evening everybody so i wanted to ask about how do you think about the comp drivers in 2020 there s a bunch of factors to consider on the inside there so market growth cannibalization relative to last year how are you thinking about the lagged acceleration off the accelerated existing home sales and then just the overall sort of impact of pricing now that there is this tariff relief and then ultimately as a follow up to that how are you thinking about the cadence of comp over the year trevor lang executive vice president and chief financial officer ok i m going to try and tackle this chris if i don t catch em all please just reiterate it i think as we said we are expecting a better macro backdrop here we ve had six months of existing home sales improving interest rates are at a very low rate housing stock is as tom mentioned a lot of the housing stock over 40 years old we re now beyond two years away from houston a number of initiatives that tom laid out give us a lot of comfort around what went on the business and we feel really good about the products we ve got a few headwinds with some of our in stocks but we re working through that feel good about where we re going to be as we end this quarter and come into q2 so with that as we mentioned in the prepared comments we feel like the comps will be fairly consistent throughout this year christopher horvers j p morgan analyst so i guess if you think about that so maybe focusing on the lagged impact of the existing home sales one would think that as you get into the second and third quarter especially in line with the improvement in the thailand stock that one would think that perhaps comps should accelerate in those quarters but on the other hand you have the relief on the tariffs so are you essentially assuming that they offset themselves or how are you thinking about that trevor lang executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think we do a very bottoms up approach we also have to look at new stores that are coming on stores that are getting cannibalized stores that are getting coming off being cannibalized we think about what is landing from an assortment perspective initiatives we ve got in the pro and the designer and the omnichannel experience that we re executing i mean all of those detailed factors go into the plan i think your instincts are right on the refund of the tariffs we generally lower prices when we can and lisa and the team have done a very thoughtful analysis of what s going on in the market and we want to keep that price leadership position so i think your thoughts are right there that we re going to keep our everyday low price strategy and stay below the competition and i think as we anniversary the second half of next year the other issue is we had some increase in comps we talked about 80 basis points in q3 of this last year a bigger number than that in q4 that we just finished because we had to raise some prices because of tariffs and so we re up against those as we come into the second half of next year as well christopher horvers j p morgan analyst gotcha and then my follow up is on the gross margin what was the adjusted ex the nonoperating charges gross margin because you mentioned you had the 4 million for the supply to dc but then you had the 3 million that sort of roughly offsets it and it looks like the adjusted gross margin was up 130 so could you help us reconcile that trevor lang executive vice president and chief financial officer sure the way i think about it chris is the 14 million really benefit to the p l in the fourth quarter relates to that tariff refund and as i mentioned earlier is the way we looked at it was on november 20 is the date that u s customs lowered the rate from 25 to zero so from that period to the end of the year our margin was higher just because we and nobody else changed our retails that quick so that was roughly 0 02 a share or in the quarter worth 270 basis points of benefit to gross margin if you think about the distribution center expenses that in and of itself was probably about 50 basis points but we re going to have that for the rest of our lives so we ll start to get leverage out of it but the way i like to think about it is the benefit of the 14 million the 3 million that was november 20 on plus the 11 million before that was worth 270 basis points that was kind of unnatural and drove our gross margin rate up christopher horvers j p morgan analyst understood thanks very much tom taylor chief executive officer thanks chris trevor lang executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks chris operator our next question comes from the line of steven forbes with guggenheim securities please proceed with your question steven forbes guggenheim securities analyst good afternoon maybe just starting with a quick follow up on the gross margin question for the fourth quarter right because i think if you back out that 270 basis point tailwind it would imply that gross margin was down again makes sense given the baltimore distribution center but can you comment about the product margins during the quarter because i thought you said you were satisfied with them but where were product margins and are you still getting that good better best trade up tailwind trevor lang executive vice president and chief financial officer i ll take a quick and lisa and tom may want to weigh in the thing you have to remember mostly about the fourth quarter based on inventory turn is those tariffs went from 10 to 25 in june of last year and based on inventory turning just over two times a year we had the full brunt of those tariffs going from 10 to 25 so we had plan for that in our margins our margin actually came in better than we had guided based on the guidance we gave and really there was two pieces that drove our margins to be better about equal the first one was our overall product margins and rebates ended up coming in stronger at the end of the year and then the supply chain team did a good job and the overall distribution center expenses were probably some portion of 1 4 million better than we had planned for so relative to the guidance we gave we had a beat if you think about the overall beat for the quarter 0 02 as i mentioned was the tariffs that nobody was expecting and then we had another 0 02 associated with better product margins as i said both product margins and supply chain and then the rest of that beat is tied up with just spending and rounding tom taylor chief executive officer yeah and i d take out a couple of things that we are continuing to see that our best product to be our best performing product they continue to grow at a faster pace than and are doing very well so the consumer is trading up often in our stores and i think the energy around two of our big initiatives the energy around our design initiatives we know when a designer engages with our customer that we get a higher average ticket and we get a better gross margin and better customer satisfaction and that department and those associates that our designers continue to perform better and better each quarter the longer that we get into it and then all of the energy that we ve had around our installation materials department where we changed our kind of the bonus program within the department we changed the way the department is merchandise and they pay good dividends and we re selling more add on product so our associates are doing a good job and all of that s helping margin steven forbes guggenheim securities analyst thank you and then just a follow up regarding i guess the fifth pillar right the plan to invest in free design services maybe just expand on that right you think about the space in the front of the store that is designated to the vignettes do you see an expansion of that especially as we think right incorporating maybe some of the new product categories vanity tops vanities et cetera i mean is there training right for the design representatives in those other categories maybe just expand on the initiatives as a whole tom taylor chief executive officer yeah so i think we ve had from a merchandising standpoint we ve been really good for many many years on kind of the design center and the vignettes within the store and how we re executing there i mean every store they get a little bit better we re doing a really good job designing them and the departments look good i don t see the department getting much bigger i think we re committing the right amount of square footage to it but what we started to do a little over now it s going on two years ago as we hired a head of design we instituted some train not some lots of training we gave the designers tools technology we put guidelines in and we re in the early to middle innings of seeing the payoff of that i mean i m really pleased with what s going on i still think as we mentioned in our prepared comments earlier i mean we re going to pilot in home design services this year that s going to be something that s new for us we will show we ve got work to do in showing our adjacent categories within our design centers and as you know we redo half of our design center every year so we ll be adding some of those adjacent categories and to show them better but still in the early innings but really excited about what we re doing there steven forbes guggenheim securities analyst thank you tom taylor chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from the line of michael lasser with ubs please proceed with your question michael lasser ubs analyst good evening thanks a lot for taking my question so what have you assumed in your guidance for this year for any disruptions associated with the china supply chain tom taylor chief executive officer i mean as we mentioned in our calls it s a fluid situation but we ve done a good job in getting our chinese new year orders in early 97 of them came and were shipped before the holiday we ve got safety stock within the store and in our distribution centers and we feel like it while it s a fluid situation and we re certainly paying attention to it and we feel like we re in a pretty good position to weather it michael lasser ubs analyst and tom as of the end of 2019 what percentage of your good came from china tom taylor chief executive officer mid 30s michael lasser ubs analyst mid 30s and so if this situation were to extend on for a couple of months should we think about the potential downside risk as maybe 10 hit to 30 of your sales or is that too draconian too downside of a scenario that would play out lisa laube president michael it s lisa michael lasser ubs analyst lisa congratulations lisa laube president thank you very much so the good news is our asia sourcing office is all over this and so we ve got 12 people that are in china and they have been in very close contact with all of our factories and so we re very excited that 50 of our factories are back up and running this week and we think within the next week we ll be up to about 75 up and running so as tom mentioned our chinese new year orders got here on time so that brought us some time we carry safety stock in the stores and in the dcs and so we feel like we ve got many weeks before we get concerned about what this could mean to the business so by all intents everything that we re hearing coming out of our factories in china is that they expect that they ll be delivering and we won t have much in the way of delays michael lasser ubs analyst and is it your sense that the 50 better up and running are those at full capacity and what about from a transportation and just movement of goods perspective is it your sense that there will be no bottlenecks from that perspective either lisa laube president they re not up to full capacity i mean that s something they re building that to full capacity however to be fair when the factories come back from chinese new year every year they never start the first week or two at full capacity so i can t really answer are they further ahead or behind than they normally are because there s always a bit of a ramp up when they come back but right now like i said we re not really concerned there is some concern over the domestic transportation in china the supply chain team is working closely with our vendors there and making sure that we get or able to get the reputation that we need but that is possible that we could see some bottleneck there but as tom mentioned before it s very fluid our team is talking to our factories and our vendors every day and we just keep seeing where we are on that but at the moment we feel tom taylor chief executive officer that s right lisa laube president optimistic cautiously optimistic i would say michael lasser ubs analyst even if this goes on for several more weeks you re still in a decent spot lisa laube president i think yeah several more weeks we re ok yes michael lasser ubs analyst ok my follow up question unrelated is so these rebates and reduced tariffs that flow through what has been the response to that from the independent community from the competitors and do you expect to be able to widen your price gaps as a result of this tom taylor chief executive officer yeah i mean we certainly pay attention to price across the independents and across really all of our competitors and we re changing prices up and down all the time in reaction to our competitors and we feel we ll be able to maintain the spread that we ve that s existed over the last several years michael lasser ubs analyst could i ask a question just may be another way could you guys give us an aggregate sense of what your prices increased net of all the decreases in 2019 and what that might have contributed to the comp and how are you expecting that in 2020 and then i m done trevor lang executive vice president and chief financial officer we quoted i think our overall retail is i think the 2 60 maybe 2 65 on a per sku basis and i think that was probably close to 2 50 the year i m talking about the end of fiscal 2019 versus the end of fiscal 2018 and we had a modest increase driven by the 10 tariff and the 25 tariffs lisa laube president and better mix trevor lang executive vice president and chief financial officer and better we ve got some mix drove that as well so we feel like very modest increases because of the tariffs as we mentioned earlier we ll be more aggressive now that that cost is down and i think we re seeing some of the industry taking out some of their retailers as well so we feel like it s managed well if you know us well what you know is we re very disciplined about keeping our price discrepancy on opening price points mid price points against the competition and we re continuing to follow that strategy has served us well for many years michael lasser ubs analyst thanks a lot and good luck tom taylor chief executive officer thanks michael operator our next question comes from the line of zack fadem with wells fargo please proceed with your question zack fadem wells fargo securities analyst hey guys first question on cannibalization curious whether that s still tracking above plan and with some of the bigger stores entering the comp base how do you think about how the impact plays out as we move through 2020 trevor lang executive vice president and chief financial officer zack this is trevor you re right we called out cannibalization we d expected it to be the highest it s been in our history in the fourth quarter of this last year and then that did come to fruition it was a high number for us part of that is if you go back to 2018 35 of our stores were in existing markets this last year fiscal 2019 that we just finished up 60 of our stores were in new markets so we knew it would be higher this year as we look to the future as tom mentioned we think about 60 of our stores will be in existing markets again so it will be high this year i think as we exit this year our current modeling suggests that it gets a little bit better every quarter the year will still be a fairly high number but it will get better every quarter is how we re currently modeling it and i d say we re not sitting idly by too we ve got a lot of thoughtful people here with some strategies on things we can do in pro and commercial and design and product great operators at the field level so it is high it s the highest it s been but we expect it to come down and we re focused on continuing to do things to help those older stores and i guess the last thing i just would reiterate that we said on the last call is we intentionally opened really big stores close to these very high volume old stores that were small and didn t give the customer the experience we don t have that many stores left to do we ve got a handful of those stores left that are kind of small and old and really don t show the business the way it should be presented so i do think that that is a bit of a unique piece that we won t have to redo that again as we think about 2020 and 2021 zack fadem wells fargo securities analyst got it and with the lvt exclusion how do you expect the pricing reinvestments to trend through 2020 is it more front end loaded and then how do you expect that to impact the gross margin line in terms of cadence throughout the year trevor lang executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think the market unleashing from the way too i mean the market reacted pretty quickly and rationally and we all kind of know that we used to pay 25 cents on the dollar product and now we re not paying that 0 25 so the math was fairly simple and people kind of came down reasonably over time is what we ve seen we haven t seem to be getting too aggressive we factor all that in when we give our guidance and again our comps are kind of contemplated to be fairly consistent throughout the year zack fadem wells fargo securities analyst got it i appreciate the time trevor lang executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks zack operator our next question comes from the line of matt mcclintock with barclays please proceed with your question matt mcclintock barclays analyst sorry that s raymond james hi good afternoon everyone so i guess my first question is first off congratulations lisa that s great news it really is good to hear that my first question really is tom you talked about lost customers and that you actually do have lost customers and i was wondering if you actually dig into what you ve learned in terms of what you re doing that actually loses those customers and how you can turn that around that s my first question tom taylor chief executive officer yeah i mean we ve got some really great reporting now that our pro teams can use and we re able to identify someone that was purchasing lot from us at one time and slowed down and doesn t purchase as much this time or currently and we re able to reach out to that customer and find out what happened is it a change in their business or have they decided to go elsewhere are they working in a different part of the market and look we re not immune we re like every other retailer we try to execute at a high level but there is times that we can do better because of the amount of activity at the back of our store picking up an order if we don t get it done quick enough time is money to a pro and we ve got to react to that we averaged a 15 minute pickup time now behind our stores which we re pretty proud of but you can have one or two outliers to that and you can really aggregate a professional customers so that s an example of a service thing that i think that we can always do better to get our customer on quicker a lot of the times though it s things that we really can t control they move too far away we still only have 121 stores we re not in every part of the market and their jobs may take them to a different part of the market that we re just simply too far for so we think store openings will help that but i m just glad that we ve got our fingertips on that type of reporting now and that our stores can react to it trevor lang executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the only thing i would add is we are really excited about the crm tool we put a really high quality tool in there and lisa s team s got a few people that are really helping us understand and know things about our customers that we ve never known before and we really just have stood that thing up and so like i think all companies as we have this data that we ve not had in the past and we can really deep dive into our customers see who they are see why they re shopping with us why they in a few cases they stopped shopping with us we can learn how we market and get that consumer and find more consumers so we re very excited about having the crm tool stood up matt mcclintock barclays analyst yeah and then as my secondary question just on the design studios i think you had one in new orleans you might have one somewhere else or historically you have and i was just trying to think about how those studios play into your overall strategy how to think about expanding those what do they actually do for your business in terms of uplift in the region etc as you have decided to roll that out to i believe dallas right tom taylor chief executive officer yeah not rollout we re piling in another one i would say yeah we do have a small store that it s on magazine street outside of store in new orleans and it s something that the founder had opened since before i joined the company we always thought it was an interesting store and an opportunity for us and it s just as we look through kind of how are we going to take more market share and how are we going to penetrate areas that we can t today this store gives us the opportunity to offer our supply chain advantages of having really great prices in a different environment that we can t fit a big box store so it gets us into markets and gets us into areas where it will be really difficult to put a big box store but a customer will have the ability to see everything that we carry under one roof staff full of designers and a little bit better of an atmosphere and it just gives us the opportunity to get into more like i said in the script kind of highly populated dense markets where we can t get a big store so i think it s a unique opportunity we ll talk more about it as we get it open as we learn more it s a bit of a laboratory and we ll share more as we learn more matt mcclintock barclays analyst so manhattan s opening up next year right guys tom taylor chief executive officer it s a good example of kind of how we re thinking about it so yes manhattan maybe not next year but certainly it s a good example of how we plan to use a store like that matt mcclintock barclays analyst well i appreciate the color i cant wait to see the rest of it thanks guys best of luck trevor lang executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah take care operator our next question comes from the line of jonathan matuszewski with jefferies please proceed with your question jonathan matuszewski jefferies analyst yeah thanks for taking my questions first one just on the pro private label card you mentioned the launch this year just maybe tell us a little bit more about kind of how this solution will differ from your current offerings and anything embedded in guidance related to this new offering trevor lang executive vice president and chief financial officer this is trevor so we ve had a consumer private label credit card for a long period of time and i believe it s just sub 10 of our sales is in that consumer card and then we have through an external large bank that manages our big customer when we do commercial sales they ll manage the vast majority of our big customer commercial sales and what we ve really never had a great solution for is that pro it s in the middle which is the need of our customer it s a small business person that maybe has a handful of employees that the private label credit card is too small but yet they don t qualify for 10 000 20 000 50 000 100 000 line of credit like some of our large commercial clients are for so that s really what it s designed at we ve been designing it now for a year it s not easy to do because a lot of these customers don t have extensive credit they re maybe new in business and so we ve got a great partner we re working with there a couple of things that will be unique we ll offer extended payment terms extended interest terms we will offer the ability for a business owner to let s say they have four employees they can give the card to the four or five different employees they can give different employees different credit limits they can text to approve over time and so we do think it s going to be something unique and different we ve been working on it for a long period of time i don t think i can specifically call out an exact percentage in our comps but it is a net new additive solution that we think our pros are going to appreciate jonathan matuszewski jefferies analyst helpful and then just a quick follow up on in home design consultation that s interesting have you guys done any customer insights work and kind of what has that revealed about maybe geographically where you re seeing outsized demand or any other kind of insights that s informing kind of the move there tom taylor chief executive officer yeah we re not doing a lot of customer insight work on that beyond we ve got 121 stores that have staff with designers who tell us all the time in every store our customers would love us to go to their house so we do think there s a bit of an opportunity it s like we know when we engage with a customer within our own store within our own vignettes with their own pictures and their own samples we know that we can sell them more and we know if we go out to the house and see what they re working on it helps build even a better relationship and gives us the opportunity to not only make the current project better but make the next one even better so we ve talked about it since we put designers on staff in the store this has been a common request it was something that we thought my goal was first let s get the stores operating consistently let s get a good program within the stores and once we get that going and going in the right direction and then we ll improve our service even more by starting to get outside of the store so i think it s another good initiative and another good idea and another thing that should help drive same store sales growth jonathan matuszewski jefferies analyst great thanks so much trevor lang executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator our next question comes from the line of simeon gutman with morgan stanley please proceed with your question unknown speaker hi guys this is josh on for simeon the business is performing pretty well and all the external factors except maybe for coronavirus seem to be swinging in your favor at the moment is there anything you can talk about within your business that s not up to your expectations you kind of touched on a couple of things earlier and then what risks are you most focused on at the moment trevor lang executive vice president and chief financial officer this is trevor i guess i m glass half empty guy so it s true i ll have to take that one i think the cannibalization is a little bit higher again we re working through that as we ve said i think one thing when you guys get to do in your detailed modeling i think you ll notice that our new store productivity is planned to be slightly lower from the class of 19 just to give a little context around that the class of 2020 stores we do very detailed pro formas we spent a lot of time going through that brian s team does a good job managing that for us we feel really good about the class of 2020 on a full year basis both sales and profitability when you compare it to the class of 19 but even though we re opening a few of those stores earlier in the quarter in the year i should say we re currently not planning on opening those stores at the midpoint of the quarter or early in the quarter a number of those new stores are going to open late in the quarter and so that s going to have the appearance of having lower new store productivity but it really is just a timing issue and that we re going to open some of those stores a little bit later in the quarter in 2020 relative to the same quarter in 2019 so really again it s just a timing issue and if you look at our overall new store productivity for 19 while it might be slightly below 18 it s still at a very high rate relative to our recent past for example it will be well above what we did in 2018 so and then we worried about new stores all the time but we ve done a good job of opening new stores for a long period of time but those probably are the two i guess i d call out unknown speaker and then just on the cannibalization again if you can remind us the rationale for sticking to 60 in new markets sorry in existing markets this year is it just that you want to complete the program of the smaller stores that you have to cannibalize is it because you want to kind of stay within range in your dc footprint is it how to find the right real estate which tom touched on briefly or is it something else going on tom taylor chief executive officer i mean it gets harder to get to new markets the bigger we get but we re about getting total market share and as we re building that awareness and we think we try to have a balance we like new stores and going into new markets within the same time trevor can talk about the profitability components of doing that but from the standpoint what we hear from our pro customers is the markets we re participating hey your stores are really far apart we ll use you even more if convenience becomes more replaced so we want to get those markets filled out and we ll keep going down that path trevor lang executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah the only thing i just from a modeling perspective the way we ve tried to think about it is we try to as close as we can about half of our new stores and new markets and half in existing markets you can t ever do that perfect because sometimes it s harder to get stores in certain markets and one of the reasons we do that is we shoot for an overall level of sales and profitability so that when we re done you ll have some higher volume stores that are more profitable and you have some other stores that are lower volume aren t as profit but on average we can get to a sales number and a profit number that makes sense for us and we ve called that out as being i think 12 million to 14 million and trying to shoot for close to 2 million and slightly above 2 million in first year ebitda and so that factors into it as well we ve got to have a good balance and as tom mentioned as you would imagine where we have a lot of stores and really good brand recognition and a really strong pro team generally in our existing markets our new stores are higher volume and more profitable when you go to a new market it takes time to build that up it takes time maybe get the assortment exactly perfect and so generally speaking our new stores and our new markets just take a little bit of time from a sales and profitability perspective so that s why we shoot to the 50 50 and every year we get close but some years it s more new in some years it s more existing unknown speaker and then just to clarify it quickly so there s nothing you re seeing at all that would cause you to pause on or question the 400 store target at this moment is that fair tom taylor chief executive officer no nothing unknown speaker great thank you operator our final question comes from the line of chuck grom with gordon haskett please proceed with your question chuck grom gordon haskett analyst thanks great quarter and good year my question just is with regards to the potential upside and flow through if you guys were to outperform your comp guidance which i think some people expect could happen but i understand why you re guiding to where you are so i guess is there a way to capture what the margin flow through would be maybe for every 1 of comp upside in 2020 trevor lang executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah this is trevor i mean every comp point is going to work just over 20 million next year we would like to keep that in kind of the maybe 25 range maybe slightly above that margins a bit better but that s how we re thinking about it i think the other thing that if we are beating on comps there s things we re going to want to invest in too and we do a lot of investment as it is but there s lots of ideas that we d like to try and think so but i guess to answer that simply we would plan on the mid 20s maybe slightly above the mid 20s flow through is how we d expect incremental sales above our flow through chuck grom gordon haskett analyst ok and then just one more just with regards to your 2021 commentary i just wonder if you guys could just amplify on that for us and i guess just to make sure our math is correct does that exclude the benefit that you re going to see here in the 53rd week in terms of that potential upside trevor lang executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah this is trevor it s all on a 52 to 52 week basis we ve tried to make it as comparable as possible and exclude that 53rd week so yes as we think about 2021 we think as long again as i said in the outset of my prepared comments as long as the macro environment is at or where we are now and it doesn t take a step down or any trade policy go the wrong way we feel really good about it i think just from where we are where we re going to end the year the type of comp stores we re going to open as we said in my prepared comments we think we re going to hopefully open a few more stores earlier in the year we re taking some of those expenses into this year that would normally reside in 2021 and then this year specifically we ve got 12 months of our new store support center versus we only had two months in fiscal 19 same thing with the baltimore distribution center we only had two months of that baltimore distribution center in fiscal 19 versus a full 12 months in fiscal 2020 and so we ll get the benefit of leveraging those fairly big investments we ve made we won t have to make that level of investment as we think about 2021 and so all those things just give us confidence that we re going to do better and the final thing i said in my prepared comments is that we re expecting gross margins to continue to grow each of the quarters if you back out that 14 million benefit we talked about so that makes us feel good assuming we execute that that makes us feel good about where the product margins are exiting the year at so we ll see long time away from now but that s how we re modeling the business today chuck grom gordon haskett analyst great thanks operator we have reached the end of our question and answer session and i would like to turn the call back over to mr tom taylor for any closing remarks tom taylor chief executive officer yeah well first i d like to thank i know we as i said in the last call we have associates that listen in on the call that are and i d like to thank them for all their hard work we

the seeds for ultra low and negative interest rates were sowed 700 years ago according to a working paper by the economist paul shmelzing we are therefore exactly where we are supposed to be how so according to the author global interest rates which he traced back to 1311 have been trending downwards over the years despite increases over different periods in the past seven centuries the author also predicts that negative interest rates may be here to stay and they may sooner or later be the new normal put differently the financial crises which the world was faced with throughout the period of the study were cyclical downturns that transitioned interest rates to lower levels global interest rates were on their way there anyway such historic financial crises include the tulip mania bubble in the 17th century which was the result of an unexplainable frenzy to buy tulip bulbs bidding prices up for them another financial crisis was in the unwinding of mississippi company in the 18th century acquired by a bank established by economist john law in france the bank introduced paper money for the first time to salvage the french government from stagnant growth and a growing national debt post the spanish succession war other more recent financial crises include the great depression of the 1920s 30s the recession in early 1980s and the asian financial crisis of 1997 mired in the negative paul s analysis indicate that average long term global interest rates have been negative all along this was though more of an implicit trend rather than an explicit one subsequently current negative rates introduced after the 2008 financial crisis are a tangible culmination of a negative trajectory that has been 700 years in the making while the above mentioned financial crises exacerbated those long term negative global interest rates there is one main underlying factor that has been driving this downward trend this pertains to shifts in saving rates and consumption which can be the result of nature and human induced events an increase in savings rate means money flowing into bonds which naturally pushes interest rates lower the opposite happens when consumption increases and savings drop unforeseen events for instance the black death in the 14th century was detrimental in wiping out a significant percentage of the global workforce which nudged surviving individuals to increase their consumption and spending think today of coronavirus and the impact that it could have on global economic growth and whether or not it could produce another drag or stagnation similar to that witnessed on the back of the 2008 financial crisis human intervention human induced factors include changes in taxation that would directly impact consumption other human induced factors are the above cited financial crises which most times if not all are consequences of human behaviour in financial markets shmelzing forecasts that between now and 2040 short and long term interest rates would have plunged into negative terrain for good what does that mean for central banks and for monetary policies monetary policies will need to get more creative quantitative easing qe was one example of central banks being creative the struggle for central banks nowadays is not with ultra low or negative interest rates but on how to come up with new ways to manage monetary policies and thus liquidity in their economies given that low interest rates are usually associated with inflation missing inflation targets by central banks have been nothing but frustrating especially when not even qe has done the trick moving forward central banks could look into ways to influence long term interest rates rather than short term ones by targeting their yields this seems to be the most recent innovation pioneered in japan but its effectiveness is yet to be tested across the board even though yield targeting for long term maturities can provide one solution more solutions will be needed as ultra low and negative interest rates become the new normal which is happening in conclusion the trajectory of global interest rates was ultimately headed to today s new era of ultra low and negative interest rates the world will need to come up with innovative monetary tools to deal with that and future financial crises both nature and human induced ones the last thought that i want to leave you with what can countries with pegged currencies do about ultra low and negative interest rates

chief executive officer of tpg specialty lending inc joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi thank you good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today let me start off by reviewing our full year and fourth quarter 2019 highlights and then i ll hand it off to my partner and our president bo stanley to discuss our portfolio activity and metrics our cfo ian simmonds will review our financial results in more detail and i will conclude with final thoughts before opening the call to q a after the market closed yesterday we reported fourth quarter net investment income per share of 0 51 and net income per share of 0 57 this result this resulted in full year net investment income per share of 1 94 which corresponds to a return of equity of 12 the full year net income per share of 2 34 which corresponds to a return on equity of 14 5 supported by the earnings power of our portfolio we generated earnings in excess of our base dividend more on this in a moment the difference between this quarter s net investment income and net income per share was primarily driven by unrealized gains from both the impact of net tightening credit spreads on the valuation of our portfolio and portfolio company specific events at year end our reported net asset value per share reached another high record of 16 83 compared to 16 72 and the prior quarter and 16 25 at year end 2018 yesterday our board approved a 5 increase to our quarterly base dividend from 0 39 to 0 41 per share to shareholders of record as of march 30 payable on april 15 our board also declared a q4 supplemental dividend of 0 06 per share to shareholders of record as of february 28 payable on march 31 finally our board declared aggregate special cash dividends of 0 50 per share that will be paid to shareholders during q2 statistically 0 25 per share will be payable on april 30 to shareholders of record as of april 15 and 0 25 per share will be payable on june 30 to shareholders of record as of june 15 there s been a couple of changes to our dividend policy this quarter so let me take a few moments to discuss these in detail starting with the increase in our base dividend as we said many times in the past we view our base dividend as an ongoing cash liability and therefore we set it at a level that we believe with the high degree of confidence will be supported by the earnings power of our portfolio this is evidenced by our track record of strong base dividend coverage to net investment income which through the end of 2019 has averaged 127 since our march 2014 ipo nearly three years ago in may 2017 we introduced a variable supplemental dividend framework as a way enhanced cash distributions to our shareholders and slow the growth of our excise tax while preserving the stability of our net asset value since that time and given the change in the regulatory framework in the form of lower asset coverage requirement we believe that fundamental earnings power of our business has increased slightly offset by the decrease in libor over the course of 2018 taken into account our go forward expectations for balance sheet leverage asset level yields and potential for credit losses we believe again with a high degree of confidence that our portfolio will be able to support a higher base dividend as for the 0 50 per share special dividends that our board had just declared those who know us know we ve historically stayed away from paying specials given our focus on building net asset value and our desire to foster a long term shareholder base while our philosophy hasn t changed our consistent over earning of our dividends combined with our expectation of near term capital gains from portfolio realizations will likely result in ric distribution requirement issues that we wanted to proactively address while these special dividends were a tax driven decision all in all all else equal we expect that our return on equity will experience a slight uplift as a result of capital efficiency gains and the reduction in excise tax on our undistributed income and the slight increase in financial leverage since we ve recalibrated our base dividend to correspond with our view of earnings power of the portfolio in the intermediate term we don t expect any ric distribution requirement issues for the foreseeable future for avoidance of doubt there will be no changes to the calculation of our quarterly variable supplemental dividends except to note that the impact of the special dividend will be excluded from the purposes of the nav constraint which ensures that our nav declines by no more than 0 15 per share over the current and preceding quarter pro forma for the impact of the supplemental dividends before passing over to bo to talk about our portfolio activity i d like to quickly highlight the broader market backdrop and its impact on how we think about our business this past year was characterized by periods of volatility a divergence in sector performance and their corresponding credit spreads investor preference for high quality pay growth was driven by a mixed macro backdrop deteriorating underwriting standards and growing concerns around loan downgrades a flight to quality was observable and rising lcd spread deltas between first lien and second lien loans between bb and b credits rated credits in between cyclical and non cyclical industries this trend was particularly notable in the second half of the year it is the peak in november before moderating at year end as shared on our last call given the low cyclical exposure in our portfolio the volatility in credit spread movements throughout the year had a relatively muted impact on the valuation of our portfolio when we took into account industry when we took into industry specific comps for each of our investments looking ahead although we may see volatility related to the u s presidential election and the unfolding economic impact of the coronavirus fundamentally we think the near term u s economy remains in good shape supported by deescalating trade tensions accommodative monetary policy and low inflation however we believe economic cycles do exist as such we will continue to focus on being at the top of the capital structure limiting our exposure at cyclicals and finding strong risk adjusted returns for secondary source of repayment as it relates to our financial policy given the competitive late cycle environment we expect that we will continue to operate below the top end of our targeted leverage range of 0 9 to 1 25 this allows us to preserve our reinvestment option and create higher risk adjusted returns in next market dislocation as a result of our recent efforts on the liability management side which ian will discuss in detail we have ample and diverse funding sources with long dated maturities for our capital needs across market cycles with that i d like to turn the call over to bo who will walk you through our portfolio activity and metrics in more detail robert stanley president thanks josh the competitive environment for direct lending in 2019 continue to be challenging but we re starting to see signs of stabilization compared to record 2018 levels capital raise for middle market direct lending in 2019 was down over 35 and private debt dry powder at year end albeit still elevated at nearly 260 billion was down over 10 from the prior year given this ample dry powder and the credit bifurcation in the broadly syndicated market that josh mentioned one of the main themes over the past few quarters has been the growing market share of direct lenders and large syndicated sponsor financing our decision on whether to pursue a particular opportunistic investment strategy is informed by the risk reward dynamics in that market for us we found that in the current environment the best risk adjusted returns continue to transpire from our sector themes by partnering with sponsors and companies only in situations where we have a differentiated view of the business or the sector or the ability to provide creative solutions for complex situations we ve been able to command better pricing and terms compared to the broadly syndicated markets to give you a flavor of our investment activity over 25 of total commitments this year on a dollar basis were in retail asset based loans that we underwrite based on liquid collateral values instead of enterprise values which tend to fluctuate with market cycles our robust deal activity in retail abl in 2019 is reflective of the particularly challenging year for brick and mortar retailers which saw a record high 9 300 store closings we believe there will be continued there will continue to be disruptions in the traditional retail model and therefore the ongoing need for capital solutions in the space given our platform s relationships and core expertise in retail abl as illustrated by an average gross unlevered irr of 23 fully realized retail abl investments we expect this to continue to be one of our investment themes for the period ahead outside of retail just under 50 of total commitments in 2019 were sponsored transaction within our specialized sector sub themes such as business services and fintech where we believe we have a competitive advantage and where the underlying businesses have attractive revenue characteristics high quality customer bases and strong returns on invested capital overall we had a productive q4 with total commitments of 329 million and total fundings of 289 million across nine new investments and upsizes to four existing investments this quarter we were aging on eight of nine of our new investments which we believe is valuable in our ability to control the loan structuring and monitoring process compared to the record repayment activity of 383 million in q4 of last year this quarter was relatively quiet with 104 million of repayments from one full and six partial investment realizations resulting in net portfolio growth of 185 million for q4 for full year 2019 we generated 1 2 billion of commitments and 1 1 billion of fundings we had total repayments of 575 million for the year resulted in net portfolio growth of 512 million to get a more accurate snapshot of our portfolio s growth trend it s best to look at it over a longer 18 month period given the strong repayment levels we experienced in late 2018 over the last 18 months our portfolio grew by 291 million or a modest 10 on an annualized basis looking at the year over year portfolio trends as the portfolio grew in 2019 we kept our average investment size steady resulting in an improvement in the diversification of our portfolio our top 10 borrower exposure decreased to 33 of portfolio at fair value down from 39 in the prior year similarly our portfolio cyclical exposure which excludes our asset based loans in retail and our reserve and asset based loans in energy decreased from 4 1 to 2 9 of the portfolio year over year on a fair value basis at december 31 our top two industry exposures on a fair value basis were business services at 16 8 and retail and consumer products consisting predominantly of retail asset based loans at 14 9 from a credit statistics standpoint we continued to improve the interest coverage and net leverage profile of our portfolio at year end across our core portfolio companies our average net attachment point was 0 2 times and our average last dollar leverage was 4 2 times compared to 0 4 times and 4 4 times a year ago and the average interest coverage ratio for our core portfolio companies improve from 2 8 times to 3 2 times year over year we had no investments on non accrual status at year end and the overall performance of our portfolio remains steady at 1 15 on our assessment scale of one to five with one being the highest compared to 1 14 in q4 of last year we continue to have limited junior capital exposure with 96 of first lien exposure at year end on the underwriting side we source 99 of our portfolio through non intermediated channels this has supported our ability to structure effective group voting control on 80 of our debt investments and an average two financial covenants per credit agreement it has also supported our ability to structure call protection across our debt portfolio which provides fee income in periods of high portfolio turnover to support our roes as for portfolio year yields at year end the weighted average total yield on our debt and income producing securities at amortized cost was 10 7 compared to 10 8 in the prior quarter breaking down the drivers of this yield movement there was 30 basis points of downward impact from the decrease in the effective libor across our debt investments which was partially offset by 20 basis points of uplift from the yield impact of new versus exited investments the yield at amortized cost on new investments this quarter was 12 3 compared to 12 on exited debt investments with that i d like to turn it over to ian ian simmonds chief financial officer thanks bo as josh and bo mentioned this quarter was strong from both an earnings and originations perspective in q4 we generated net investment income per share of 0 51 which put our 2019 full year net investment income per share at 1 94 at year end we had total investments of 2 2 billion total debt outstanding of 1 1 billion and net assets of 1 1 billion or 16 83 per share which is prior to the impact of the 0 06 per share supplemental dividend that will be paid during q1 given our increased net funding activity this quarter our average debt to equity ratio moved into our revised target leverage range for the first time increasing from 0 86 times in the prior quarter to 0 97 times our average debt to equity ratio for the full year was 0 84 times consistent with our prior year and our leverage at december 31 was 1 times following our inaugural index eligible unsecured notes offering in q4 that we discussed on our november earnings call last month we made further enhancements to our capital structure and liquidity profile by increasing the commitments under our revolving credit facility from 1 245 billion to 1 315 billion and extending the final maturity by approximately a year to january 2025 in addition in january we opportunistically reopened our 2024 notes increasing the total principal amount outstanding from 300 million to 350 million we were able to execute the reopening at a price above par which implied a spread to five year treasuries of 195 basis points 50 basis points tighter than the implied spread on our original transaction this reopening allowed us to increase our unsecured funding mix with negligible impact on our weighted average cost of debt and therefore our roe given our risk management principle of mitigating interest rate risk across our floating rate portfolio we entered into a fixed to floating interest rate swap on the 50 million of new notes consistent with the rest of our fixed rate debt pro forma for the revolver amendment and the use of net proceeds from the notes reopening we had 870 million of undrawn revolver capacity at year end we feel very good about our capital position and the significant amount of liquidity we have to support our reinvestment option in environments where we can generate outsized roes for our shareholders turning to our presentation materials slide 9 is the nav bridge for the quarter walking through the main drivers of this quarter s nav growth we added 0 51 per share from net investment income against the base dividend of 0 39 per share there was a positive 0 04 per share impact from credit spread movement on the valuation of our portfolio and a negative 0 03 per share impact from net unrealized mark to market losses on the interest rate swaps on our fixed rate securities given movements in the forward libor curve other changes in net realized and unrealized gains primarily driven by portfolio specific events contributed a positive 0 07 per share impact to this quarter s nav moving on to our operating results detail on slide 11 total investment income for the fourth quarter was 66 5 million compared to 70 1 million from the previous quarter breaking down the components of income interest and dividend income was 57 6 million up 1 5 million from the previous quarter as a result of the increase in the average size of our debt portfolio other fees which consist of prepayment fees and accelerated amortization of upfront fees from unscheduled paydowns were lower at 1 8 million compared to 11 2 million in q3 given quieter prepayment activity this quarter other income was 7 1 million compared to 2 7 million in the prior quarter net expenses excluding management and incentive fees for the quarter was 16 5 million up from 16 1 million in the prior quarter due to higher interest expense from an increase in the average quarterly debt outstanding our weighted average interest rate on average debt outstanding decreased 24 basis points quarter over quarter primarily from the decrease in the effective libor across our debt instruments given the one quarter timing lag on the libor reset date on our interest rate swaps and the downward movement in libor during q4 we expect a continued tailwind to our weighted average cost of debt in next quarter s results let me take a moment to wrap up on the roes of our business after record repayments at the end of 2018 we steadily rebuilt the portfolio increasing our financial leverage from 0 59 times to 1 times while maintaining a strong return on assets of 12 5 with an average debt to equity ratio that was consistent with the prior year at 0 84 times we generated roe on net investment income of 12 and an roe on net income of 14 5 looking at year over year trends our roe on net investment income decreased from 14 in 2018 mostly resulting from record 2018 repayment levels which corresponded with elevated activity related fees the increase in our roe on net income from 11 6 in the prior year to 14 5 was partially driven by an increase in portfolio valuations resulting from a reversal of the q4 2018 credit spread widening it was also driven by net unrealized gains related to certain portfolio investments and net unrealized gains on our interest rate swaps resulting from changes in the shape of the forward libor curve i d like to quickly flag that as per our adoption of recent hedge accounting guidance we ve applied hedge accounting treatment to our 2024 unsecured notes and the related interest rate swaps as a result changes in the fair value of this particular interest rate swap will be offset by changes in the carrying value of the 2024 notes there will be no unrealized gains or losses recognized in our income statement related to this hedging relationship and therefore changes in the fair value of the swap will not impact our roe on net income going forward as we look ahead to full year 2020 based on our expectations over the intermediate term for our net asset level yields cost of funds and financial leverage we expect to target a return on equity of 11 to 12 based on our pro forma year end book value per share of 16 77 which includes the impact of the q4 supplemental dividend this corresponds to a range of 1 84 to 2 01 for full year 2020 net investment income per share with that i d like to turn it back to josh for concluding remarks joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi thank you ian our fourth quarter results supported another year of strong roes for our shareholders for the year ahead our objective continues to be generating attractive risk adjusted returns for our shareholders for our direct origination strategy the differentiated human capital expertise across our platform and capital allocation decisions that serve in the best long term interest of our stakeholders before moving to q a i d like to address the pending topic regarding our broader tpg sixth street partners investment platforms relationship with tpg holdings our sixth street business was started in 2009 as a strategic partnership with tpg sixth street currently manages 33 billion across the platform with over 250 people and nine global offices in the past 10 years our sixth street business and tpg have each grown and evolved thoughtfully and in productive ways likewise so has a relationship with tpg my partners and i at sixth street have been having a series of discussions with tpg about the next step in the evolution of our relationship including the option of operating the independent organizations with tpg continuing to maintain a minority stake in the sixth street business given sixth street scale sector expertise market presence and the fact that we have already been operating autonomously a potential next phase as an independent organization is going to be business as usual for tslx there would be no changes to the dedicated management personnel of our business and our shareholders will continue to benefit from the same sourcing underwriting and operational capabilities of the platform they have experienced with tslx since inception as of today no formal agreement has been finalized and there s no guarantee that one will be reached in either case or we business as usual for us those who know us know that our northstar has always had make decisions in the best interest of our shareholders with that i d like to thank you your continued interest and for your time today operator please open up the line for questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from rick shane with j p morgan your line is open richard shane j p morgan analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions this morning josh you partially addressed my first question in your final comments related to the separation of sixth street from tpg but i am curious do you think one of the things that has worked well at tslx over the years is good response to incentives do you think your incentives are going to change as you separate from tpg joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi no hey rick thanks for the question i think we re both on the same time schedule which is pretty early in the morning so excuse me i m down with a little bit of the cold look we tend to remain exactly the same all the team s economic group based in the sixth street business and the focus of the team has always been able to create long term value for both our private lps and our public shareholders and we effectively had very limited economics coming from the activities across the firm so i think the incentives remain exactly the same and actually probably a little bit stronger on a go forward basis if we come to a conclusion that we re going to operate as an independent entities but it s basically business as usual and the focus was again has always been you take care of your shareholder you take care of your private lp everything else kind of falls in place focus on your client focus on your customer richard shane j p morgan analyst got it thank you for that and then sort of on a more portfolio related question when we look at the portfolio on a year over year basis of the top 10 investments today for our new investments two of those being abls which typically are shorter have a shorter time on the balance sheet is that the type of rotation that we should continue to expect on an ongoing basis and the reason i asked that is that as you as the company continues to scale do you expect to do slightly larger transactions and drive higher rotation of that top 10 joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah those are very good questions so let me break it down i think there has been a and part of our late cycle focus has always been that you can manage being the late cycle in our mind kind of four different ways one is move up the capital structure the second is being defensive industries where you have sources of repayment that are not related to the economic cycle the third is to create more diversity in your portfolio and the fourth is to have run lower balance sheet leverage so i think the we ve created year over year a lot more diversity in our top 10 investments and you ll also see things that have less correlation to the economic cycle and that could be things that have strong secondary sources of repayment from asset values that are not related to the economic cycle or shorter duration investments so i think that will be continued theme for us on managing how we think about the how we think about beating the late cycle so i don t know if i answered your question i hope i did richard shane j p morgan analyst no you did i mean i think i would have in some ways expected greater concentration of new investments in the top 10 typically that sort of ratchets up over time but i was in part curious if it was not increasing is a function of that sort of late cycle defense more defensive approach joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi that is correct richard shane j p morgan analyst great that s it for me thank you guys joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi great thank you operator our next question comes from fin o shea with wells fargo your line is open finian o shea wells fargo securities analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my question just a couple on portfolio names i ll start with a small investment avidxchange which was recapitalized this quarter you re in the debt equity now but can you give context on how this fits into your platform structure there was a post quarter announcement that you had a funding round i don t know if that news was in january i don t know if that was this same deal but i m mainly asking in the purpose of is this a name that sort of migrates to your from the debt platform to the capital solutions strategy joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah hey fin let me start off first with the industry and then i ll put i ll turn it over to bo to talk about the investment so avidxchange we ve been around i guess probably for four or five years it fits squarely in our theme of b2b payments and payment ecosystems so it provides it s a company that has a ecosystem that provides payments across that ecosystem mostly in property management in the property management sector so it fits squarely in our theme the business has continued to grow significantly it has it continues to reinvest and grow at a significant rate the latest investment we did quite frankly was had a larger suite had a larger structured equity investment and so we de risked because it was less appropriate to fit inside the that tslx platform and in that series of transactions where they raised junior equity to our structured equity they also redeemed us out of our original equity investment i ll turn it over to bo if i missed anything robert stanley president no i think you touched on everything this has been a long term relationship and part of the theme that we ve been pursuing over the last five years and the numbers of the b2b payments you picked up the announcement of the there was a junior capital raise a series upraise of 125 million in late december in addition to our debt and our prep solution so that s what was picked up in the press finian o shea wells fargo securities analyst okay thanks for the context on that and so some a question on forever 21 being an abl that s a very rich spread you attained and i think as we speak it might have been paid off given the acquisition of the brand by strategics but can you give us context on was that can we not see an abl spread these days how much of that was for just the short amount of time you would hold it or the risk of going probably a deep stretch second lien abl for example joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah so a great question and forever 21 i would say at this point 97 98 resolved but i ll walk through it so first of all you can t beat irr and people don t understand when i say that but look if you hold if you have a 30 irr and you hold for a day you really have no mom to compensate you for risk to the downside so the spread was to compensate for a minimum return given that we were actually allocating real capital to the situation it was a dip financing and where our thesis was you had asset value in the brand you had two core real estate warehouses in the center of l a that we thought were very very valuable and that we had a real view on and then you had the inventory what i would say is forever 21 is pretty well noted in the press had a very very rocky december as of december 31 we actually had kept our mark basically consistent with our with the cost basis versus what you would have expected you would have expected it to migrate up to the effectively the coal price or coal plus the access fee that would obviously that we will get our active fee and we would get all of our economics and in retrospect that mark was very conservative but it was a very difficult december for the company but look our thesis was it was a little bit too big to fail it was one of they biggest rent payers in the mall ecosystem i think calvin centers was 2 5 or 2 2 5 of the rents and so it was a little bit too big to fail that it had a real brand name and then it had real underlying asset value in the form of inventory and real estate as of yesterday with the proceeds we have about 9 million outstanding against a real estate property that s basically under contract for i think 19 5 million so again it s basically revolved but december was it was we had a very conservative mark and again it goes to the expertise of our platform of understanding component parts of underlying asset values of these companies finian o shea wells fargo securities analyst okay got it that s all for me thanks so much operator thank you our next question comes from mickey schleien with ladenburg your line is open mickey schleien ladenburg thalmann analyst yes good morning everyone and josh thanks for getting up early and battling through your cold i wanted to ask a high level question to what extent do you believe the volatility in the more liquid loan markets may benefit your direct lending platform going forward given that we re hearing more and more borrowers are migrating away from bsl toward direct lending joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah so it s a great question mickey look i think that i would start up and saying that there s been some volatility in the broadly syndicated market that the broadly syndicated markets have been really differentiated by the have and have not that s kind of diverse course so the correlations will no longer won across credit spreads that s reversed course a little bit and there s the correlations are getting tighter my deep overall concern is that for the industry is that given where the industry sits on the cost curve i e when you look at our base management fees and our incentive fees that we better be a little careful or better be a lot careful of being a pure substitute to the broadly syndicated market where people can access the broadly syndicated market at 50 basis 25 basis points to 50 basis points through a closed end fund or a clo structure and us effectively creating the same risk return and because we sit so much higher on the cost curve this has actually been a theme for me mickey that you and i have discussed probably now over five or six years which was my problem with ticc which was they basically brought broadly syndicate loans and brought other people s clo equity and didn t manufacture their own and so where they sat on the cost curve they were basically taking 1 and destroying the 1 of providing something we less than 1 value to the shareholders given where they sat on the cost curve so my hope is that if the industry will see volatility as a way to create solutions and certainty and get paid for that providing that certainty to issuers if the industry is effectively substituting and providing the same risk reward at higher on the cost curve the industry is going to be in deep trouble mickey schleien ladenburg thalmann analyst i understand and i thank you for that color that s really helpful josh your firm is well known for doing deep dives on a sector basis and obviously with some particular specialties i m curious to understand what you re thinking in terms of the alternative energy sector we get everybody talks about oil and gas and how to favor it is but there s a flip side obviously as to what s going to replace that so are there borrowers in that space that are of the right size with the right balance sheets and cash flow profiles that are starting to look interesting to you joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah so good question so as you i think you re exactly right i think there s going to be quite frankly given the disruption in energy and how much capital has been destroyed and upstream e p and quite frankly the demand probably for traditional carbon products going down there s going to be opportunity for people who have deep knowledge on where asset is in the cost curve what their decline is what the unit economics are there s going to be opportunity given the lack of capital of the industry the energy industry will attract over time for people who are net debt return as it relates to the alternative energy space the answer is we actually have a very we have a great team sitting in new york focused on all energy and infrastructure project run on energy they typically fit better in a private fund format because they typically were typically buying assets or cash flow from assets versus winding the corporate borrowers and so we ve done a lot of stuff in renewables in spain and italy where the take or pay contracts and so they typically have not hit the typical corporate loan that is required under the 40 act of the good asset and they ve typically taken another form which is buying street the cash flows or buying asset with little or no merchant risk that being said we have the expertise and so if a corporate loan does pop up that will be a great opportunity for us but your entities again are i think are right i think generally the energy space is a little bit of a mess start back in 2015 i guess but it s continued most forward and it s structured enough people got the decline goes wrong demand for overall carbon products going down the equity markets and the high yield markets and then you have emerging disruptive technologies in all synergy and so i think over a period of time that it can be a unique spot for us to take the expertise of our platform and create value that being said we have you have some commodity price risk and so we re going to be very careful when we do that mickey schleien ladenburg thalmann analyst thank you for that and if i could just finish with a couple of sort of housekeeping questions just to gauge risk in the portfolio can you give us a sense of what the portfolios average debt to ebitda ratio is joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah i think bo covered in the prepared remarks i think it s gone down year over year so our last dollar on average our last dollar attachment point is 4 2 times that compares to that on average last year of 4 5 times on an interest coverage basis it s i think also got better that s effectively and i m giving exact numbers i think it was 3 2 this year compared to 2 8 last year i mean and some of that quite frankly is earnings growth a mix between earnings growth and that continues to be having a comment at that mickey schleien ladenburg thalmann analyst okay and lastly maybe for ian just at a high level ian on a portfolio company basis what were the main drivers of the realized loss and the unrealized gains this quarter ian simmonds chief financial officer on the unrealized there s no major driver it s i don t want to describe as cats and dogs but there s probably about 12 names that contribute to that overall so nothing specific stands out there s a small realized gain on a liquid name that we have but it s less than 0 05 there s really nothing major to highlight joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah i mean look i think curriculum which i think has publicly announced that got refinanced in q1 so the remarkable update basically up to the call price that was 0 02 but there was nothing that will contribute more than 0 02 on a single basis right mickey schleien ladenburg thalmann analyst and that s also the case with the realized loss joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah mickey schleien ladenburg thalmann analyst okay that s great that s all for me this morning i appreciate your time thank you very much joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi great thanks mickey ian simmonds chief financial officer thanks mickey operator our next question comes from chris york with jmp securities your line is open christopher york jmp securities analyst good morning guys and thanks for taking my questions this one may be for ian so other income was a record this quarter can you breakdown some of the drivers there whether that was led by higher structuring or syndication fees joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah so we actually didn t have any syndication fees in the quarter chris and i ll just give you a little bit of context if you look at our call it an activity basis fee so accelerated oid from prepayments which there wasn t that much of this quarter and obviously we didn t have that many prepayments in general if you look at that plus syndication fees which was zero and then our other income collectively those items were 0 14 per share for the quarter if i look at what those items collectively have been over the last four years the average has also been 0 14 per share so in aggregate we re basically the same as what we ve experienced historically in the other income items this particular quarter it was really driven by an amendment that i think was known to the market with ferrellgas and then we had a couple of other items that were we re calling them work fees because they involved some service and input on our part that drove that other income line christopher york jmp securities analyst very helpful i noticed that you did put in the k that it was an amendment fee so how much was that amendment fee specifically in the fourth quarter joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi look ferrell is a publicly traded company i don t want to get into details i think the total other income is dollar wise ian simmonds chief financial officer 7 million joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi 7 million and farrell was a own pay it was a smallest piece of that so but people should look at the farrell k or their public reporting and what they disclosed christopher york jmp securities analyst got it okay and then in your prepared remarks you said that some of your decision to issue a special dividend this year was driven by expected gains i think in maybe the first half of this year does that include ferrellgas or curriculum or what are the specific drivers there joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi let s take a if we take a step back and i mean it turns a little ian is the greatest tax person but i do kind of play on every once a while we had about 1 60 per share in undistributed income and we barely made and by the way this is all manageable but our tax year ends in march and we were basically only had about 1 8 million or 2 million of room against the minimum distribution requirement of 0 90 we got 90 and so for us and again that could have been that s all solvable and would have been solved but if you look forward at where our base is and where our kind of recurring special no we don t call special ian simmonds chief financial officer supplemental joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi supplemental dividends are through the year effectively on an accrual basis in q1 we would have been out of compliance with the minimum distribution requirements now we have until march 20 march 21 to solve that but on an accrual basis we would no longer be and that s a function of both net investment income and cap gains and so that played a big part of it which is we knew we are going to have to make a large special dividend by march 2021 it was known we are in an effective accrual basis we would have been out of compliance in q1 we barely made it in q for this tax year so that s one piece of it the second piece of it is that the excise tax was continuing to grow and continuing to burden shareholder returns and was just a pure friction cost and so we were able to minimize we basically are reducing that by a third on a pro forma basis and that will grow again quite frankly but we re reducing that by a third and so and then the third piece of it was that there is capital efficiency in that we re saving we re effectively reducing our equity and that has a associated cost of capital and borrowing which has a associated cost of capital that s a lot and so when you put all those three things together which is we knew we were going to have to be in compliance on a ric basis in 2021 we knew we weren t going to be in compliance in 2021 that this is actually on a net income basis accretive because you re saving the excise tax you re saving a little bit of management fee given that you go into the break which has been reduced by interest expense and reduced by a little bit of infinity but it s positive about 0 01 a share on a net income basis given the excise tax and you re generating higher roes it seems like although it was not consistent with the past actions the fact that circumstances have changed christopher york jmp securities analyst color is extremely helpful and josh you played the role well as a ric expert ian simmonds chief financial officer the only thing i would add chris and we read your report that came out last night and you referenced the growth in undistributed income year over year and i think that was actually pretty good as a way to think about one of the inputs into how we sized the special dividend so this time last year our undistributed income was we estimated at about 1 22 top for the year we re now at 1 60 so there s 0 38 of growth over that period so that was one of the inputs into how we size that josh referenced the potential to save say excise tax which is important to us because that s loss to the system and then we re also very focused on preserving nav and so the other way we thought about sizing especially we looked at a year on year growth that we had achieved through operating results in 2019 we backed off the impact of the swaps with the tailwind that we got from mark to market movements in the swaps so that s sort of triangulated to 0 50 special dividend that s what we re thinking behind it as we had discussions with the public christopher york jmp securities analyst sure it makes a lot of sense i was just trying to i mean when i was looking at undistributed income growth the comments you had in the prepared remarks were just what i was focused on so i ll switch gears the last one was on your potential separation agreement so i think investors had generally thought the bdc and then tssp had received some halo benefits from its association with tpg so given the recent change at the advisor with tpg why would it be wrong for investors to think either the informational advantages or maybe even the future capital raising with lps seem to be consolidating relationships could be impacted going forward joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah look i mean i think if there was a halo benefit if you look back nine years ago today the tssp platform is 33 billion of aum these conversations we had conversations obviously with our private lps they ve known about the changing relationship over the last nine years when we started the business there was 10 people today there s 250 people we ve built out industry expertise we haven t relied on the firm for any informational advantages for years so i don t again i think it s business as usual that cap again i would say that nothing is done but it was in the press and surely that our revolver lenders the minimum was done post to being in press the revolving lenders didn t care our cost of capital and change we did a tap on the bond deal our cost of capital didn t change quite frankly went down and so it is and it s been very well known in both the lp market and i think with our shareholders this has really been a jv controlled by the tssp class 3 partners and manage nobody s ever done our investment committee nobody s ever referred the deal to us in the bdc and so it is really the business as usual christopher york jmp securities analyst that s a good answer and obviously your comments on the debt capital mitigate our concerns there so good perspective last one just following up on that so i know the fee was very nominal but and the separation agreement is pending right now but will there be a suspension of the licensing fee to tpg for the use of your name would that expire joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah so there is look again there is no there hasn t been any actual fee related to the tpg specialty lending so and that either the management company has paid or the shareholders have paid obviously on a go forward basis i think to be determined but quite frankly it s really sixth street partners branded business sixth street partners managed business and again there hasn t been a deal we haven t come to a deal with all that reflects christopher york jmp securities analyst got it that s it for me thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from kenneth lee with rbc capital your line is open kenneth lee rbc capital markets llc analyst hi thanks for taking my question wondering if you could talk about the key factors driving the you mentioned an increase in the potential earnings power that is supporting the increase in the base quarterly dividends this year and how much of that would be dependent on any movement within the libor rates thanks joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah it s s a good question so first of all let s take a step back i don t think the increase in the dividend from 0 39 to 0 41 is more of a resetting what the dividend should have been years back i think on a last year in supplemental dividends we paid out 0 19 and so there was and by the way and we grew nav even though we paid out 0 19 and so if you divide do simple math 19x4 that s what 0 47 0 46 a quarter rather than 0 39 and so the business last year which was slightly a little bit of a higher libor environment would have supported with still growing nav a basically a dividend around 0 44 to 0 45 per share ian simmonds chief financial officer with still over earning supplemental joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi with growing nav so i it s more a function of that the dividend was undersized for years and years and years and then there was a change in the asset coverage ratio which would allow for greater financial leverage which obviously boosted roes and so it s the combination of those two things when we look at the when we look at our ability to earn the dividend or even our ability to earn the dividend with coverage which is how we think about it we take the dividend as a cash liability we don t look at spot libor today we look at the forward libor curve that will be a headwind but the earnings as a business we ve already massively over earning the dividend and so even if you walk forward a year or two years out and look at the spot libor curve you still feel very good about the newly sized dividend for the existing power of the business kenneth lee rbc capital markets llc analyst got you that s very helpful just one follow up if i may you mentioned within your prepared remarks seeing a slight uplift in asset yields on new investments wondering if you could just elaborate what s driving the uplift in yields despite the movement in libor rates in the quarter thanks joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah look i think it s pretty idiosyncratic quarter to quarter things bump around so what i would say is the overall trend of the industry continues to remain super competitive i mean i think yields on new investments were 12 3 in q4 a large function of that was little over 21 in q3 was 10 4 and q2 was 11 4 and q1 was 10 7 and so again i think it s idiosyncratic the industry continues to be very very competitive but my hope is that the industry is going to start trying to take spread back as libor falls and realize that they need to provide an acceptable return given where we ve seen the cost structure to shareholders kenneth lee rbc capital markets llc analyst understand very helpful thank you operator thank you our next question comes from robert dodd with raymond james your line is open robert dodd raymond james analyst hi guys good morning and thought was exactly the point you just made josh in terms of the industry the hope maybe the industry will try and take spread back for lack of a better term is you intend to kind of put a stake in the ground on spread on your front because right now it looks like the industry really isn t doing that forward curve is down spreads don t really seem to be widening and that broader markets are still tightening so i mean any color you can give us on your willingness to hold that ground if everybody else loses their minds around you if you will joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah look we re willing to give up growth for the manager and for the platform to protect shareholder economics and the again it has to work for shareholders and have to work for private lps the watch out is that i think people are ignoring the forward libor curve either they re ignoring it or they re making a bet against the forward libor curve overall the industry earnings power if they don t take back spread is going to go down absent massive changes of leverage given the forward libor curve that compounded with a lot of people fix their funding costs and so that s going to compound the issue and so you can t manage the business here in the moment you ve got to manage the business and look at your cost of capital and look at shareholders expectations and what the market is telling you about interest rates and your cost of funding and quite frankly we re positioned much better because we have we have libor floors and floating rate libor floor in our assets and floating rate liabilities and so at some point if you continue to see libor drift below our floors we ll have net interest margin expansion but i think the watch up for the industry is people better people should start thinking about that forward libor curve and thinking about what that means for their economic reality and overlay that into what their funding mix looks like robert dodd raymond james analyst got it i appreciate that josh one more if i can on the abl side obviously you ve got a ton of experience the abl brick and mortar problem has been going on a while you ve gotten great returns out of that one of the newer areas of softness if you will i think is in grocery food retail things like that where i think people thought grocery stores were more defensive against some of the brick and mortar retail trends and that s not working out can you give us any color on your appetite do those kind of deals given a perishable versus non perishable collateral if that changes the dynamic so if you d be willing to look at those kind of deals joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah so look you re exactly right it s a very good point so we did great american and pacific tea company back in 2014 which was a grocery store deal and there are packing considerations typically don t impact grocery but there are packing consideration there are also the perishable and so you have to be much more conservative and be much more constructive in your borrowing base and how that works right now we have to save a lot but that has some of those similar dynamics but well i think people never realize about the grocery segment was it was much it was levered to inflation given the large fixed cost structure and so i think people that inflation would come in and when you have a fixed cost structure that s good you ve had deflation and you ve had a lot of disruptive competition and so there will be some opportunities but i think we ll be very careful robert dodd raymond james analyst i appreciate it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from ryan lynch with kbw your line is open ryan lynch keefe bruyette woods analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my questions just have a couple remaining as part of at least from my understanding as part of the partnership engine between tpg and sixth street from my understanding you guys are not able each of the parties are not able to start up competing businesses or overlapping strategies for one year but then after that you are free to do such just curious has sixth street thought about once that one year clock period lapses that you guys will look to pursue other strategies besides credit joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah thanks ryan again there s been no agreement reached and so i know there s been stuff reported out there i think it s a little bit premature i think your construct is probably roughly right i don t think this decision was driven by the desire to for either part to expand into white space that belongs to the other party and so i think this decision if it does come to fruition it was just about the natural evolution and that people will have their own relationships with lps and people were managing their own separate businesses and there were synergies that existed any longer given the evolution of both businesses so i think your concept is roughly right although no agreement has been reached i would also say that that wasn t the primary factor of this process ryan lynch keefe bruyette woods analyst okay that makes sense and then i wanted to follow up on your response to chris question regarding the dividend and the special dividend payment i think you mentioned three reasons one of the reasons were for paying a special dividend is that you guys were potentially going to bump up to some of these ric payout requirements in 2021 you also mentioned that you don t love paying special dividends so i m curious as you guys still kept the supplemental dividend policy at a 50 payout ratio it feels like you guys could run into the same issue again a year or two from now as you guys have put up really strong results so is there any consideration to increasing the supplemental payout ratio to something higher like 75 or 100 to avoid these special dividends which you guys said you don t really love paying joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi yeah were you at the board meeting by the way i mean yeah you hit it on the head which was look we re going to have a ric problem even if we had running the supplemental at 75 we re at 100 quite frankly because how the supplemental was calculated was based on nii and did it pick up realized cap gains and so we were going to have the ric issue no matter what and quite frankly on an accrual basis although you had until 2021 to solve that you were going to have it effectively in q1 this year so we did think about the other levers increasing it to 75 that s on the table quite frankly if the business continues to perform we ll have this issue again the excise tax kills me because it s pure friction and so those things will continue to be on the table as we go forward but quite frankly it was a combination of the size of the special not if you could if you needed to do the special the percentage of the supplemental and the base dividend and what we did was we hit two of the three we want to continue to build nav and so we didn t change the percentage but we hit two of the three levers ryan lynch keefe bruyette woods analyst okay that makes sense those are all my questions i appreciate the time today and really nice quarter guys joshua easterly director and chairman of the board chief executive officer co chief investment officer of the advi great thanks ryan operator thank you and i m currently showing no further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back over to joshua easterly for closing

by briefly reviewing some of the highlights of 2019 before focusing my remarks on a selection of our recent investments in the context of the market environment toni sanzone our cfo will cover our 2019 results our 2020 guidance and our balance sheet positioning including the further flexibility we ve gained with the renewal and upsizing of our credit facility we re joined by our president john park and our head of asset management brooks gordon who are available to take questions during 2019 we executed on a variety of important initiatives coming into the year we were focused on fortifying the benefits associated with our merger with cpa 17 while taking advantage of opportunities to further enhance our portfolio and balance sheet and continuing to replace investment management fees with higher quality lease revenue on the portfolio front our weighted average lease term continued to increase while enhancing the quality of our portfolio including lowering tenant concentration reducing office assets and converting a large operating self storage portfolio to net lease with investment grade rated extra space as the tenant through our merger and our regular investment activity we increased real estate affo per share by 8 year over year which we feel particularly good about in the context of simultaneously reducing leverage and eliminating earnings from investment management our balance sheet is stronger than ever and the quality of our earnings ebitda and dividend coverage all significantly improved in 2019 with investment management representing just 5 of total affo the percentage that will continue to decline as the remaining funds roll off in the capital markets we accessed a variety of channels raising a record amount of capital via the public markets we prepaid over 1 billion of mortgage debt and achieved the lowest coupons and spreads in our history in both the u s and euro bond markets while reducing secured leverage below 10 as a result of our strong execution on multiple fronts we generated a total shareholder return of 29 and were placed on positive outlook by s p most importantly we believe our efforts will benefit shareholders not just in 2019 but over the long run as we complete the wind down of our investment management business and focused on delivering consistent and steady performance from our real estate portfolio turning to the fourth quarter from an investment standpoint it was an especially active quarter completing close to half of our 2019 investment volume primarily into warehouse and industrial properties at attractive spreads to our cost of capital and that momentum has continued into the new year the market environment in the fourth quarter was again defined by the competitive conditions that prevailed throughout 2019 underpinned by low interest rates in europe very low rates continued to spur capital flows into the region with increasing amounts of money chasing widely marketed deals progress with brexit helped renew interest in u k assets and the nordic commercial real estate market had a record year for deal flow in the u s industrial and logistics continued to be the most sought after property types amid continued economic growth supported by low unemployment low inflation and the low cost of credit throughout 2019 we continued to view sale leasebacks and off market acquisitions as well as build to suits and other capital projects as the best ways to put capital to work on a risk adjusted basis while the warehouse and industrial sectors presented the best opportunities in 2019 comprising close to 80 of our full year investment volume we maintained our diversified approach completing investments totaling 868 million that spanned all major property types across 55 properties net leased to 29 tenants operating in 14 different industries located primarily in the u s and northern and western europe during the year we also creatively converted the bulk of our operating self storage assets to net lease adding further diversity to our net lease portfolio as well as a potential source of future net lease opportunities as operators look to take an asset light approach in 2019 we actively used our improved cost of capital to extend our investments into higher quality industrial and logistics assets that trade at lower cap rates however this did not displace our ongoing focus on the broader opportunity set of net lease assets that we ve traditionally invested in namely operationally critical properties net leased to growing companies that sit just below investment grade thereby providing additional spread and compelling risk adjusted returns over long leases in aggregate our 2019 investments were executed at an initial weighted average cap rate of 6 7 and had a weighted average lease term of 19 years as anticipated our 2019 investment activity was back end weighted with an especially active fourth quarter during which we completed 412 million investments at a weighted average initial cap rate of 6 3 in a weighted average lease term of 20 years this included the completion of three capital investment projects totaling 44 million bringing the full year total for completed projects to 127 million which represented about 15 of our total 2019 investment volume these are truly off market transactions enabling us to negotiate better terms compared to widely marketed deals and create value to the lease structure itself such transactions not only provide a ready source of incremental deal flow given the size and breadth of our portfolio they also add high quality real estate at cost let s go through a handful of the more notable deals from the quarter our largest investment during the fourth quarter was the 94 million sale leaseback of logistics facility net leased to stanley black decker the widely known manufacturer of hand and power tools which has an a rating from s p the facility is located in the greater charlotte area in close proximity to key transportation routes and is the tenant s second largest distribution center in the u s to triple net lease with fixed annual rent increases and has below market rent that provides potential upside at the end of the 12 year term in december we completed a 56 million acquisition of an experiential retail store net leased to bass pro group a leading provider of outdoor sporting goods in the u s and canada this is a true destination retail location that s been in operation for more than 17 years it s triple net leased on a 24 year term with cpi based rent growth we remained selective in our approach to the retail sector and continue to focus on top performing locations with strong coverage where the tenant has a differentiated strategy shielding it from e commerce competition early in the quarter we closed a 53 million cross border sale leaseback for three industrial facilities net leased to apex tool group which is one of the largest producers of high performance tools two of the facilities are located in the u s and one in mexico all of which are critical to the company s global operating footprint the properties are leased on a triple net basis in u s dollars for a period of 25 years with fixed annual rent escalations the last one i ll mention is the 38 million sale leaseback we closed in november for two logistics facilities in denmark and sweden net leased to stark group which is the largest supplier of building and construction projects products in the nordic region both assets are strategically located with easy access to major highways and shipping routes they re triple net leased for a 20 year term with annual cpi based rent escalations our 2019 investments in conjunction with our proactive approach to asset management also improved the quality of our portfolio across many key metrics abr generated from warehouse and industrial properties increased to 45 of abr while abr from office was reduced to 22 compared to 25 a year ago we increased the proportion of abr generated by investment grade tenants to 30 and further reduced our top 10 tenant concentration to 22 which remains one of the lowest in the net lease peer group we also extended the portfolio s weighted average lease term to 10 7 years which is six months longer than it was a year earlier despite the passage of time and edged closer to full occupancy ending the year 98 8 occupied looking ahead we expect market environment to remain competitive in 2020 the central banks both in the u s and europe signaling their intentions to keep rates low brexit has made some meaningful progress and fears of a trade war with china have eased somewhat however the impact of the coronavirus and global growth in supply chains has become an unknown over the long term we believe the market opportunity for net lease remains vast our diversified approach enables us to invest across property types in on two continents and our cost of capital allows us to do so accretively supported by established access to the capital markets and a well positioned balance sheet with ample liquidity to execute on our investment pipeline as i mentioned the transaction momentum we saw in the fourth quarter has extended into 2020 year to date we ve added 206 million of investments comprising two closed acquisitions totaling 139 million and three completed capital projects totaling 67 million we also have an additional six projects totaling 176 million scheduled for completion by the end of this year so we currently have good visibility into about 380 million of investment volume for 2020 and a healthy pipeline of additional new investments an excellent position to be in this early in the year and with that i ll hand the call over to toni toni sanzone managing director chief financial officer good morning everyone as jason said we are very pleased with the progress we made on several fronts in 2019 and believe we are well positioned for the year ahead given our current outlook starting with our results as a reminder our 2019 results reflect the full year impact of the merger with cpa 17 which significantly improved the composition of our earnings with 95 of total affo generated by our core real estate business as our investment management fee stream declined over time we are actively replacing them with more highly valued and steady real estate cash flows we were pleased to generate 8 year over year growth in real estate affo per share while at the same time significantly deleveraging and strengthening our balance sheet total affo for the fourth quarter was 1 28 per share bringing full year affo to 5 per share a decrease of 7 2 driven by the expected decline in investment management earnings affo from real estate totaled 1 21 per share for the quarter and 4 74 per share for the full year an increase of 8 over the prior year driven by substantially higher lease revenues from the properties we acquired in the cpa 17 merger as well as our net investment activity and strong same store growth real estate affo in 2019 also included two significant lease related settlements and recoveries totaling 16 million which we discussed on prior calls as jason discussed our fourth quarter investment volume totaled 412 million representing close to half of our full year total of 868 million and because the majority of investments closed near the end of the quarter they had minimal impact on the fourth quarter and full year earnings disposition activity was also largely back end weighted driven by the new york times repurchase at the start of december during the fourth quarter we disposed of 12 properties for 348 million bringing full year dispositions to 384 million since the end of the year we ve closed the sale of an operating hotel in miami for 115 million leaving us with just one remaining operating hotel which we expect to sell over the next year our 2019 occupied dispositions were executed a weighted average cap rate of 7 8 excluding the new york times which we view as an outlier given its fixed price purchase option other dispositions during the fourth quarter included six retail properties and one educational facility which were vacant and transferred back to the lenders thereby eliminating their associated carrying costs abr increased 5 year over year driven by our 2019 net investment activity the conversion of self storage assets to net lease and solid year over year contractual rent escalations same store rent growth as we define it was 2 which represents an average contractual rent increase written into our leases as many of you know there has been growing interest for net lease reits to disclose the same store growth metrics that includes the impact of leasing activity vacancies and credit losses incorporating the impact of those factors would reduce our same store rent growth about 100 basis points and it s something we ll look to add to our supplemental disclosure going forward from a releasing perspective we had an active fourth quarter executing 15 lease renewals and extensions representing 2 of abr a portion of this related to the lease restructuring of four manufacturing facilities which we discussed on our last earnings call as anticipated that restructuring included an initial rent reduction from 5 4 million to 1 million but will steadily grow to 2 4 million by year four of the lease this rolldown more than offset positive releasing spreads on several office and warehouse properties in aggregate our releasing activity recaptured 89 of the prior rent and added seven years of incremental weighted average lease term given the variability in this metric from quarter to quarter internally we look at it over the trailing eight quarters over which time frame we recaptured 97 of the prior rent and on a weighted average basis added 7 7 years of incremental lease term while only spending 1 16 per square foot on tenant improvements and leasing commissions for new leasing activity we entered into 11 new leases on existing properties with a weighted average lease term of 17 years this included leasing approximately 1 million square feet of roof space for the installation of solar panels on a recently expanded logistics facility we own in the port of rotterdam in the netherlands this will generate additional lease revenues without any additional investment on our part given the opportunity set provided by the size of our warehouse and industrial portfolio we re actively looking to replicate these leasing opportunities which also serves to further our esg initiatives moving to our capital markets activity and balance sheet we continue to have access to a variety of capital markets in 2019 in total raising 1 4 billion of well priced long term and permanent capital we accessed the u s dollar and euro debt capital markets in june and september respectively raising approximately 900 million through unsecured bond offering net proceeds from these offerings are primarily used to reduce amounts outstanding on our unsecured credit facility and to repay higher yielding mortgage debt further advancing our unsecured debt strategy in the fourth quarter we paid down 324 million of mortgage debt bringing the total for 2019 to 1 3 billion as a result secured debt as a percentage of gross assets was effectively cut in half during 2019 ending the year at 9 7 unencumbering an additional 180 million of abr in the process as a result at the end of 2019 73 of total abr was unencumbered up from 53 at the start of the year our 2019 bond issuances had a weighted average interest rate of 2 3 which is well below the 4 8 weighted average cost of the mortgage debt we repaid creating significant interest savings in 2020 and beyond in addition through our atm program we raised 523 million of equity capital in 2019 at weighted average price of 79 70 all of which completed earlier in the year as no atm activity was issued in the fourth quarter we ended the year with net debt to adjusted ebitda of 5 4 times and debt to gross assets of 40 3 reducing overall leverage from 5 8 times and 42 8 a year ago since year end we ve amended and restated our senior unsecured credit facility increasing total capacity to 2 1 billion of which 1 8 billion is a multi currency revolving line of credit in addition to gbp150 million term loan and a 105 million equivalent multi currency delayed draw term loan all of which mature in five years the increased size and improvements in pricing duration and other terms reflect the significant progress we ve made over the last several years executing our business strategy and the strong demand in the bank market for our credit as such we are starting the year with an extremely well positioned and strong balance sheet with ample liquidity ensuring we have significant flexibility in funding our acquisition pipeline and allowing us to continue accessing the capital markets opportunistically turning now to guidance for 2020 we expect to generate total affo of between 4 86 per share and 5 01 per share including real estate affo of between 4 74 per share and 4 89 per share our guidance assumes investment volume of between 750 million and 1 25 billion which includes capital investment projects we expect to complete during the year regarding the timing of 2020 investments as jason mentioned we ve closed 206 million of investments already this year reflecting continued momentum from an active fourth quarter and we have an additional 176 million of capital investment project scheduled to be completed in 2020 with expected completion dates for each provided in our supplemental based on our experience our guidance also assumes investment activity not currently in our pipeline is likely to be more weighted toward the end of the year disposition activity for the year is expected to fall between 300 million and 500 million this includes the 115 million sale of an operating hotel which closed in january as i previously mentioned from a forecasting perspective it s important to note this hotel is running near breakeven so its sale will not have a significant impact on 2020 affo as expected our investment management earnings will continue to decline with the pending merger and internalization of the cwi lodging funds we currently expect that transaction will close at the end of the first quarter subject to shareholder approval at which time we will receive an estimated 32 million of common stock and 65 million of preferred stock in the combined company which we anticipate will carry a 5 dividend this is in addition to the approximate 100 million of common stock we currently own in the cwi funds at the same time we will see starting asset management fees and profits interest in the funds and will no longer pay sub advisory fees on the expense side we expect total g a for 2020 to fall between 80 million and 84 million this includes certain one time expenses of about 4 million in 2020 as we transition to a new headquarters office later this year in addition we expect to absorb the cost of previously shared platform costs as the reimbursements we received from the cwi funds for transition services wind down over the course of the year to give some additional context on our 2020 expectations in relation to this year s results affo for 2019 included significantly higher lease termination and other income than we expect in 2020 primarily as it relates to the two larger lease related recoveries that totaled 16 million in 2019 similarly in 2019 we recognized certain income tax benefits totaling over 5 million which reduced our cash tax expense to about 20 million on an affo basis based on our current visibility we would not expect similar benefits in 2020 thereby increasing our cash tax expense lastly we expect interest expense to decline significantly in 2020 resulting from the full year impact of last year s capital markets activity which reduced our cost of debt to 3 2 at the end of the year while we don t provide specific guidance on capital markets activity our guidance range assumes we run our balance sheet leverage neutral on a debt to gross asset basis in closing our balance sheet is stronger than ever with low leverage ample liquidity and well established access to various forms of capital we re pleased with the early momentum we re seeing with the investments we ve already closed to date and how our pipeline is building as jason noted we have good visibility into about 380 million of 2020 deal volume through investments that have already closed and capital projects scheduled for completion by the end of the year and with the expected closing of the cwi merger at the end of the first quarter we will further simplify our business moving incrementally closer to generating 100 of our earnings from real estate and with that i ll pass the call back to the operator for questions questions and answers operator thank you at this time we will take questions our first question comes from sheila mcgrath with evercore please proceed sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst i guess i was wondering if you could give us insights on the same store noi for self storage which was particularly strong are all those properties leased properties and just how what was driving that growth and participation in the leases brooks g gordon managing director head of asset management this is brooks the vast majority are net leased in the extra space transaction we have 10 that are currently operating properties and another nine that are scheduled to be added to the extra space lease and the same store performance is really just embedded in that portfolio those are in markets that have seen good rent growth so for example in the 10 that we retained as operating properties for example those have seen very good growth north of 10 noi growth and on the net lease those are subject to a long term rent growth formula where there is a fixed component and a variable component based on revenue growth sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst okay great and then brooks g gordon managing director head of asset management so and also just u haul has a bump in there as well and that s a big piece of the puzzle sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst that s right and then on the leasing spread on industrial being negative was there one deal that was skewing that just a little color on the leasing spreads in industrial brooks g gordon managing director head of asset management yeah that s very much just driven by that one workout that toni mentioned in her opening remarks so if you back that out the leasing spreads were quite strong this quarter kind of in the 112 range but that one workout transaction on four industrial properties really drove that sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst okay and last question if you could just comment on tenant watch list how that s tracking and if there is any notable tenants you want to call out for us to be mindful of brooks g gordon managing director head of asset management sure credit quality is quite good right now heightened watch list is under 2 of abr in terms of any concentration there aren t really any industry trends in there it s just a mix again we closely monitor all tenants and are quite cautious and willing to downgrade onto our watch list quite proactively so we think that s a safe list to look at and one we feel pretty good about so no real concentrations are particularly notable ones sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from greg mcginniss with scotiabank please proceed greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst hey good morning jason e fox chief executive officer board member good morning greg greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst toni i was just hoping you could help us think about sort of the acquisition guidance kind of what the underwriting assumptions on there whether it s cap rates or investment spreads jason e fox chief executive officer board member hey greg this is jason i ll take that sure so in our guidance we talked about an acquisition range of 750 million to 1 billion in a quarter of new investments i think embedded in that we have seen some cap rate compression over the year both in the u s and europe if you look at our q1 deals to date the 200 million we referenced earlier across five investments both new investments as well as capital projects those blended to around a 6 5 cap rate hard to predict the full year of where the markets will go and where the opportunities will arise but i think that s probably a good run rate for you to think about on the year it s come down a little bit from the mid to high sixes that we were for a blended cap rate in 2019 and i think that s a reflection of two things one is we have seen continued yield compression but i think equally important we are kind of broadening the types of deals that we look at we re still focused on what we ve traditionally done which is sale leasebacks critical operating properties where we ve generated above market yields but we re also adding higher quality real estate that may trade at lower cap rates may have higher embedded growth or better releasing outcomes at the end of the terms the black the stanley black decker would be a good example of that so i think those two components really are kind of driving the slight cap rate compression at least how we re seeing the year unfolding greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst thanks and then i know you talked about this a bit previously so i apologize if this was covered but on the capital investment side where you re looking to deliver almost 0 25 billion of projects in 2020 do you see this as a reasonable expectation for deliveries going forward just kind of curious what you see as the how deep is this pipeline within the current portfolio of potential investment projects and then what s the process for sourcing more jason e fox chief executive officer board member yeah we ve i ll start here and i ll see if brooks wants to add some color yeah so 2018 2019 about 10 to 15 of our deal volume was these capital investment in development projects that also include build to suits by the way this year you heard the numbers that we just talked about we expect that to double the 2019 numbers we re expecting about 240 million of investments that are scheduled to complete this year again both build to suits and expansions some of those have already completed year to date we also have another 130 million in our supplemental that are expected to complete in 2021 so hard to predict as always but i think a good run rate is probably in that 20 to 30 range it s become a big focus of our investment management team we have the skill set to identify the tenant relationships we also have a sizable pool of assets and particularly the industrial assets that tend to lend themselves quite well to expansions i mean as we ve talked in the past we re putting more money to work but we re also putting money to work at higher yields we re extending lease terms when we re doing expansions it s higher quality real estate and we re also adding criticality of the portfolio given that we re building or expanding to a tenant s current specs and need so a lot of positives that come out of that type of investment and i think you ll continue to see a focus and hopefully a growing portion of our annual deal volume greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from jeremy metz with bmo please proceed jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst hey guys good morning question for jason or maybe brooks here but i was hoping we can get any sort of update on the pendragon situation if you re having any discussions there about potentially restructuring those leases and that s something we need to keep an eye out for possibly here in 2020 and just as a follow on the pendragon property count went down an asset it s down to 69 now but i didn t see a sale listed on the disposition page so any color on that would be great as well brooks g gordon managing director head of asset management sure i ll this is bruce i ll take that one on that specific question we just went direct with a tenant that was formerly the subtenant so we re still on the property but that was a good outcome for going direct with a subtenant that was already in place and then with respect to pendragon more broadly we think the company has made a lot of progress especially in the second half a lot of their actions are bearing fruit those include hiring a very well regarded new ceo substantially reducing cost but really the biggest driver of their turnaround and the biggest cause for some of their challenges was just way too much inventory and they drastically reduced that by close to 30 and are in a much better place i think that s in the context of a very conservative balance sheet certainly industry headwinds and their competitors share those headwinds but we don t view this as a default risk we have over 10 years of weighted average lease term there is no intention to restructure that deal nor do we foresee a need to so we think the company is in a good place now certainly industry headwinds but they re well positioned on recovery jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst that s helpful and then toni i appreciate the added color you gave on the same store you mentioned that including vacancies and credit loss it would have had about 100 basis point impact not sure if you have it but interested in what that would have been in terms of impact for the full year how much of that was credit loss versus vacancy and just as you think about credit loss in 2020 any sort of color on what you re forecasting here even if just relative 20 versus 19 brooks g gordon managing director head of asset management so this is brooks in terms of credit losses we make assumptions that are baked into our guidance i don t have the specific percentage right in front of me but in any given year we re always assuming some portion of credit loss our expectations are historically that we would actually perform better than that i ll say with respect to the drag on same store that s a 100 basis points is a good placeholder and we intend to disclose more of that going forward i think our real world experience in recent years has been somewhat better than that and so we do think that s a good placeholder for the moment and you ll see more disclosure from us on that in the future jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst and that 100 basis points that is both a mix of credit loss and vacancy impact right so should we think about that half and half or is there any sort of rough ballpark brooks g gordon managing director head of asset management yeah i think the rough ballpark i think half and half is probably a good assumption for example that workout that i just mentioned and toni mentioned certainly plays into that number jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst great thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from emmanuel korchman with citi please proceed emmanuel korchman citi research analyst hey good morning everyone just maybe one for toni the dispositions can we talk about the timing and the expected yields on those throughout the year toni sanzone managing director chief financial officer for the upcoming year or what we ve experienced emmanuel korchman citi research analyst for the upcoming year toni sanzone managing director chief financial officer sure i think i mean i think the timing is pretty well spread at this point in time i don t really see any significant weighting i mean i think the pipeline is something we actively work on brooks can you give some color on this just a breakdown of how we re looking at that brooks g gordon managing director head of asset management yeah so the obviously we ve announced one transaction which was already closed which was the operating hotel the disposition pipeline is pretty evenly spread over the year but historically that has tended to slip closer toward the end of the year but we do expect it to be pretty well spread out from a deal makeup perspective the 40 of that expected disposition volume is what we call non core again the vast majority of that being that operating hotel and minimal vacant asset sales kind of about 5 to 7 of that with the balance kind of roughly split between residual risk management and opportunistic sales it s about 60 international 40 us and pretty evenly split across property types emmanuel korchman citi research analyst great thanks and jason going back to a comment you made you said that you re sort of maybe broadening the types of properties you looked at you pointed out the stanley black decker deal does that then put you in a situation where you re competing with the different competitive set of other investors and how do you think about your cost of capital on your sort of operating advantages versus theirs when you re operating in a different asset category jason e fox chief executive officer board member yeah i mean on the margin there probably are some different competitors that will compete against especially as you get into higher quality more infill or tier 1 markets i think where we differentiate ourselves on a lot of those deals is our ability to execute the focus is still going to be on sale leasebacks we can drive some yield relative to what the market typically bears to the extent there is complexity in the upfront structuring that will play well into us but our cost of capital has gotten stronger and we can do deals like the stanley black decker deal that s kind of a well below 6 cap rate and still generate sufficient spreads to our cost of capital we re not going to win all of those deals of course but we do have very good relationships within the net lease community we think we ll get first look and last look at a lot of these and that s an advantage to us as well so again we look at that as more incremental to our deal volume we re going to continue to focus and do lots of deals in the traditional space where we can generate cap rates of north of 6 and even north of 7 in some circumstances emmanuel korchman citi research analyst great thank you jason e fox chief executive officer board member welcome operator thank you thank you we do have an additional question from sheila mcgrath with evercore please proceed sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst yes jason i saw an article in crain s that you guys were thinking about doing something new in chicago maybe redevelop or expanded a building at clinton street i was wondering if you could just give us some information on that opportunity jason e fox chief executive officer board member yeah sure it s a great asset that we ve owned for a while i ll let brooks give some color on what our possibilities are for that asset brooks g gordon managing director head of asset management sure so it s an office asset in the west loop in chicago it has a way below market rent and the tenant doesn t have any renewal option so we have an excellent opportunity to push economics there we also own a parking lot directly adjacent and so the article i believe you re mentioning references the planned expansion that we re working on for that site it s early days but it s a very very good opportunity with an extremely attractive site and so hopefully hear more about that soon sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst okay great and that s currently not in the investments in the supplemental correct brooks g gordon managing director head of asset management no it is not sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst okay thank you operator thank you at this time i m not showing any further questions i ll now hand the call back to mr sands peter

business activity index posted 53 3 in february down from 53 9 in january but still the second highest since september 2018 the slowdown partly reflected weaker demand from abroad as signalled by a renewed fall in new export orders during february analysts at fxpro told alliance news a trend reversal prevailed throughout the week on the markets the dollar index reversed to decline after almost daily growth since early february the data probably helps to stop the rally of the american currency the pmi indices published at the beginning of the day in the eurozone and the uk exceeded expectations the pmi composite remained at 53 3 at 18 month highs rejecting fears that an outbreak of coronavirus is already affecting the mood of purchasing managers a similar situation in the eurozone where the pmi index grew to the highest level since august reacting to the ecb s soft policy more than the threat of a slowdown in asia the same figure from the us suddenly went into the region below 50 after three months of growth there is already a business reaction to the threat from china it is still difficult to rely on positive notes of data from europe but they turned out to be enough to launch a friday pullback when markets moved against the trends that prevailed during the week the euro stood at usd1 0863 at the european equities close up from usd1 0794 late thursday following a slew of data releases from the continent the eurozone saw business activity increase to a six month high in february flash estimates from ihs markit showed the ihs markit flash eurozone composite pmi rose slightly to 51 6 points in february from 51 3 in january any reading over 50 indicates expansion despite the only modest increase february s reading marked a six month high the flash services pmi rose slightly to 52 8 in february from 52 5 the previous month while the manufacturing pmi improved to 49 1 from 47 9 though remaining in contraction territory the surprise uptick in the key european pmis in february suggests that the disruption from coronavirus is not yet overwhelming the positive effects of lower political uncertainty following the phase 1 us china deal and the uk election with a bit of luck this will largely continue in the next few months however economic activity remains vulnerable to disruptions linked to coronavirus which will take time to fully show up said berenberg economist holger schmieding meanwhile inflation in the eurozone rose in january on an annual basis but declined month on month data from eurostat showed the eurozone s annual inflation rate measured by the consumer price index was 1 4 in january up from 1 3 in december the eurozone flash estimate for january released last month was 1 4 on a monthly basis inflation fell 1 0 in january from a 0 3 rise in december both readings came in line with consensus estimates the european central bank targets inflation of below but close to 2 over the medium term against the yen the dollar was trading at jpy111 72 down from jpy112 10 late thursday stocks in new york were lower at the london equities close amid coronavirus fears additionally declines were compounded after data showed activity in the us manufacturing and services sectors stalled in february the djia was down 0 8 the s p 500 index down 0 80 and the tech heavy nasdaq composite down 1 2 us services and manufacturing sector activity suffered in february as companies become more concerned about the potential effects of the coronavirus markit said the flash us services purchasing managers index reading for february came in at 49 4 down sharply from 53 4 in january which markit said was the lowest since october 2013 the services pmi reading missed market consensus estimates of 53 0 a score above the neutral 50 0 mark indicates expansion while one below points to contraction the flash manufacturing pmi score registered at 50 8 in february down from 51 9 in january a six month low the reading missed the consensus estimate of 51 5 ihs markit said the upturn in output was the softest since last july with firms stating that weak demand conditions and delays in deliveries following the outbreak of the coronavirus in china had dented production growth brent oil was quoted at usd57 80 a barrel at the london equities close down sharply from usd59 75 at the close thursday oil prices

officer thanks stefanie and thank you all for joining us today before i review our 2019 achievements and provide operating and regulatory updates i want to look forward to the future and share more information about our focus areas and priorities our strategy is anchored by four concepts that align with industry trends and shape the way we do business those concepts can most simply be stated as clean affordable reliable and customer focused let me talk briefly about each one clean is about decarbonizing our generation mix with our new goal to deliver 100 clean carbon free energy by 2050 affordable is planning and operating our business to maintain reasonable electricity prices for the people businesses and communities we serve reliable means serving our customers with dependable power safely and efficiently and customer focused is about developing new solutions products and services to meet the changing needs and expectations of our customers with these in mind we created a long term plan and targets to track our progress along the way first we recently announced our goal to deliver 100 clean carbon free electricity to customers by 2050 this goal includes a near term target of 65 clean energy with 45 coming from renewables by 2030 and a commitment to exit coal by 2031 importantly our plan includes flexibility to ensure that we re able to execute in a way that maintains affordability for customers as jim will discuss we expect this plan will require considerable capital investment we believe a carbon free future as possible while keeping customer rates over time at or below the rate of inflation with timely recovery of clean energy investments to support the affordability of our transition to a carbon free resource mix we will have a sharp focus on economic development in arizona growing our customer base allocates these costs across more customers which helps keep rates affordable and increase the shareholder value by growing our company supporting an internal culture focused on reducing costs and maintaining a financially strong company to access low cost capital are also key in delivering a 100 clean energy future affordably in the area of reliability we believe putting the responsibility on the utility to maintain high performing well run resources is important in pursuit of our clean energy plan we will acquire resources that appropriately balance reliability cost and flexibility for our customers this includes both owning new resources and considering supplemental generation from purchase power as appropriate our fourth concept reinforces that customers are at the core of what we do every day we re committed to providing options that make it easier to do business with us we plan to continue developing innovative programs that connect customers with advanced technologies to help manage their bill in addition we ll be convening an advisory panel of customers to gain a deeper understanding of the customer experience through individual perspective so a little design basis thinking as we work to execute in all these strategic areas we ll focus on strengthening our relationships with stakeholders going forward we plan to continue working collaboratively with those who have vested interest in arizona s future and our company s role as the state s largest electricity provider for our regulators we are committed to maintaining an open dialog listening and ensuring transparency we have a lot of important work ahead of us and we ll be sharing information about our progress as we advance through the year and while i m excited about our future opportunities i also want to recognize our team and the hard work completed last year we finished 2019 with our best ever reliability performance if you exclude outages from voluntary proactive fire mitigation efforts and palo verde once again achieved a capacity factor above 90 our goal to reach 100 clean carbon free energy by 2050 is new but our efforts to move toward a cleaner energy mix are not in 2019 we maintained our environmental social and governance a rating from msci and we were ranked in the electric utility sectors top quartile by sustainalytics notably aps was one of 10 american companies and the only u s utility to make cdp s a list for both climate change and water security in 2019 and we accomplished all this while reducing the average residential bill by 7 8 or 11 68 on average since january of 2018 due primarily to savings from federal tax reform and operating cost savings that have been passed on to customers 2019 was also a busy year for our state regulatory team some of the work that we began in 2019 will continue this year key dockets for 2020 include our rate case retail choice disconnection rules and modifications to the commission s energy rules a number of workshops have already been scheduled to discuss these topics and you can find a list of key dates in the appendix to our slides the next milestone in our rate case proceeding is may 20 the date the commission staff and other interveners file testimony however i would note that commission staff has indicated that they may need an extension to watch that proceeding outside of our regulated operations our bright canyon subsidiary acquired minority equity stakes in two wind farms being developed by tenaska the 242 megawatt clear creek wind farm in missouri and the 250 megawatt nobles 2 wind farm in minnesota we expect these wind farms to be operational in q1 and q4 of this year respectively our objective with these investments is to gain experience in the construction ownership and operation of wind assets and to partner with a proven developer in tenaska our overall strategy with bright canyon is to develop own operate and acquire infrastructure within the electric energy industry investments in renewables electric transmission and microgrids represent some of the opportunities that bright canyon has been evaluating and i want to emphasize that these are close adjacencies we will continue to pursue attractive growth opportunities consistent with our core strength we have ambitious goals and a talented team to achieve them at the officer level i recently made changes to our organizational structure that better aligns our experience and talent to our strategic focus areas and to strengthen our succession pipeline i m excited about our future all the possibilities and the team i have the privilege of working with before i turn it over to jim for a financial discussion i want to do three quick shoutouts first to the team at palo verde for their work on a short notice outage at unit 3 in getting the necessary work done safely and the unit back online ahead of schedule and second to our t d engineering and construction team for their outstanding work on the new substations associated with the microsoft datacenter build out and third to the arizona state sun devils for their win last night over 14 oregon so jim go ahead and take it away james r hatfield executive vice president and chief administrative officer thank you jeff and thank you again everyone for joining us today this morning we reported our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 before i review the details of our 2019 results let me briefly touch on some of the key factors from the quarter which can be found on slide 3 for the fourth quarter of 2019 we earned 0 57 per share compared to 0 23 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 our results were largely impacted by a one time tax refund to customers related to the team iii refund and lower adjusted o m expenses we also experienced another quarter of mild weather for the full year 2019 we earned 4 77 per share compared to 4 54 per share in 2018 2019 earnings reflect our growing infrastructure to support the strong phoenix economy and 2 customer growth other key items for 2019 was negative weather which decreased gross margin by 37 million or 0 25 per share the negative impact was more than offset by lower o m year over year lower adjusted o m expense increased earnings 0 52 per share primarily driven by lower planned outage expenses and lower public outreach costs at the parent level as i mentioned last quarter we are committed to enhancing our customer and shareholder value through cost management the implementation of lean sigma will be the mechanism that allows us to improve the customer and employee experience while eliminating waste as a result of our cost management efforts we made great strides in reducing o m in 2019 allowing us to reach the low end of our original guidance range despite the mildest metro phoenix cooling season on 10 years we expect to continue our cost savings efforts by reducing o m approximately 20 million in 2020 as jeff mentioned in his comments we are on a path to deliver 100 clean carbon free electricity part of that plan includes ending our use of coal fired generation seven years earlier than previously projected as a result the reduction in fuel costs as we use less fossil fuels and more renewables will be a source of cost savings to our customers in the future our journey to a carbon free future will require intelligent investments in renewable resources and developing technologies as you can see on slide 14 we rolled forward our capex forecast for one year our 2022 capex forecast reflects nearly 800 million of investment related to new clean generation resources and reflects our conservative mix of owned resources while we don t know the exact mix of ownership versus purchase power at this point we will need an appropriate mix to ensure long term value and reliability for customers that said we believe there is potential upside to our capital investments especially as we get past 2022 as jeff alluded to customer affordability will be top of mind we would expect customer rates to increase no more than the rate of inflation over time in terms of financing our clean energy future we would expect that we will issue equity sometime after 2020 while the exact amount has not yet been determined we would expect the amount to be in the 300 million to 400 million range the timing of the offering around the next rate case minimizes dilution and is ultimately accretive for our shareholders our financial health including a solid equity layer will continue to provide our customers the benefits of low cost access to capital and competitive returns to our shareholders in 2020 we expect to issue up to 1 billion of term debt at aps and 450 million that pinnacle west overall liquidity remain strong in the fourth quarter aps issued 300 million of new 30 year unsecured debt at 3 5 we used the proceeds to repay commercial paper and to fund a 100 million of our 250 million par value 2 2 notes which matured in mid january at the end of the fourth quarter pinnacle west had a 115 million of short term debt outstanding and aps had no short term debt outstanding due to the tax benefits associated with both the team phase ii and phase iii and optimized use of income tax incentives our effective tax rate for 2019 was a negative 2 9 we anticipate an effective tax rate in 2020 of 14 continued use of income tax incentives including tax credits associated with clean generation investments will reduce cash taxes in the year projects our projects are placed in service a quick note on pension the funded status of our pension remains healthy at 97 as of year end 2019 this is due to strong portfolio returns during 2019 continued contributions and the continued success of our liability driven investment strategy which has helped mitigate risk to our benefit plan funded status 2019 was a great year for economic development in our service territory we saw high profile data centers and manufacturing plants break ground in the west valley we successfully connected two new data centers to our power grid included in the microsoft data center and begin prep work to add an additional six data center feeds in 2020 in addition to growth from the commercial sector arizona is benefiting from residential population growth according to a december 2019 report from the u s census bureau arizona ranked third in population growth behind texas and florida arizona s population grew by approximately 120 000 people between july 2018 and july 2019 reflecting the steady improvement in economic conditions aps retail customer base grew 2 2 in the fourth quarter of 2019 we expect that this growth rate will continue in response to the economic trends in our service territory the metro phoenix area continues to show strong job growth and has consistently been above the national average in 2019 employment in metro phoenix increased 2 9 compared to 1 6 for the entire u s construction employment in metro phoenix increased by 9 6 and manufacturing employment increased by 5 2 according to the u s bureau of labor statistics arizona s job growth ranked second in the nation in 2019 the metro phoenix residential real estate market has also continued its upward trend in 2020 we expect a total of 31 100 housing permits driven by both single family and multifamily permits we continue to expect pinnacle west s consolidated earnings for 2020 to be in the range of 4 75 to 4 95 per share a complete list of key factors and assumptions underlying our 2020 guidance can be found on slide 6 and 7 in closing our long term rate base growth outlook remains intact at 6 to 7 and we expect to achieve a weather normalized annual consolidated earned return on average common equity of more than 9 5 in 2020 the new year is off to a great start with the announcement of our bold clean energy plan coupled with organic growth in our service territory we are excited to embark on a path that will help create a healthy and prosperous arizona that benefits our customers communities and shareholders this concludes our prepared remarks i ll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now be conducting a question and answer session thank you our first question comes from the line of michael weinstein with credit suisse please proceed with your question michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hi good morning guys jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hey michael michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hey could you talk about the you mentioned that there would be potentially some upside after 2022 in the capital plan as a result of your carbon reduction and greenhouse gas goals trying to achieve that going forward is there any way maybe we could kind of frame that up and talk about some more of the specific opportunities you see ahead particularly maybe in battery storage or in generation jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well on average between now and to hit the interim target at 2030 we re going to need at least 300 megawatts of battery storage and 300 megawatts to 500 megawatts of other resources to meet that goal and so ultimately you have some competing plans out there all toward green and clean but at different dates and want to see exactly how it plays out but we re being very conservative in how we think about our capex budgets at this point michael weinstein credit suisse analyst got you and i think maybe i missed this but did you talk about equity needs going forward i know it s a little bit early considering the rate case is still pending and everything but can you talk about the normalized equity need going forward and what how that might change depending on the outcome of the case jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well so we don t expect to issue equity in 2020 michael we expect the next offering we have will be in the 300 million to 400 million range it will be teed up closer to the next rate filing but a lot of that will be what it shakes out ultimately and the capital expenditures as we move forward ppa versus owned operator does that complete your question michael weinstein credit suisse analyst no is that block equity or atm type equity jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer we haven t decided the how yet at this point so we ll have to details will follow on that as we get closer michael weinstein credit suisse analyst okay got you thank you very much jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thanks michael operator our next question comes from the line of greg gordon with evercore please proceed with your question greg gordon evercore analyst thanks good morning jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer morning greg greg gordon evercore analyst a couple of questions so other than the rider that you have for aps solar communities which i believe is for rooftop which we should be assuming that to move this capital through into rates that i think you ve already said this pretty explicitly you will need to file another rate case post the one that s going to be closing this year too or you ll be in sort of serial filing mode to get these investments into revenues is that fair jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer it may depend a little bit greg on kind of how the how this case moves forward we ve got an res adjustment mechanism there s some potential for that to come into play i think what you see is if you move with a more traditional rate basing process then yeah you would be looking at rate cases that would be filed periodically to reflect the changing capital but one of the things i think we d like to have a conversation with the commission about is are there either mechanisms we have today or other ways that we can look at doing that so that we re not in serial rate making mode greg gordon evercore analyst understood and then when i look at the 2022 rate base target or aspiration it s it just looks a little bit low to me relative to the increase in capex maybe i m wrong but should i presume that the cwip balances would be perhaps a bit larger and the afudc portion of your income statement would be a little bit bigger in 22 james r hatfield executive vice president and chief administrative officer you know greg this is jim i know this slide is 2020 to 2022 that 6 to 7 we think is a long term outlook and when necessary it just reflects the debt the period that shown the math looking at what s shown is more like 8 but we re looking at into the future greg gordon evercore analyst no i understand that i m making i m asking a more basic question when i think about the earnings guidance for this year with afudc expected to be 35 million plus or minus that s on slide 6 james r hatfield executive vice president and chief administrative officer yeah greg gordon evercore analyst i m just sort of saying like maybe i m stating the obvious but as your capital expenditures accelerate up that cwip and therefore the contribution to earnings from afudc should grow james r hatfield executive vice president and chief administrative officer that would be correct greg greg gordon evercore analyst okay final question guys i think there was some work the puc sorry the acc outside of the tucson case and outside of the your pending case has been workshopping several different issues including making a policy decision on how to deal with fair value adjustment how to deal with post test year adjustments in rate cases and i think there was one other item which frankly i m embarrassed i can t remember but i think you hopefully you are knowledgeable about to what i m referencing and could you give us an update on that where those stand on those two or three items barbara lockwood senior vice president public policy arizona public service company yes greg this is barbara lockwood there has been some conversation about taking a look at those outside of rate cases frankly there hasn t been much activity on that recently they ve been focused on some other topics greg gordon evercore analyst okay so there s no sort of formal process for coming up with policy statements on those would like a date certain barbara lockwood senior vice president public policy arizona public service company no there s not not at this time greg gordon evercore analyst okay thank you very much take care jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thanks greg james r hatfield executive vice president and chief administrative officer thanks greg operator our next question comes from the line of insoo kim with goldman sachs please proceed with your question insoo kim goldman sachs analyst thank you first question could you maybe give a little bit of an update on your thoughts on the telecom petition docket and couple of the proposal that were made and just your thoughts on the feasibility of that and what potential impact that could have on the system and on aps as well jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yeah insoo it s jeff the process there has been some draft rule proposals that were put out and if we want to go into any more detail let barbara talk about it but one of the major challenges we have here in arizona is that we re not in an organized market and to make the retail competition effective i think you ve really got to be in an rto and have that underlying framework and you ve also got to have a fair amount of infrastructure around resource adequacy we re in a time if you go back to the original competition discussion back in the early 2000s there was a lot more capacity there was an overbuild of capacity and so capacity was not as tight we re in a much tighter capacity markets so it would be really risky to move forward without strong resource adequacy frameworks and this is a pretty lean commission and so how you would put in place the infrastructure that would ensure resource adequacy how would you deal with the market structure that moves beyond scheduling independent scheduling administrator which is what we had in the last go around into an actual rto type of independent system operator and then how would you actually address the arbitrage the gaming that could happen around the trading and prices and customer facing situation so it s just really difficult for me to see how you put all those in place to make this effective but obviously this is early in the discussion on where those rules are and so we ll engage and share that perspective with the commission insoo kim goldman sachs analyst got it thank you for the insight and the second question just going back to the storage and other clean energy investments i think the 300 of storage and the 300 megawatts to 500 megawatts of other resources what time frame was that for and i heard a 2030 timeframe and i didn t know what the overall opportunity set you may have spoken about in this next 10 year period jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yeah insoo i was referencing the sort of interim 45 renewables target in 2030 and over that timeframe from now to 2030 our need is about 300 megawatts a year of battery storage and 300 megawatts to 500 megawatts of renewable generation a year in that timeframe insoo kim goldman sachs analyst got it when i was just looking at the clean energy investments in 2021 and 2022 it seems like the dollar amounts if you do some rough math would imply pretty high hundreds of megawatts i don t know if it s what you re talking about already been captured in this next couple of years or am i doing the math wrong jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer no it s been captured remember it s an average over the timeframe but yeah we see significant opportunity in storage and renewables insoo kim goldman sachs analyst got it okay i ll follow up thank you jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from the line of julien dumoulin smith with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning team can you hear me jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hey julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey howdy just to follow up and clarify the early equity commentary when you talk about that 300 million to 400 million it seems as if that you re basically saying 2021 upon rate case resolution just also want to clarify does that include 2022 or these contemplate no equity in 22 as you true up your capital structure in 21 given that you ve now provide a capex in 22 so sorry for all that detail but i wanted to clarify that jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yeah no julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah go forward jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer i would just say julien if i imply that was going to be in 2021 that wasn t what i was trying to imply i was just trying to imply as we look out we see our capex we ll need to issue equity to support the capital structure into the next rate case no assumption on when that rate case would be filed julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay and just to clarify that that is reflective of the capex at least through 22 as it says they re not necessarily indicative of like perhaps equity subsequently post 22 right jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yeah this is just the next time we go to market i expect it to be in a 300 million to 400 million range and that will be refined based on what we ultimately do on the capex front and so on julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it excellent thank you and then the second question coming back to the rate case dynamics obviously it s a little bit more protracted here how do you think about settlement and the timing of having those settlement conversations just given how long of a process it and then just to what well i ll leave easy jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yeah the originally if you remember julien that there was a lot of discussion this was a case that we were directed to file by the commission and i think that the assumption was that this would be a fully litigated rate case obviously we would i think like to talk about settlement i think there is a lot of benefits of settling cases particularly in the sense that you can come up with solutions that both sides you can have a win win kind of an outcome and often in litigated cases you re much more in a binary outcome where it s kind of one or the other and so i think there s value in settlement it s probably too early we haven t even got in it if staffer has been our testimony yeah that s going to come in may likely and so it s early yet to see if there is a dynamic that could come into play there but just to be realistic the commission has said that this is a case that they want to see fully litigated so if that changes or if the opportunity presents itself i think we d certainly be interested in doing that but that s not the path that we re on right now julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and just to clarify that that has not changed in recent months there at least your understanding on this case jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yeah and again julien this is also kind of early in the process where it too haven t really done anything because normally that s going to come after you see staff and intervenor testimony come in julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right excellent thank you all very much jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer okay thanks julien operator our next question comes from the line of paul patterson with glenrock associates please proceed with your question paul patterson glenrock associates analyst hey good morning jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hey paul paul patterson glenrock associates analyst so first question sort of on the renewable energy sort of outlook and potential cost impacts you guys are putting more effort in renewable energy costs have come way down i m just wondering how you when you look at your rate base and your capex projections and everything obviously there s going to be lots of variables but what are you guys thinking about what the potential rate impact might be with this outlook jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yeah paul what we ve really been focused on is trying to manage through this plan with essentially real prices remaining flat so keep the rate pressure at or below the rate of inflation and obviously part of what you can look at with that is as you put more storage resources into the system you re able to trade out some fuel expense and so i think we re probably 1 billion or so of fuel expense right now in what we ve seen so if you can do a little fuel for steel you re able to translate that fuel expense into you had rate base growth but importantly it takes the rate pressure off customers so that you re able to make that trade out and get the capital investment but also mitigate the rate impacts and really important other component to this plan is the work that we ve been doing you see it reflected in and i think some of the earnings that we re able to announce this quarter is the work around lean six sigma transformation where we re trying to really look at doing work differently and eliminate waste and streamline processes and that s going to be important because we ve got to keep the o m flat or lower so as you re making these capital investments you re not just putting the rate increases through to consumers and so it s going to have to be a combination of that looking at how you can do some fuel for steel and save on fuel expense and then how you can find the o m savings and then just a third component which is different from the internal pieces but is just driving growth in the state and so when you see the large high load factor customers come in like the data centers they pick up a significant amount of the fixed costs and so you re able to more efficiently use the system and so it s really tying those three things together that we think can help mitigate rate pressures on us paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay great and then i guess sort of on the other element that you mentioned at the beginning of the call this rate design issue and as you know this it seems to me at least from watching all of this that the rate design issue that was implemented in the last rate cases caused or really actually probably caused a lot of the regulatory issues that we re now encountering and i know that you guys are trying to do customer education and what have you but coming from sort of from more of a consumer perspective like technology and stuff when you have to educate the consumer that sometimes has seen in of itself is being kind of a drawback and i m wondering whether or not there is an effort of maybe thinking about and i don t really see it i guess in the current rate case and it s there i apologize but the idea of maybe just simplifying the whole thing because i m not i guess what i m wondering is customers may not want to be educated i m saying in other words they might want simplicity and so i m just wondering i know you guys are doing a stakeholder thing and discussing it with stakeholders and what have you but i m wondering if there is any plan potentially of sort of making it so that you don t have what we i guess sort of have come up with in which you have people sort of having a really difficult time with we ve just sort of dealing outside of rates just the complexity of what at least some of these customers seem to be dealing with jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yeah paul a couple of points to that first is we are absolutely looking at those issues we ve got a proposal in the case for essentially a flat bill so similar to what you see cellphone companies offer which is here s what your monthly plan would be it s fixed we don t do a true up at the end there is a nuance to that that actually says if you tie it to allowing us to put a smart thermostat in the house you ve get a lower risk rate on that but what s really important you re i think you re going to see this still continue across commission s around the country as you move into this advanced energy economies since we re making this transition there is absolutely a role for customers not just commercial and industrial and we re working a lot with some of our commercial and industrial customers who are asking for demand side options so that they can manage around the prices that we see at the wholesale level the duck curve issue that we ve got which is causing wholesale prices to be very low or negative in the middle of the day and then the need to shift load off into the evening hours when you ve got no solar production coming onto the grid and so the commercial industrial customers are absolutely taking advantage of that a lot of the rate design pieces are simply to align rates that we ve had for decades we ve had time of use in demand rates in our service territory for decades so the rate concepts aren t new the issue was that if you have a 12 to seven peak period and you ve got negative prices occurring at noon that is a crazy price signal to send customers there s no way you can long term operate a system with that kind of time of use period and so the first change is shifting the time of use off to three to eight which aligns us with what we actually see as the peak and get some of that shift and then with the demand rates we ve had the largest demand rate participation in the country for again decades because in arizona a lot of cases you ve got two air conditioners when you have a demand rate your average your consumption your energy costs the cents per kilowatt hour is lower because it s picked up on a demand charge and even back 20 years ago there were technologies like load controllers that could allow customers to manage their demand and so yeah we re going through education process but what we re seeing in the rate design is real customer response to those price signals we re seeing customers who are able to take advantage of demand response programs with smart thermostats that we simply would not be able to offer without that rate design and really importantly as you move forward this just doesn t to me you can t leave residential customers out of this advanced energy economy and we have to be able to take advantage of the thermal storage that s in the 1 1 million residential homes that we have in our service territory through smart water heater smart thermostats things like that and none of that really works without the rate design so sorry for the long answer but to try to get to your question yeah let s put together some options like the flat bill so that we can target or give something to folks who really don t want to do that recognize that there are a lot of folks who don t want to worry about it so now there is technology like smart thermostats that can do it without them having to actively do things i think increasingly you ll see the technology take the consumer behavior out of the equation and they ll just be doing things and the customer won t notice but to get to that point you ve got to have these price signals that are there so again sorry for long answer but that s how we re thinking about it paul patterson glenrock associates analyst i appreciate it thanks a lot operator our next question comes from the line of charles fishman with morningstar please proceed with your question charles fishman morningstar analyst hi the only thing i had left is the disconnect policy that you brought up last quarter i see it s still on the bullet points on your 2020 drivers did that get resolved between the 20 million and 30 million james r hatfield executive vice president and chief administrative officer so that 20 million and 30 million was our projection going into 2020 keep in mind you re just now having people come off the sort of form of payment plan and so a lot of this is we ll see later this year what that impact will be we did increase our bad debt reserve last year in june so we are picking some of that in just our reserve but where that shakes out remains to be seen we will ultimately adjust that reserve once we have an annualized pattern that we feel good that that s the right amount jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer okay but charles the rulemaking still the rulemaking is still under way at the commission so they ve not landed on final rules for that yet charles fishman morningstar analyst okay got it that s all i had thank you very much jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thanks charles operator our next question comes from the line of david peters with wolfe research please proceed with your question david peters wolfe research analyst yeah hey good morning guys jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hey david james r hatfield executive vice president and chief administrative officer good morning david peters wolfe research analyst i would be curious just to kind of get your guys view of the legislation that s been proposed to potentially move the acc to an appointed commission do you sense there is a level of support for this at the legislature and from voters or should we expect to kind of see a similar result that we saw in the past jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yeah i think david the it didn t get out through a committee there is a committee that it failed out of and that was exactly the comment that was made is that the committee members that they believed it was important to allow the voters to have the right to elect the commission and so it s working its way through the process right now just again to be clear this was not something that we proposed or that we were trying to move forward with and just to give you a flavor on that i think if it were and so it s still unclear as to whether it would ultimately get out of the house but are out of legislature to the ballot it would then have to go to the ballot so then you d have to actually have voters decide to do this and as you know i made the commitment that we weren t going to participate in commission elections i think within the spirit of that commitment we would not be participating in something like an independent expenditure to try to promote this because i just think that would be too close to violating the spirit of what we are committed to do with the commission so legislature will do what they re doing but and i think we said we d work with commissioners obviously whether appointed or elected but if this will be a long road david peters wolfe research analyst great and then just quickly on the bright canyon business as you kind of think about it today do you expect or is the intention to ever get to the scale of where it s kind of a material earnings driver for you guys jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yeah it s a little early in that but i think when you look at the adjacency opportunities that s what i try to emphasize in the prepared remarks is that we re not trying to go out far beyond what we believe is really core expertise so we ve got expertise and working with the with wind and solar we re working on more expertise around battery storage we ve got we had phenomenal performance at our microgrid we had an event in yuma with the microgrid that we had installed for the marine corps air station where they actually lost the substation and in eight seconds that microgrid kicked in and picked up the entire load of the base from a black start held the load until the substation was repaired and then was able to seamlessly transition the base back into service so for what the military is looking for in their base resiliency work those kind of projects are good we ve got great expertise i think in doing those and so a little early to see how much is really there but i don t want to leave that expertise untapped and so we are looking at how we can expand bright canyon into more opportunities like that but it s a competitive environment we re not going to do something that doesn t make sense obviously for our investors but we do think there is some opportunity there david peters wolfe research analyst great thank you operator our next question is a follow up question from michael weinstein with credit suisse please proceed with your question michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hey guys just a quick one how much equity is usually issued through the employee plans every year and how much can that absorb of the future 300 million to 400 million james r hatfield executive vice president and chief administrative officer so we don t have an employee plan we have a drip and i think the revenue through the drip is 11 million 12 million a year it s not significant michael weinstein credit suisse analyst got you okay all right thank you jeffrey b guldner chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hey thanks michael operator thank you we have no further questions at this time i would now like to turn

tesla s stock market value is already bigger than ford and general motors combined says a report in forbes magazine elon musk s company had already received nearly 5 billion in federal subsidies by 2015 helping him amass a net worth of 31 billion who says the government can t make anyone rich but hold on an ascendant bernie sanders has called for a massive expansion of government run electricity production he claims to be no friend of billionaires and is running against multiple billionaires including two democrat candidates and 23 contributors to mayor pete s campaign but he sure is helping the rich sanders and many other politicos have championed a multi state effort to end the sale of vehicles with internal combustion ic engines so have several european nations related goals include phasing out coal oil and natural gas for heating electric power generation and other uses as politico reports a major part of sanders 16 trillion greener new deal allocates massive new funding for the four existing power marketing administrations that are overseen by the department of energy tennessee valley authority and a new federal agency the money would go to vastly expand their solar wind and even geothermal power production matt palumbo writing in the bongino report says the sanders plan will need 2 trillion just for infrastructure dwarfing the cost of the interstate highway system to add 800 gigawatts of intermittent weather dependent wind and solar energy right now sanders insists that he is not nationalizing energy production but merely providing wholesale energy to public and private local suppliers however these subsidized government run facilities will surely control the energy market that looks like nationalization in all but official nomenclature private companies that now rely on coal or natural gas will be further squeezed by mandated deep cuts in co2 emissions meanwhile energy demand for a mandated and growing fleet of electric vehicles evs will soar requiring still more wind turbines solar panels backup batteries transmission lines and as i note in a recent article about electric buses metals minerals and mining demands on unprecedented scales coupled with rampant environmental destruction child labor and horrific increases in cancer and other diseases from the absence of workplace safety and pollution control standards americans have expressed great displeasure over subsidizing evs for the wealthy a recent american energy alliance poll found only one in five voters would trust the federal government to make decisions about what kinds of cars should be subsidized or mandated many do not even like or cannot afford the innovations already introduced for internal combustion vehicles as evidenced by data showing that the average age of the u s vehicle fleet has increased in recent years who can blame them for being angry wealthy ev buyers can get 7500 federal and up to 2500 state tax credits not just deductions free or low cost charging at stations installed at taxpayer and electricity consumer cost and access to hov lanes even with no passengers ev drivers pay no gasoline tax and thus pay nothing for road construction repair and maintenance and as states go green and eliminate fossil fuel and nuclear power average americans will have to endure the eyesores noise habitat destruction and wildlife losses that will come with millions of more wind turbines and solar panels nevertheless despite public qualms most automakers have joined the ev movement like gossip in a small town proposals and promises to ban or end the production of ic engines have spread like wildfire the chinese owned swedish automaker volvo announced in 2017 it would stop designing new ic engines german giant daimler mercedes benz followed suit last year and in the united states general motors in 2018 announced plans to offer only battery powered or hydrogen powered vehicles in the near future these automakers are perhaps just responding to the political climate in europe the united kingdom just moved up its cutoff date for banning sales of new ic vehicles to 2035 the uk ban would even include hybrids france and other countries are holding to a 2040 date for mandating all electric fleets while norway has set a goal not a mandate to eliminate most ic engines but not hybrids by 2025 but amazingly california lawmakers actually killed a 2018 effort to ban ic engines by 2040 meanwhile european automakers have moved to profit from ev charging stations ionity created in 2017 as a joint venture between the bmw group mercedes benz ag the ford motor company and the volkswagen group with audi and porsche has already built over 200 facilities with over 860 charging points it plans to expand to 400 facilities in 24 countries by yearend 2020 and ionity is not alone europe today still has over 100 000 petrol and diesel fueling stations certain to shrink as ic engines are now pariahs but how do europeans plan to charge all the electric cars trucks and buses if they must rely entirely on intermittent unreliable weather dependent super expensive wind and solar electricity before february 2020 ionity was charging a flat fixed rate of eight euros about 8 87 for a fast charging session that was less than 15 cents per kilowatt hour for a 60 kw charge that might be good for 210 miles on a continent where electricity prices are already 25 to 45 cents per kwh with eu gasoline prices ranging from 1 77 euros liter 7 35 per gallon in the netherlands to 4 41 gallon in romania drivers would need about 31 in romania or 51 in the netherlands to drive the same distance assuming 30 mpg even at these incredible and unsustainable bargain basement electricity prices but as of february 1 ionity switched to unit pricing at a rate of 0 79 euro kwh 88 cents kwh or about 52 80 for a 60 kw charge that s a 500 increase in the cost of charging your car just to travel a couple of hundred miles suddenly an ev charge is a whole lot more expensive than a fill up so ionity is offering discounts that customers can purchase from ionity partner companies at home chargers in the eu cost about 18 per 60 kw charge plus about 1 000 for installation that s at the average eu residential rate of 30 cents kwh twice the current u s average and that s before the mad rush to electric cars trucks and buses and the mad rush to expensive renewable energy how will poor and working classes afford this especially people who must drive to work or must use trucks in their small businesses who will subsidize their soaring costs the eu s increasingly stretched and impoverished middle class its millionaires and billionaires here s the rub for americans if sanders gets his way the federal government will control the price and availability of electricity in the usa california which wants to mandate evs only has already faced multi day electricity blackouts due to fire concerns and if there s no power there s no charging many other countries also lack reliable electric power and increasing electricity scarcity almost certain in a fossil fuel free environment drives up prices even in government controlled marketplaces after the 1970s oil embargo the united states opted for a broad based energy sector so that shortages in one fuel would not cripple the national economy but today many cities have already moved to ban oil coal and natural gas nuclear is still taboo and wind and solar are intermittent the push toward an all electric society plus heavy and rising burdens on the power grid from intermittent power generations and charging all electric vehicles looks like a recipe for disaster at least for the average consumer the well connected always do well enough in controlled economies at least until government policies send energy prices soaring and send angry poor and working class protesters into the streets to rage and rampage as has happened in iran france and chile but what can a we the governed do but submit to the will of the all powerful state envisioned by sanders and his fellow democrat presidential wannabes they re all insulated by their wealth and positions from the impacts of their policies but what about the rest of us state and federal ruling classes might be surprised at how liberty and opportunity loving americans respond duggan flanakin is director of policy research for the committee for a constructive tomorrow cfact

expected to close in the first quarter and contribute to 2020 production commencing in the second half of the year 2019 was a year of significant achievement for teranga and as a result we are a much stronger company and offer a significantly improved value proposition to our shareholders than just 12 months ago our second gold mine wahgnion is now in commercial production and we are preparing to complete our transformational acquisition of massawa a high grade top tier asset that neighbours our sabodala mine in senegal said richard young president and ceo with the advancements made in 2019 the course is set for an exciting year ahead as we start repositioning teranga as a low cost mid tier gold producer paul chawrun chief operating officer noted operationally sabodala has never been stronger and is well positioned to start processing feed from the massawa deposits in the second half of the year wahgnion is off to a very good start and plant throughput is above nameplate capacity reconciliation to reserves is largely in line save for some artisanal mining near surface in both active pits with our two gold producing assets running smoothly our attention in 2020 is turning to

reconciliation in the nogbele pit is slightly negative to reserves to 2019 year end however continues to improve as mining activities progress at depth below artisanal workings in the upper oxide zones with an overall positive reconciliation for january 2020 processing ramp up of the processing plant continued during the fourth quarter 2019 with production stabilizing at above nameplate capacity on november 1 2019 the processing plant achieved the design criteria and commercial production was declared the crusher feed blend comprised 74 oxide ore and 26 fresh hard rock modifications made to the crushing circuit combined with a drier ore feed due to the end of the rainy season increased crusher throughput mill throughput for fourth quarter 2019 was above plan at 0 7 million tonnes

of scheduled production endnotes 1 non ifrs financial measures the company provides some non ifrs financial measures as supplementary information that management believes may be useful to investors to explain the company s financial results beginning in the second quarter of 2013 we adopted an all in sustaining costs measure consistent with the guidance issued by the world gold council wgc on june 27 2013 of which teranga became a member on november 27 2018 the company believes that the use of all in sustaining costs is helpful to analysts investors and other stakeholders of the company in assessing its operating performance its ability to generate free cash flow from current operations and its overall value this measure is helpful to governments and local communities in understanding the economics of gold mining the all in sustaining costs is an extension of existing cash cost metrics and incorporate costs related to sustaining production total cash cost per ounce sold is a common financial performance measure in the gold mining industry but has no standard meaning under ifrs the company reports total cash costs on a sales basis we believe that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with ifrs certain investors use this information to evaluate the company s performance and ability to generate cash flow accordingly it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs the measure along with sales is considered to be a key indicator of a company s ability to generate operating profits and cash flow from its mining operations total cash costs figures are calculated in accordance with a standard developed by the gold institute which was a worldwide association of suppliers of gold and gold products and included leading north american gold producers the gold institute ceased operations in 2002 but the standard is considered the accepted standard of reporting cash cost of production in north america adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measure of other companies the wgc definition of all in sustaining costs seeks to extend the definition of total cash costs by adding corporate general and administrative costs reclamation and remediation costs including accretion and amortization exploration and study costs capital and expensed capitalized stripping costs and sustaining capital expenditures and represents the total costs of producing gold from current operations all in sustaining costs exclude income tax payments interest costs costs related to business acquisitions and items needed to normalize profits consequently this measure is not representative of all of the company s cash expenditures in addition the calculation of all in sustaining costs and all in costs does not include depreciation expense as it does not reflect the impact of expenditures incurred in prior periods therefore it is not indicative of the company s overall profitability the company also expands upon the wgc definition of all in sustaining costs by presenting an additional measure of all in sustaining costs excluding cash non cash inventory movements and amortized advanced royalty costs this measure excludes cash and non cash inventory movements and amortized advanced royalty costs which management does not believe to be true cash costs and are not fully indicative of performance for the period total cash costs per ounce all in sustaining costs per ounce and all in sustaining costs excluding cash non cash inventory movements and amortized advanced royalty costs per ounce are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized definition under ifrs and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs the measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under ifrs other companies may calculate these measures differently the following tables reconcile the most directly comparable ifrs measure to these non ifrs measures average realized price is a financial measure with no standard meaning under ifrs management uses this measure to better understand the price realized in each reporting period for gold and silver sales average realized price is calculated on revenue and ounces sold to all customers except franco nevada as gold ounces sold to franco nevada is recognized in revenue at 20 percent of the prevailing gold spot price on the date of delivery and 80 percent at 1 250 per ounce the average realized price is intended to provide additional information only and does not have any standardized definition under ifrs it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs other companies may calculate this measure differently ebitda is a non ifrs financial measure which excludes income tax and related expenses finance costs including accretion expense interest income and depreciation and amortization from net loss profit for the year in 2019 teranga amended the definition of ebitda to exclude accretion expense to improve comparability of this non ifrs financial measure with its peers the comparative 2018 ebitda has been restated to conform to the new presentation ebitda is intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts and do not have any standardized definition under ifrs and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs management believes that ebitda is a valuable indicator of our ability to generate liquidity by producing operating cash flow to fund working capital needs service debt obligations and fund capital expenditures beginning second quarter 2019 the company adopted adjusted ebitda as a new non ifrs financial measure management believes that adjusted ebitda is a valuable indicator of our ability to generate liquidity by producing operating cash flow to fund working capital needs service debt obligations and fund capital expenditures after adjusting for factors not reflective of the underlying performance of the company adjusted ebitda is intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts and does not have any standardized definition under ifrs and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs the company calculates adjusted ebitda as ebitda adjusted to exclude unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses gains and losses on derivative instruments non cash fair value changes impairment provisions and reversals thereof and other unusual or non recurring items free cash flow is a non ifrs financial measure the company calculates free cash flow as net cash flow provided by operating activities less sustaining capital expenditures the company believes this to be a useful indicator of our ability to generate cash for growth initiatives other companies may calculate this measure differently adjusted net loss profit attributable to shareholders and adjusted basic loss earnings per share are financial measures with no standard meaning under ifrs these non ifrs financial measures are used by management and investors to measure the underlying operating performance of the company presenting these measures from period to period is expected to help management and investors evaluate earnings trends more readily in comparison with results from prior periods the company calculates adjusted net loss profit attributable to shareholders as net loss profit for the year attributable to shareholders adjusted to exclude specific items that are significant but not reflective of the underlying operations of the company including the impact of unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses gains and losses on derivative instruments accretion expense on long term obligations the impact of foreign exchange movements on deferred taxes non cash fair value changes impairment provisions and reversals thereof and other unusual or non recurring items adjusted basic loss earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding under the basic method of earnings per share as determined under ifrs reconciliation of non ifrs measures the reconciliation

particular traded slightly lower against the greenback thanks to a survey showing weakening consumer sentiment in germany halt in production among several german companies operating in china dented consumers confidence the coronavirus epidemic has started to take a toll on such companies germany s forward looking consumer sentiment index is now projected to decline to 9 8 points in march from 9 9 points in february against another major currency the japanese yen the dollar rose 1 29 to 111 28 its highest since last may japan s economy contracted at the fastest pace in the december quarter in almost six years something that didn t bode well for the yen market pundits are now claiming that japan s economy is heading for a recession after the world s third largest economy saw its gdp decline 6 3 on an annual basis during the last quarter of 2019 and with two of the largest exporting nations signaling that they are in deep trouble economists are concerned about the growth of the global economy but the u s economy in the meantime has strengthened and eventually supported the greenback story continues dollar was supported by strong domestic housing data that showed a narrower than expected fall in u s new home construction while home permits soar to the highest level in 13 years what s more builder confidence continues to remain near an all time high after all mortgage rates recently hit a three year low boosting the country s housing market needless to say lower cost of home financing drove demand among potential buyers talking about the domestic economy both domestic

according to the institute of supply management its manufacturing index climbed to 50 9 in january from an upwardly revised 47 8 in december the index scaled beyond the 50 mark which separates expansion from contraction analysts by the way were expecting a reading of 48 5 strength in new orders production and employment supported the gains the non manufacturing index came in at 55 5 in january topping analysts estimate of 55 it was also higher than the december reading of 54 9 the non manufacturing sector thus saw uninterrupted expansion for the 120th consecutive month and indicated that the broader economy is on track for steady growth this year in the meantime the u s economy has been steadily adding new jobs as americans continue to return to the labor force further wage growth has improved according to the labor department the united states added a massive 225 000 jobs last month way higher than analyst expectations of 160 000 jobs it was also up from december s upwardly revised number of 147 000 in addition to december s positive revision non farm payrolls for the month of november increased by 5 000 to 256 000 and that means the economy added an average of 211 000 new jobs in the past three months a significant rise from last summer to top it fed s minutes supported the dollar s upward movement policymakers are cautiously optimistic about holding interest rates steady despite the coronavirus onslaught it s worth mentioning that any rate cuts could have compelled investors to sell dollar denominated assets eventually weakening the dollar s exchange rate which stocks gain from a stronger dollar a rising dollar impedes earnings growth which suggests that returns from the equity market might be subdued particularly companies that derive a majority of their earnings from overseas will suffer such companies are exposed to foreign exchange risks between the united states and other countries they are operating in thus if dollar gains strength it tends to hamper foreign sales of such companies thus investing in stocks with high domestic exposure in terms of revenue generation seems judicious after all such stocks are set to benefit from wider domestic revenue exposure which insulates them from the effects of a stronger dollar we have thus picked five such stocks that flaunt a zacks rank 1 strong buy or 2 buy onconova

the ventas team is here with me to discuss our 2019 performance and provide our outlook for 2020 let me start by expressing how personally committed i am to the future success of ventas our ventas team and our stakeholders as such today we are announcing a series of decisive actions to drive performance including recruitment of new talent and realignment of our executive team the launch of an exciting new growth platform and significant moves to improve senior housing quality and reliability following our third quarter call with you in october we committed to doing three things one closing out the year consistent with the guidance we provided second taking demonstrable steps to improve performance and get back on the ventas winning path and third providing 2020 guidance when it was ready and reliable today we have met all three commitments let s start with finishing our year consistent with our outlook for the full year in 2019 we delivered solid enterprise results of 3 85 per share at the high end of our full year normalized ffo guidance range issued in february of 2019 led by our office segment outperformance steady growth in our healthcare portfolio accretive investments and effective capital markets activity our fourth quarter 2019 results also came in line with our projections notably during the year we also made significant strategic advances we announced closed or commenced nearly 4 billion in new investments expected to yield between 6 and 7 these investments include our attractive lgm portfolio and partnership in quebec and our commitment to nearly 1 billion of high quality research innovation ground up development projects with leading research universities we took smart capital markets actions to finance our investments lower interest expense and extend maturities and thanks to pete bulgarelli and his team we delivered strong results in our office business that now represents nearly 30 of our portfolio we continue to lead in and be widely recognized for our commitment to environmental social and governance values second we promised to take demonstrable actions to improve our performance and position us for growth and success we have been moving with a sense of urgency intensity and purpose and have made significant strides over the past couple of months these actions fall into three general categories leadership senior housing and platforms for growth let me start with leadership today we announced the appointment of justin hutchens to our executive leadership team most of you know justin as a well respected operationally focused senior housing leader justin who will report to me and move to chicago will oversee our senior living business in north america partner with our operators and focus on maximizing our position in the market his operating background will provide a strong complement to our existing capable team and his presence will add to our senior housing bandwidth we are all very excited about the insights and impact justin will have on the ventas senior housing business when he joins us in early april at the same time we are realigning our current leadership team to provide expanded roles and responsibilities for each executive and we will welcome our new general counsel carey roberts when she begins at ventas in march turning to the action items to improve our senior housing business we are marketing for sale over 600 million in nonstrategic senior housing assets and the process is competitive when achieved proceeds of these divestitures will be recycled into our exciting research innovation pipeline with leading research universities we have also collaborated with our operators to accelerate and target our senior housing capital investment plans for 2020 and better position our communities to compete in their markets in priority markets we have significantly increased our 2020 budgeted capex spend particularly on projects that are customer facing and designed to improve the occupancy competitive position and overall attractiveness of our communities we have also taken initial steps to form an institutional joint venture for the esl portfolio as esl continues to find its footing following the transition of assets to it the recent rollout of its simplified pricing model and an increased allocation of capital to the communities and finally in a sincere attempt to be responsive to investor and analyst input we have updated our shop same store policies to enhance comparability transparency and consistency in the presentation of our shop results and guidance i want to recognize michael bilerman for encouraging this initiative as well as tom herzog pete scott bob and our own team for the energy and professionalism they brought to this effort for the benefit of investors analysts and other stakeholders the third category of action we have taken to position the company for growth and success is the launch of an exciting new business in the first quarter it is a ventas branded perpetual life vehicle focused on life science medical office and senior housing assets our fund is off to a fast start with about 650 million of committed third party capital by its initial closing which is expected in the first quarter ventas is seeding the fund with life science and medical office buildings valued at a 4 9 cash cap rate validating the value creation of our investment strategy and execution at inception we also expect the fund to enjoy nearly 0 5 billion of incremental buying power to acquire additional assets and we expect the fund s gross assets under management to grow over time ventas will retain a 20 interest in the fund to ensure alignment with the fund investors as well as receive asset management fees and other compensation if the fund investors receive expected returns our new fund has numerous strategic and financial benefits for ventas and its shareholders it leverages our brand team experience and industry knowledge extends our reach and provides us with another consistent source of capital to grow we expect each of the actions outlined above to contribute positively to our enterprise results over time which leads to the third and final objective we communicated to you that we would introduce 2020 guidance and the components thereof when they were ready and reliable today we are introducing 2020 normalized ffo per share guidance of 3 56 to 3 69 our 2020 guidance at the midpoint approximates our fourth quarter 2019 results times four adjusted for a few identified items our guidance also reflects our expectation for continued strength and reliability in our office and healthcare verticals continued pressures in our senior housing portfolio and no capital markets or investment activity although our 2020 guidance excludes as is typical the impact of new acquisitions we are coming off a fantastic year and we continue to see attractive investment opportunities across our verticals including in our research innovation business during 2020 we will endeavor to extend our long history of effectively sourcing acquiring underwriting and financing value creating investments turning to the broader market we continue to see strong institutional interest in all of our asset classes particularly senior housing life science and medical assets global investors continue to be powerfully attracted to these asset classes for the same reasons we are they are driven by powerful demographic demand tailwinds we are especially encouraged by the favorable supply demand trends in the national senior housing market and in our submarkets that bode well for our future in the top 99 markets absorption in the fourth quarter outpaced inventory growth for the second consecutive quarter driving 2019 absorption to the highest level on record across ventas submarkets we expect 2020 deliveries of new communities to improve year over year although operators are still digesting the cumulative supply delivered over the past couple of years the power of this upturn in senior housing is undeniable and inevitable so as we push through 2020 we have our sights set squarely on the potential in ventas from the upside we see in our senior housing business contribution from the opening of our research innovation developments steady growing noi from our high performing office and healthcare portfolios the expansion of our footprint and access to capital through our newly launched fund our enhanced team that is committed to each other and to our stakeholders and our continued investment in capital markets opportunities and now i m happy to turn the call over to my partner our cfo bob probst robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks debbie in my remarks today i will cover our property performance and outlook our overall 2019 company results and our company guidance for 2020 but before i jump in our 2020 ffo guidance range midpoint of 3 63 per share can be framed simply as our adjusted fourth quarter 2019 ffo annualized further adjusted for continued growth in office and triple net healthcare or 0 08 of dilution from 1 3 billion of capital recycling and for flat senior housing performance this guidance excludes any new unannounced fees investments or capital markets transactions as is our practice with that context let s get into the property discussion shop results for the fourth quarter 2019 were in line with our latest expectations full year 2019 same store shop noi declined 4 4 while q4 declined 7 5 driven by the cumulative effect of new competition together with some unique operational issues at esl if we exclude esl which represents 8 of our same store noi fourth quarter 2019 same store noi would have declined 4 and the full year 2019 would have been down 3 1 as anticipated the lower revenue trajectory coming out of q3 continued in the fourth quarter and occupancy finished the year at 86 3 which is 160 basis points below prior year on a positive note operating expense growth was less than 2 in q4 with labor inflation mitigated by strong cost controls a theme which played out consistently during 2019 in terms of guidance 2020 same store shop noi is projected to decline in the minus 9 to minus 4 range the simple facts are that our shop guidance is a result of two factors one the revenue trends that we called out at the end of the third quarter as having an important impact in 2020 because of a lower occupancy start point entering the year and two the impact of cumulative supply still being digested in 2020 the fourth quarter of 2019 which incorporates the lower ending occupancy levels is a good jumping off point for 2020 relative to the fourth quarter of 2019 annualized 2020 shop same store noi is expected to be flat at the guidance midpoint we do expect improvement in the full year occupancy gap in 2020 relative to the 160 basis point gap in the fourth quarter of 2019 as well as modest 2020 revpor growth driven by healthy in place rent increases wage and insurance inflation and the impact of an extra day due to the leap year are also incorporated encouragingly new supply coming online in our shop submarkets is expected to decline nearly 15 in 2020 and new construction starts and preconstruction permits are also trending favorably that said we estimate cumulative new units that have come online over the last several years and that are still being absorbed will remain elevated in 2020 thereafter the positive trends of growing demand and lower inventory under construction should become manifest debbie summarized earlier our action plans at senior housing i ll build on a few of those points first we continue to increase the frequency and depth of dialogue with our operators the addition of justin hutchens with deep experience and relationships in senior housing operations will accelerate and complement those efforts second we ve incorporated the sale of 600 million of nonstrategic senior housing assets into our shop outlook benefiting the same store range by an estimated 50 to 100 basis points and third we ve revised our same store shop definitions as announced last week in conjunction with and consistent with healthpeak the new definitions are summarized on pages 47 to 49 of our supplemental these shop updates are effective january 1 2020 and we ve also presented 2019 results as if these updates to shop policies had been in effect during the year the impact of their adoption is to reduce 2020 same store growth by 50 to 100 basis points by eliminating the benefit of lease up of certain redevelopments taken together the impacts of the sale of certain shop assets and the adoption of the new definitions effectively offset each other i would also note that over 80 of our shop assets are in the same store pool and as is our normal practice we provide transparency into both quarterly and full year same store pools which we think is critical to understanding organic growth in shop finally i m pleased to report that the lgm portfolio has been successfully integrated our partnership with the lgm team is off to a strong start and the assets are performing well let s turn to our triple net lease portfolio which grew same store cash noi by a solid 2 2 for the full year 2019 our healthcare portfolio of acute and post acute assets led this growth within triple net irf and ltac coverage remained stable at 1 4 times ardent continued to perform exceptionally well throughout 2019 and ardent rent coverage remained robust at 3 1 times trailing 12 month senior housing triple net rent coverage was flat at 1 1 times but included some drift lower in coverage from certain operators including brookdale we were pleased to see the solid report from brookdale on its earnings call yesterday on a same store basis for 2020 triple net overall we expect same store cash noi will grow 1 5 to 2 5 year over year driven by in place lease escalations in the healthcare assets let s discuss our exciting office reporting segment which represents 27 of ventas noi for the full year 2019 office same store cash noi increased by 2 6 beating the high end of our upwardly revised guidance range of 2 to 2 5 this outstanding result was fueled by our r i portfolio which grew 2019 full year same store cash noi by 6 with average rent per square foot up 5 5 and occupancy approaching 97 strong performance at our university based developments affiliated with duke and university of pennsylvania fueled growth in q4 and the full year in r i the benefit of lease up of our attractive r i developments will continue to boost same store growth in this segment in 2020 complementing the fast growing r i business is our highly valuable medical office business mob same store cash noi for the full year 2019 increased 1 6 in line with our expectations and above the midpoint of our guidance the mob team did a terrific job delivering excellent customer service in 2019 and achieved a very strong 92 tenant retention rate for the quarter and 86 for the full year a ventas record on a combined basis our office portfolio of life science properties and mob assets is expected to accelerate growth in same store cash noi from 2 6 in 2019 in the range of 3 to 4 for the full year 2020 this guidance is comprised at the midpoint of 1 75 and 9 for mob and r i respectively now on to our overall company financial results in 2019 we delivered normalized ffo of 3 85 per share at the top end of the initial guidance range of 3 75 to 3 85 that we set out last february for the full year 2019 same store property results were also in line with our latest guidance ranges we ve been proactive in refinancing our debt at the end of 2019 ventas average debt duration on senior notes approached eight years our average cost of debt improved to 3 5 and our debt maturities through 2021 are minimal finally as expected net debt to adjusted ebitda was 6 times for the full year 2019 i ll finish up with our full year 2020 guidance for the company the key components of our guidance are as follows net income attributable to common stockholders is estimated to range between 1 61 and 1 74 per fully diluted share normalized ffo is forecast to range from 3 56 to 3 69 per share we expect our portfolio same store cash noi to range from minus 1 5 to positive 1 and net debt to adjusted pro forma ebitda is expected to remain stable for the full year 2020 following q3 2019 earnings we communicated that our implied q4 2019 guidance midpoint annualized or 3 64 per share would be a good start point for our 2020 ffo per share this calculation was before any new investments or dispositions in 2020 our 2020 ffo guidance midpoint as published today is 3 63 per share despite absorbing an anticipated 0 08 per share of dilution from 1 3 billion of dispositions used to reduce debt and to invest behind our new r i developments and as is our usual practice we have not included in our guidance any new fees investments or associated capital market activities a normalized ffo per share bridge from our fourth quarter 2019 annualized to our 2020 guidance midpoint of 3 63 can be found in our press release to close the entire ventas team is fully engaged and committed to execute on our 2020 plan to improve performance and to position us for the exciting opportunities that lie ahead with that i will ask the operator to please open the call for questions questions and answers operator and our first question comes from vikram malhotra from morgan stanley your line is now open vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst thanks for taking the questions i know you guys have done a lot of work so congrats on getting all this done so i know i have one question and a follow up so just focused on guidance can you give us a bit more color on sort of how you came out with the ranges for your ideal growth kind of at the midpoint and then what gets you to either end and what how the flu may be baked into that and then second question on the triple net side you talked about coverage i m just wondering are you baking in any additional cuts or anticipating any cuts to the rents on the triple net side robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i ll take those and thanks for the question let s start with shop midpoint of the range and then i ll do the high low midpoint of the range occupancy we expect to improve the gap year over year relative to the fourth quarter the fourth quarter was down 160 basis points versus the prior year 2019 would be 2018 and we expect to improve i e narrow that gap over the course of 2020 we expect modest revpor growth we had nice in place increases in the 2020 first quarter and that s helping that will be offset in part by releasing spreads to get to modest growth in revpor on the expense side we highlighted some of the issues including labor inflation insurance inflation and the extra day of leap year and those are all baked into the plan i would say on the opex growth side we have not assumed that we ll continue to hold overall opex below 2 which is what we saw in the last few years and when you add all that up that gets you to the midpoint of the range that we quoted on the i ll call it the good side of the range the real lever is i would say particularly around cost so their ability to continue to drive the labor inflation down through efficiencies in the operating model procurement etc would be the upside that really is key to get to the good side of the range on the other end it s really about the revenue and pricing and what happens in the marketplace as we continue to absorb the supply that s still out there so really a revenue driven equation on the downside and that s really the upside downside as we portrayed it on the second question i should say the flu yes the flu is incorporated we don t believe it s a big deal this year but it is incorporated triple net coverage a complex equation for sure i d say a few things one what we told you last year remains true i e lease modification impacts transitions etc 10 becomes 20 and 20 is a simple phrasing that is true that s incorporated in our guidance we ve also incorporated some room for further modifications should they be necessary and so that is in the guidance range for ffo as we look at the overall so while the answer is vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst so just to clarify when you the guidance the shop guidance that you have given you re looking to given esl may undergo a change what would the guidance have been excluding esl robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer the benefit is not baked into the range as it s not baked into our guidance i d say it approximates 100 basis points vikram malhotra morgan stanley analyst thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from nick joseph from citi your line is now open nick joseph citi group analyst hey it s michael bilerman here with nick and debbie thanks for working with your peers to standardize same store and we certainly appreciate that two questions from me from the fund that you launched can you walk us through the process now of allocating acquisitions into the fund versus on the portfolio it sounds like it s going to be both core and core plus so what s going to be the factors of an asset or a portfolio of assets going into the fund versus on balance sheet debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer good well we are excited about this i ve long admired hamid and his success in this area and i m excited that we can use our infrastructure and platform to give investors a choice of how to invest in these core life science and medical office and senior housing assets so there are defined criteria as you would imagine for the fund and over time as the fund grows which we expect and hope that it will there will be just really a choice of which is the better home for the assets making sure of course that we treat all of our stakeholders fairly nick joseph citi group analyst and then second question in terms of g a load i guess it s really a 2 part one what s embedded for guidance for 2020 relative to 2019 for g a especially as you re bringing new people on but also taking a look at 2019 you were at 166 million call it about 50 basis points of gross asset value your q closest large cap healthcare reit peers you had peak running at 90 million or just over 40 basis points and well at 126 million just over 30 basis points of gav is there i mean maybe there s some disclosure in terms of comparability but just directionally do you feel that there s areas that you can reduce the g a load and how will justin s hiring impact things as we look at 2020 robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i ll take that one thanks michael so it s always hard to compare on g a using different measures scale your operating model are two variables that can drive material differences as we look at our g a i d highlight a few things when you look at year over year for example in 2019 we saw the lease accounting standard change where we begin to expense leasing commission costs that is a in the run rate if you like but a year over year impact in 2019 and in the base as we look at 2020 we would expect effectively to on g a try to stay flat and thereby by definition absorbing headcount costs including justin so that s going to mean efficiencies and being sharp as we always are but that s our budget debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer well i told him he has to make it all that times three or something robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer i m sure you ll pay for that no doubt nick joseph citi group analyst i m sure okay robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer thanks michael operator thank you and our next question comes from rich anderson from smbc your line is now open rich anderson smbc analyst thanks good morning debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer hi rich rich anderson smbc analyst good addition with justin good guy of course looking forward to seeing him again debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer yes we are too rich anderson smbc analyst so the on the same store i guess the question that goes for both same store and ffo as the year progresses and same store meaning shop how do you envision this sort of moving over the course of the year do you see a trough quarter on either measure and then when you think about the work that went into sort of identifying your shop guidance is there a time line where you get back to a more competitive level of growth versus your peers is it a year from now i m sure there s something some sort of thought about time line to sort of get this matter all fully behind you robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer yes rich good question and thanks for asking because the profile as you know of 2019 was in the second half we saw the revenue drop we called it out obviously in the third quarter that carried forward into the fourth so if you just kind of drew a line if you think about 2019 obviously it started high finished low and coming into 2020 that s our start point and so all else equal we d expect to see a tougher comp in the first half of the year and then normalizing if you like as we get into the back half of the year so that s just going to be the normal phasing as we look at it and as we look at the year over year guidance range that is a fundamental predicate absolutely for sure go ahead rich anderson smbc analyst no i was going to say could you so is the first quarter the trough year both for same store and ffo would you say the trough quarter robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer yes you ll have some competing forces there so in terms of ffo phasing the dispositions we talked about 1 3 billion of dispositions being used to reinvest behind r i and debt repayment will be over the course of the year so that is dilutive when we consider 0 08 versus the fourth quarter so you ll see that phasing in over the course of the year so some offsetting forces rich anderson smbc analyst all right but then this time next year do you think we ll be at a competitive level of growth on the same store shop portfolio debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer everyone in this room is focused on delivering 2020 rich anderson smbc analyst okay second question is on the fund assets you kind of answered it kind of but i appreciate you want to kind of hold your cards a little bit but is there at least a higher percentage of riskier assets or core plus assets there and would you seed more from your existing portfolio or is this all you re going to do for now and everything else would be growth debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer well right now it s our expectation that everything will be growth and importantly we believe that it really does augment our aggregate capacity to grow and so from here on out we would expect john s team to be sourcing investments and if appropriate they ll go in the fund and otherwise we will happily take them on balance sheet so we re excited about the expansion of overall capacity rich anderson smbc analyst i still don t know what appropriate is though can you define what appropriate is for the fund debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer yes i mean there are defined investment criteria that are identified that would be for core life science stabilized core life science senior housing and mobs and things like our growing research innovation pipeline ground up development with our exclusive partner wexford would clearly be for the ventas account so there are pretty clear demarcations but where there may be overlap again our job is to be fair to all the stakeholders and in the aggregate expand our reach and our acquisition capacity rich anderson smbc analyst a wonderful quarter for thanks debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer thank you rich operator thank you and our next question comes from nick yulico from scotiabank your line is now open nick yulico scotiabank analyst thanks just going back to the fund i think you mentioned 500 million of incremental buying power in the fund can you just tell us what the leverage target is so we just have an understanding of the assets you d be buying in the fund debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer yes it s consistent with our enterprise leverage targets nick yulico scotiabank analyst okay so and the 500 million of incremental buying power that was you re referring to actually assets being bought at the fund level debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer well it s equity and debt availability on top of what we re already seeding the fund with in the initial closing and then again we would expect the assets under management to grow from there nick yulico scotiabank analyst okay and in terms of the additional assets are you more likely to be buying new assets or contributing existing ventas assets into the fund debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer right very clearly from here on out we would expect this to augment our total acquisition capacity and it would only be newly acquired assets which if they meet the criterion or otherwise appropriate would go to the fund so we re initially seeding it with the five that we talked about and then from there it will be john s team that will be sourcing and closing the investments and if appropriate that s how the fund would grow from here nick yulico scotiabank analyst okay just one last question on the hiring of justin maybe you could talk a little bit more about exactly what you re hoping for him to achieve and i guess because looking back on last year it just felt you had kind of an issue where you were just dealing with some operator issues and in some cases you just have to kind of live with those operating issues i mean going forward how is justin going to be working with senior housing operators where i guess you could have a little bit more control over ultimately how some of these assets perform debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer good good i m so glad you asked that and note that we did this right before the trade deadline so we re excited about it i mean what we really think that justin will bring and again we have this bias to action we re taking a lot of actions to do what we told you which is to put ventas back on a winning path and to realize the upside in our portfolio in the senior housing portfolio so what he is going to do is work very closely with our existing highly capable team he s going to bring that complementary operating background that he has that will make us better and he has preexisting relationships with most if not all of our operating partners as you know and so he can work with them and our team on operating strategies and capital plans with the overall objective of course to improve operating results he will also as we mentioned in the press release serve on the esl board of directors nick yulico scotiabank analyst okay thank you debbie debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from jeff spector from bank of america your line is now open jeff spector bank of america analyst good morning thank you i d like to focus a little bit more on hiring justin congratulations debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer thank you jeff spector bank of america analyst could you share with us i guess some of the feedback criteria that he provided to you and in taking this role again some of the criteria he requested debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer yes i mean one of the great things is that justin coming here really is attracted to ventas team our strong track record our commitment to our stakeholders and the upside in our business broadly speaking and our senior housing portfolio in particular and he is obviously well versed in the u s senior housing market he helped build the business during a dynamic time in the senior housing market and i think he is confident that he can have a very positive impact on the company and on our portfolio once he joins jeff spector bank of america analyst so has he already influenced the 600 million of dispositions the noncore dispositions is that the bulk right off the bat or he still needs to comb through the portfolio and figure out how much more needs to be sold from there because i m trying to tie just that and then you still did comment in your press release that you re expecting a positive turn in senior housing and i m not sure when you feel that that s coming debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer good so i mean we have been working on these action plans obviously on our own and as well as all the other actions that we outlined today we ve been full speed ahead on them and justin will start to make his contributions really when he comes here in april and we re really looking forward to that and as i said in my remarks i mean the tailwinds of demographic demand in senior housing are compelling and the fact that there will be an upturn in senior housing driven by those demographic tailwinds is both undeniable and inevitable and so we re focused on 2020 we want to continue to take actions as we have today to position us to capture that upside and that s what we re all focused on and justin will be focused with us as soon as he gets here jeff spector bank of america analyst thank you operator thank you ur next question comes from john kim from bmo capital markets your line is now open john kim bmo capital markets analyst thank you it s taking a step back looking at your guidance it implies over a two year period and 11 decline in ffo and that s totaling 99 million at the midpoint but at the same time same store noi is flat you ve made 4 billion of investments can you just remind us what the disconnect is between those three items i know you have a 10 million rent cut last year but are there more rent cuts contemplated this year just given where your triple net coverage is robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer right so the key variable that you mentioned there is disposition and loan repayment activity i e sales over the last several years again reinvested in either debt reduction or future growth through r i which have been dilutive to ffo that together with the senior housing market driven performance is effectively those are the two key things that answer that question john kim bmo capital markets analyst what about any further rent cuts or relief like you had last year robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer right so again we in our guidance have incorporated the impact of that which happened last year so we talked about the 10 million becoming a 20 million in terms of activity in the triple net operator portfolio that s in and then we provided for some additional activity if it s necessary so we ve contemplated having to deal with some others so that s in the guidance john kim bmo capital markets analyst okay and then my second question is on your fund can you just discuss how much you re going to earn in fees this year is it just your typical asset management fees or if there s any origination or acquisition fees that would be included in your normalized ffo debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer yes it s a it s just a market structure and i m surrounded by a phalanx of counsel who s encouraging me to restrain my comments so i will but it s just a market structure john kim bmo capital markets analyst so any onetime fees would be basically to promote or would there be anything else in there debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer again principally again there s asset management fees as you would expect and other as the documents provide john kim bmo capital markets analyst thank you yes operator thank you and our next question comes from steve sakwa from evercore your line is now open steve sakwa evercore analyst thanks good morning debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer hi steve steve sakwa evercore analyst hi i just want to go back debbie to a comment you made earlier about the capex spend and you re investing into the senior housing to help shore up the portfolio but i don t know that you actually provided a dollar figure for that so is there any color you can provide on that and how that kind of relates to overall maintenance capex spending in 2020 robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer i ll do overall for the company that s in the guidance i ll let chris talk a little bit more specifically about senior housing but the guidance range for 2020 this is fad capex steve is 180 million at the midpoint round numbers we were 156 million in 2019 and the vast majority of that increase is a function of senior housing and again very much a result of this targeted and accelerated spending in senior housing so i ll turn it to chris to give a little more meat on that bone christian n chris cummings senior vice president asset management seniors housing yes great again chris cummings senior housing asset management as you look at senior housing spend on a per unit basis in 2019 we spent on a total basis around 2 500 per unit closer to 3 300 per unit in 2020 is our expectation we re spending in terms of customer facing capital about 65 more dollars in 2020 than we did in 2019 and where we re spending those dollars is primarily in those markets which we view as future attractive from a supply demand perspective where we can get good outcomes from that spend steve sakwa evercore analyst okay and debbie just going back to the r i business just in general what are you seeing with wexford in terms of deploying new capital and how would you expect starts to trend in 2020 and maybe into 2021 debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer we continue to have a robust pipeline i mean wexford has a terrific position in the marketplace with these leading research universities and we have a team dedicated here at ventas to work with them steve sakwa evercore analyst can you just share any more around just types of deals or the size of the pipeline or expectations on starts debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer i d refer that to my colleague john cobb john d cobb executive vice president and chief investment officer yes i mean i think last year we announced 1 5 billion pipeline today we ve done almost 1 billion of that so we re still working another 0 5 billion that we think will start hopefully in the first half of this year and then we re constantly looking at new deals they generally range between 100 million to 250 million apiece so they re sizable but we re we have an active pipeline and we have a great market competitive position steve sakwa evercore analyst great thanks debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from jordan sadler from keybank your line is now open jordan sadler keybank analyst thank you i just want to clarify on the hiring of justin his real marching orders here i know you talked about sort of increasing the dialogue with operators and obviously he s on the esl board but is he also will he also be taking an overall inventory and assessment of the existing seniors housing triple net and shop portfolios and sort of assessing whether or not you have the right portfolio of assets going forward debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer well working with chris cummings and our existing team we want to partner with justin as a team to improve performance and obviously part of that is looking at the portfolio with fresh eyes we believe we have a portfolio that will continue that will perform in the long term look at capital plans obviously look at pricing strategy so it s all part of the overall leadership of our senior housing business jordan sadler keybank analyst so it sounds like i guess what we re all probably trying to get out of here is what justin s mandate is and sort of what s been relayed to him in terms of what he ll be able to do in terms of needing to address whatever may be going on within the portfolio and so what s the latitude in terms of capital recycling it sounds like you re saying there ll be some latitude debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer yes i mean we these are enterprise decisions we will all work together to optimize both portfolio and enterprise and he will be really leading that effort with chris and his team and we look forward to the results of that improving ventas performance and position and realizing the upside that we know is in the portfolio jordan sadler keybank analyst okay and will he remain on the in his current board seat at new senior has that been discussed at all debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer i mean that s something that i would refer you to new senior for jordan sadler keybank analyst okay and lastly bob just a clarification if you could on the leverage you said it d be stable throughout the year i think it i think at a six from the six times i assume that was at year end but just to clarify that and then but how does that sort of fit with the 1 3 billion of recycling in this point and the 700 million of debt repayment robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer right so simple sources uses here jordan is we ve got the 1 3 billion of sources coming in from the dispose the uses of those are twofold roughly 600 million of that is going to be redevelopment spend principally behind the r i pipeline and development and 700 million is going to be debt repayment and you run all through that that all through the grinder that s flat on a leverage basis versus 2019 jordan sadler keybank analyst okay i think i get it robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from daniel bernstein from capital one your line is now open daniel bernstein capital one analyst good morning okay so i d like to go back and obviously hindsight is 2020 but what lessons can you learn from the last couple of years in terms of the portfolio that you can bring forward as the do you need more robust asset management more capex early more asset recycling early maybe that s related to justin coming onboard as well but what lessons can you learn from the performance of the last two years that you can bring forward and change how you operate debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer well i think clearly the actions that we re taking speak to those points i think that bringing justin being one of them in terms of expanding our and complementing our strength with significant operating experience and perspective i would say that really understanding that the longer transition period in esl portfolio and communicating that more to you and generally obviously having i think consistent shop policies and so on so that investors can really understand organic performance across companies which i think we ve now tried to offer between us and healthpeak which i think is a step forward so obviously lots of lessons learned i think over a 20 year time period we have really focused on delivering and on excellent performance and i think we ve had a short period here where we have not met our own expectations but we re doing everything within our power to get back on the winning path and i m confident that the actions we re taking will do so daniel bernstein capital one analyst okay and maybe this is related but what gives you confidence that the shop portfolio is going to perform better or even better than industry besides a rising tide raises all boats with industry i mean you obviously have underperformed within the shop what gives you confidence that it can perform better in the future is it the location of the assets the management at sunrise atria etc just trying to understand what can change in within the portfolio versus maybe that s just debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer again yes so we understand so there s two things as bob described that we re have been that affect our 2020 guidance it was the end of the third quarter which mathematically lowers our start point going into 2020 so obviously when that happens that has an effect on 2020 and then the cumulative absorption of the supply in our submarkets and we know that that second aspect is improving and the noi will inevitably follow plus again working with the operators on capital plans that are targeted and accelerated as well as bringing on more operating focused experience to work on pricing and so on so those are all the actions that we re taking that we believe will drive improved performance daniel bernstein capital one analyst okay and i know it s more than two questions here but one last one i just want to make understand was the 10 million of triple net lease restructuring was that already in 4q that s rolling into 2020 i just wasn t clear on that robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer correct debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer you got it daniel bernstein capital one analyst okay rolling into 2020 ok robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer yes right daniel bernstein capital one analyst that s all i think debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer all right thank you operator thank you our next question comes from steven valiquette from barclays your line is now open steven valiquette barclays analyst thanks good morning so at the reitworld conference back in november you guys gave a little more color on some of the specific secondary markets that were problematic back in 3q 2019 with some of those ones in texas utah new york california etc i don t know how much you want to get into that on this call i guess i m just curious if there s any update on those markets you would point out as maybe being expected to improve in 2020 from that prior list versus which ones may still be let s say difficult throughout the whole year robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i ll take that one and i would say the themes are very consistent with what we talked about last in that regard namely the secondary markets particularly in the fourth as in the third continue to see on a proportional basis more revenue challenge and again that s where we saw supply come earlier and that the need to digest those units comes first so that as we look into 2020 that said second some of the secondary markets have begun to see that turn and as chris was describing where for example we re focusing some of the capital those would be good opportunities to spend targeted capital there on the other hand primary markets so these are just broad brush you have to get of course get into the specifics but primary markets is where supply came later and the digestion will come later put it that way and so we ll expect in 2020 to see some of those primary markets having to deal with that supply but at the end of the day this is timing because the trends are inexorable we see the demand growth we see the penetration growth the starts trend which has been favorable now for several years those come together and manifest themselves in the upside that we keep talking about and it s just a matter of getting from here to there steven valiquette barclays analyst thank you jonathan hughes raymond james analyst hey good morning debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer hi jonathan jonathan hughes raymond james analyst hi debbie i was hoping you could clarify the augmented external growth strategy and relationship with the core and core plus fund you mentioned only stabilized deals will go into that vehicle does that mean only value add and development opportunities will be targeted by ventas and the historical external growth trajectory that was outlined last june is maybe also augmented down from 2 billion and maybe half that debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer not at all so let me try to take it again so the fund helps us grow our platform by augmented investment capabilities and capacity and so basically we ve seeded the fund and then anything that grows the funds assets under management will be new investments typically at sporty cap rates and the fund will provide another arrow in our quiver in terms of access to capital and will enable us to acquire things that in some cases would be inefficient for us to acquire on balance sheet and as i said before we have an unlimited capacity to invest on balance sheet and then eventually in the fund as it continues to grow and if you look at prologis for example as an example then you would see that it s helped the overall enterprise grow and that s what we re aiming for and in addition as we mentioned in the release will be the 20 gp of the fund so we will maintain a significant interest in those assets as well so it s an overall win for everyone the new stakeholders in the fund as well as ventas shareholders jonathan hughes raymond james analyst okay so the growth trajectory of ventas as a whole is the same more in the outside vehicle and john s team sounds like they ll be busy debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer the same or better is the theory yes in hand jonathan hughes raymond james analyst and john s team sounds like it ll be very busy though okay all right then one more on esl i know you re looking for a jv partner and demand for senior housing is strong but this same portfolio ultimately didn t find a partner when i recall it was being marketed back in late 2017 why sell it now or jv it now after noi has taken such a drastic turn for the worse just feels like we re selling at a trough why not just keep it as a whole and lap it and in 18 months we lap these comps and you get the benefit debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer great question because we do see upside there over time and so first of all historically speaking we chose not to pursue a partnership at that time and so i think that s important for you to understand and then secondly we have taken these initial steps to do a joint venture there is institutional interest in generally partnering with ventas and in senior housing in particular and we believe that continuing to recycle capital and attract capital and gain more partnerships with investors is a positive development for ventas and this could enable us to do that jonathan hughes raymond james analyst why did you not jv it two years ago debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer we made a decision at that time that it was not in the best interest of the company to do so jonathan hughes raymond james analyst and you stick by that today as noi has gone down pretty precipitously debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer we do and i ll we ll be happy to talk to you about more color off line but yes we do jonathan hughes raymond james analyst alright fair enough i ll follow up offline debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer okay look forward to it operator thank you and the next question comes from michael mueller from jpmorgan your line is now open michael mueller jpmorgan analyst yeah hi just shop debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer hi michael michael mueller jpmorgan analyst hi just a quick question on shop occupancy the 160 basis point gap at year end bob i know you talked about that closing some but can you talk about like a magnitude of how much of that closing would you say is really good progress versus kind of a base case scenario i asked right robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you for asking yes i appreciate that and the goal is to narrow debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer yes so in the right direction robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer and that s a lower number than 160 and obviously there s a related question which is pricing so both of those need to be answered together we need to be smart on both occupancy and price revenue when you re when all is said and done growing revenue is the job to be done and so that s where the focus is michael mueller jpmorgan analyst okay and real quick on esl to jv should we read into that that you think the progress process to turn that around is going to take longer so you just want to less of it today is that the right way to think of it john d cobb executive vice president and chief investment officer this is john i wouldn t read into it that way we re going to stay in michael mueller jpmorgan analyst okay got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from chad vanacore from stifel your line now open chad vanacore stifel analyst hi this is todd show for chad a good morning debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer hi chad chad vanacore stifel analyst this is tao qiu for chad my first question is on dividend coverage so fad this quarter was 0 78 versus 0 79 dividend and 2019 guidance implies some decline in ffo so how do you feel about your dividend at this point also in light of the higher capex you were expecting in senior housing debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer hi my first question is about doing covers yes thank you for the question so obviously the dividend is an important component of our total return and we feel good about where the dividend is because we feel good about investing in our portfolio this year which has increased fad this year so that we can realize the benefits of the upside in our portfolio so as we look forward we do see the benefits of senior housing turning up we also see the benefits of the r i development pipeline that we ve been heavily investing in with those assets starting to come online and contributing to cash flow and ebitda as they open in late 2021 and into 22 and they ll make a significant contribution at that time so the combination of and then the steady growth of the office and healthcare portfolios all combined make us feel comfortable chad vanacore stifel analyst okay and a follow up on the revpor numbers can you talk about what kind of rate increases you are seeing now that you have the month of january under the belt and how does it compare to prior years given the lower occupancy level you re seeing are you interested in more discounting to drive that revenue robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer yes thanks so there s two pieces of price i ll touch on both one is the in place resident increase that happens this time of year and that s been healthy i d say consistent with last year so that s encouraging and important part of revenue and then to your second question which is i think of it in terms of the releasing spread when resident leaves what are we seeing on pricing and it remains a competitive market there s no question about it therefore our guidance for the year of modest revpor growth incorporates both those odds but so far i d say the start of the year it s in line with our expectation chad vanacore stifel analyst thank you robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from omotayo okusanya from mizuho your line is now open omotayo okusanya mizuho analyst hi good morning everyone debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer welcome back omotayo okusanya mizuho analyst thank you i appreciate it yes so again congrats on the justin hutchens exit from the u k i think again you re generally hearing positive commentary on him but i guess again the core question i think a lot of us are trying to get on to the call is kind of fundamentally what s really changing here in regards to how you re going to operate the shop platform going forward i think again the asset sales are helpful but again your shop portfolio is 12 6 billion and i think you re only selling 600 million yes the esl jv is helpful to kind of reduce exposure but kind of what really is fundamentally changing here to give us more confidence that the shop portfolio will perform better going forward debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer okay we ve been yes we ve been trying to get at and respond to your questions fundamentally we if we have a 2020 and realize the benefits of justin s contributions and we see cumulative supply declining in our submarkets as we expect and we continue to take these other actions that we ve described which include targeted capital plans simplified pricing and so on the combination of those things makes us confident that the portfolio will perform and we will realize the upside in the portfolio and we have to demonstrate that over time and that s what we are committed to doing omotayo okusanya mizuho analyst is anything changing in regards to just data analyses lease structures the type of relationships you re trying to form with operators just i guess i ve kind of part of what i m kind of looking for about what structurally is changing i granted ultimately again fundamentals will also will be better for the sector but again that s kind of a rising tide lifts all boats i m trying to think ventas specific what really changes here robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer well tayo i d add the two things one the significant incremental dedicated horsepower in this portfolio obviously critically important to us dedicated focused in with an individual who has an incredibly unique set of skills with background as a reit with deep expertise within the operations to be able to come in and complement and accelerate that which we re already doing but really can bring that extra bandwidth i used to call it the multiplier effect that he s going to bring operationally and strategically for the portfolio and so we re excited about that and the portfolio itself and the operators themselves again as we painted to you before we think we re in good markets with good operators so it s really then how do you optimize within that omotayo okusanya mizuho analyst got you all right that s helpful then my second question your cost of capital is actually pretty attractive at this point and so when we kind of think about the acquisition outlook going forward any kind of thoughts around again clearly you re trying to do more development in life sciences but from an actual acquisition perspective how do you kind of think about the very attractive cap rates in skilled nursing for example or on the hospital side versus doing more on the mob side or senior housing side debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer so good yes i mean i think that your point is well taken we have talked about our investment framework that we ve used over the years and that we re augmenting today with the launch of the fund and enhancing and basically as you know we ve created a history of accretive acquisitions through basically really high quality relatively lower cap rate assets such as 1030 mass life science building we have our kind of right down the middle investments such as our successful lgm investment last year which is performing well in both the stable assets as well as the lease up assets so generating kind of between a 5 and 6 unlevered return and then we have a smaller category of higher yielding that could include development it could include healthcare government reimbursed assets and so on where we allocate a certain amount of capital and the overall combination of those investment activities is what has driven the accretion from investments historically and we would continue to stick with that framework omotayo okusanya mizuho analyst okay thank you debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer thanks taiyo operator thank you and our next question comes from connor siversky from berenberg your line is now open connor siversky berenberg analyst good morning everybody and thank you very much for having me on debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer hi connor connor siversky berenberg analyst so just related to these disposition expectations for 2020 about 600 million i mean do we have any kind of pricing expectations on these assets and then is there any rhyme or reason as to the markets you ve identified for these dispositions debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer it s 1 3 billion inclusive of the contributions which are effectively sales to the fund and i believe in the aggregate it s a sub 5 cap rate connor siversky berenberg analyst okay okay that helps and then i mean there s a note that these funds are expected to be recycled into the r i pipeline i mean how quickly or any kind of color on how quickly you can move those funds into maybe new development projects or acquisitions robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer so yes just to clarify the 600 million of dispositions are turning around and going to be invested in 600 million of development or redevelopment this year that s on existing projects john mentioned that we announced 900 million plus of new projects last year and so it s really investing behind those first and foremost debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer so exactly what you said robert f bob probst executive vice president and chief financial officer yes connor siversky berenberg analyst yeah okay all right well that helps thank you very much debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer good thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from michael carroll from rbc capital markets your line is now open michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst yeah thank you i was hoping you could provide some color on the triple net leases that have under 1 times ebitdarm coverage i m assuming that s largely holiday and brookdale are you comfortable holding those leases today or should we expect some type of restructuring over the next few years or even sooner debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer michael thanks for being patient and thanks for your question as bob pointed out and we ve talked about before we were very happy to see the improved report from brookdale yesterday i m really excited and happy for cindy and the management team they ve done a ton of heavy lifting to get to this point where they re really starting to see some traction and some positive trends so we feel really happy for them and good for us as well in terms of holiday again we continue to have fixed charge coverage that makes rent reliable and that all having been said bob mentioned that our range does include in the triple net side the possibility that we would decide if appropriate to take action on different tenants in our triple net portfolio and that s all baked within the guidance michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst okay and then i guess just in general i guess not specifically related to those two tenants but how do you ensure that operators that have this tight lease coverage ratios are committed to positioning those communities to compete in the current marketplace and even position themselves to benefit from the demographic tailwinds just overall debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer yes i mean good question and important one and often you do see some lesser spend on a triple net lease in some of those circumstances so what i would say is the leases generally provide for some required capex spend and or investment we often will work with the triple net operators to provide additional capital at a return to continue to invest in the assets and then lastly ultimately as the owner of these assets we can also just make investments in them as we deem appropriate either on transition or otherwise to keep them competitive in their markets michael carroll rbc capital markets analyst okay and then with holiday and brookdale have you pursued i guess any specific asset sales or is that included in guidance and i know with brookdale you originally had a handful of assets set aside to potentially sell i mean did you officially take those off the market or what s the plan to those potential sales debra a cafaro chairman and chief executive officer good memory in fact when we did our positive deal with brookdale seems like a lifetime ago but we sort of anticipated first of all that their operating performance would improve through the efforts that cindy and the team are making so again we re happy to see that we did work with them to identify some assets that we both thought would be better outside the portfolio in other operators hands we ve sold some of those and some of those are included in our 2020 disposition guidance so good memory and we are doing that so again thanks for your

private creditors yet while the fernandez government read the washington based lender s bulletin as vindication of the argentine demand that private creditors take a hit on their loans the way forward is far less certain neither the imf which is on the hook to argentina for 44 billion or 47 of its entire credit exposure nor the minimum 75 or so of bondholders required to sign off on any agreement will be bullied easily into a bad deal any more than they will be moved by pope francis s prayers that s the cue for the country s ruling peronists to swap the balcony for the negotiating table will they advertisement advertisement ever since he swept argentina s presidential primaries last august virtually ensuring his electoral victory alberto fernandez has been the topic of fierce speculation would a famously behind the scenes politician serve as merely the mouthpiece for his willful deputy the former president cristina fernandez de kirchner or would he outflank the peronist flamethrowers and work up a pragmatic plan to spare the nation another ruinous default half a year on we re no wiser though the signs out of buenos aires are hardly auspicious the ruling front for all electoral alliance remains a coalition of rivals the resulting mixed messaging from fernandez s inner circle is confusing investors and lenders and stoking popular demands that his administration will be hard pressed to meet in january buenos aires governor and alpha peronist axel kicillof issued creditors an ultimatum take a late payment on 250 million in provincial debt or face a disorderly situation his mentor fernandez de kirchner upped the ante warning on a trip to cuba no less that the international monetary fund wouldn t get even half a cent back until the country grew again and only if it agreed to a big haircut on argentine debt both petards may have been no more than ill wind off the pampas neither the provincial bondholders nor the imf blinked but the malodorousness was hard to miss the imf has given argentina a reprieve but not a pass fernandez must convince chary creditors to come to terms with a nation storied for serial default his self imposed timeline for closing a deal march 31 advertisement advertisement yet the government s economic agenda offers few clues and thin hopes on the campaign trail fernandez pledged to find an amicable solution to the country s debt imbroglio argentina owes around 312 billion worth 91 of gross domestic product he also promised to spare his compatriots any more pain and scolded the imf for deepening the country s woes fernandez then doubled down on that message during a recent diplomatic tour on which he sought the blessings of european heads of state and pope francis ahead of the country s debt negotiations story continues he left the details to economy minister martin guzman a young he s 37 respected academic with no hands on experience like his mentor the nobel laureate joseph stiglitz guzman is no fan of laissez faire economics at the same time he has been hailed as a moderate and a rare pragmatist in a palace packed with nationalist hardliners optimists took heart from fernandez s first policy initiative the december economic emergency law which included measures to rein in the primary fiscal deficit to 0 4 of gdp in 2020 by raising taxes on farm exports tourism personal goods buying dollars and reducing spending by selectively freezing prices and capping pension increases yet the government s subsequent loose money policies could erase even those modest savings and fuel what oxford economics calls the highest rate of monetary expansion in 16 years nor was guzman s debut in congress reassuring in a hearing before lawmakers he warned bondholders to brace for frustration over the coming deep debt restructuring and forecast reaching fiscal balance only in 2023 we re not going to allow foreign investment funds to set the guidelines on macroeconomic policy he said argentina s dollar bonds slumped the populist pitch was likely a nod to the domestic audience which is bracing for a third straight year of recession with one of every three argentines already living in poverty the government position may reflect the paranoia of a leader in a region on fire benjamin gedan director of the argentina project at the wilson center in washington told me austerity was a trigger for social unrest across latin america over the last year and after four years of worsening poverty and a deep recession argentina has every ingredient for explosion adjustment is a toxic word advertisement advertisement alternatively standing tough with creditors may have been guzman s strategic opening move in an eventual compromise on debt but if that s so the government s leverage is limited in a marketplace already inured to argentine bluster when buenos aires s creditors refused to budge on provincial debt kicillof paid them in full the message from buenos aires was that argentina will do anything to avoid default said gedan the fernandez government is not wrong to say that under current conditions the debt is unpayable and to ask creditors to sit down to discuss better terms said adriana dupita of bloomberg economics but first you need to have the right diagnosis of the problem and a plan and i don t see one dupita is not alone just to repay the imf the country s priority creditor argentina will have to spend out the equivalent of a quarter of all export revenues projected for 2022 and 2023 financial analysts nouriel roubini and alessandro magnoli bocchi wrote this week since that s out of the question the only recourse is for argentina to persuade the fund to reschedule its debt yet in lieu of a sensible plan a new loan arrangement with an easier repayment schedule is unlikely they concluded given the current lack of a clear and comprehensive strategy by the government a formal default on the foreign law debt appears to be quite likely at this stage roubini and bocchi wrote advertisement advertisement before argentina can come up with a solid economic plan it needs a credible political pact that takes a government which speaks with one voice mutes the palace incendiaries and treats debt and economic recovery not as a passion play but as part of a national business plan argentines need to have a discussion of what type of country they want a state led industrial policy a country open to global trade said nicolas saldias an argentina expert at the wilson center that requires cutting across partisan lines and getting the opposition on board to come to an understanding about economic basics now that would be something to celebrate to contact the author of this story mac margolis at mmargolis14 bloomberg net advertisement

participants on the call are invited to participate in listen only mode i will now turn the call over to michael michael steinmann president and chief executive officer thank you siren welcome everyone joining us today to discuss our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 our results clearly reflect the significant contribution of the mines we acquired with the tahoe transaction which closed on february 22nd 2019 consolidated gold production rose by 380 000 ounces to a total of 559 000 ounces in 2019 revenue of 1 35 billion was up 72 over 2018 primarily on higher gold sale volumes and higher precious metal prices in 2020 we are expecting production increases of 7 for silver and 16 for gold considering the strength of our business and financial position the board has decided to increase the quarterly dividend by 43 to 0 05 per share net income in q4 2019 was 51 7 million or 0 25 per share this included the investment income of 33 7 million mostly related to the gain on our 17 interest in new pacific metals offset by a 40 1 million impairment charge related to the manantial espejo mine in argentina net income for the full year was 111 2 million or 0 55 per share adjusted income in q4 2019 was 68 9 million or 0 33 per share full year adjusted income was 158 million or 0 78 per share record quarterly net cash flow from operating activities of 129 5 million was recorded in q4 2019 reflecting strong operating performance and the improvement in precious metal prices during the quarter operating cash flow before working capital changes interest taxes and mine care and maintenance was 151 million in q4 the strong cash flow allowed us to repay 40 million in our line of credit in q4 bringing the total repaid in 2019 to 60 million at year end 275 million was drawn in our line of credit we already repaid another 15 million in january of 2020 and plan to continue deleveraging our balance sheet according to our objective of carrying no debt 2019 operating cash flow before changes in working capital mine care and maintenance and income tax of 432 million was enough to fund our operating requirements including sustaining capital income taxes and dividends it also covered our growth capital transaction costs paid for mine care and maintenance and increased our year end 2019 cash and short term investment by 26 million at december 31st 2019 cash and short term investments totaled 238 3 million and working capital was 517 million turning to operations production in 2019 was in line with expectations while costs were below our guidance we produced 6 6 million ounces of silver in q4 2019 bringing total production in 2019 to 25 9 million ounces consolidated gold production was 173 900 ounces in q4 and 559 200 ounces for the full year all in sustaining cost for the silver segment of our operations were 11 37 in q4 and 10 46 for the year relative to 2018 costs benefited from higher than expected by product credits and positive net realizable value inventory adjustments and were negatively impacted by an increase in concentrate treatment charges all in sustaining cost for the gold segment of our operations were 901 in q4 and 948 per ounce for the year sustaining capital of 179 1 million came in below our guidance of 203 million to 213 million largely as a result of timing the deferred capex is included in our guidance for 2020 sustaining capital 2020 we are expecting to spend 225 million to 240 million on sustaining capital important projects are heap leach pad and waste rock dump expansions at dolores shahuindo and la arena as well as tailings storage expansions at la colorada and timmins project capital of 22 million to 27 million is largely directed at the la colorada skarn discovery and production expansion at bell creek mine we are expecting to produce 27 million to 28 5 million ounces of silver and 625 000 to 675 000 ounces of gold in 2020 all in sustaining costs are expected to be in the range of 10 25 to 11 75 for the silver segment the moderate increase in all in sustaining cost is related to higher treatment charges for concentrates lower zinc price assumption and higher sustaining capital all in sustaining cost for the gold segment are expected to be in the range of 1 090 to 1 170 due to higher sustaining capital and more conservative assumptions regarding positive grade reconciliations at la arena and shahuindo for the new pit phases positive grade reconciliations at the same levels as 2019 would have a positive impact on the 2020 cost estimate further information on our 2020 guidance is available in our news release issued on january 15th 2019 was a transformative year for pan american i m very pleased with what we have achieved in a short time frame and how we are positioned for the future we completed the highly accretive tahoe acquisition adding four new mines to our diversified portfolio and we are capturing annual g a synergies of 25 million to 30 million escobal mine offers material upside for investors the new government under president alejandro giammattei took office in guatemala on january 14th 2020 we look forward to the new government advancing the court mandated ilo 169 consultation process with indigenous population executing the tahoe transaction was an exceptional event yet we had another exceptional events with the discovery of the large polymetallic skarn at our la colorada mine in december of 2019 we announced an inferred mineral resource estimate for the skarn of 72 5 million tonnes averaging 44 grams per tonne of silver 0 17 copper 2 02 lead and 4 4 zinc truly a world class deposit in 2020 pan american plans to invest 16 million to 18 million on the drilling program early stage engineering and metallurgical testing for the la colorada skarn the 44 000 meter drill program is focused on infill and exploration drilling to further define expand and add confidence to the inferred resource estimate last week we released the results of 14 additional holes conducted during the fourth quarter of 2019 which were not included in the resource estimate and indicate the potential to increase our initial resource estimate that wraps up my formal comments and i would like to open the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session our first question comes from chris terry with deutsche bank please go ahead chris terry deutsche bank analyst hi michael and congrats on a great end to the year a few questions from me just in terms of the la colorada skarn discovery you said you d spend 16 million to 18 million i think this year what are the next data points on that we should look for just for project updates with the next addition to resource met testing project timelines etc that we should look out for thank you michael steinmann president and chief executive officer yeah sure good morning chris first of all we ll put out every quarter i think a result press release like we did last week we re drilling a lot of meters so we don t want to hold that back too long because it will just accumulate and i think they re all and will be continued some very positive results that we will share with you so look forward every quarter to that as you know we moved with that after the transaction of tahoe we moved our reserve and resource update to mid year so we don t expect any update at the beginning of the year anymore we started at last year and published our reserves as of end of june we will continue to do that it aligns our reserve update much better with our budget process that comes just a few months or start a few months later and gives us the newest and finest reserves that we can use for our budget so that s a much better timing for us so again when we put that resource and reserve update out in june there will be an update on the first inclusion of our resource of la colorada so expect there further updates on metallurgy and first pass engineering and that s it will just continue with updates during the year i think this will be a year of heavy drilling a lot of metallurgical work we published a few results earlier on and a lot of early stage engineering to see what kind of size we re going to envision to advance this project chris terry deutsche bank analyst okay thanks michael and then a couple of others from me you obviously gave guidance for the full year 2020 in january since then the macro has been pretty volatile and base metals in particular have been under pressure just wondering on the cost guidance in the by product credits and different currency moves just if you could speak to the conservatism more or where your where your costs could come out versus what you guided in january thanks michael steinmann president and chief executive officer yeah look the guidance is only a month old and a lot of things move up and down in that case you mentioned the base metal that affect our base metal or polymetallic mines on the cost because they re by product credits but there are lot of other moving parts as well to it like currency fluctuations labor costs goods and parts etc etc so of course we cannot update our cost guidance for each of that move some go up some go down and i don t see any reason to make a change at this point chris terry deutsche bank analyst okay no that s fine and then just thinking about some of your country exposure argentina in particular where there s been some changes just wondering if you could comment broadly on the operating environment how comfortable we are with the operations there in that country thanks michael steinmann president and chief executive officer well argentina definitely got harder this year you saw we took 40 million writedown on manantial espejo cose joaquin mostly for those reasons we re looking at additional export taxes we re looking at additional restrictions in the country right now due to the issues and they re facing right now we are comfortable to work in argentina we are working argentina for a long time but it definitely got a bit harder right now and that s what it reflected in that write down as you also know right now manantial espejo and cose joaquin is a very small part of our nav so there is a very minimal exposure right now from argentina and the other thing i think that s i see that it s just a point in time i m sure argentina will do its best to advance here in and bring their economy back on track and everything will improve again chris terry deutsche bank analyst thanks michael just a last one from me high level i guess after doing the tahoe acquisition and then not selling some of those gold assets because of the improvements you ve been able to do over the course of 2019 when we look forward to 2020 and beyond you ve obviously got more revenue from gold than silver is that something you re comfortable with going forward do you need to continue to reshuffle the portfolio back toward silver or are you just going to stick with what will be from here thanks michael steinmann president and chief executive officer well we are silver company it s embedded in our name and in our history of course there is more revenue right now coming from the gold side not only because of higher gold production but also because of the gold silver ratio where it sits right now with gold outperforming silver you should have a look in our corporate presentation and our website there is a slide that compares our revenue with our reserves and it will clearly see that our reserve is a silver reserve mostly i think it s about half of our reserve is silver that s obviously where it s going to go here in the future so while we develop these assets that are very silver rich we will go back to a much more kind of what you are used to silver gold ratio for the company s production but meanwhile where the gold price stands and gold outperformed i m very comfortable to have the higher gold production basically generating the cash flow for us to advance our silver projects chris terry deutsche bank analyst great thanks michael that s all from me all the best for the years michael steinmann president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from cosmos chiu with cibc please go ahead cosmos chiu cibc analyst hi thanks michael and team and first off congratulations on a very strong q4 and a great end to 2019 and certainly i m sure investors are happy with the dividend increase maybe first off on your 2020 guidance here michael you touched on for the gold segment you touched on the higher cost for shahuindo and la arena for 2020 there s been some conservatism it sounds like built into it but how about timmins you know timmins had a fairly good 2019 with a new shaft in place you still sort of forecasting a higher all in sustaining costs in year 2020 is there any kind of upside here as well in terms of potentially coming in below what you re guiding to for cost for 2020 at timmins steve busby chief operating officer good morning cosmo this is steve cosmos chiu cibc analyst hi steve steve busby chief operating officer my the big driver to that cost increased projection at timmins there s really two drivers one is we do have a substantial tailings dam expansion in the sustaining capital that we have to complete that s an important project for us so that will get done during the year the other thing is there is there is an access road we ship the ore from timmins west to bell creek and along that highway there is project at this summer some substantial highway works going on by the province there so we re having the redirect trucks and it s quite a bit of a distance so it s going to add to that haulage costs from timmins west during that construction period on the highway so we factored that in now we re looking at some potential offsets to that we may find some better economics by investing in some short bypasses and things like that there may be some upside there but i wouldn t factor that in right now i think those cost projections at timmins are pretty solid overall cosmos chiu cibc analyst for sure and since i have you here steve maybe if i can talk about the recoveries at dolores i know you didn t publish i don t even want to call it recovery it s more like the ratio of what stacked and what s been the what came out in terms of but if i were to back calculate what was stacked in q4 i work out to somewhat of a 51 ratio for silver 71 for gold at dolores especially for silver that seems a bit low and i thought given what you ve done in 2019 for the full year and given the pulp agglomeration plant that s in place what should we how should we look at it is this just a one off is the high grade stacked in q4 going to benefit q1 2020 and what s what are we targeting in terms of quote unquote recovery here at dolores michael steinmann president and chief executive officer yeah good color there cosmo you re right on what we did see in q4 the one thing that we re seeing at dolores is the heap stack height in this pad 3 areas getting extremely deep we re stacking over 100 meters right now in some areas so we got fresh ore that stacked upon leach spent ore that s 100 meter in depth and it s taking a long long time for a solution to percolate through that heap and q4 is notoriously the quarter where we get a lot of rainfall and a lot of dilutive effects of the increase in water inventory we take on during that quarter which was compounded a bit this year because we were in the middle of construction on what we call pad 1 north and so we had exposed liner on a new pad that collected quite a bit of rainwater that came in at a pretty high volume so we have a lot of inventory we ve got to work through we have and we talked about this last year we have kind of reduced our solution application rates to make sure we got effective percolation conditions for leaching through that heap so q4 was below what we were hoping to see below our expectations below what we typically had been seeing from the pulp agglomeration plant addition but we think it is a one off thing i think when you look at the full year you ll see our silver recovery is it is a record silver recovery for the year for that mine so you are seeing the benefits over the whole year even though q4 was a bit behind we do think we ll catch up on an early part of this year 2020 cosmos chiu cibc analyst and then i guess on that steve i worked it out to about 60 silver recovery for the year is that what you re targeting or could it be even higher with the pulp agglomeration plant steve busby chief operating officer we do think there is still upside to that you know the one thing that the recovery side the additional recovery we re expecting close to 20 on the on the silver and we were we were also projecting additional quicker kinetics faster leach times we believe today we are seeing that higher overall recovery but the timing to get there is longer than we expected and that s reflected because we had to slow down that leach application rate we weren t getting quite the percolation we thought we would with the agglomerates so we have slowed that down that has affected timing but no i think as we look into 2020 we do expect to see that come up to the higher 60s as opposed to the lower 60 overall cosmos chiu cibc analyst okay and then i did the same calculation for shahuindo here i see that the gold recovery was about 67 about 67 for the year as well i seem to recall that under tahoe that number could be higher especially with the crushing agglomerator are in place i know you re not crushing agglomerating at this point in time so i guess my question is is there upside beyond the 67 that you realized in 2019 and is the crushing agglomerator back in the cards in 2020 steve busby chief operating officer it s looking like you re reading my to do list on my desk you re right cosmos chiu cibc analyst i swear i m not spying steve busby chief operating officer yeah you re right on we are not we think there is upside to metallurgical recovery at shahuindo we re not yet convinced it requires us to crush and agglomerate to get there it may we don t know yet we do think there are substantial upside to that all i would say to caution that a little bit is remember this is a run of mine heap leach so we only have one head grade that goes out to the pad and that s from our ore control and our ore control is showing substantially higher grades than reserves we need to verify that that is indeed the case that there is a chance we re hoping that s not the case but there is a chance maybe the recoveries aren t as high or the recoveries are higher but the grades aren t as high so we re kind of working through all those issues you described currently i have i have to say from my perspective i m optimistic we re going to find ways to improve at shahuindo cosmos chiu cibc analyst great maybe switching gears a little bit here michael as you mentioned the new reserve resource as to update is now going to be mid year at this point in time have you determined what gold and silver price or other commodity prices you might be using just given how well gold and silver has done year to date or since sort of late last year and i only asked because i think some of your mines might be a bit more sensitive to changes in commodity price assumptions such as dolores so at this point in time have you figured out what you might be using michael steinmann president and chief executive officer no cosmos we did not so if you look at our official resource statement as of june that surprises there that we use of course was a lot of changes during the last few months that s a short time we will look at it and define that a couple of months before we do the reserve update but in general as you know we are also very careful we like to generate good margins with our mines and just running up the metal price to create more resources and not what i have in mind at all i never had but we did not define a price cosmo i just would like to as you touched on the half history of the dividend i would like to give a quick update here in general our capital allocation and our plans which is very straightforward and very simple with three clear steps that we follow here and i think we have proven here over the last few years that that s working out very well for our shareholders number 1 accretive highly accretive projects and acquisitions that s the best return to our shareholders i think we have proven that very clearly over the last 12 months with the tahoe acquisition what kind of impact accretive transactions can have number 2 where our capital goes is improving our balance sheet and maybe improving is not the right word because even improving further because our balance sheet as you know is very strong we had a very strong free cash flow allowed us last year to pay back 60 million in our line of credit 40 million in the fourth quarter alone and i don t know if you heard it in my call we actually already paid another 15 million back in january on the line of credit and i really like that i like to have little debt as possible and the line of credit available to us because it gives us the flexibility to jump in for opportunities if they come along on accretive acquisitions so that s a circle right it s like when when it happened with tahoe you need to keep your powder dry we do very few a transaction and when we do them we need to be ready though so like to have a line of credit available and a very strong balance sheet and you know if prices stay where they are and we will continue to pay back our line of credit very quickly and then the last point is return to our shareholders with dividends mostly dividend slightly you sell there the increase i think that s a third increase here in three years i believe we re happy very happy to return our dividends to our shareholders i think we returned about 440 million or 450 million since 2010 between dividends and share buybacks to our shareholder so it s a very simple three step plan that we follow we follow that for a few years now and i don t see any reason to change that cosmos chiu cibc analyst yeah for sure michael i think that s great and on the debt repayment or the payments back to the line of credit michael as you mentioned you did above 60 million in 2019 15 million again in january 2020 have you do you have any targets in terms of what level you want to pay back in 2020 i know there is dividend there is capital allocation i m just wondering if you ve publicly made any statements in terms of how much you want to decrease that debt by in 2020 michael steinmann president and chief executive officer as i said we will follow this three step plan on the cash flow allocation and the more of the more money is left at the end of the day the more we will pay back on the line of credit idea is to go to as little or zero debt if possible i can we can always take the money again on our line of credit and react on an opportunity but there s no reason in my mind even if interest rates are low to service that if we can pay back rather invest that money in further drilling at la colorada for example cosmos chiu cibc analyst yeah for sure when and for what s worth i have you have forecasting free cash flow of 200 million for your company in 2020 so there is going to be a lot of a lot of cash for you coming in and then maybe one last question on argentina could you give us a bit more detail i guess there was a writedown you talked about the increase in export tax i wasn t aware that i was not aware that s been put into law has it and could you maybe give us any other changes that either has been confirmed or were expecting in argentina steve busby chief operating officer yeah cosmos this is steve specifically on the export tax a law has been passed but it has not been regulated yet we expect when it is regulated it will be retroactive to the first of the year that s our expectation under the law the export tax effectively does increase because it takes it from a peso based to a revenue based tax so net net it is an increase in that tax cosmos chiu cibc analyst and what kind of magnitude michael steinmann president and chief executive officer sorry you ve probably also seen that as a quite a few other changes there is a double severance payment that was one of the reason why we decided to go a bit slower with the production and make due with the people that we have there there is some currency restrictions it s not as simple anymore just to move money in and out and so there s a whole bunch of changes as i said in the former call that affect our operations in argentina but again when you look at our corporate nav and the part that is in argentina this is very small its a few percent points steve busby chief operating officer relative to the magnitude on that export tax cosmos when it first came out it came out as a peso based tax and then the peso had eroded what we re seeing is effectively about a 3 percentage point increase in export revenue tax cosmos chiu cibc analyst okay yeah because i think when it first came out as you said with the depreciating peso it worked out to for what i remember 7 or 7 5 equivalent sort of tax but now you re saying maybe an additional 3 to it michael steinmann president and chief executive officer that s correct yeah cosmos chiu cibc analyst okay and then michael i agree with you that argentina is now only a small portion of the nav at pan american silver but you do have in your guidance about 4 million to 4 3 million ounces in production silver production included for 2020 any concerns at this point in time either it be geopolitical or ground conditions at cose joaquin in terms of getting to that guidance michael steinmann president and chief executive officer no no concerns on that cosmos chiu cibc analyst okay great thanks michael steve and team and congrats once again on a very good q4 michael steinmann president and chief executive officer thank you cosmos operator our next question comes from chris thompson with pi financial please go ahead chris thompson pi financial analyst hey good morning gents i want to echo what cosmos was saying congratulations just a couple of little questions related to guidance i guess looking at some of the gold assets here first of all you re guiding for between 42 million and 44 million in sustaining capital for la arena my understanding is there s a limited mine life i wonder if you could just unpack where that s going steve busby chief operating officer yeah good morning chris this is steve a big part of that and i think it s close to 30 million of that is on pre stripping we had what we call tahoe used to refer to it as a phase 8 we are kind of changing those phases a little bit we with these positive reserve reconciliations we think there s opportunities maybe to increase some of the reserves there and maybe look at the pit a little differently but we are doing some layback there so there is some substantial pre stripping in that number and then in addition we do have waste dumps we have substantial costs on preparing waste dump ground it s a very boggy area very wet where you have a lot of drainage efforts that go in and ground preparation work that has to go in before we can start placing waste on waste rock dump on new areas so those are predominantly the big increases in capital chris thompson pi financial analyst okay great are you guys doing any work on the sulfide opportunity there steve busby chief operating officer we are not chris it s really a copper gold play it s really not in our interest again our focus right now is on this la arena 1 if you will the oxide gold and we think there are some opportunities there we re fairly optimistic we might be able to squeeze a little bit more value out of that michael steinmann president and chief executive officer chris la arena 2 obviously a very interesting project but i think i made very clear since the acquisition that a very large copper porphyry is not something that pan american should and will build so at one point of course that project will be up for sale but there is time as you hear from steve there is some opportunity and on the reserve side on the oxide side so we ll leave the work on the sulfide side for the for a large copper company to do chris thompson pi financial analyst great thanks for that and just finally i guess moving on to the timmins assets i mean you say a lot of your capex guidance little bit of it anyway is going into a 20 expansion of the bell creek there how should we be viewing that from a timing perspective to see the results of that michael steinmann president and chief executive officer yeah it s really interesting it s of that i think we laid out 5 million for that expansion and roughly half of that is going into the plant and it s really just upgrading pumping systems throughout the plant and so the schedule of completing that work is really dependent on manufacturing and delivery schedules of the pumps and the mine equipment we think that will trickle in throughout the year so that by the end of the year we ll be up to that 20 expanded rate chris thompson pi financial analyst right okay and i guess that would be what is it the 5500 tonne a day mike michael steinmann president and chief executive officer yeah we look at it as a tonne per hour but we re going to go from about 220 just a little above 220 to 250 tonnes an hour and we re getting about 92 availability on the mill so it takes us right about 5500 which is a good number tonnes per day chris thompson pi financial analyst great guys thanks a lot congrats michael steinmann president and chief executive officer thanks chris operator our next question comes from lawson winder with bank of america please go ahead lawson winder bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi thank you for taking the call maybe if i might just start on la colorada and steve i think this is probably for you but i mean it seems now for two quarters operating cost per tonne are running in the low 90s and so i really have two questions on that i mean one is that the level that you re budgeting for 2020 guidance and then is that a level that you see as being sustainable going forward at least on a medium term basis thanks steve busby chief operating officer yeah lawson nice question we have seen some pretty substantial debottlenecking efforts in the mine at la colorada that s led to quite a bit higher throughputs than what we had originally designed i think we achieved just over 2100 tonnes a day on average for the year of 2019 we re optimistic we can actually improve upon that some more we re also optimistic that that coupled with some interesting mechanization efforts we got going on over the next several years will lead to some better cost efficiencies with all that said we do have some challenges during 2020 we have some substantial ventilation raises that we re going to be installing in the mine and we need those raises to kind of get some of this mechanization efforts moving so i don t anticipate big changes through 2020 but i think when we look beyond that we see some optimism for some additional cost optimizations if you will unit cost decreases going forward lawson winder bank of america merrill lynch analyst so for 2020 you would expect it to be in the lower 90s then steve busby chief operating officer yeah i d say we re forecasting a little higher there are some cost increases that we re absorbing on labor particularly we anticipate 5 kind of escalation of costs so we re probably in the mid 90s mid to mid 90 95 a tonne lawson winder bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thanks that s very helpful steve and then just on the dividend that was a pretty remarkable increase i think what is two questions one when you re setting this dividend are you basically looking at what your budgeted gold and silver price assumptions are for 2020 that s the first question and where it s coming from i mean it seems conservative versus historical increases vis a vis the current spot price and then the second question is i think historically the cadence of dividend change announcements has typically come in the first quarter with q4 results i mean is that something that you expect to continue going forward or could that cadence perhaps change thanks michael steinmann president and chief executive officer look lawson i think it s when i talk about the capital allocation i think that s really the key when you look at that so as i mentioned the return in dividends is number 3 in our list very high and very important but we give preference to accretive projects and pay back our debt i know it s a very nice increase 43 what we do is we really look quarter by quarter at this dividend and look at our capital allocation and depending what s going on there we make a decision you can imagine that right now there s a lot of cash flow generation a lot of free cash flow generation some money will also be needed and capital will be needed to advance the la colorada skarn deposit and so we kind of try to keep a balance here with returning as i said very high accretive projects to our shareholders and returning dividend at the same time lawson winder bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thanks michael that s very helpful and then just moving to one of the other assets morococha rather morococha in peru is there still an expectation that you ll need to move the plant and if so when are you expecting that might have to happen thanks michael steinmann president and chief executive officer maybe on timing if that should happen steve can give you an update there i think there is still i would call it a fluid situation there as we re discussing with our neighbor how to advance the open pit and how that will impact our plant which is really located very much on the fringe or even a bit outside of the pit so i think steve timing wise we started i think we made that public last year and this year that we start spending some money on some early stage engineering that s what we are working on i think we have at the end of this year a better idea but i don t have a date yet or anything set if and when such a move should happen lawson winder bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay steve busby chief operating officer just to add on to michael s comments he is exactly right we are doing engineering we are actually doing permitting efforts but in terms of timing we have not yet defined the timing with our neighbor lawson winder bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay that s very helpful and then maybe just finally on the escobal ilo 169 process i m not sure to what extent you re able to share where that process is but my question really is at what point are you guys in that process and is the process still as we had understood it a little over a year ago with the four stages michael steinmann president and chief executive officer yeah look i m sure you saw that there is a new administration as i mentioned in the call under alejandro giammattei so a lot of changes in guatemala on the federal and local side the new government took office on the 14th i think it was of january so very recent just a month ago and so we re really looking forward for them to advancing that process the ilo 196 consultation process with the indigenous population we are obviously enhancing still and educating training our team there addressing a lot of issues going from human rights social concern indigenous manners etc etc you can imagine there s a lot to do and of course we will support that government led ilo 169 process as much as we can to find a peaceful dialogue with our neighbors and with the host communities that we re working there so a lot of changes in guatemala and i like what i see there s i still don t have a timing i think the process where it has to go through is still the same so nothing changed in that at least not what i would know but because that s this is four stages as we saw last year we have not been informed by anybody that that would have changed but again it s a government run process and we are just a participant in it lawson winder bank of america merrill lynch analyst understood thanks very much for your comments operator our next question comes from john tumazos with john tumazos very independent research please go ahead john tumazos john tumazos very independent research analyst thank you could you give us a timetable or density of drill holes maybe to get la colorada skarn measured and indicated maybe two reserve reports out next year and in tahoe as they reported there was almost 20 million ounces of gold and 6 billion pounds of copper in resources across ontario and the two sulfides in peru i know you re very busy with la colorada skarn and the existing mine operations in escobal and navidad but is there one or two of those projects that might be a priority from the resource queue at tahoe if you have time to get to it in the next year or two christopher emerson vice president of business development geology sure hi john it s chris emerson here really to explain the drill pattern program of drilling for the inferred resource we re probably at around 70 meters to 80 meters spacing at the moment we d want to get that down to below 50 and depending on the geostatistics as to the variability within those drill holes and grades so certainly with the 44 000 meters this year we ll probably hopefully be upgrading again it all depends on the results we ll certainly be looking to maybe 20 or 30 of that certainly for june this year and then as that program advances into december this year upgrading that further but certainly we re a little away from getting that all 72 into a m i for instance in 2020 we d certainly be looking for a couple of years of continued drilling and then at that detailed reserve drilling we d probably want to be closer to the deposit i e get underground and actually drill it from there because at the moment we re probably drilling 80 from surface with directional drilling which is obviously so costly so to get it down to that closer spacing we definitely want to sort of get that more efficient michael steinmann president and chief executive officer john it s obviously one of our top priority projects here as you can imagine this is a world class discovery and while chris is drilling we are moving quickly ahead here with our metallurgy and engineering in parallel to move the project forward as fast as possible so stay tuned for updates as we said midyear on the resource and then as chris continues to drill to advance that into different categories on the resource state to your second question regarding the copper that tahoe had in their resource most of it is located in la arena ii in peru and as we are very we are very happy what we see and i think there s some upside and we re very happy what we see at la arena in the oxides and the gold production as i mentioned before la arena ii has a big copper porphyry it will not be a project that we will advance and we ll look to divest that project over time but there s really no big hurry in us since we have still several years of production the upside ahead of us john tumazos john tumazos very independent research analyst concerning the over 10 million ounces of gold resources much of which tony makuch acquired when it was lake shore up in ontario are there any of those that you have time to evaluate in 2020 2021 i know you re busy with these other sweet irons in the fire michael steinmann president and chief executive officer yeah we re actually looking at them we re doing some work on it and some of those projects haven t really made the final decision on all of them if they are core or not for us some are fairly close to our timmins operations and they have a chance to be in trucking distance and then some are further away which definitely will be not high on our list of projects and we ll probably look to divest them john tumazos john tumazos very independent research analyst thank you michael steinmann president and chief executive officer thank you john operator our next question comes from adam graf with b riley fbr please go ahead adam graf b riley fbr analyst thank you guys it s been a lot of questions but just i know that you talked a bit about conditions in argentina becoming more difficult but i was curious to hear if there s been any update on the progress to be able to move forward on navidad and if the challenging conditions in argentina actually would help or hurt that process to open up reopen up development of navidad michael steinmann president and chief executive officer yeah adam it s you cannot just compare very simply kind of a shorter life mine like manantial cose joaquin where we re looking at a three year maybe 3 5 year life and then you look at a project like navidad that needs a few years to go through permitting and building and then many many years of production so i see the issues in argentina as i said just a point in time some issues that the government will work through it and but at short term so let s look it at short term it definitely made it more challenging for us as i said when you look at really long term projects like navidad that will be in production for decades i don t think so that you can just extrapolate those issues so that s a different time frame adam graf b riley fbr analyst yeah michael perhaps you could give us an idea of where things stand as far as politics in the province and at the federal level as far as moving things forward to allow for just the approval at navidad michael steinmann president and chief executive officer sure i can do that and like in many other places we work in latin america there was a change of government we had elections the legislature in the province actually took seat i m not completely sure it was around the 10th of december i believe 10 or 12 somewhere around there led by the governor mr arcioni he won a very clear election there he is a strong governor in the province i think i think he has very good ideas how to advance the province and the economics of the province and i m looking forward to work with the new incoming government or the government that is there now for 1 5 months nothing changed in my view on the project navidad is a very strong very large silver deposit it s still probably the largest or one of the largest undeveloped silver deposits in the world it s very scalable so there are shallow open pits i think there s about eight zones that are mineralized that we can mine so it s very scalable in size in terms of size on start up and how much capital you want to spend upfront and how much how many phases you want to grow the project we did not make decisions that how we do that will depend on the situation and then the permitting etc etc if the project goes ahead but at the moment obviously there is no way to do the open pit mining because there is the mining law in place that prevents us from doing that so this is with the government to make that change it s a political process i can t do that obviously i m just sitting there on the side waiting and discussing providing information and then we see how it advances but as i said the really important part of navidad is the scalability and that makes it i think much more adaptable for us to once we make a decision on size and scale and capital requirements and timing for possible start ups adam graf b riley fbr analyst so just so i m understanding you correctly no change in the provincial or the federal level as far as new initiatives or to change the law that would allow this project to move forward on the horizon as far as you can tell michael steinmann president and chief executive officer no that s not that s not correct first of all the federal side does not really matter on this law this is a provincial law the resources in argentina belong to the province so that s not a federal law on the provincial side a lot of changes over the last what is it 12 months i would say mr arcioni if you remember came in as vice governor and was that last year and so the province actually is working on the zonification laws providing provided kind of a draft map i think that would kind of explain where they would install kind of mining zones and no mining zones and so we re talking about possible mining zones in the center of the province called meseta and then obviously no mining around the big rivers glaciers coast line etc etc so there has been lots of advantages there but at the end of the day it s pretty black and white decision by the provincial legislature to change that law in order to allow open pit mining and once that s done obviously we would provide our environmental impact study which is ready to go and then start a permitting process adam graf b riley fbr analyst so is that draft law expected to be finalized and come up for a vote in the next six months in the next year in the next 18 months or there s no schedule michael steinmann president and chief executive officer i don t have a timing for that adam adam graf b riley fbr analyst okay thank you very much michael steinmann president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from trevor turnbull with scotiabank please go ahead trevor turnbull scotiabank analyst hi michael here at the end of the queue i ended up getting most of my questions answered including from adam just previously but i guess there was one nuance to the discussion of navidad i wanted you to touch on we try and keep an eye on the news coming out of argentina look at the local papers and so forth and toward the end of the year and into january there was quite a bit of a lot of articles a lot of protests going on about the environment specifically in chubut and it seemed like this open pit mining law was getting kind of wrapped up in that there was a lot of other issues at play but certainly it was one of the things that was being bundled with other concerns that these environmental people had at first we thought that this increased agitation by environmental concerns meant perhaps that the mining law was coming to ahead maybe they were getting closer but it all seemed sort of died down a bit here in the last couple of weeks and i wondered are we reading too much into these protests are they unrelated or was that a bit of an indication the government was in your opinion getting closer to doing something michael steinmann president and chief executive officer i think they were mostly related to the issues that happened in mendoza at the end of the year i would say probably see that they actually changed the law in mendoza i think unfortunately they did not they did not provide in the law a zonification so there was no mining or non mining zones in the province which i think the population really didn t like as you can see now mendoza is a big wine producing area so that should be areas of course that should be non mining and others that should mining could go forward so that caused a lot of issues and i think that kind of spilled over to chubut yeah i don t have really much more information on this trevor i think you re probably reading a bit too much into it where we stand with the government i mean as i said it s a political process the governor and the legislature i m sure are diligently working on a lot of issues in the province and that mining law is one of them to provide jobs and to provide income for the province in the future and where it stands at the end as i said it s a decision of the provincial legislature trevor turnbull scotiabank analyst okay i appreciate that michael thank you operator this concludes the question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to michael steinmann for any closing remarks michael steinmann president and chief executive

the yen has been the key underperformer in the past few days and is now trading around 112 versus the dollar says francesco pesole fx strategist at ing bank we think the yen s fall has been a combination of market shifting from short term fears i e global pandemic to pricing in the long term impact of a slowdown in china and japan is highly exposed in this sense rising fears of recession in japan after the grim 4q growth data and finally speculation about sustained outflows from japan as japanese investors look for more attractive yields abroad as the financial year comes to an end with increasing evidence of japanese economic damage from the coronavirus the yen has come under sustained pressure as defensive support crumbles yen declines to 10 month lows the japanese yen declined sharply on wednesday amid a perfect storm of trading factors the japanese currency registered the sharpest daily decline for 6 months and selling continued on thursday with usd jpy posting 10 month highs around 112 20 the yen has also declined sharply on several crosses with eur jpy back above 120 00 and gbp jpy around 144 50 although the yen steadied on friday with usd jpy below 112 00 the yen was set for its worst weekly performance in over 2 years image usd to jpy exchange rate chart confidence in the japan s economy slides recession likely a key factor has been increased fears over the coronavirus impact on the japanese economy evidence indicates that chinese demand has fallen sharply and japanese companies will also be hurt by damage to supply chains advertisement the latest pmi business confidence data recorded a manufacturing decline to 47 6 for february from 48 8 previously with a sharper retreat for services to 46 7 from 51 0 survey components were notably weak reinforcing concerns over the near term japanese outlook underlying confidence in the yen has therefore weakened with a technical recession likely according to marc chandler chief market strategist at bannockburn global forex the ties to china exposure to the coronavirus compounded by japan s own domestic challenges is bolstering fears that the world s third largest economy is likely contracting for the second consecutive quarter the number of coronavirus cases in japan has also increased to over 100 and numerous domestic events have been cancelled which will further damage the economy yen no longer a safe haven image japanese gdp the japanese yen traditionally acts as an important global safe haven asset when fear increases the yen tends to strengthen especially as japanese funds repatriate funds the yen did gain initial support from the chinese coronavirus outbreak but has since fallen out of favour china s central bank has boosted market liquidity and cut interest rates global equity markets therefore have continued to trade strongly with wall street indices trading near record highs gains in stock markets have limited potential yen support on financial contagion fears the latest data also indicates that japanese funds have increased capital outflows rather than repatriating capital which will tend to reinforce yen selling pressure us data releases have been generally stronger than expected with housing starts registering strong gains for january the us economy is less sensitive to potential coronavirus effects and the us dollar has been seen as a more attractive defensive asset the february philadelphia fed survey for example released this week strengthened to a 33 month high the dollar index has strengthened to 33 month highs i think this has really brought into focus the role the dollar is playing as a safe haven commented rabobank senior currency strategist jane foley japan s proximity to china and recent poor economic data had also turned markets off the yen she said alternative defensive assets such as the swiss franc and gold have performed more strongly in particular gold has attracted strong demand with a move to 7 year highs above 1 630 per ounce notably the yen has weakened to record lows against gold new cases in south korea and in japan have obviously given some people a little bit of cold feet regarding japan and the yen as a safe haven said david bloom global head of fx at hsbc they re thinking maybe swissy and gold are better so there is a little bit of scratching of heads there s no doubt about it he said adding he was not yet prepared to abandon the idea of the yen as a safety play in a tweet marc andré fongern head of research at maf global forex commented that the jpy is no longer immune to japan s severely poor economic data probably the primary reason why the currency s safe haven status is increasingly being called into question investors seem to be turning their backs on japan for the time being perhaps with good reason fx markets lusting for big moves foreign exchange markets have been starved of volatility and looked to pounce on any big move the 110 00 20 area for the usd jpy exchange rate had proved an important resistance area with failures to move above this level in january and february a break above this area triggered significant stop loss yen selling especially as the run of heavy options expiries came to an end there will however be the risk of a correction after such strong moves ing considered the correction potential the question that comes naturally is whether this move in usd jpy is sustainable our short term financial fair value model highlights how the pair has moved into overvalued territory breaking above the 1 5 standard deviation band this suggests the move may be somewhat overdone at this point and possibly makes a case for some stabilisation the yen has secured a tentative recovery on friday with usd jpy retreating to near 111 80 live

ardagh group s a nyse ard q4 2019 earnings call 10 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator hello everyone and welcome to the ardagh fourth quarter and full year 2019 results i will now hand the call over to paul coulson chairman and ceo please begin paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer well good morning and good afternoon everyone and welcome to our fourth quarterearnings call which follows publication earlier today of our results for the quarter and the full year with me as usual are david matthews our cfo shaun murphy our coo and john sheehan our corporate development and investor relations director our remarks will include certain forward looking statements these reflects circumstances at the time they are made and the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied due to a wide range of factors including those set forth in our sec filings and news releases our earnings release for the quarter as well as our financial report related materials can be found at ardaghgroup com information regarding the use of non gaap financial measures may also be found in the notes section of the release which also includes a reconciliation to the most comparable gaap measures of adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per share full details of the company s statutory forward looking statements disclaimer can be found in our sec filings as you re aware the divestment of our food specialty business was completed on 31st of october and following which ardagh holds a 42 stake in the trivium packaging joint venture our comments today will however focus on our continuing operations comprising metal beverage and glass packaging and trivium packaging will report its 2019 results on 5th of march so turning to the overall results first for the fourth quarter the results were in line with our expectations with revenue growth of 1 at constant currency to 1 6 billion adjusted ebitda of 267 million increased by 6 again at constant currency for the full year adjusted ebitda of 1 173 billion was in the upper end of our guidance range with adjusted earnings per share of 1 82 which was slightly ahead of our guidance and if we look at the segmental performance in the quarter and in the year and again i m focusing here on constant currency movements the metal beverage business which now represents over half of our annual revenues and where we have leading market positions in europe and in the americas total units shipped in the quarter increased by 4 in the quarter and 5 for the year metal beverage america demand remained strong across the region during the quarter as it did for the full year fourth quarter revenue increased by 6 to 457 million with units shipped increasing by 9 partly offset by the pass through of lower input costs adjusted ebitda of 66 million was 4 lower than the same period last year mainly reflecting a particularly strong comparable quarter last year but over the past two years fourth quarter adjusted ebitda has grown by a compound rate of 15 full year adjusted ebitda increased by 9 to 250 million with good gains in both the u s and in brazil and we re very pleased with the continued strong development of metal beverage in the americas since we acquired the business in 2016 units shipped in 2019 increased by 7 with growth in specialty cans of 17 and this is an area where we re well represented and as we look to 2020 and over the medium term the outlook remains very positive in the americas industry volumes in north america grew by 3 5 in 2019 and a greater sustainability awareness has contributed to new product introductions being increasingly co2 beverage cans the brazilian market grew by double digits in 2019 and structural shifts further underpin consumer driven demand growth over the medium term in addition to these industrywide factors we in ardagh have significantly diversified our own customer base in recent years and notably this has been the case in north america and we have been growing our presence in faster growing segments of the market including hard seltzers energy drinks and sparkling waters and the focus that we have on portfolio optimization with an emphasis on value over volume has delivered tangible benefits since 2016 and in parallel with this we ve made investments in support of our customers growth including our new ends facility in manaus in brazil and the addition of specialty capacity in north america despite all these investments we have at times been stretched to meet customer demand on our available for capacity our capacity for 2020 is fully sold and as we look forward we see opportunities to invest further in both north america and brazil in support of customer growth and market and the market conditions and the evolution support this also i ll return to this topic later in my remarks moving to metal beverage europe where revenue of 341 reflected a reduction of 1 in units shipped in the quarter compared to the same period last year marginally lower shipments reflected a strong comparable in 2018 as well as a disciplined commercial focus which led us to reduce volume with certain customers in the latter part of the year full year units shipped in europe increased by 2 compared with the same period in 2018 market fundamentals remained attractive but temporary cost under recovery from some legacy contracts resulted in a reduction in adjusted ebitda in the quarter we do however expect to cycle through these headwinds by the middle of this year european beverage can demand remains healthy underpinned by ever increasing sustainability awareness and our capacity for 2020 is fully sold our geographic exposure our 40 specialty mix and a well invested cost efficient asset base provide confidence in our outlook for the area but we will remain focused on achieving appropriate value for our products if i turn to glass glass in europe delivered another excellent performance with good progress in adjusted ebitda and margins of over 25 revenue increased by 6 to 395 million compared to same period last year principally due to positive pricing and the pass through of increased input costs volume mix was flat in the quarter full year revenue increased by 5 to 1 6 billion compared to 2018 adjusted ebitda of 99 million in glass europe increased by 21 compared to the same period in 2018 and ebitda for the full year grew by 15 to 391 million market conditions remained attractive in glass europe with growing sustainability awareness and an appreciation by consumers of the infinite recyclability of glass packaging and by the brand owners of the potential of glass to drive growth through premiumization and innovation glass packaging in north america performed well in the fourth quarter and was benefiting from the wide ranging actions we initiated in 2017 in response to challenging market conditions revenue of 388 million was marginally lower than the same period last year as a 2 decline in volume and mix was offset by the pass through of input of increased costs full year revenue fell by 1 to 1 7 billion compared with last year adjusted ebitda increased by 18 to 58 million compared with the same quarter last year growth was driven by cost efficiencies including from past footprint adjustments the disciplined pass through of input cost and positive ifrs 16 effects full year ebitda increased by 9 to 279 million we are pleased to have stabilized profitability in 2019 with some growth achieved in the second half the multiple initiatives that our team in north america has undertaken in the last two years in rightsizing our footprint rebalancing our business mix investing in quick return projects and continuously benchmarking and optimizing our cost base have significantly improved the position of the business and its ability to navigate current markets but there is much more to be done we see scope for improvement in the coming years and we ll invest in pursuit of further efficiencies and enhancing our capabilities as we outlined last quarter alongside these initiatives as a member of the american glass coalition we filed anti dumping and countervailing duty petitions in 2019 against unfairly traded chinese glass container imports we filed this at the international trade commission and at the department of commerce in washington and we welcome the itc s unanimous preliminary finding last november of a reasonable indication of material injury to domestic producers from such imports and we look forward to the department of commerce s assessment of duties which is due shortly such duties once imposed would be an addition to tariffs which were introduced in 2018 by the u s government on chinese imports and will remain in force subject and these new tariffs will remain in force subject to final approval for an initial five year period while the glass market in north america remains oversupplied our footprint adjustments and other actions coupled with the establishment of a level playing field lead us to see a positive future for glass packaging in north america we are committed to the successful long term development of this business with europe providing the template for a well invested and efficient industry supplying high quality sustainable packaging to a diversified customer base turning then to sustainability which has been a very hot topic in the last year and we ve seen a greater focus on this whole area and ardagh as a producer of infinitely recyclable metal and glass packaging is set to benefit from this trend it is also an area in which we have invested significant resources over many years as we view economic sustainability and environmental sustainability as inter dependent this has informed our initiatives to achieve industry leading colored usage in europe including direct investments in colored collection and colored treatment joint ventures as well as continuous programs to down gauge and lightweight our products we recently published our 2019 sustainability report updating on progress made toward our 2025 targets we ve also appointed senior executive as chief sustainability officer and have recently established a board sustainability committee to oversee this important area and our progress continues to be recognized by external accreditations most recently with our climate change rating from the carbon disclosure project and sustainability driven shifts in the substrate are here to stay as permanent materials metal in vast packaging are well positioned to win from this stronger medium term demand outlook and we are totally focused on seizing the opportunity this presents by providing existing and new customers with sustainable solutions as they respond to changing consumer preferences if i turn now to business growth investments the favorable current and projected demand backdrop for our products has created a range of investment opportunities right across the group all of which leverage our existing scale and market presence to generate attractive returns on investment in an environment when low or even negative interest rates have significantly elevated the valuation multiples of acquisition targets the pursuit of our organic growth opportunities represents a compelling shareholder value proposition these investments are also deleveraging we therefore plan to invest approximately 250 million on business growth investments in 2020 this investment will occur principally in our metal beverage businesses and in glass europe we will prioritize growth investments in existing production facilities and these investments have materially lower implementation times and start up risks thereby resulting in enhanced returns the investments in new capacity will also be supported by customer contracts the business growth investments will be additional to and separate from annual maintenance capex expenditure across our business which is approximately 350 million in 2020 the business growth investments will be funded from cash flow if i turn then to our capital structure we have also we have during last year materially enhanced our capital structure we delevered to 4 5 times pro forma adjusted ebitda reflecting strong cash generation and the divestment of the food and specialty packaging to the trivium joint venture and in parallel we continue to invest in our business with 500 million of capital investment in our continuing businesses during 2019 annualized cash interest costs were reduced by 180 million during the year to a pro forma 260 million as a result of debt repayment and the august refinancing of our 2024 senior notes these actions also had the effect of extending our average debt maturity to almost six years also we refinanced the debt of our holding company in 2019 with the maturities extended to mid 2027 and the interest rate reduced from approximately 7 2 to less than 5 8 and having delevered to 4 5 times ebitda at the end of 19 we intend to maintain leverage in a range of 4 to 4 5 times adjusted ebitda and we believe this range to be appropriate given the inherent stability of our business underpinned by its scale with annualized revenues of almost 7 billion and adjusted ebitda of some 1 2 billion and with the geographic focus in europe and in north america and a smaller one in brazil secondly we supply a diversified blue chip customer based in the stable beverage and food end markets with three quarters of our revenue under multi year contract and thirdly our prudent capital structure where average debt maturities i mentioned earlier are almost six years and where some 90 of our debt is at fixed rates current interest cover is approaching five times and in addition we retained significant secured debt capacity and an attractive covenant structure so for all these reasons we think the range of 4 to 4 5 times ebitda for leverage is appropriate so in summary performance for 19 has seen significant operational and financial progress and we look to the future with confidence and while we are mindful of macroeconomic risks we are targeting further progress in 2020 and expect the following adjusted ebitda of approximately 1 2 billion this compares with the 2019 pro forma ebitda of 1 73 billion which at current exchange rates of around a 1 08 to the euro versus 1 12 in 2019 this equates to 1 15 billion business growth investments are expected to only contribute modestly to ebitda in 2020 we expect free cash flow in 2020 before these business growth investments of 375 to 400 million and we expect maintenance capital expenditure in the year of 350 million adjusted eps is expected to be in the range of 1 48 to 1 64 per share this excludes the contribution from trivium packaging which will be equity accounted and from which no cash contribution is expected in the initial years we expect first quarter 2020 adjusted ebitda to be approximately 270 million so having made these opening remarks we ll be delighted to take any questions which you may have questions and answers operator thank you first question is from the line of anthony pettinari from citi please go ahead your line is now open randy toth citi analyst good morning guys this is actually randy toth sitting in for anthony you completed the 150 million in special payback projects at the end of 2019 which were originally expected to boost ebitda by 40 million or so on a continuing operation standpoint with the ebitda guidance implying an uplift of about 25 million year over year is it possible to say how much of that is from these projects versus organic growth thank you david matthews group chief financial officer and director i think we saw some of those investment spread over a two year period we would have seen a very small amount coming through in 2018 but then they did contribute usefully in over the course of 2019 so the incremental contribution in the current year is probably of the order of about maybe 15 million or so as we get into 20 over 2019 but the one other point as we mentioned the 1173 million to the approximate 1200 million if you adjust that for currency instead of being at 20 odd million randy toth citi analyst okay yeah that makes sense and then i think on those projects there was something like a three year payback period i m just wondering if the 250 million i guess you announced what kind of returns you re expecting there or what kind of payback thank you paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer well i think we said that they re deleveraging which by definition would mean they re less than the 4 to 4 5 year payback randy toth citi analyst okay that s helpful i think in your prepared remarks you mentioned the specialty can mix is around 40 of your portfolio right now is that expected to increase after these projects announced today are completed paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer yes david matthews group chief financial officer and director it will yes the mix overall last year was about 40 higher in brazil just a shade on the 40 didn t in the other markets but it s predominantly in that area randy toth citi analyst okay that s helpful i will turn it over thank you operator next question is from roger spitz from bank of america please go ahead your line is now open roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks good afternoon first what was the outstanding amount on your off balance sheet to securitization at december 31 paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer 470 million roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst and your assumptions for the 375 million to 400 million your free cash flow you gave the 350 million as the capex base capex what do you have for cash interest taxes working capital any other items to make them upto 400 million paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer let me just walk you through that roger we start with around 1 2 billion ebitda capex 350 million interest around 260 million tax 80 million we ve got the repayments on the leases that are now on the balance sheet of around 80 million and we expect a bit of investment in working capital to support the growth projects that s sort of around 40 million so if you add that lot out that should come to a number in the 375 million to 400 million range and that s clearly before the business growth investment spend roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and in terms of the business growth investment would we be likely to see 2021 to be on the same order of magnitude of 250 million or will that start to ramp down paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer we haven t made any decisions on that yet it depends on market conditions and demand conditions i think if they continue the growth and demand continues as we see it now particularly in our bev can business i think it s likely that there will be further investment but the quantum of that would be we couldn t yet say but i mean it s attractive for us because i mentioned the paybacks onus and obviously we are in business to support our customers so it very much depends on demand trends but as trends are today and if the demand is very strong in the bev can area then yes i think it s likely you will see some investment further investments roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst and lastly can you give a sense of by how much of this investment will grow both your global beverage can capacity and your glass europe capacity say on a percentage basis paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer well i think most the bulk of the investment will occur in metal beverage both in principally in the americas in the u s and in brazil and some in european glass roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you very much operator next question is from travis edwards from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is now open travis edwards goldman sachs analyst hi thanks for the time and good morning i just wanted to ask a quick question on capital allocation i was wondering if you had any updated thoughts or commentary on how you re thinking about your dividend policy as far as upstreaming maybe taking out a dividend for shareholders and potentially stripping away some of those holdco notes paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer i think at the moment travis we are continuing with our dividends which is pretty much in line with what we ve done in previous quarters and i think this will be a year of investment we haven t made any decision yet in relation to whether there will be a further dividend for shareholders or not i think it s too early in the year to come to any such conclusion i d obviously be happy to pay out dividends and reduce our holdco debt as we go forward and i think that s something we will eventually do travis edwards goldman sachs analyst got it and then do you mind just refreshing us on that rp capacity that you have at the opco paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer the rp capacity at the moment is 580 million travis edwards goldman sachs analyst appreciate the time thank you very much operator next question is from debbie jones from deutsche bank please go ahead your line is open debbie jones deutsche bank analyst hi good morning i wanted to ask one more question about the north america investments do you think that what you re putting in right now will allow you to grow in line with the market in 2021 if it continues to grow around this rate and if not are you prepared to add incremental capacity if it does and kind of like on a smaller scale whether it be like line additions and things like that paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer well debbie our approach to this has been to look at our investment and increases in capacity in our existing plants rather than build greenfield plants the returns are better it s easier to execute these projects and that s where our focus lies at the moment and that s going to mean additional lines speed up etc etc yes of course as i said in an earlier answer we will look at further investment if that s appropriate and the returns are there and it s backed up by customer contracts i think at the moment we don t have any plans to build greenfield operations so it whether or not we get outpaced by the market in terms of percentage share i m not sure that s the main consideration for us is to be disciplined in our approach to pricing and returns and obviously to be disciplined in terms of the returns we make on these capital investments debbie jones deutsche bank analyst okay thanks so fair points if i could just move to brazil you did sound pretty optimistic about the growth there as well so i m curious how you manage that going forward just given that there is a lot of interest right now on north america and in european glass it s a good problem to have but i d like to get your thoughts on that as well paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer i m sorry the last bit debbie i didn t quite catch the last bit of your question debbie jones deutsche bank analyst so i just mentioned that it was a good problem to have in terms of right now it s in the focus being north america and europe for the investment but you also sounded pretty confident or pretty optimistic about the growth down in brazil as well so i just wanted to get your thoughts on how you manage that given whereas the capital is going into the other regions paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer yeah well i think i think the situation in brazil is that there are structural changes in the market place down there with people moving from one type of packaging to another you ve seen movement from glass to cans there in brazil we re not in glass down there but so that has led to increased demand and other factors as well down there and we are lucky in that the three plants we have in manaus and jacarei and alagoinhas the two can plants in alagoinhas and jacarei and then the plants in manaus we re lucky that we can significantly increase capacity within those existing factories without having to build any new facilities so it s much easier for us to increase capacity and also the returns on adding additional lines are more attractive than building greenfields or having to build new plants and much less risky so we ve also got a very strong team down there right across the piece and we have very modern assets and we re certainly prepared to invest to expand them so i think for us it s a good situation in brazil debbie jones deutsche bank analyst okay thank you very much for the clarity i ll turn it over operator next question is from michael leithead from barclays please go ahead your line is open michael leithead barclays analyst thanks good afternoon guys i guess first question if i look at the metal can businesses it looks like in the fourth quarter organic revenue was up but ebitda was down so can you kind of just parse through some of the cost headwinds that you guys had in this quarter david matthews group chief financial officer and director yeah i think there was two things in europe for the past several quarters that we have alluded to it was the number of contracts that came up for renewal when new capacity was coming into the market and not buying out the asset the beverage can business back around in 2015 2017 so we some cost headwinds there and then if those fully recover we would expect to be fully cycled through that by the middle of this current year and in the americas the business has performed very strongly we ve seen good volume we ve been stretched as we mentioned to meet demand in both north america and in brazil so you know there seems to be increased cost there but as we said in the remarks that the growth because it s on a two year basis and the compound rate of growth in fourth quarter ebitda in our americas beverage business is about 15 so that s purely temporary and both businesses grew quite strongly on a full year basis revenue volumes and ebitda michael leithead barclays analyst got it that s helpful and i think you made in your prepared remarks or commentary that you re fully sold out for 2020 so what does that look like then in terms of volume growth year over year versus 19 and also in terms of ebitda growth for the metal can business david matthews group chief financial officer and director i think in europe the market is it s traditionally been a low single digit 2 to 3 growth could be a little bit better than that we did mention that with discipline in the fourth quarter that s when some business that we didn t take so that was a little tougher so that s kind of in that the low single digit range and then in north america and brazil we ve been flat out struggling at times to meet demand so we have been investments going in but they will take a little bit of time so they will limit the their effect in the current year will be limited in terms of volume we ve also as we said diversified our concentration of our business so it s not purely about volume there particularly in north america it s more so about value and mix michael leithead barclays analyst got it and if i could just squeeze one more in if we look at the north american glass market obviously it s been a bit of an evolution in terms of volume numbers for the past year or so but you guys still seem to be doing well on the cost front and keeping ebitda in line so can you maybe just talk a little bit about what your expectations are just for the broader north american glass market as we enter 2020 and how you guys are thinking about it from an ardagh perspective paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer well i think there is still as i said earlier michael there is still excess capacity in the market i think the tariffs the coming the existing tariffs and the coming tariffs from the actions we took will strengthen demand or at the very least stem the falls in demand and i think if we ve rightsized our we believe our portfolio is now rightsized to the business we have and our focus will be on improving the profitability of the business through an improvement in operating performance so as we see it as i said earlier i mean i don t think i think it s going to take time for it to start growing again but we are quite optimistic that we have the levers to do that michael leithead barclays analyst great thank you guys operator next question is from brian maguire from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is now open arthur almeida goldman sachs analyst good morning this is actually arthur on for brian and in a past conference in december of last year you mentioned you were looking to alter your contract structure particularly in european glass i was hoping you could give us some more color on what percentage of the overall revenues in that segment would be changed based on those contracts and when you think that timeline is going to take place david matthews group chief financial officer and director i think what we ve alluded to it s not about european glass if you look the performance there this year and over many years has been extremely positive we ve talked more so about some of the indexation and the process like that in north america on the metal side and in some aspects of the glass side where we ve been working on that throughout the year so that s progressing but you can only do it at a pace at which context so now that s really about getting the pass throughs the cost pass throughs more aligned rather than just a straight tech and improve ppi to whether it s the labor component or a freight component or a chemicals component we ve made good headway in that in the past were into specifically to european glass arthur almeida goldman sachs analyst i wasn t referring to the pricing maybe i misunderstood then but i was under the impression that it had to do more so with volumes specifically with customers having to actually purchase the capacity that they are making ardagh obligated to cover or is my understanding of that incorrect paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer well i mean it s i wouldn t make a huge issue of it i mean it s something area that we that arthur that we have been working on to make sure where you ve got full capacity utilization of your capacity and in some cases excess demand in europe for glass we want to make sure that the customers that you allocate capacity to actually take that capacity i think that may have been the reference and obviously we re working very closely with our customers to ensure that we fully use our capacity each year and that we don t have unused capacity or unsold capacity in markets which are very tight so i think it s more that kind of commercial focus rather than perhaps some contractual change but i think that s more the general commercial focus than anything else arthur almeida goldman sachs analyst thank you operator next question is from gabe hajde from wells fargo securities please go ahead your line is open gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst thank you good morning gentlemen can you hear me paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer yeah sure gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst i m curious if you had or i m sure you do have visibility into european beverage contracts kind of cycling through what seems to be a little bit of under recovered inflation here how much of that business has turned kind of since it was acquired in 2016 and are you at a point where now you ve kind of cycled through all those and are on terms that you like paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer well i think gabe we at the time of the takeover in 16 clearly there was a fair amount of shifting around with volumes that were new entrants and new capacity over the last few years built in europe and the market has started to grow into that capacity and at the time we took it over we had to defend some volumes and some of those contracts are now starting to run off and as we said earlier we ll probably cycle through most of those headwinds by the middle of this year and we are very focused now in getting properly paid for our products and as john said earlier we have walked away from business in the last quarter of last year because we weren t happy that it provided us with the appropriate returns for our product so we will adopt a very disciplined approach to it i think clearly the demand supply situation in north america and brazil is tighter than it is in europe but it is tightening in europe as well as we see increased demand for beverage can products in europe and i think as has been referenced by others we may well we probably will see some migration of seltzer volume into europe as well which will provide growth opportunities as we go forward gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst okay thank you and i think the question has been asked a couple of different angles and i ll try one more time is there something different that you re doing within kind of the four walls of the beverage can business i mean my understanding is that you get much past three lines within a facility and things get a little complex to manage sometimes and so i guess if growth persist call it in this 3 to 5 range in the markets in which you participate is there a point in time i m sure there is that you re going to have to put new brick and mortar in the ground or can you continue to add here in the next two years if again growth is sustained in that range paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer i wouldn t yeah there may be but we certainly don t see it happening in the immediate future for us because we have opportunities to invest in our existing plants i can t comment for others it s a function of what space you have in your buildings than the configuration of the plants but we feel quite strongly that we should take these opportunities for investment first before we look at any greenfield investments they re much less risky you have the trained personnel on site already who can mentor new staff and the execution risks are far lower so we re comfortable as i said earlier we will be disciplined in our approach to this whole area but i don t know what s going to happen two years out i mean that s something we ll have to look at when we see what the evolution of the market is but i don t think we want to get out ahead of our skis here gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst understood and one just maybe trying to put a finer point you made the comment about being fully sold out in north america are you can you comment if you are in fact tolling cans at all in the market or you re just running full out david matthews group chief financial officer and director yeah it was a modest amount over each of the last couple of years but we don t visit any of that in the current year in 2020 gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst great thank you good luck paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator next question is from mark wilde from bank of montreal please go ahead your line is open mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst good morning paul paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer good morning mark how are you mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst good i wondered if we could get a little more granularity on that where the 250 million is going in terms of kind of particular projects and how much capacity this will add paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer no i think mark we re comfortable with the amount of granularity we ve given already and i don t think that i think we ve given you guidance as to where it will be but as to specific plants specific lines specific customers no i think we ll pass on that mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst okay is it possible also to get a sense of whether there is any benefit in 2020 from some of these contracts that were redone in north america in the beverage can business paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer yes clearly there is mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst and is it possible to get any kind of order of magnitude on that for how much it will benefit ardagh paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer no i think i mean the big contracts have been renegotiated for in the market we reduced our exposure to some of the bigger customers in the u s since 2016 our business mix has changed we re much less dependent on the bigger customers than we were when we bought the business in 2016 and this has been a focus to improve pricing and improve margins and i think it s reflected in the results mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst okay and then any thoughts paul on potential actions to improve liquidity in the stock over time paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer at the current levels no in terms of increasing the free float i think our we refined our holdco debt in a way that put it out to 2027 i mean clearly in the future we can still place stock and reduce that debt or but i wouldn t be of a mind to do that at the current stock levels share prices given our view of the businesses we re in and the prospect for those businesses going forward mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst okay and then the last one for me just kind of a very industry specific one we talk a lot about the sustainability of glass but at least in north america just it seems like less and less glasses are actually being collected by kind of recyclers or municipalities so that in reality the amount of the glass that s actually being recycled is probably going down any thoughts on that paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer yeah i mean clearly recycling rates in glass in north american market i think they re somewhere around 30 compared to much much higher levels than that in europe so they re very low and one of the main drivers is that too much glass far too much glass in the u s go straight to landfill and there isn t segregation one issue there the second issue you have is some of the quality of supply and the quality of the colors is not as good as we find in europe and the cost of it as well and we are working with various people on various initiatives and with customers who are very focused on this area some of the bigger beer customers for example in the u s are very focused on trying to improve these recycling levels but it s not a it s not something you can you know flash a wand and get an instant result on this is something that some structural changes are going to have to take place here but it is very strange as an european to see so much glass go straight to landfill and landfill of course is much deeper in the u s than in europe mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst okay all right that s helpful i ll turn it over good luck in 2020 paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator and that was our final question for today so i ll hand the call back to paul coulson for any closing comments please go ahead paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer good well thank you everyone for joining us on the call today and we look forward to talking to you again in april with our q1 results ok thank you very much operator duration 44 minutes call participants paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer david matthews

ard earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 ardagh group s a ard q4 2019 earnings call 10 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator hello everyone and welcome to the ardagh fourth quarter and full year 2019 results i will now hand the call over to paul coulson chairman and ceo please begin paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer well good morning and good afternoon everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call which follows publication earlier today of our results for the quarter and the full year with me as usual are david matthews our cfo shaun murphy our coo and john sheehan our corporate development and investor relations director our remarks will include certain forward looking statements these reflects circumstances at the time they are made and the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied due to a wide range of factors including those set forth in our sec filings and news releases our earnings release for the quarter as well as our financial report related materials can be found at ardaghgroup com information regarding the use of non gaap financial measures may also be found in the notes section of the release which also includes a reconciliation to the most comparable gaap measures of adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per share full details of the company s statutory forward looking statements disclaimer can be found in our sec filings as you re aware the divestment of our food specialty business was completed on 31st of october and following which ardagh holds a 42 stake in the trivium packaging joint venture our comments today will however focus on our continuing operations comprising metal beverage and glass packaging and trivium packaging will report its 2019 results on 5th of march so turning to the overall results first for the fourth quarter the results were in line with our expectations with revenue growth of 1 at constant currency to 1 6 billion adjusted ebitda of 267 million increased by 6 again at constant currency for the full year adjusted ebitda of 1 173 billion was in the upper end of our guidance range with adjusted earnings per share of 1 82 which was slightly ahead of our guidance and if we look at the segmental performance in the quarter and in the year and again i m focusing here on constant currency movements the metal beverage business which now represents over half of our annual revenues and where we have leading market positions in europe and in the americas total units shipped in the quarter increased by 4 in the quarter and 5 for the year metal beverage america demand remained strong across the region during the quarter as it did for the full year fourth quarter revenue increased by 6 to 457 million with units shipped increasing by 9 partly offset by the pass through of lower input costs adjusted ebitda of 66 million was 4 lower than the same period last year mainly reflecting a particularly strong comparable quarter last year but over the past two years fourth quarter adjusted ebitda has grown by a compound rate of 15 full year adjusted ebitda increased by 9 to 250 million with good gains in both the u s and in brazil and we re very pleased with the continued strong development of metal beverage in the americas since we acquired the business in 2016 units shipped in 2019 increased by 7 with growth in specialty cans of 17 and this is an area where we re well represented and as we look to 2020 and over the medium term the outlook remains very positive in the americas industry volumes in north america grew by 3 5 in 2019 and a greater sustainability awareness has contributed to new product introductions being increasingly co2 beverage cans the brazilian market grew by double digits in 2019 and structural shifts further underpin consumer driven demand growth over the medium term in addition to these industrywide factors we in ardagh have significantly diversified our own customer base in recent years and notably this has been the case in north america and we have been growing our presence in faster growing segments of the market including hard seltzers energy drinks and sparkling waters and the focus that we have on portfolio optimization with an emphasis on value over volume has delivered tangible benefits since 2016 and in parallel with this we ve made investments in support of our customers growth including our new ends facility in manaus in brazil and the addition of specialty capacity in north america despite all these investments we have at times been stretched to meet customer demand on our available for capacity our capacity for 2020 is fully sold and as we look forward we see opportunities to invest further in both north america and brazil in support of customer growth and market and the market conditions and the evolution support this also i ll return to this topic later in my remarks moving to metal beverage europe where revenue of 341 reflected a reduction of 1 in units shipped in the quarter compared to the same period last year marginally lower shipments reflected a strong comparable in 2018 as well as a disciplined commercial focus which led us to reduce volume with certain customers in the latter part of the year full year units shipped in europe increased by 2 compared with the same period in 2018 market fundamentals remained attractive but temporary cost under recovery from some legacy contracts resulted in a reduction in adjusted ebitda in the quarter we do however expect to cycle through these headwinds by the middle of this year european beverage can demand remains healthy underpinned by ever increasing sustainability awareness and our capacity for 2020 is fully sold our geographic exposure our 40 specialty mix and a well invested cost efficient asset base provide confidence in our outlook for the area but we will remain focused on achieving appropriate value for our products if i turn to glass glass in europe delivered another excellent performance with good progress in adjusted ebitda and margins of over 25 revenue increased by 6 to 395 million compared to same period last year principally due to positive pricing and the pass through of increased input costs volume mix was flat in the quarter full year revenue increased by 5 to 1 6 billion compared to 2018 adjusted ebitda of 99 million in glass europe increased by 21 compared to the same period in 2018 and ebitda for the full year grew by 15 to 391 million market conditions remained attractive in glass europe with growing sustainability awareness and an appreciation by consumers of the infinite recyclability of glass packaging and by the brand owners of the potential of glass to drive growth through premiumization and innovation glass packaging in north america performed well in the fourth quarter and was benefiting from the wide ranging actions we initiated in 2017 in response to challenging market conditions revenue of 388 million was marginally lower than the same period last year as a 2 decline in volume and mix was offset by the pass through of input of increased costs full year revenue fell by 1 to 1 7 billion compared with last year adjusted ebitda increased by 18 to 58 million compared with the same quarter last year growth was driven by cost efficiencies including from past footprint adjustments the disciplined pass through of input cost and positive ifrs 16 effects full year ebitda increased by 9 to 279 million we are pleased to have stabilized profitability in 2019 with some growth achieved in the second half the multiple initiatives that our team in north america has undertaken in the last two years in rightsizing our footprint rebalancing our business mix investing in quick return projects and continuously benchmarking and optimizing our cost base have significantly improved the position of the business and its ability to navigate current markets but there is much more to be done we see scope for improvement in the coming years and we ll invest in pursuit of further efficiencies and enhancing our capabilities as we outlined last quarter alongside these initiatives as a member of the american glass coalition we filed anti dumping and countervailing duty petitions in 2019 against unfairly traded chinese glass container imports we filed this at the international trade commission and at the department of commerce in washington and we welcome the itc s unanimous preliminary finding last november of a reasonable indication of material injury to domestic producers from such imports and we look forward to the department of commerce s assessment of duties which is due shortly such duties once imposed would be an addition to tariffs which were introduced in 2018 by the u s government on chinese imports and will remain in force subject and these new tariffs will remain in force subject to final approval for an initial five year period while the glass market in north america remains oversupplied our footprint adjustments and other actions coupled with the establishment of a level playing field lead us to see a positive future for glass packaging in north america we are committed to the successful long term development of this business with europe providing the template for a well invested and efficient industry supplying high quality sustainable packaging to a diversified customer base turning then to sustainability which has been a very hot topic in the last year and we ve seen a greater focus on this whole area and ardagh as a producer of infinitely recyclable metal and glass packaging is set to benefit from this trend it is also an area in which we have invested significant resources over many years as we view economic sustainability and environmental sustainability as inter dependent this has informed our initiatives to achieve industry leading colored usage in europe including direct investments in colored collection and colored treatment joint ventures as well as continuous programs to down gauge and lightweight our products we recently published our 2019 sustainability report updating on progress made toward our 2025 targets we ve also appointed senior executive as chief sustainability officer and have recently established a board sustainability committee to oversee this important area and our progress continues to be recognized by external accreditations most recently with our climate change rating from the carbon disclosure project and sustainability driven shifts in the substrate are here to stay as permanent materials metal in vast packaging are well positioned to win from this stronger medium term demand outlook and we are totally focused on seizing the opportunity this presents by providing existing and new customers with sustainable solutions as they respond to changing consumer preferences if i turn now to business growth investments the favorable current and projected demand backdrop for our products has created a range of investment opportunities right across the group all of which leverage our existing scale and market presence to generate attractive returns on investment in an environment when low or even negative interest rates have significantly elevated the valuation multiples of acquisition targets the pursuit of our organic growth opportunities represents a compelling shareholder value proposition these investments are also deleveraging we therefore plan to invest approximately 250 million on business growth investments in 2020 this investment will occur principally in our metal beverage businesses and in glass europe we will prioritize growth investments in existing production facilities and these investments have materially lower implementation times and start up risks thereby resulting in enhanced returns the investments in new capacity will also be supported by customer contracts the business growth investments will be additional to and separate from annual maintenance capex expenditure across our business which is approximately 350 million in 2020 the business growth investments will be funded from cash flow if i turn then to our capital structure we have also we have during last year materially enhanced our capital structure we delevered to 4 5 times pro forma adjusted ebitda reflecting strong cash generation and the divestment of the food and specialty packaging to the trivium joint venture and in parallel we continue to invest in our business with 500 million of capital investment in our continuing businesses during 2019 annualized cash interest costs were reduced by 180 million during the year to a pro forma 260 million as a result of debt repayment and the august refinancing of our 2024 senior notes these actions also had the effect of extending our average debt maturity to almost six years also we refinanced the debt of our holding company in 2019 with the maturities extended to mid 2027 and the interest rate reduced from approximately 7 2 to less than 5 8 and having delevered to 4 5 times ebitda at the end of 19 we intend to maintain leverage in a range of 4 to 4 5 times adjusted ebitda and we believe this range to be appropriate given the inherent stability of our business underpinned by its scale with annualized revenues of almost 7 billion and adjusted ebitda of some 1 2 billion and with the geographic focus in europe and in north america and a smaller one in brazil secondly we supply a diversified blue chip customer based in the stable beverage and food end markets with three quarters of our revenue under multi year contract and thirdly our prudent capital structure where average debt maturities i mentioned earlier are almost six years and where some 90 of our debt is at fixed rates current interest cover is approaching five times and in addition we retained significant secured debt capacity and an attractive covenant structure so for all these reasons we think the range of 4 to 4 5 times ebitda for leverage is appropriate so in summary performance for 19 has seen significant operational and financial progress and we look to the future with confidence and while we are mindful of macroeconomic risks we are targeting further progress in 2020 and expect the following adjusted ebitda of approximately 1 2 billion this compares with the 2019 pro forma ebitda of 1 73 billion which at current exchange rates of around a 1 08 to the euro versus 1 12 in 2019 this equates to 1 15 billion business growth investments are expected to only contribute modestly to ebitda in 2020 we expect free cash flow in 2020 before these business growth investments of 375 to 400 million and we expect maintenance capital expenditure in the year of 350 million adjusted eps is expected to be in the range of 1 48 to 1 64 per share this excludes the contribution from trivium packaging which will be equity accounted and from which no cash contribution is expected in the initial years we expect first quarter 2020 adjusted ebitda to be approximately 270 million so having made these opening remarks we ll be delighted to take any questions which you may have questions and answers operator thank you first question is from the line of anthony pettinari from citi please go ahead your line is now open randy toth citi analyst good morning guys this is actually randy toth sitting in for anthony you completed the 150 million in special payback projects at the end of 2019 which were originally expected to boost ebitda by 40 million or so on a continuing operation standpoint with the ebitda guidance implying an uplift of about 25 million year over year is it possible to say how much of that is from these projects versus organic growth thank you david matthews group chief financial officer and director i think we saw some of those investment spread over a two year period we would have seen a very small amount coming through in 2018 but then they did contribute usefully in over the course of 2019 so the incremental contribution in the current year is probably of the order of about maybe 15 million or so as we get into 20 over 2019 but the one other point as we mentioned the 1173 million to the approximate 1200 million if you adjust that for currency instead of being at 20 odd million randy toth citi analyst okay yeah that makes sense and then i think on those projects there was something like a three year payback period i m just wondering if the 250 million i guess you announced what kind of returns you re expecting there or what kind of payback thank you paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer well i think we said that they re deleveraging which by definition would mean they re less than the 4 to 4 5 year payback randy toth citi analyst okay that s helpful i think in your prepared remarks you mentioned the specialty can mix is around 40 of your portfolio right now is that expected to increase after these projects announced today are completed paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer yes david matthews group chief financial officer and director it will yes the mix overall last year was about 40 higher in brazil just a shade on the 40 didn t in the other markets but it s predominantly in that area randy toth citi analyst okay that s helpful i will turn it over thank you operator next question is from roger spitz from bank of america please go ahead your line is now open roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks good afternoon first what was the outstanding amount on your off balance sheet to securitization at december 31 paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer 470 million roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst and your assumptions for the 375 million to 400 million your free cash flow you gave the 350 million as the capex base capex what do you have for cash interest taxes working capital any other items to make them upto 400 million paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer let me just walk you through that roger we start with around 1 2 billion ebitda capex 350 million interest around 260 million tax 80 million we ve got the repayments on the leases that are now on the balance sheet of around 80 million and we expect a bit of investment in working capital to support the growth projects that s sort of around 40 million so if you add that lot out that should come to a number in the 375 million to 400 million range and that s clearly before the business growth investment spend roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and in terms of the business growth investment would we be likely to see 2021 to be on the same order of magnitude of 250 million or will that start to ramp down paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer we haven t made any decisions on that yet it depends on market conditions and demand conditions i think if they continue the growth and demand continues as we see it now particularly in our bev can business i think it s likely that there will be further investment but the quantum of that would be we couldn t yet say but i mean it s attractive for us because i mentioned the paybacks onus and obviously we are in business to support our customers so it very much depends on demand trends but as trends are today and if the demand is very strong in the bev can area then yes i think it s likely you will see some investment further investments roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst and lastly can you give a sense of by how much of this investment will grow both your global beverage can capacity and your glass europe capacity say on a percentage basis paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer well i think most the bulk of the investment will occur in metal beverage both in principally in the americas in the u s and in brazil and some in european glass roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you very much operator next question is from travis edwards from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is now open travis edwards goldman sachs analyst hi thanks for the time and good morning i just wanted to ask a quick question on capital allocation i was wondering if you had any updated thoughts or commentary on how you re thinking about your dividend policy as far as upstreaming maybe taking out a dividend for shareholders and potentially stripping away some of those holdco notes paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer i think at the moment travis we are continuing with our dividends which is pretty much in line with what we ve done in previous quarters and i think this will be a year of investment we haven t made any decision yet in relation to whether there will be a further dividend for shareholders or not i think it s too early in the year to come to any such conclusion i d obviously be happy to pay out dividends and reduce our holdco debt as we go forward and i think that s something we will eventually do travis edwards goldman sachs analyst got it and then do you mind just refreshing us on that rp capacity that you have at the opco paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer the rp capacity at the moment is 580 million travis edwards goldman sachs analyst appreciate the time thank you very much operator next question is from debbie jones from deutsche bank please go ahead your line is open debbie jones deutsche bank analyst hi good morning i wanted to ask one more question about the north america investments do you think that what you re putting in right now will allow you to grow in line with the market in 2021 if it continues to grow around this rate and if not are you prepared to add incremental capacity if it does and kind of like on a smaller scale whether it be like line additions and things like that paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer well debbie our approach to this has been to look at our investment and increases in capacity in our existing plants rather than build greenfield plants the returns are better it s easier to execute these projects and that s where our focus lies at the moment and that s going to mean additional lines speed up etc etc yes of course as i said in an earlier answer we will look at further investment if that s appropriate and the returns are there and it s backed up by customer contracts i think at the moment we don t have any plans to build greenfield operations so it whether or not we get outpaced by the market in terms of percentage share i m not sure that s the main consideration for us is to be disciplined in our approach to pricing and returns and obviously to be disciplined in terms of the returns we make on these capital investments debbie jones deutsche bank analyst okay thanks so fair points if i could just move to brazil you did sound pretty optimistic about the growth there as well so i m curious how you manage that going forward just given that there is a lot of interest right now on north america and in european glass it s a good problem to have but i d like to get your thoughts on that as well paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer i m sorry the last bit debbie i didn t quite catch the last bit of your question debbie jones deutsche bank analyst so i just mentioned that it was a good problem to have in terms of right now it s in the focus being north america and europe for the investment but you also sounded pretty confident or pretty optimistic about the growth down in brazil as well so i just wanted to get your thoughts on how you manage that given whereas the capital is going into the other regions paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer yeah well i think i think the situation in brazil is that there are structural changes in the market place down there with people moving from one type of packaging to another you ve seen movement from glass to cans there in brazil we re not in glass down there but so that has led to increased demand and other factors as well down there and we are lucky in that the three plants we have in manaus and jacarei and alagoinhas the two can plants in alagoinhas and jacarei and then the plants in manaus we re lucky that we can significantly increase capacity within those existing factories without having to build any new facilities so it s much easier for us to increase capacity and also the returns on adding additional lines are more attractive than building greenfields or having to build new plants and much less risky so we ve also got a very strong team down there right across the piece and we have very modern assets and we re certainly prepared to invest to expand them so i think for us it s a good situation in brazil debbie jones deutsche bank analyst okay thank you very much for the clarity i ll turn it over operator next question is from michael leithead from barclays please go ahead your line is open michael leithead barclays analyst thanks good afternoon guys i guess first question if i look at the metal can businesses it looks like in the fourth quarter organic revenue was up but ebitda was down so can you kind of just parse through some of the cost headwinds that you guys had in this quarter david matthews group chief financial officer and director yeah i think there was two things in europe for the past several quarters that we have alluded to it was the number of contracts that came up for renewal when new capacity was coming into the market and not buying out the asset the beverage can business back around in 2015 2017 so we some cost headwinds there and then if those fully recover we would expect to be fully cycled through that by the middle of this current year and in the americas the business has performed very strongly we ve seen good volume we ve been stretched as we mentioned to meet demand in both north america and in brazil so you know there seems to be increased cost there but as we said in the remarks that the growth because it s on a two year basis and the compound rate of growth in fourth quarter ebitda in our americas beverage business is about 15 so that s purely temporary and both businesses grew quite strongly on a full year basis revenue volumes and ebitda michael leithead barclays analyst got it that s helpful and i think you made in your prepared remarks or commentary that you re fully sold out for 2020 so what does that look like then in terms of volume growth year over year versus 19 and also in terms of ebitda growth for the metal can business david matthews group chief financial officer and director i think in europe the market is it s traditionally been a low single digit 2 to 3 growth could be a little bit better than that we did mention that with discipline in the fourth quarter that s when some business that we didn t take so that was a little tougher so that s kind of in that the low single digit range and then in north america and brazil we ve been flat out struggling at times to meet demand so we have been investments going in but they will take a little bit of time so they will limit the their effect in the current year will be limited in terms of volume we ve also as we said diversified our concentration of our business so it s not purely about volume there particularly in north america it s more so about value and mix michael leithead barclays analyst got it and if i could just squeeze one more in if we look at the north american glass market obviously it s been a bit of an evolution in terms of volume numbers for the past year or so but you guys still seem to be doing well on the cost front and keeping ebitda in line so can you maybe just talk a little bit about what your expectations are just for the broader north american glass market as we enter 2020 and how you guys are thinking about it from an ardagh perspective paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer well i think there is still as i said earlier michael there is still excess capacity in the market i think the tariffs the coming the existing tariffs and the coming tariffs from the actions we took will strengthen demand or at the very least stem the falls in demand and i think if we ve rightsized our we believe our portfolio is now rightsized to the business we have and our focus will be on improving the profitability of the business through an improvement in operating performance so as we see it as i said earlier i mean i don t think i think it s going to take time for it to start growing again but we are quite optimistic that we have the levers to do that michael leithead barclays analyst great thank you guys operator next question is from brian maguire from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is now open arthur almeida goldman sachs analyst good morning this is actually arthur on for brian and in a past conference in december of last year you mentioned you were looking to alter your contract structure particularly in european glass i was hoping you could give us some more color on what percentage of the overall revenues in that segment would be changed based on those contracts and when you think that timeline is going to take place david matthews group chief financial officer and director i think what we ve alluded to it s not about european glass if you look the performance there this year and over many years has been extremely positive we ve talked more so about some of the indexation and the process like that in north america on the metal side and in some aspects of the glass side where we ve been working on that throughout the year so that s progressing but you can only do it at a pace at which context so now that s really about getting the pass throughs the cost pass throughs more aligned rather than just a straight tech and improve ppi to whether it s the labor component or a freight component or a chemicals component we ve made good headway in that in the past were into specifically to european glass arthur almeida goldman sachs analyst i wasn t referring to the pricing maybe i misunderstood then but i was under the impression that it had to do more so with volumes specifically with customers having to actually purchase the capacity that they are making ardagh obligated to cover or is my understanding of that incorrect paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer well i mean it s i wouldn t make a huge issue of it i mean it s something area that we that arthur that we have been working on to make sure where you ve got full capacity utilization of your capacity and in some cases excess demand in europe for glass we want to make sure that the customers that you allocate capacity to actually take that capacity i think that may have been the reference and obviously we re working very closely with our customers to ensure that we fully use our capacity each year and that we don t have unused capacity or unsold capacity in markets which are very tight so i think it s more that kind of commercial focus rather than perhaps some contractual change but i think that s more the general commercial focus than anything else arthur almeida goldman sachs analyst thank you operator next question is from gabe hajde from wells fargo securities please go ahead your line is open gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst thank you good morning gentlemen can you hear me paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer yeah sure gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst i m curious if you had or i m sure you do have visibility into european beverage contracts kind of cycling through what seems to be a little bit of under recovered inflation here how much of that business has turned kind of since it was acquired in 2016 and are you at a point where now you ve kind of cycled through all those and are on terms that you like paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer well i think gabe we at the time of the takeover in 16 clearly there was a fair amount of shifting around with volumes that were new entrants and new capacity over the last few years built in europe and the market has started to grow into that capacity and at the time we took it over we had to defend some volumes and some of those contracts are now starting to run off and as we said earlier we ll probably cycle through most of those headwinds by the middle of this year and we are very focused now in getting properly paid for our products and as john said earlier we have walked away from business in the last quarter of last year because we weren t happy that it provided us with the appropriate returns for our product so we will adopt a very disciplined approach to it i think clearly the demand supply situation in north america and brazil is tighter than it is in europe but it is tightening in europe as well as we see increased demand for beverage can products in europe and i think as has been referenced by others we may well we probably will see some migration of seltzer volume into europe as well which will provide growth opportunities as we go forward gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst okay thank you and i think the question has been asked a couple of different angles and i ll try one more time is there something different that you re doing within kind of the four walls of the beverage can business i mean my understanding is that you get much past three lines within a facility and things get a little complex to manage sometimes and so i guess if growth persist call it in this 3 to 5 range in the markets in which you participate is there a point in time i m sure there is that you re going to have to put new brick and mortar in the ground or can you continue to add here in the next two years if again growth is sustained in that range paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer i wouldn t yeah there may be but we certainly don t see it happening in the immediate future for us because we have opportunities to invest in our existing plants i can t comment for others it s a function of what space you have in your buildings than the configuration of the plants but we feel quite strongly that we should take these opportunities for investment first before we look at any greenfield investments they re much less risky you have the trained personnel on site already who can mentor new staff and the execution risks are far lower so we re comfortable as i said earlier we will be disciplined in our approach to this whole area but i don t know what s going to happen two years out i mean that s something we ll have to look at when we see what the evolution of the market is but i don t think we want to get out ahead of our skis here gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst understood and one just maybe trying to put a finer point you made the comment about being fully sold out in north america are you can you comment if you are in fact tolling cans at all in the market or you re just running full out david matthews group chief financial officer and director yeah it was a modest amount over each of the last couple of years but we don t visit any of that in the current year in 2020 gabe hajde wells fargo securities analyst great thank you good luck paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator next question is from mark wilde from bank of montreal please go ahead your line is open mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst good morning paul paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer good morning mark how are you mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst good i wondered if we could get a little more granularity on that where the 250 million is going in terms of kind of particular projects and how much capacity this will add paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer no i think mark we re comfortable with the amount of granularity we ve given already and i don t think that i think we ve given you guidance as to where it will be but as to specific plants specific lines specific customers no i think we ll pass on that mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst okay is it possible also to get a sense of whether there is any benefit in 2020 from some of these contracts that were redone in north america in the beverage can business paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer yes clearly there is mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst and is it possible to get any kind of order of magnitude on that for how much it will benefit ardagh paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer no i think i mean the big contracts have been renegotiated for in the market we reduced our exposure to some of the bigger customers in the u s since 2016 our business mix has changed we re much less dependent on the bigger customers than we were when we bought the business in 2016 and this has been a focus to improve pricing and improve margins and i think it s reflected in the results mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst okay and then any thoughts paul on potential actions to improve liquidity in the stock over time paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer at the current levels no in terms of increasing the free float i think our we refined our holdco debt in a way that put it out to 2027 i mean clearly in the future we can still place stock and reduce that debt or but i wouldn t be of a mind to do that at the current stock levels share prices given our view of the businesses we re in and the prospect for those businesses going forward mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst okay and then the last one for me just kind of a very industry specific one we talk a lot about the sustainability of glass but at least in north america just it seems like less and less glasses are actually being collected by kind of recyclers or municipalities so that in reality the amount of the glass that s actually being recycled is probably going down any thoughts on that paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer yeah i mean clearly recycling rates in glass in north american market i think they re somewhere around 30 compared to much much higher levels than that in europe so they re very low and one of the main drivers is that too much glass far too much glass in the u s go straight to landfill and there isn t segregation one issue there the second issue you have is some of the quality of supply and the quality of the colors is not as good as we find in europe and the cost of it as well and we are working with various people on various initiatives and with customers who are very focused on this area some of the bigger beer customers for example in the u s are very focused on trying to improve these recycling levels but it s not a it s not something you can you know flash a wand and get an instant result on this is something that some structural changes are going to have to take place here but it is very strange as an european to see so much glass go straight to landfill and landfill of course is much deeper in the u s than in europe mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst okay all right that s helpful i ll turn it over good luck in 2020 paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator and that was our final question for today so i ll hand the call back to paul coulson for any closing comments please go ahead paul coulson chairman and chief executive officer good well thank you everyone for joining us on the call today and we look forward to talking to you again in april with our q1 results ok thank you very much operator duration 44 minutes call participants paul

up 72 over 2018 primarily on higher gold sale volumes and higher precious metal prices in 2020 we are expecting production increases of 7 for silver and 16 for gold considering the strength of our business and financial position the board has decided to increase the quarterly dividend by 43 to 0 05 per share net income in q4 2019 was 51 7 million or 0 25 per share this included the investment

the gold segment of our operations were 901 in q4 and 948 per ounce for the year sustaining capital of 179 1 million came in below our guidance of 203 million to 213 million largely as a result of timing the deferred capex is included in our guidance for 2020 sustaining capital 2020 we are expecting to spend 225 million to 240 million on sustaining capital important projects are heap leach pad and waste rock dump expansions at dolores shahuindo and la arena as well as tailings storage expansions at la colorada and timmins project capital of 22 million to 27 million is largely directed at the la colorada skarn discovery and production expansion at bell creek mine we are expecting to produce 27 million to 28 5 million ounces of silver and 625 000 to 675 000 ounces of gold in 2020 all in sustaining costs are expected to be in the range of 10 25 to 11 75 for the silver segment the moderate increase in all in sustaining cost is related to higher treatment charges for concentrates lower zinc price assumption and higher sustaining capital all in sustaining cost for the gold segment are expected to be in the range of 1 090 to 1 170 due to higher sustaining capital and more conservative assumptions regarding positive grade reconciliations at la arena and shahuindo for the new pit phases positive grade reconciliations at the same levels as 2019 would have a positive impact on the 2020 cost estimate further information on our 2020 guidance is available in our news release issued on january 15th 2019 was a transformative year for pan american i m very pleased with what we have achieved in a short time frame and how we are positioned for the future we completed the highly accretive tahoe acquisition adding four new mines to our diversified portfolio and we are capturing annual g a synergies of 25 million to 30 million escobal mine offers material upside for investors the new government under president alejandro giammattei took office in guatemala on january 14th 2020 we look forward to the new government advancing the court mandated ilo 169 consultation process with indigenous population executing the tahoe transaction was an exceptional event yet we had another exceptional events with the discovery of the large polymetallic skarn at our la colorada mine in december of 2019 we announced an inferred mineral resource estimate for the skarn of 72 5 million tonnes averaging 44 grams per tonne of silver 0 17 copper 2 02 lead and 4 4 zinc truly a world class deposit in 2020 pan american plans to invest 16 million to 18 million on the drilling program early stage engineering and metallurgical testing for the la colorada skarn the 44 000 meter drill program is focused on infill and exploration drilling to further define expand and add confidence to the inferred resource estimate last week we released the results of 14 additional holes conducted during the fourth quarter of 2019 which were not included in the resource estimate and indicate the potential to increase our initial resource estimate that wraps up my formal comments and i would like to open the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session our first question comes from chris terry with deutsche bank please go ahead chris terry deutsche bank analyst hi michael and congrats on a great end to the year a few questions from me just in terms of the la colorada skarn discovery you said you d spend 16 million to 18 million i think this year what are the next data points on that we should look for just for project updates with the next addition to resource met testing project timelines etc that we should look out for thank you michael steinmann president and chief executive officer yeah sure good morning chris first of all we ll put out every quarter i think a result press release like we did last week we re drilling a lot of meters so we don t want to hold that back too long because it will just accumulate and i think they re all and will be continued some very positive results that we will share with you so look forward every quarter to that as you know we moved with that after the transaction of tahoe we moved our reserve and resource update to mid year so we don t expect any update at the beginning of the year anymore we started at last year and published our reserves as of end of june we will continue to do that it aligns our reserve update much better with our budget process that comes just a few months or start a few months later and gives us the newest and finest reserves that we can use for our budget so that s a much better timing for us so again when we put that resource and reserve update out in june there will be an update on the first inclusion of our resource of la colorada so expect there further updates on metallurgy and first pass engineering and that s it will just continue with updates during the year i think this will be a year of heavy drilling a lot of metallurgical work we published a few results earlier on and a lot of early stage engineering to see what kind of size we re going to envision to advance this project chris terry deutsche bank analyst okay thanks michael and then a couple of others from me you obviously gave guidance for the full year 2020 in january since then the macro has been pretty volatile and base metals in particular have been under pressure just wondering on the cost guidance in the by product credits and different currency moves just if you could speak to the conservatism more or where your where your costs could come out versus what you guided in january thanks michael steinmann president and chief executive officer yeah look the guidance is only a month old and a lot of things move up and down in that case you mentioned the base metal that affect our base metal or polymetallic mines on the cost because they re by product credits but there are lot of other moving parts as well to it like currency fluctuations labor costs goods and parts etc etc so of course we cannot update our cost guidance for each of that move some go up some go down and i don t see any reason to make a change at this point chris terry deutsche bank analyst okay no that s fine and then just thinking about some of your country exposure argentina in particular where there s been some changes just wondering if you could comment broadly on the operating environment how comfortable we are with the operations there in that country thanks michael steinmann president and chief executive officer well argentina definitely got harder this year you saw we took 40 million writedown on manantial espejo cose joaquin mostly for those reasons we re looking at additional export taxes we re looking at additional restrictions in the country right now due to the issues and they re facing right now we are comfortable to work in argentina we are working argentina for a long time but it definitely got a bit harder right now and that s what it reflected in that write down as you also know right now manantial espejo and cose joaquin is a very small part of our nav so there is a very minimal exposure right now from argentina and the other thing i think that s i see that it s just a point in time i m sure argentina will do its best to advance here in and bring their economy back on track and everything will improve again chris terry deutsche bank analyst thanks michael just a last one from me high level i guess after doing the tahoe acquisition and then not selling some of those gold assets because of the improvements you ve been able to do over the course of 2019 when we look forward to 2020 and beyond you ve obviously got more revenue from gold than silver is that something you re comfortable with going forward do you need to continue to reshuffle the portfolio back toward silver or are you just going to stick with what will be from here thanks michael steinmann president and chief executive officer well we are silver company it s embedded in our name and in our history of course there is more revenue right now coming from the gold side not only because of higher gold production but also because of the gold silver ratio where it sits right now with gold outperforming silver you should have a look in our corporate presentation and our website there is a slide that compares our revenue with our reserves and it will clearly see that our reserve is a silver reserve mostly i think it s about half of our reserve is silver that s obviously where it s going to go here in the future so while we develop these assets that are very silver rich we will go back to a much more kind of what you are used to silver gold ratio for the company s production but meanwhile where the gold price stands and gold outperformed i m very comfortable to have the higher gold production basically generating the cash flow for us to advance our silver projects chris terry deutsche bank analyst great thanks michael that s all from me all the best for the years michael steinmann president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from cosmos chiu with cibc please go ahead cosmos chiu cibc analyst hi thanks michael and team and first off congratulations on a very strong q4 and a great end to 2019 and certainly i m sure investors are happy with the dividend increase maybe first off on your 2020 guidance here michael you touched on for the gold segment you touched on the higher cost for shahuindo and la arena for 2020 there s been some conservatism it sounds like built into it but how about timmins you know timmins had a fairly good 2019 with a new shaft in place you still sort of forecasting a higher all in sustaining costs in year 2020 is there any kind of upside here as well in terms of potentially coming in below what you re guiding to for cost for 2020 at timmins steve busby chief operating officer good morning cosmo this is steve cosmos chiu cibc analyst hi steve steve busby chief operating officer my the big driver to that cost increased projection at timmins there s really two drivers one is we do have a substantial tailings dam expansion in the sustaining capital that we have to complete that s an important project for us so that will get done during the year the other thing is there is there is an access road we ship the ore from timmins west to bell creek and along that highway there is project at this summer some substantial highway works going on by the province there so we re having the redirect trucks and it s quite a bit of a distance so it s going to add to that haulage costs from timmins west during that construction period on the highway so we factored that in now we re looking at some potential offsets to that we may find some better economics by investing in some short bypasses and things like that there may be some upside there but i wouldn t factor that in right now i think those cost projections at timmins are pretty solid overall cosmos chiu cibc analyst for sure and since i have you here steve maybe if i can talk about the recoveries at dolores i know you didn t publish i don t even want to call it recovery it s more like the ratio of what stacked and what s been the what came out in terms of but if i were to back calculate what was stacked in q4 i work out to somewhat of a 51 ratio for silver 71 for gold at dolores especially for silver that seems a bit low and i thought given what you ve done in 2019 for the full year and given the pulp agglomeration plant that s in place what should we how should we look at it is this just a one off is the high grade stacked in q4 going to benefit q1 2020 and what s what are we targeting in terms of quote unquote recovery here at dolores michael steinmann president and chief executive officer yeah good color there cosmo you re right on what we did see in q4 the one thing that we re seeing at dolores is the heap stack height in this pad 3 areas getting extremely deep we re stacking over 100 meters right now in some areas so we got fresh ore that stacked upon leach spent ore that s 100 meter in depth and it s taking a long long time for a solution to percolate through that heap and q4 is notoriously the quarter where we get a lot of rainfall and a lot of dilutive effects of the increase in water inventory we take on during that quarter which was compounded a bit this year because we were in the middle of construction on what we call pad 1 north and so we had exposed liner on a new pad that collected quite a bit of rainwater that came in at a pretty high volume so we have a lot of inventory we ve got to work through we have and we talked about this last year we have kind of reduced our solution application rates to make sure we got effective percolation conditions for leaching through that heap so q4 was below what we were hoping to see below our expectations below what we typically had been seeing from the pulp agglomeration plant addition but we think it is a one off thing i think when you look at the full year you ll see our silver recovery is it is a record silver recovery for the year for that mine so you are seeing the benefits over the whole year even though q4 was a bit behind we do think we ll catch up on an early part of this year 2020 cosmos chiu cibc analyst and then i guess on that steve i worked it out to about 60 silver recovery for the year is that what you re targeting or could it be even higher with the pulp agglomeration plant steve busby chief operating officer we do think there is still upside to that you know the one thing that the recovery side the additional recovery we re expecting close to 20 on the on the silver and we were we were also projecting additional quicker kinetics faster leach times we believe today we are seeing that higher overall recovery but the timing to get there is longer than we expected and that s reflected because we had to slow down that leach application rate we weren t getting quite the percolation we thought we would with the agglomerates so we have slowed that down that has affected timing but no i think as we look into 2020 we do expect to see that come up to the higher 60s as opposed to the lower 60 overall cosmos chiu cibc analyst okay and then i did the same calculation for shahuindo here i see that the gold recovery was about 67 about 67 for the year as well i seem to recall that under tahoe that number could be higher especially with the crushing agglomerator are in place i know you re not crushing agglomerating at this point in time so i guess my question is is there upside beyond the 67 that you realized in 2019 and is the crushing agglomerator back in the cards in 2020 steve busby chief operating officer it s looking like you re reading my to do list on my desk you re right cosmos chiu cibc analyst i swear i m not spying steve busby chief operating officer yeah you re right on we are not we think there is upside to metallurgical recovery at shahuindo we re not yet convinced it requires us to crush and agglomerate to get there it may we don t know yet we do think there are substantial upside to that all i would say to caution that a little bit is remember this is a run of mine heap leach so we only have one head grade that goes out to the pad and that s from our ore control and our ore control is showing substantially higher grades than reserves we need to verify that that is indeed the case that there is a chance we re hoping that s not the case but there is a chance maybe the recoveries aren t as high or the recoveries are higher but the grades aren t as high so we re kind of working through all those issues you described currently i have i have to say from my perspective i m optimistic we re going to find ways to improve at shahuindo cosmos chiu cibc analyst great maybe switching gears a little bit here michael as you mentioned the new reserve resource as to update is now going to be mid year at this point in time have you determined what gold and silver price or other commodity prices you might be using just given how well gold and silver has done year to date or since sort of late last year and i only asked because i think some of your mines might be a bit more sensitive to changes in commodity price assumptions such as dolores so at this point in time have you figured out what you might be using michael steinmann president and chief executive officer no cosmos we did not so if you look at our official resource statement as of june that surprises there that we use of course was a lot of changes during the last few months that s a short time we will look at it and define that a couple of months before we do the reserve update but in general as you know we are also very careful we like to generate good margins with our mines and just running up the metal price to create more resources and not what i have in mind at all i never had but we did not define a price cosmo i just would like to as you touched on the half history of the dividend i would like to give a quick update here in general our capital allocation and our plans which is very straightforward and very simple with three clear steps that we follow here and i think we have proven here over the last few years that that s working out very well for our shareholders number 1 accretive highly accretive projects and acquisitions that s the best return to our shareholders i think we have proven that very clearly over the last 12 months with the tahoe acquisition what kind of impact accretive transactions can have number 2 where our capital goes is improving our balance sheet and maybe improving is not the right word because even improving further because our balance sheet as you know is very strong we had a very strong free cash flow allowed us last year to pay back 60 million in our line of credit 40 million in the fourth quarter alone and i don t know if you heard it in my call we actually already paid another 15 million back in january on the line of credit and i really like that i like to have little debt as possible and the line of credit available to us because it gives us the flexibility to jump in for opportunities if they come along on accretive acquisitions so that s a circle right it s like when when it happened with tahoe you need to keep your powder dry we do very few a transaction and when we do them we need to be ready though so like to have a line of credit available and a very strong balance sheet and you know if prices stay where they are and we will continue to pay back our line of credit very quickly and then the last point is return to our shareholders with dividends mostly dividend slightly you sell there the increase i think that s a third increase here in three years i believe we re happy very happy to return our dividends to our shareholders i think we returned about 440 million or 450 million since 2010 between dividends and share buybacks to our shareholder so it s a very simple three step plan that we follow we follow that for a few years now and i don t see any reason to change that cosmos chiu cibc analyst yeah for sure michael i think that s great and on the debt repayment or the payments back to the line of credit michael as you mentioned you did above 60 million in 2019 15 million again in january 2020 have you do you have any targets in terms of what level you want to pay back in 2020 i know there is dividend there is capital allocation i m just wondering if you ve publicly made any statements in terms of how much you want to decrease that debt by in 2020 michael steinmann president and chief executive officer as i said we will follow this three step plan on the cash flow allocation and the more of the more money is left at the end of the day the more we will pay back on the line of credit idea is to go to as little or zero debt if possible i can we can always take the money again on our line of credit and react on an opportunity but there s no reason in my mind even if interest rates are low to service that if we can pay back rather invest that money in further drilling at la colorada for example cosmos chiu cibc analyst yeah for sure when and for what s worth i have you have forecasting free cash flow of 200 million for your company in 2020 so there is going to be a lot of a lot of cash for you coming in and then maybe one last question on argentina could you give us a bit more detail i guess there was a writedown you talked about the increase in export tax i wasn t aware that i was not aware that s been put into law has it and could you maybe give us any other changes that either has been confirmed or were expecting in argentina steve busby chief operating officer yeah cosmos this is steve specifically on the export tax a law has been passed but it has not been regulated yet we expect when it is regulated it will be retroactive to the first of the year that s our expectation under the law the export tax effectively does increase because it takes it from a peso based to a revenue based tax so net net it is an increase in that tax cosmos chiu cibc analyst and what kind of magnitude michael steinmann president and chief executive officer sorry you ve probably also seen that as a quite a few other changes there is a double severance payment that was one of the reason why we decided to go a bit slower with the production and make due with the people that we have there there is some currency restrictions it s not as simple anymore just to move money in and out and so there s a whole bunch of changes as i said in the former call that affect our operations in argentina but again when you look at our corporate nav and the part that is in argentina this is very small its a few percent points steve busby chief operating officer relative to the magnitude on that export tax cosmos when it first came out it came out as a peso based tax and then the peso had eroded what we re seeing is effectively about a 3 percentage point increase in export revenue tax cosmos chiu cibc analyst okay yeah because i think when it first came out as you said with the depreciating peso it worked out to for what i remember 7 or 7 5 equivalent sort of tax but now you re saying maybe an additional 3 to it michael steinmann president and chief executive officer that s correct yeah cosmos chiu cibc analyst okay and then michael i agree with you that argentina is now only a small portion of the nav at pan american silver but you do have in your guidance about 4 million to 4 3 million ounces in production silver production included for 2020 any concerns at this point in time either it be geopolitical or ground conditions at cose joaquin in terms of getting to that guidance michael steinmann president and chief executive officer no no concerns on that cosmos chiu cibc analyst okay great thanks michael steve and team and congrats once again on a very good q4 michael steinmann president and chief executive officer thank you cosmos operator our next question comes from chris thompson with pi financial please go ahead chris thompson pi financial analyst hey good morning gents i want to echo what cosmos was saying congratulations just a couple of little questions related to guidance i guess looking at some of the gold assets here first of all you re guiding for between 42 million and 44 million in sustaining capital for la arena my understanding is there s a limited mine life i wonder if you could just unpack where that s going steve busby chief operating officer yeah good morning chris this is steve a big part of that and i think it s close to 30 million of that is on pre stripping we had what we call tahoe used to refer to it as a phase 8 we are kind of changing those phases a little bit we with these positive reserve reconciliations we think there s opportunities maybe to increase some of the reserves there and maybe look at the pit a little differently but we are doing some layback there so there is some substantial pre stripping in that number and then in addition we do have waste dumps we have substantial costs on preparing waste dump ground it s a very boggy area very wet where you have a lot of drainage efforts that go in and ground preparation work that has to go in before we can start placing waste on waste rock dump on new areas so those are predominantly the big increases in capital chris thompson pi financial analyst okay great are you guys doing any work on the sulfide opportunity there steve busby chief operating officer we are not chris it s really a copper gold play it s really not in our interest again our focus right now is on this la arena 1 if you will the oxide gold and we think there are some opportunities there we re fairly optimistic we might be able to squeeze a little bit more value out of that michael steinmann president and chief executive officer chris la arena 2 obviously a very interesting project but i think i made very clear since the acquisition that a very large copper porphyry is not something that pan american should and will build so at one point of course that project will be up for sale but there is time as you hear from steve there is some opportunity and on the reserve side on the oxide side so we ll leave the work on the sulfide side for the for a large copper company to do chris thompson pi financial analyst great thanks for that and just finally i guess moving on to the timmins assets i mean you say a lot of your capex guidance little bit of it anyway is going into a 20 expansion of the bell creek there how should we be viewing that from a timing perspective to see the results of that michael steinmann president and chief executive officer yeah it s really interesting it s of that i think we laid out 5 million for that expansion and roughly half of that is going into the plant and it s really just upgrading pumping systems throughout the plant and so the schedule of completing that work is really dependent on manufacturing and delivery schedules of the pumps and the mine equipment we think that will trickle in throughout the year so that by the end of the year we ll be up to that 20 expanded rate chris thompson pi financial analyst right okay and i guess that would be what is it the 5500 tonne a day mike michael steinmann president and chief executive officer yeah we look at it as a tonne per hour but we re going to go from about 220 just a little above 220 to 250 tonnes an hour and we re getting about 92 availability on the mill so it takes us right about 5500 which is a good number tonnes per day chris thompson pi financial analyst great guys thanks a lot congrats michael steinmann president and chief executive officer thanks chris operator our next question comes from lawson winder with bank of america please go ahead lawson winder bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi thank you for taking the call maybe if i might just start on la colorada and steve i think this is probably for you but i mean it seems now for two quarters operating cost per tonne are running in the low 90s and so i really have two questions on that i mean one is that the level that you re budgeting for 2020 guidance and then is that a level that you see as being sustainable going forward at least on a medium term basis thanks steve busby chief operating officer yeah lawson nice question we have seen some pretty substantial debottlenecking efforts in the mine at la colorada that s led to quite a bit higher throughputs than what we had originally designed i think we achieved just over 2100 tonnes a day on average for the year of 2019 we re optimistic we can actually improve upon that some more we re also optimistic that that coupled with some interesting mechanization efforts we got going on over the next several years will lead to some better cost efficiencies with all that said we do have some challenges during 2020 we have some substantial ventilation raises that we re going to be installing in the mine and we need those raises to kind of get some of this mechanization efforts moving so i don t anticipate big changes through 2020 but i think when we look beyond that we see some optimism for some additional cost optimizations if you will unit cost decreases going forward lawson winder bank of america merrill lynch analyst so for 2020 you would expect it to be in the lower 90s then steve busby chief operating officer yeah i d say we re forecasting a little higher there are some cost increases that we re absorbing on labor particularly we anticipate 5 kind of escalation of costs so we re probably in the mid 90s mid to mid 90 95 a tonne lawson winder bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thanks that s very helpful steve and then just on the dividend that was a pretty remarkable increase i think what is two questions one when you re setting this dividend are you basically looking at what your budgeted gold and silver price assumptions are for 2020 that s the first question and where it s coming from i mean it seems conservative versus historical increases vis a vis the current spot price and then the second question is i think historically the cadence of dividend change announcements has typically come in the first quarter with q4 results i mean is that something that you expect to continue going forward or could that cadence perhaps change thanks michael steinmann president and chief executive officer look lawson i think it s when i talk about the capital allocation i think that s really the key when you look at that so as i mentioned the return in dividends is number 3 in our list very high and very important but we give preference to accretive projects and pay back our debt i know it s a very nice increase 43 what we do is we really look quarter by quarter at this dividend and look at our capital allocation and depending what s going on there we make a decision you can imagine that right now there s a lot of cash flow generation a lot of free cash flow generation some money will also be needed and capital will be needed to advance the la colorada skarn deposit and so we kind of try to keep a balance here with returning as i said very high accretive projects to our shareholders and returning dividend at the same time lawson winder bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thanks michael that s very helpful and then just moving to one of the other assets morococha rather morococha in peru is there still an expectation that you ll need to move the plant and if so when are you expecting that might have to happen thanks michael steinmann president and chief executive officer maybe on timing if that should happen steve can give you an update there i think there is still i would call it a fluid situation there as we re discussing with our neighbor how to advance the open pit and how that will impact our plant which is really located very much on the fringe or even a bit outside of the pit so i think steve timing wise we started i think we made that public last year and this year that we start spending some money on some early stage engineering that s what we are working on i think we have at the end of this year a better idea but i don t have a date yet or anything set if and when such a move should happen lawson winder bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay steve busby chief operating officer just to add on to michael s comments he is exactly right we are doing engineering we are actually doing permitting efforts but in terms of timing we have not yet defined the timing with our neighbor lawson winder bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay that s very helpful and then maybe just finally on the escobal ilo 169 process i m not sure to what extent you re able to share where that process is but my question really is at what point are you guys in that process and is the process still as we had understood it a little over a year ago with the four stages michael steinmann president and chief executive officer yeah look i m sure you saw that there is a new administration as i mentioned in the call under alejandro giammattei so a lot of changes in guatemala on the federal and local side the new government took office on the 14th i think it was of january so very recent just a month ago and so we re really looking forward for them to advancing that process the ilo 196 consultation process with the indigenous population we are obviously enhancing still and educating training our team there addressing a lot of issues going from human rights social concern indigenous manners etc etc you can imagine there s a lot to do and of course we will support that government led ilo 169 process as much as we can to find a peaceful dialogue with our neighbors and with the host communities that we re working there so a lot of changes in guatemala and i like what i see there s i still don t have a timing i think the process where it has to go through is still the same so nothing changed in that at least not what i would know but because that s this is four stages as we saw last year we have not been informed by anybody that that would have changed but again it s a government run process and we are just a participant in it lawson winder bank of america merrill lynch analyst understood thanks very much for your comments operator our next question comes from john tumazos with john tumazos very independent research please go ahead john tumazos john tumazos very independent research analyst thank you could you give us a timetable or density of drill holes maybe to get la colorada skarn measured and indicated maybe two reserve reports out next year and in tahoe as they reported there was almost 20 million ounces of gold and 6 billion pounds of copper in resources across ontario and the two sulfides in peru i know you re very busy with la colorada skarn and the existing mine operations in escobal and navidad but is there one or two of those projects that might be a priority from the resource queue at tahoe if you have time to get to it in the next year or two christopher emerson vice president of business development geology sure hi john it s chris emerson here really to explain the drill pattern program of drilling for the inferred resource we re probably at around 70 meters to 80 meters spacing at the moment we d want to get that down to below 50 and depending on the geostatistics as to the variability within those drill holes and grades so certainly with the 44 000 meters this year we ll probably hopefully be upgrading again it all depends on the results we ll certainly be looking to maybe 20 or 30 of that certainly for june this year and then as that program advances into december this year upgrading that further but certainly we re a little away from getting that all 72 into a m i for instance in 2020 we d certainly be looking for a couple of years of continued drilling and then at that detailed reserve drilling we d probably want to be closer to the deposit i e get underground and actually drill it from there because at the moment we re probably drilling 80 from surface with directional drilling which is obviously so costly so to get it down to that closer spacing we definitely want to sort of get that more efficient michael steinmann president and chief executive officer john it s obviously one of our top priority projects here as you can imagine this is a world class discovery and while chris is drilling we are moving quickly ahead here with our metallurgy and engineering in parallel to move the project forward as fast as possible so stay tuned for updates as we said midyear on the resource and then as chris continues to drill to advance that into different categories on the resource state to your second question regarding the copper that tahoe had in their resource most of it is located in la arena ii in peru and as we are very we are very happy what we see and i think there s some upside and we re very happy what we see at la arena in the oxides and the gold production as i mentioned before la arena ii has a big copper porphyry it will not be a project that we will advance and we ll look to divest that project over time but there s really no big hurry in us since we have still several years of production the upside ahead of us john tumazos john tumazos very independent research analyst concerning the over 10 million ounces of gold resources much of which tony makuch acquired when it was lake shore up in ontario are there any of those that you have time to evaluate in 2020 2021 i know you re busy with these other sweet irons in the fire michael steinmann president and chief executive officer yeah we re actually looking at them we re doing some work on it and some of those projects haven t really made the final decision on all of them if they are core or not for us some are fairly close to our timmins operations and they have a chance to be in trucking distance and then some are further away which definitely will be not high on our list of projects and we ll probably look to divest them john tumazos john tumazos very independent research analyst thank you michael steinmann president and chief executive officer thank you john operator our next question comes from adam graf with b riley fbr please go ahead adam graf b riley fbr analyst thank you guys it s been a lot of questions but just i know that you talked a bit about conditions in argentina becoming more difficult but i was curious to hear if there s been any update on the progress to be able to move forward on navidad and if the challenging conditions in argentina actually would help or hurt that process to open up reopen up development of navidad michael steinmann president and chief executive officer yeah adam it s you cannot just compare very simply kind of a shorter life mine like manantial cose joaquin where we re looking at a three year maybe 3 5 year life and then you look at a project like navidad that needs a few years to go through permitting and building and then many many years of production so i see the issues in argentina as i said just a point in time some issues that the government will work through it and but at short term so let s look it at short term it definitely made it more challenging for us as i said when you look at really long term projects like navidad that will be in production for decades i don t think so that you can just extrapolate those issues so that s a different time frame adam graf b riley fbr analyst yeah michael perhaps you could give us an idea of where things stand as far as politics in the province and at the federal level as far as moving things forward to allow for just the approval at navidad michael steinmann president and chief executive officer sure i can do that and like in many other places we work in latin america there was a change of government we had elections the legislature in the province actually took seat i m not completely sure it was around the 10th of december i believe 10 or 12 somewhere around there led by the governor mr arcioni he won a very clear election there he is a strong governor in the province i think i think he has very good ideas how to advance the province and the economics of the province and i m looking forward to work with the new incoming government or the government that is there now for 1 5 months nothing changed in my view on the project navidad is a very strong very large silver deposit it s still probably the largest or one of the largest undeveloped silver deposits in the world it s very scalable so there are shallow open pits i think there s about eight zones that are mineralized that we can mine so it s very scalable in size in terms of size on start up and how much capital you want to spend upfront and how much how many phases you want to grow the project we did not make decisions that how we do that will depend on the situation and then the permitting etc etc if the project goes ahead but at the moment obviously there is no way to do the open pit mining because there is the mining law in place that prevents us from doing that so this is with the government to make that change it s a political process i can t do that obviously i m just sitting there on the side waiting and discussing providing information and then we see how it advances but as i said the really important part of navidad is the scalability and that makes it i think much more adaptable for us to once we make a decision on size and scale and capital requirements and timing for possible start ups adam graf b riley fbr analyst so just so i m understanding you correctly no change in the provincial or the federal level as far as new initiatives or to change the law that would allow this project to move forward on the horizon as far as you can tell michael steinmann president and chief executive officer no that s not that s not correct first of all the federal side does not really matter on this law this is a provincial law the resources in argentina belong to the province so that s not a federal law on the provincial side a lot of changes over the last what is it 12 months i would say mr arcioni if you remember came in as vice governor and was that last year and so the province actually is working on the zonification laws providing provided kind of a draft map i think that would kind of explain where they would install kind of mining zones and no mining zones and so we re talking about possible mining zones in the center of the province called meseta and then obviously no mining around the big rivers glaciers coast line etc etc so there has been lots of advantages there but at the end of the day it s pretty black and white decision by the provincial legislature to change that law in order to allow open pit mining and once that s done obviously we would provide our environmental impact study which is ready to go and then start a permitting process adam graf b riley fbr analyst so is that draft law expected to be finalized and come up for a vote in the next six months in the next year in the next 18 months or there s no schedule michael steinmann president and chief executive officer i don t have a timing for that adam adam graf b riley fbr analyst okay thank you very much michael steinmann president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from trevor turnbull with scotiabank please go ahead trevor turnbull scotiabank analyst hi michael here at the end of the queue i ended up getting most of my questions answered including from adam just previously but i guess there was one nuance to the discussion of navidad i wanted you to touch on we try and keep an eye on the news coming out of argentina look at the local papers and so forth and toward the end of the year and into january there was quite a bit of a lot of articles a lot of protests going on about the environment specifically in chubut and it seemed like this open pit mining law was getting kind of wrapped up in that there was a lot of other issues at play but certainly it was one of the things that was being bundled with other concerns that these environmental people had at first we thought that this increased agitation by environmental concerns meant perhaps that the mining law was coming to ahead maybe they were getting closer but it all seemed sort of died down a bit here in the last couple of weeks and i wondered are we reading too much into these protests are they unrelated or was that a bit of an indication the government was in your opinion getting closer to doing something michael steinmann president and chief executive officer i think they were mostly related to the issues that happened in mendoza at the end of the year i would say probably see that they actually changed the law in mendoza i think unfortunately they did not they did not provide in the law a zonification so there was no mining or non mining zones in the province which i think the population really didn t like as you can see now mendoza is a big wine producing area so that should be areas of course that should be non mining and others that should mining could go forward so that caused a lot of issues and i think that kind of spilled over to chubut yeah i don t have really much more information on this trevor i think you re probably reading a bit too much into it where we stand with the government i mean as i said it s a political process the governor and the legislature i m sure are diligently working on a lot of issues in the province and that mining law is one of them to provide jobs and to provide income for the province in the future and where it stands at the end as i said it s a decision of the provincial legislature trevor turnbull scotiabank analyst okay i appreciate that michael thank you operator this concludes the question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to michael steinmann for any closing remarks michael steinmann president and chief executive officer thank you very much great call and it was a great year for pan american silver for sure a transformational year and looking

included in the financial information we released this morning as well as the slides for this conference call which are both available on our investor relations website at investor southerncompany com at this time i ll turn the call over to tom fanning thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good afternoon and thank you all for joining us as you can see from the materials that we released this morning we reported strong adjusted results for the full year that exceeded our original guidance expectations and we re in line with the updated year end estimate we disclosed on the third quarter call by all accounts 2019 was an outstanding year for our company we performed well across a broad range of metrics we reached all 2019 major milestones at vogtle units three and four operational performance at our state regulated utilities was superb with record generation and transmission performance we concluded several key regulatory proceedings including constructive base rate cases for nicor gas georgia power and atlanta gas light we took steps to further strengthen our balance sheet we continued to economically decarbonize our generating fleet decreasing our coal generating capacity by 2000 megawatts and we expanded our portfolio of renewable energy sources which is now over 12 of our generation mix our company is ranked in the top quartile nationally for customer satisfaction and we were named best company to work for in our industry and 14th overall in the united states so overall terrific performance let s turn now to an update on plant vogtle units three and four in april of 2019 we laid out an aggressive site work plan as a tool to achieve margin to meet the november 2021 and 2022 regulatory approved in service dates executing this strategy resulted in substantial progress at the site and we reached all major milestones in 2019 the aggressive site work plan established last april set a goal of approaching 90 completion of unit three direct construction by year end today unit three direct construction is 85 complete as we have discussed in the past southern nuclear evaluates projected cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis as part of this process we completed a scheduled refinement for units three and four earlier this month which in summary produced three major conclusions first we confirmed our ability to our expected ability to achieve the november 2021 and november 2022 in service dates second we supported the site s strategy to continue to utilize an aggressive site work plan with no change to the may 2021 target in service date for unit three and a two month advancement of the target in service date for unit four to march 2022 and third we confirmed no change in the projected overall capital cost forecast now i ll walk you through the details let s begin with some additional background on the schedule refinement over the past year we continued to gain a greater understanding of the site capabilities for construction and testing specifically for construction in 2019 the site achieved sustained periods of 140 000 to 145 000 earned hour per week but built a backlog to the april 2019 aggressive site work plan the schedule refinement process took into account our 2019 performance and also our progress on work packages testing and turnover the resulting refined aggressive site work plan for 2020 relies on sustaining our current construction production levels and requires a reasonable increase in electrical commodity installation on the refined aggressive site work plan we have extended by about six weeks two of our near term milestones for unit three starting cold hydro testing and hot functional testing by extending these milestones refining testing sequences between hot functional testing and fuel load and planning to complete noncritical electrical work later in the schedule we now have more time to complete construction and work down the current backlog of construction hours with these changes the aggressive site work plan continues to target a unit three fuel load by the end of this year supporting a may 2021 in service date the aggressive site work plan reflects a continuation of our strategy to drive construction productivity complete testing activities and ultimately meet the regulatory approved in service dates next to complement the aggressive site work plan for unit three we have established a november benchmark that forecasts construction production levels and future milestone date necessary to support the regulatory approved in service date of november 2021 this benchmark provides a clear comparison to the refined aggressive site work plan on the november benchmark fuel load could occur as late as the summer of 2021 in support of a november 2021 in service date the november benchmark also supports our expectation that the aggressive site work plan is an appropriate strategy and provide sufficient flexibility to achieve the november 2021 regulatory approved in service date the result of the schedule refinement and the november benchmark is illustrated on the key milestones chart for unit three the blue line represents the aggressive site work plan and the orange represents the november benchmark with the milestone start date shown in the circles and the direct construction percent complete detailed on the lines near the top as you can see on the green bars recently we have been averaging about 2 completion per month for direct construction for unit three if we maintain construction completion of approximately 2 of direct construction from each month from now until hot functional testing we would expect to be close to the blue line or the aggressive site work plan to achieve the november benchmark we estimate this metric would need to be approximately 1 3 each month now let s focus on estimated costs in conjunction with the refined schedule in the fourth quarter georgia power allocated an additional 110 million of its project contingency primary drivers for this allocation include a continuation of current cost and schedule productivity trends which have been lower than planned through the fourth quarter of 2019 georgia power has allocated a total of 140 million so approximately 60 of our initial total cost contingency remains looking at it another way the scheduled cost margin and the remaining cost contingency combined represent approximately 20 of the remaining estimated cost to complete recall the estimated cost of the time between the aggressive site work plan and the regulatory approved november in service dates or there our scheduled margin is embedded in georgia power s base capital forecast as we have said we expect to utilize the entirety of these funds as we progress toward completion of the project in summary as i mentioned earlier there is no change to the total estimated cost to complete the project finally from a regulatory perspective georgia power continues its vogtle construction monitoring or vcm process with the georgia public service commission vcm 2021 recall it s 12 months was unanimously approved by the psc on tuesday georgia power filed vcm 22 accounting for six months yesterday in summary we continue to expect that we will meet the november regulatory approved in service dates and there is no change to our estimated cost to complete it is important to recognize the substantial progress made on vogtle units three and four both in 2019 and really since the southern nuclear team assumed leadership at the site nearly three years ago it is equally important to recognize that there is much work ahead particularly in 2020 our primary objective remains achievement of the regulatory approved november 2021 and 2022 in service dates for vogtle units three and four and we look forward to communicating progress on our major milestones in the month ahead drew i ll turn it over to you now for an update on the financials and our outlook andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks tom and good afternoon everyone first i d like to echo the tom s comments on an incredible year in 2019 we achieved earnings per share of 3 11 on an adjusted basis above the guidance range that we established at the beginning of the year we delivered this outstanding financial performance while also returning to customers the benefits of tax reform and regulatory sharing programs including additional onetime refunds to customers as a result of the georgia power rate case settlement a detailed reconciliation of our reported and adjusted results is included in the morning s release and in the earnings package 2019 eps was 0 04 higher compared to the prior year on an adjusted basis primarily driven by higher earnings at our state regulated utilities just to be clear our performance is relative to year in 2008 2018 that significantly exceeded the midpoint of our original guidance expectations in part due to strong weather at our state regulated utilities and in 2019 we more than offset 0 31 of eps from entities we divested in the prior year with that backdrop the 0 04 year over year increase reflects the impacts of tax reform and related to changes in capital structure and continued investment at state regulated utilities in support of infrastructure modernization along with some customer growth recognizing the industry trend that customer used is declining we have also been successful in mitigating internationally related to o m expense as we always look to operate more efficiently turning to some operational highlights for 2019 our energy supply mix was comprised of 50 natural gas 22 coal 16 nuclear and 12 renewables notably generation from coal decreased by almost 20 from 2018 this is consistent with our carbon reduction objectives and our commitment to deliver affordable energy to customers we continue to experience strong population and job growth in our southeast service territory particularly in georgia which is the fifth fastest growing state in the u s last year we added over 41 000 new residential electric customers and nearly 30 000 residential natural gas customers across the state regulated utilities exceeding our full year expectation over the past five years on average we ve seen weather adjusted retail electric sales remain essentially flat we ve seen annual customer growth of roughly 1 offset by a decrease in customer usage of about the same percentage reflecting continued energy efficiency in technology advancements for 2019 specifically we saw a trend of weaker industrial sales this resulted largely from global trade uncertainty as well as changes in production levels and customer responses to real time pricing however we do see some modest improvements emerging and we believe the southeast is well positioned to add customers as the industrial sector picks up overall usage remains consistent with our expectation and we expect retail sales growth to be flat to 1 for the foreseeable future turning now to our expectation for 2020 our guidance range for the full year is 3 10 to 3 22 the 3 16 midpoint represents a compound annual growth rate of 5 from the midpoint of our 2018 guidance range for the first quarter of 2020 we estimate that we ll earn 0 72 per year per share our expected long term eps growth rate remains 4 to 6 using the same base that we established in 2018 of 2 87 per share with over 90 of total projected earnings over the five year planning horizon coming from our state regulated utilities our eps trajectory has a solid foundation likewise our balance sheet improvements recent constructive regulatory results and ongoing focus on cost control serve to strengthen our outlook over the next several years as the lower roes related to vogtle three and four construction phase in and phase out our long term outlook also continues to be driven by capital investment in our state regulated businesses our investment plan of 40 billion for the 2020 through 2024 time frame includes projected rate base growth at our state regulated utilities of approximately 6 this updated plan reflects a 2 billion increase over last year s five year forecast the main driver of the increase is incremental investment related to new electric generation and additional safety related gas pipeline replacement programs of the total 95 is expected to be invested in our state regulated utilities with a continued emphasis on transmission and distribution modernization for southern power the cumulative five year investment plan is comprised entirely of previously announced projects and maintenance capital for the existing generation fleet which supported by recent recontracting successes is over 90 contracted for the next 10 years any incremental growth opportunities at southern power expected to enhance the long term financial plan and be largely self funded we currently forecast no equity need over our five year plan horizon as a result of strategic value accretive transactions that we have executed over the past two years and our august 2019 equity units offering financial integrity and strong credit ratings provide significant benefit to both customers and investors and has always been a very top priority for us we have taken significant steps over the past two years to deleverage our balance sheet decreasing our total company debt to capitalization by almost eight percentage points and believe we re well positioned to further strengthen our balance sheet and improve our credit metrics as part of this focus we ve engaged in an effort over the past year to simplify our business this effort has included identifying and divesting assets that are not sufficient not of sufficient scale to be meaningful to southern s overall value proposition the announced sale of our ownership interest in the atlantic coast pipeline and the pivotal lng business to dominion energy is the most recent example of this business simplification effort additionally on january 17 we closed on the sale of southern power s plant mankato to xcel and last year we executed on the sale of led lighting and utility infrastructure businesses that were originally acquired as part of the power secure transaction lastly in an effort to continue to improve our risk profile we made a 1 1 billion voluntary contribution to our pension plan in the fourth quarter of 2019 this increased our funded status at year end to 100 further we did not expect any additional required pension contributions over the next five years before i turn it over to tom turn it back to tom i d like to give you a brief update on our regulatory calendar after a very full regulatory calendar agenda in 2019 we will return to a more normal base in 2020 proceedings related to alabama power certificate of need for new generation are ongoing and resolution of mississippi power s base rate cases expected in the coming months in addition the second quarter in the second quarter virginia natural gas expects to file a general rate case we ll keep you posted on all of these proceedings as they evolve thanks for your interest in southern and with that i ll turn it back over to tom thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thanks drew adding to your regulatory commentary we started 2019 with a full slate of regulatory proceedings the outcomes in these proceedings are once again representative of the constructive regulatory environments across our system that supports future investments in infrastructure to strengthen the reliability and resiliency of the state s electric and gas systems while maintaining competitive rates for our customers drew briefly mentioned in his remarks that generation from coal fired facilities decreased to 22 in 2019 and as a result today coal energy only represents about 14 of southern company s total revenue importantly carbon emissions have also declined by 44 since 2007 our high watermark for carbon emissions which demonstrates that we are making good progress toward our 50 carbon reduction goal by 2030 i actually believe we ll meet that goal with years to spare we also continue to increase our renewables footprint and expect to have over 15 000 megawatts of renewable resources by 2022 across our state regulated utilities in southern power these are meaningful shifts in a short in a relatively short time frame as we assess pathways to further decarbonize our footprint and diversify our generating fleet we remain mindful of potential economic community and environmental impact to society this effort will be a multi decade transformation for our industry and we look forward to engaging with our many stakeholders now before we move to your questions i want to mention a recent charitable commitment made by the charitable foundations of southern company and its state regulated utility companies one of the largest commitments in our company s history in january we announced a 50 million multiyear initiative for students at historically black colleges and universities the initiative aims to provide scholarships internships entrepreneurship training and leadership and career development to qualifying hbcu students this investment is consistent with southern company s commitment to diversify in all forms in making this commitment we also hope to ignite giving from additional corporate partners to increase hbcu funding 2019 was an excellent year by all accounts and we believe we are well positioned to carry our strong momentum into 2020 we have a solid financial outlook for 2020 and beyond driven by continued investment in our state regulated utility franchises that continue to be among the industry leaders for operational performance and customer satisfaction as i have said 2020 will be a pivotal year for the vogtle project we are committed to keeping you informed of major milestones and key productivity measures as we progress through the year and we remain focused on placing units three and four in service by their regulatory approved dates of november 2021 and november 2022 this is certainly an exciting time to be in our industry and at southern company we have much to look forward to thank you for joining us this afternoon operator we are now ready to take questions questions and answers operator the first question comes from the line of michael weinstein with credit suisse please proceed thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hey michael michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hey guys thanks for taking the call does the financing plan include any additional significant divestitures going forward or is that pretty much done at this point or is there anything else that you might be considering going forward and would that if so would that be incremental to no equity needed and result maybe some kind of a additional action thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer i ll let drew double team this one i ll lead off with this i think we ve demonstrated as well as anybody in the industry that we re good buyers and sellers we always look opportunistically strategically to improve our return to shareholders on a risk adjusted basis i think we ve demonstrated that so we re always kind of in the market does the plan assume any major activity in that regard my answer is no andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer absolutely right nothing assumed in the plan nothing assumed about our growth and our investment requires additional divestiture and i would say that principally around the transactions that we ve just discussed acp in particular our primary goal really has been our secondary goal behind credit quality has been business simplification and i think that that s a major component of it we just really wanted to select two assets that we thought would have a meaningful impact on southern s prospective growth and at 5 that simply didn t do it and we think that was really just a good thing to execute around those same two principles will guide us through everything that we evaluate in the corporation in total but there simply isn t any need for additional equity to fund the 40 billion investment thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer one of the things we like to say to ourselves we remind ourselves all the time don t do things that don t matter and that asset didn t really matter to us michael weinstein credit suisse analyst right and another question would be the difference i guess the compression and the schedule between unit three and unit four is that are there any is there anything significant about that that you can talk about that might lead to for instance maybe some acceleration on unit three at some point thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well sure i mean it s all about lessons learned from unit three when we think about i can even think of just some examples we did initial energization of unit three and we were very excited about that to achieve that milestone in looking back however we think that delaying initial energization will allow us kind of more productivity improvement on unit four we ve always felt that as we adjust the schedule which really moved us from the april 2019 to the february 2020 refinement we always find that as we refine the schedule and move things forward and move things back we can improve our ultimate performance and delivering and that s what you see in the schedule compression between three and four we picked up we think two months and that s good on a risk adjusted basis michael weinstein credit suisse analyst that s great to hear one last question the 2 billion you have in the long term plan for southern power and the infrastructure contracted infrastructure business is that what does that say about what is your philosophy going forward about investment in the unregulated part of the company going forward and in particular maybe solar and renewables going forward thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer but we want to fix both the solar and renewables so that s important the second is really that it s a recognition of a tougher marketplace we have lots of opportunity to invest in our franchise businesses i think drew pointed out 95 is kind of focused in that direction we have seen the market on a risk adjusted basis just really tough and getting tougher so we don t try to expand our market share rather we have a rather disciplined kind of investment thesis where over the long term we try to gain about 150 basis points relative to a franchise investment in that long term contracted business those projects are getting fewer and far between we still want to have exposure we have 500 million allocated per year over the next five years but it s a tougher market to do business andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think if you look at the base sort of our base expectation of around 40 billion invested almost 1 billion of that is in southern power over the time period and the vast majority of those things are already committed we ve got some very nice wind projects skookumchuck riding wild horse that rely on some wind turbines that we set aside prior to tax reform and we re really pleased to complete those projects we would love to do more it really is going to be dependent upon the return and attracting capital relative to that that we can invest in state regulated franchise thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer one other outcome is just kind of interesting who knows how it will turn out but certainly there s been more solar approved in the state of georgia i will remind you those of you that have followed us for years a couple two three years ago georgia power was named by the solar industry as the investor energy utility of the year you know that we don t have any renewable requirement in order to hit it just makes good business sense when you consider alabama s integrated resource plan there s new solar in there there may be opportunities in the southeast as well but whether those are third parties or not we ll see michael weinstein credit suisse analyst great thank you very much you bet thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question comes from the line of sophie karp with keybank please proceed thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hey sophie how are you sophie karp keybank analyst i m doing great how are you guys thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer and thanks for joining us sophie karp keybank analyst thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a terrific year and all of the accomplishments thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes it s exciting sophie karp keybank analyst yes good stuff couple of questions that i have so the divestiture of your stake in acp to the extent earnings that you were booking on that or contemplated in the original guidance which remains unchanged what are the offsets that you re seeing that would make up for that thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer big investment in our franchise businesses andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer yes no i think that s right our investment was pretty small to date construction has not progressed as rapidly as our original expectations there and so our capital deployment was not heavy the 150 175 million in aggregate in proceeds from the two businesses really allows us to sort of offset whatever we had expected and planned for eps thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer our trajectory on capital investment and what drives eps growth in our gas businesses has exceeded our expectations and recall that is really associated with safety related pipeline replacement programs and we got through regulatory processes both in illinois and in georgia and of course georgia power went through an irp last year and then the result of that irp was largely accounted for in its three year accounting order that was received at the end of the year so i think we filled in with franchise investments we look forward to more in the future when we look to mississippi we look to alabama and virginia sophie karp keybank analyst got it this is just super helpful thank you and then just a broader bigger picture question i guess so you re investing very heavily obviously in the zero carbon generation being the plant vogtle so with looking beyond that is there a sense of needing to be more esg friendly if i know if it s the right word but this is an increase increasingly a focus in the space right and we see that the names who are making esg friendly investments are performing are getting the premium valuations and performing better so is there internally a discussion of tailoring your strategy in alliance with this broader trend in the marketplace thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes and sophie thanks for that interestingly we talked about that a lot at our board and we re having a special focus of just kind of global what s going on in the esg world in april in our next board meeting so this is a particular focus of ours we view this as an and not an or this is something that i think we ve had a lot of depth in in the past and it s really just kind of coming to fruition now before i became ceo of southern we were 70 coal zero renewables and you see the numbers now the we gave you a new data point in our script today and that was 14 of our revenue total revenue is associated with coal generation that was a data point that came from one of our esg investors they wanted to see that kind of data so we provided it it s absolutely an impact that i think any responsible company will take and i think in the broadest sense southern company has been doing this for 100 years we ve talked about being citizens wherever we serve making sure that the communities are better off because we re there when we think about esg it isn t just what s going on with carbon or the environment it really goes to the broadest sense of making sure that the communities are better off because we re there and i think we demonstrate that as well as anybody this is not a company run by as per esg we have always taken into account all of our stakeholders and i think that s the right way to drive long run performance sophie karp keybank analyst right thank you so much for comments thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer you bet operator the next question comes from the line of ali agha with strh please proceed andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer hello ali how are you good afternoon ali agha strh analyst good good afternoon first question on vogtle drew can you just remind us what was the net income contribution from vogtle in 2019 and part two of that same question also can you just remind us the main sort of difference between your view of the progress and the staff and the independent monitor s view i mean clearly diametrically opposite in terms of their conclusions to where you are andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer well yes we can start with contribution and you could take the other it s a little bit of a complicated answer we know that vogtle in service will produce something like 800 million worth of additional cash flow for the corporation and about 0 40 a share in aggregate we have about half of that embedded in rates today as we collect as we construct a bit there are some offsets like the roe penalties that we incur as construction progresses and those impacts could be 0 15 to 0 25 over the next couple of years since they re a bit of an offset if you want to give us a call later on we can walk you through each of the individual years and how vogtle contributes to income within georgia thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer but i do want to hit the soft toss here andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer exactly thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer as we emerge from vogtle net income goes up andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer an additional 0 20 a share it s 40 million 0 40 worth of content michael weinstein credit suisse analyst and i think i ve said this before when you think about kind of in the i m not giving guidance now i m just doing dumb math but when you emerge from this kind of penalty rate period we re kind of in the 2023 time frame somewhere in the 3 75 even the 4 range just from eps just transitioning from this kind of return environment to a full return environment the other thing is it s a very interesting question ali i really don t think we re diametrically opposed just yesterday drew and i were down at the site and we sit there with all the co owners the independent monitors everybody is there and members of the staff are there the nrc there doe is there so we re all hearing the same stuff in some cases it s a difference in philosophy and we try to take a risk adjusted approach to this very large and complex project for example we believe that accomplishing as much as we can as fast as we can is an enormous risk mitigator you ve heard us use the expression before fail fast we d like to get our hands on major equipment and major systems and test them as early as we can two big benefits when we do that we let in the opportunity for these systems when problems invariably occur that they don t impact our critical path one two that we can minimize cost as a result of those things and three that we gain lessons learned that we can apply to other systems throughout the plant and we have proven that over and over and over again we think that is absolutely the right thing to do you will have seen testimony from some of the staff etc that would say oh we think you re testing too early we absolutely disagree with that i wouldn t say we re diametrically opposed the difference in philosophy the other one would go to this why are we driving so hard on achieving an aggressive site plan well i think it s to incent the thousands of people that are there on the site to achieve to be the best they can be were we to relax our demands on the system at the site we think we would just be giving up margin and by giving up margin we increase risk and our ability to handle unforeseen changes and to achieve ultimately the november 2021 and november 22 milestones in other words it may sound crazy but i think it s true if we were just to adopt a november pathway we think that would be a much riskier approach in building the plant than what we re doing right now the other thing that s fun to look at is go to the chart we ve given you i guess that s on page seven and what you can see is kind of our performance and how we see i hate to take my foot off the accelerator on the plant we ve been achieving 2 on the average over the past and you could see december and january are a wee bit less but that s holidays and kind of ramp up after the holiday otherwise we re pretty confident we can hit 2 the new aggressive site plan that s refined schedule assumes 2 we could drop all the way down to 1 3 by hot functional test and still achieve the november schedule and i love looking at the green line relative to the red and the blue lines i think you can see the trajectory why slow down now let s do as much as we can as efficiently as we can and i think overall that s an enormous risk mitigator as a strategy to prosecute the construction of these plants ali agha strh analyst okay got it makes sense second question when you look at that 40 billion capex plan over the next several years any of that capex or any of the functionality of that capex where you think you may get bigger pushback from regulators or is your sense there s full buy in on all the regulated capex that you re planning over that time period andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer i think time will tell on these irps especially that s where the big hunk of it is as you ve just been through a rate case in illinois and a rate case in georgia with respect to atlanta gas light from the gas standpoint that s the lion s share of it from the electric standpoint the lion s share of it is at georgia we just finished the irp and then we just finished the rate case ahead of us this year and we never get ahead of regulatory processes is the irp conclusion in alabama scott gammill investor relations the other thing ali i think i would look at is so we re talking about the 40 billion worth of investment our depreciation over that time period is something in the range of 20 billion so our net additions to rate base we think is appropriate and prudent at about 5 a year in electric so maybe closer a little more than 10 a year in the natural gas business the vast majority of expenditure in both of those categories is for modernization of transmission and distribution systems which brings higher reliability for customers we will get to a more aggressive modernization of the generating fleet over time but in the near term i think these are very consistent with the priorities that the states have laid out individually for how capital should be deployed there thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer one more thing in this new concept of resilience really matters i m helping lead the industry on all the cyber and national security work it is a national security interest for this industry to invest in resilience which is how your system operates under abnormal conditions as opposed to the old traditional engineering economics concept of reliability resilience does matter and we should put forth the effort to make sure that our electric grid is as safe as it can be ali agha strh analyst i got it i was just saying one just one clarity on that you show the capex with and then without pool closures can you just remind us why you show it without pool closures as well thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer i m sorry pond closures i think ali agha strh analyst pond closures yes i used the wrong word thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer i m sorry ok sorry about that andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer those are plans that we re working through today with commissioners and i think we wanted to just demonstrate what they could be with or without that particular category or their relative contribution ali agha strh analyst i see i see okay thank you so much andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer you bet operator the next question comes from the line of michael lapides with goldman sachs please proceed thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hey how are you michael lapides goldman sachs analyst i m fine thank you for taking my question i m actually it s two questions first of all how are you thinking about when you look across the electric utility subsidiaries kind of the post vogtle which ones are right for incremental fleet transformation you obviously have the plan laid out in alabama right now for the next couple of years how are you thinking about what happens next in georgia and what happens next in mississippi thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer so we do a we do a system plan and then every individual operating company has an integrated resource plan whatever flavor they have in their state that essentially operationalizes in that state the overall system plan and of course every state commission has their own ability to modify the plan however they see fit although i think we ve been generally successful showing the benefit of kind of the benefit of scale that we have and the benefit of everybody playing within that scale and one of the things that is an obvious kind of determining factor is that the southern company power pool where everybody participates provides excellent outstanding economic value to all of our participants so we get the benefit of a state by state solution but we also get the benefit of an integrated long term plan for generation and transmission which is a benefit we have as an integrated system relative to the so called organized markets so we have scale we have the benefit of state by state input and we have the benefit of kind of a recognition that it s not just generation it s generation and transmission and we iterate around that michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it okay one other question tom i know you re selling your stake in the atlantic coast pipeline but the reality is it was a pretty small stake in what s been a pretty big project getting bigger how are you thinking about the opportunity set for incremental gas pipeline investments but kind of stuff that s more in your service territory or touching your service territory thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well we did southern natural gas pipeline with kinder morgan thought we got a really good outcome there we ve done a few things around the margin drew can speak to that probably better than me we look at this stuff my sense is there s two big factors that s just making pipeline investment tough these days one is kind of the environmental pushback that really shows up as regulatory or permits or what have you that s tough that s a tough environment the second one is the long term question of natural gas in the system look we absolutely believe i used to say when we bought agl resources that natural gas is a bridge to 2050 i really believe natural gas will go beyond 2050 i think in order to achieve low to no or net zero concepts by 2050 given how plentiful and cheap natural gas is we re just going to have to find a way to keep it in play but deal with the carbon atom you know that we by far lead the industry in investments in that regard with wilsonville facility is our big research and development effort where we run the national carbon capture research center we run the international carbon capture research center and i think the next kind of generation the first part of that was kind of focused at coal we re going to start doing it on gas as well michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you tom much appreciated sorry andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer michael i think the only thing i d probably add is that we have been successful in smaller additions to our current infrastructure we re really pleased with the investment in sonat we think that s a very important piece of infrastructure for the southeast for reliability in particular for generation we have added things like the mcdonald lateral we ve talked to ferc and filed an sonat expansion to some degree but i think longer term this is just a piece of infrastructure given the difficulty for building new infrastructure that we ll rely on and be very proud that we ve owned for a long period of time thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes yes i said another way looking back boy that was a great acquisition because it exists and it works and it serves a little over half of our system now hey one other thing is just an exciting thing i m actually front running and breaking a little move but in the r d realm we are doing some direct air extraction of carbon we re starting to plan that anyway i ll be announcing that around the annual meeting but i guess i already did but it s some exciting work that will get us to net zero we hope by 2050 michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you tom one last one what s intended in your growth rate for o m just in terms of how should we think about kind of o m growth at the consolidated entity over the next couple of years andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer our goal is to generally blade inflation throughout the planned period michael lapides goldman sachs analyst okay great thank you guys much appreciate it as always andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sir thank you operator the next question comes from the line of julien dumoulin smith with bank of america please proceed thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hey julian how are you julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst hey good afternoon saying thanks for the time i appreciate it thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good afternoon julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst a quick question coming back to the vogtle timeline here can you talk a little bit about the sanmen experience on the cold and hot functional testing just thinking about how long was their experience in each of those phases and maybe any of the learnings that came out of that that we should be sort of following and you guys start to move through that for unit three here thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well let s think about this for a minute there were a lot of noise going on as they moved these plants into service if you remember there was a big celebration around premier esg where a lot of activity just really slowed or came to a halt and we have people on the site there there was nothing at the site that caused any discernible reason to slow down or stop what they were doing now their experience from fuel load to in service is really pretty encouraging for us so you may remember we talked about these management windows our flexibility period or what have you in the february refined aggressive site plan we have consumed about two months of our four months of total flex time if you will so that allows us to move the start dates of some of our milestones six weeks and still maintain our schedule on fuel load and in service if you look at fuel load in service we still have six months now china averaged essentially 138 days not 180 days so we think we can beat the 180 days china s debt was 112 million we frankly think and we ve got plans in place to beat that now maybe its beat it by some margin but in all i think we ve got kind of two months of flexibility from fuel load in service as demonstrated from china the other thing that i just want to point out that i forget which unit it was but some of these units when they started up they ran like a swiss watch they went post to post breaker to breaker so they performed beautifully so we should have confidence that failing any equipment problems or anything else which is why we do all the testing we do we re going to get a good result the only other thing i would just say the regulation in the united states is way different than the regulation in china so that may account for some differences from regime to regime julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst got it and then can you just talk about the timelines here i mean two months on cold functional for instance are there any specific data points that you may be point us to and perhaps more critically help would be probably thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer julien you are breaking up could you be could you say that again julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst sorry hopefully this is better i m thinking about the timelines here for the hot and cold functional testing what are the public data points that we all should be looking for in the next say cumulatively eight months here as you work your way through them especially given how tight they are for instance in the coal a couple of months for the coal functional testing as a follow up thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well so let s yes let s think about that so we ve just filed all this stuff in the vcm so you could go into the georgia process and get that material to all public one of the things that we have heard some questions i just want to clear that up what we re showing here so cold hydro testing have the ability to begin in june and conclude or actually as of the november schedule you could start as late as kind of in the fall we really don t mean to suggest that that is the duration of the test the cold hydro test that is referring to the start of it the cold hydro test itself has a duration of 19 or 20 days in total that includes mobilization and takedown the test itself is only seven days long ok the other thing let me just do high functional test too so the hot functional test from beginning to end total duration mobilization to take down is like two months the hot functional test itself is only a month now we show you just major milestones i don t mean to suggest that when we finish hot functional test we go right to fuel load there s a few other things we re going to have to do we have between cold hydro and hot functional there is some leak tests and a variety of other things we will be doing if you want a more complete picture of the vcm i think it s on page 24 of the filing has a detailed list of all those matters andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer julien we ll give you a couple of interim data points as well you ll see at the end of the first quarter our release on percent complete which will help us better define what the start of cold hydro will be there will also be testimony both from ourselves and from staff related to vcm before these events occur and so there are a couple of interim data points that will give you a little bit better handle on it as we proceed thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes let me add just a couple of things you didn t ask this but i m going to go ahead and offer it up in the spirit of this question and it really goes to you guys have often asked before what do we worry about and i think we ve been pretty consistent on productivity particularly electrical we said reasonable i think in the script here a reasonable increase in productivity we ve been averaging kind of in the 28 000 hours per week we expect to be able to achieve around 32 000 remember and that s for unit three and remember we i think i ve drawn for a lot of you all in one on one this graph and i think we ve included a similar graph somewhere in the appendix to the handouts kind of how big the capital cost curve is right now i guess it s on page 35 where we show that once we hit hot functional test the exposure to cost variant logically should decrease pretty rapidly if you go to page 35 you ll see a reasonably quick slope and a really dramatic slope for unit four that s because this graph shows both three and 4 all right so we would expect to see any major cost variances occur right now what do we worry about what are the kind of big variances one is hitting this electrical productivity again the increase for the next six months or so for unit three from 28 000 hours a week to 32 000 we believe it s reasonable because as we ve said a lot and you look at this curve again we are in the toughest period right now for electrical work we are in that reactor vessel it s confined areas it s a lot of material and it s a lot of people and so you would expect the productivity to be the worst that it should be right now as we move out of the containment vessel into other areas of the plant we open up scope we open up area we should see productivity improve that s kind of thing one thing two that is on our mind right now it s kind of next man up bechtel has a broad responsibility and they ve been doing a great job on this project and i worked with brendan bechtel he s a top guy jack boucheron barban brian and the people this side are really good folks one of their other areas of responsibility is system subcontracts and we talked about that two years ago but now is the time where subcontractors under the management of bechtel and some with us have to perform and it s stuff that you it s not electrical and containment it s things like coatings it s the hvac systems in the plant it s insulation around the pipes where you have penetrations in walls it s the ceiling of those penetrations and then fire protection and others there s actually a big laundry list of stuff but this is the next thing that we have to perform on so i know you didn t ask that it s my executive caveat to answer a question that i asked but i think it s important for everybody to understand it s just a new phase in the project julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst thanks for all the details good luck thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer you bet thank you appreciate it operator the next question comes from the line of andrew weisel with scotiabank please proceed thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hey andrew andrew weisel scotiabank analyst hey everyone so you ve already addressed you just in the last i just want to address my first question my second one is about the outlook for demand you were pretty clear that you ve seen flat weather normalized sales over the last five years what gives you the optimism that it s going to be more like flat to up 1 going forward andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer so i think the issue i was actually i wanted to be specific in addressing was that we did see a decline in use per customer this year that seemed a bit exaggerated in my mind and i think it mirrors an exaggerate a positive exaggeration in 2018 and so when you put those two things together we re a lot closer to smooth in terms of total net growth in total than any one of those two years would indicate there are a number of folks in our sector that are expressing the same issue which is that we re doing linear regression of weather normalization and we ve seen two very extreme weather years that tend to kind of bend around the curves not to get too statistical about it but i think our precision with which we can measure in these two instances is not great so your question was more around long term as we do more long term view of growth we think it s quite strong in the southeast we ve seen a lot of in migration into our area particularly in georgia but we are seeing efficiency and we re measuring the capacity for efficiency particularly in our commercial segments and so we do take some comfort that use per customer although we ll be growing the customer count will be declining but not with a full offset that s a bit of a long winded answer we re also seeing industrial rebound this is the third cycle within the last 12 years of growth cycle and we really do think that momentum is positive in the industrial segment maybe stand to that thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes i d like to geek out on all of it the first derivative of all this is momentum and in fact we re seeing that i ve told you before i think that momentum showed us bottoming out a little bit but the momentum signals were flat to negative they ve just turned a wee bit positive six positive three negative one flat and i think what you re saying in english is tax law change good reduced regulation good currency wars country trade wars bad and now all of a sudden we see some green shoots out of some agreements with us in mexico for example north america also with china and there s still more to go now countervailing that and a little bit of headwind is the coronavirus but as we have seen and we ve actually talked about this at the fed before with the kind of pandemic that we re seeing assuming that we get control of it those are reasonably shallow downturns and the recovery is pretty good so we ll see where this one takes us but long term we think the fundamentals are still good certainly relative sense for the southeast as compared to other places andrew weisel scotiabank analyst i appreciate you putting that into words i can understand it s very simple my next one next question and this is very very minor but you do have the comment that you ll have new shares for long term equity options incentive comp what s the outlook for that either in dollars or shares per year andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer we only have about 350 million worth of options outstanding robinson came it s actually a little bit lower than that probably closer to 200 million and we don t control the exercise of those but i know we know that the duration is no longer than i think 2024 and so we can t gauge the timing but we know that it all happened sometime in that time frame about 200 million is the dollar denomination of it andrew weisel scotiabank analyst great andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator thank you next question comes from the line of andy levi with exoduspoint please proceed thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hey andy how are you andy levi exoduspoint analyst good how are you thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer awesome andy levi exoduspoint analyst i m just a question on cash flows you ve talked about earnings as you get further out the 3 75 to 4 range again that s not guidance thinking about it but just what will cash flows look like how will they change from like where they are today to the 23 24 time frame as the plan stood up and running and capex business andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so there are a bunch of different ways to think about this in general though vogtle adds about 850 million of cash flow once it s fully embedded in rates all of the other business units are driving at general increase in cash flow that s consistent but if i look at this with respect to couple of things payout ratio or ffo to debt we re very credit conscious here in total and i would say that both of those measures indicate improvement over the five year plan period that s measurable and substantial that s the way we plan thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer here again andy you didn t ask this but i just feel compelled to say this too when we show our capex plan and all that it is what we think we know we don t have a bunch of placeholders in there it s not pie in the sky numbers there s an asset underlying everything that we re projecting here our experience has been that we tend to spend more in outer years but we re just showing you exactly what we know no placeholders andy levi exoduspoint analyst so you re going to have 850 million of incremental net income or cash right not net income i m sorry cash and then depending on what the capex is maybe even a little bit more let s call it 1 billion what do you do with that cash pay down debt do you or grow the dividend faster i don t know what s the balance sheet is just going to look like thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes it s all that i mean andy levi exoduspoint analyst it s coming like do you buy back stock what do you do with that 1 billion and can you talk about longer term get it up to the board but as far as once we get out of this building cycle where would you envision the dividend growth rate to be once you get that pop in earnings and does the shareholder almost in a sense get a catch up on the dividend andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer first andy as always i appreciate your long term perspective it s very refreshing to think about the 2024s 25s and 26s i would say that we will talk with our board about the bookends of opportunity around free cash flow and in general we have been keeping the dividend growth slightly behind the expected growth of income in an effort to move our payout ratio down a little bit closer to the industry we ll achieve that within this plan period and at that point we ll have a conversation about whether or not we grow dividends a pace with earnings or we on the other hand pay down debt to improve the credit quality of the corporation i think that the reality lies someplace in between and that we will emphasize both of those activities when we have the ability at the end of vogtle construction thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes and the other thing i would just say we say it all the time value is a function of risk and return improving your credit metrics as a lot of value to a value accretion as does increasing earnings and so we ll keep our eye on both of those things the wonderful news is you re looking at a company that s going to be spinning off a boatload more cash have much greater earnings potential and have little to no event risk andy levi exoduspoint analyst i agree thank you very much thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question comes from the line of ashar khan with verition please proceed thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hello jr good afternoon ashar khan verition analyst hi good afternoon congratulations tom i m hoping with the i guess this new phase we can also return to the old phase when you were the cfo and when you gave guidance you exceeded the always achieved the top end in the 2000 years when you were the cfo can i assume that under this new it s two years of good that we are back in that cycle what whacked us that they followed you that you can be back in that cycle of as you project that you re losing toward the upper end of guidance every year going forward thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes those are all southern people up there yes look we always have a conservative bearing to our earnings that s the way we like it we think we re on a great trajectory and we ll be able to address we put this 4 to 6 thing in place some time ago and we think it s good to it s fit to be faithful to that a lot of people have asked us are you going to increase it and certainly if you look at a point estimate one year going forward yes sure i mean the math would show you that it would increase long term we ll see i think once we get out of the big project business which i assumed when i got this job we will be in a position where as i just said cash flow positive in a big way earnings accretive in a big way low event risk we should be in a posture to continue to improve our recent performance ashar first time i think even when i was cfo we never said on a third quarter earnings call that we were going to exceed the range we would always say something like well we expect to be at the very top of our range we did exceed and we would have exceeded more but for part of a settlement in the georgia rate proceeding remember we gave away some of the earnings above 12 as part of an overall really attractive global settlement that was probably worth what 0 04 or so this year so i think look we re going to do the best we can to under promise over deliver right now our focus on getting vogtle done i d love to get back to those days andrew w evans executive vice president and chief financial officer i would only reiterate that we do we are ashar under pressure this year because of penalty roes related to the construction of vogtle which is a single minded focus for us and then the only thing other thing i would do is absolutely affirm the fact that tom was the cfo 2000 years ago operator and there are no further questions i ll turn the call back over to you thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you thanks everybody this is such an exciting time and well we said 2019 was such a heavy lift you look back over that year we had to scale up remember we were all worried about getting people to the site and getting site productive and we did hit numbers like a 160 000 hours in a month and we did all that stuff i think we have refined the schedule going forward at somewhere between 140 000 and 145 000 we think we can do that we are calling for a modest increase in electrical we think we can do that we ve got to get subcontractors under bechtel management to perform we think we will do that there s a long way to go here but boy oh boy we re starting to see the end of the tunnel and i m so proud of the folks that work at vogtle three and 4 and our partners bechtel on the site good folks so we look forward and we re going to continue to work on that like crazy but the other thing i don t want you to forget is that this company has been performing like champions outside of the major projects this notion that now we re the best company to work for in the industry 14th in the united states that we do so many good works in the community like the help to historically black colleges like the work we re doing on the esg front like the folks that don t do rhetoric we do solutions on the environmental and technology front we re really trying to invent our future beyond just performing on the major project we have in front of us this is i think what makes this company great it s not a company run by a spreadsheet rather it is a company run by a relentless focus on value as a function of risk and return and we try to balance both those issues in doing the best we can for shareholders going forward man oh man 2020 could be just a great year and we re going through everything we can to make it that way thank you so much for being with us and we ll talk to you soon operator that s it operator duration 72 minutes call participants scott gammill investor relations thomas a fanning chairman of the board president and chief executive officer

this is a forward looking answer to donald trump i mean donald trump s whole message is i m going to bring your jobs back i m going to bring your pay back i m going to bring your dignity back you ve been left out our message has to be that we are going to bring more jobs more possibilities more opportunity to communities left out than they ve ever had before khanna said of his bill no person should be forced to leave their hometown to get a good paying job a community s biggest export shouldn t be their kids so we re going to rebuild and revitalize these communities to bring them the opportunities of the technology revolution and people get that they intuitively get that the economy is changing they intuitively get that just bashing up on china or bashing up on immigrants isn t going to ultimately provide more economic opportunity for their kids khanna s plan is rooted in the notion that the birth of the american middle class was a result of the u s government investing hundreds of billions of dollars in research and development during world war ii and the subsequent decades after the 2016 election khanna set out across the country to better understand why his district of silicon valley had grown into a thriving albeit inequitable technological nerve center as other communities in the u s fell by the wayside and about a year ago he got in touch with mit economists simon johnson and jon gruber who in their book jump starting america argue that the key to winnowing the economic and political divides in america is federal investment in r d the major and now mostly forgotten lesson of the post 1945 period is that modern private enterprise proves much more effective when government provides strong underlying support for basic and applied science and for the commercialization of the resulting innovations gruber and johnson write as the authors lay out in 1938 before america entered ww ii the portion of state and federal income dedicated to scientific research was a pittance at a mere 0 076 as the country ramped up its efforts to catch up with its european allies and the germans in military and defense technology that investment ballooned to nearly 0 5 in 1944 and federal investment in r d eventually reached its peak of almost 2 of u s gdp in 1964 at the crest of the apollo program the manhattan project alone benefited from what would be the equivalent of roughly 80 billion between 1942 and 1946 peaking at 0 4 of gdp the steady rise of investment in these programs was commensurate with the rise of the american middle class contrast that with today when u s government spending on publicly supported science accounts for just 0 7 of gdp president trump didn t appoint a science adviser until 18 months into his administration and kelvin droegemeier wasn t confirmed by the senate until january 2019 khanna s plan would eventually boost federal investment in r d to roughly 1 of gdp as a consequence of this dip in federal funding for r d private industry is the last resort and the major issue with this dynamic is that a private company will only invest in innovation insofar as it benefits its bottom line and does not incentivize the company to share breakthrough knowledge with competitors when you have that situation we call it a classic example of a market failure in economics gruber explained that suggests you need government intervention to really get you to where you need to be gruber and johnson highlight the human genome project as an example of how potent this kind of government intervention can be in lieu of private sector interest in funding dna sequencing research congress agreed to fund the project in 1988 at a total estimated cost of 3 billion today the national institutes of health estimates that the human genome project resulted in economic growth equivalent to almost 1 trillion companies also tend to invest where there are already existing technology centers and talent pools this has led to the concentration of technology jobs on the coasts and in big cities like san francisco san jose seattle new york and boston a perfect example of this is amazon s recent competition to determine the location of its second headquarters while 238 cities applied the company ultimately picked new york and what is ostensibly washington d c two cities already at superstar status and even after the corporate conglomerate canceled its plans to build its headquarters in queens following a push led by congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez unions and activists amazon announced at the end of last year that it is expanding its footprint in new york city the problem is the private sector will only go to where the talent is already johnson explained the federal government has this ability to think bigger and think more broadly in september of last year republican governor of iowa kim reynolds and khanna attended the opening of the forge an accenture backed initiative to bring technology jobs to the rural community of jefferson iowa with the help of khanna and his silicon valley ties and reynolds s support the 6 000 square foot space will house an academy that through partnerships with local community colleges and the financial backing of companies like facebook and corteva will both employ as many as 30 full time workers and provide a four month tuition free commercial software development training program for jefferson area students to prepare them for high paying tech jobs i would say the future of the country is riding on this rural america and urban america preaching back and forth at each other about whether you should use gendered pronouns or how many guns you should be able to own those are arguments that are going to continue to divide douglas burns co owner of iowa s carroll times herald newspaper said in an interview about the forge what we re doing is literally potentially preventing a civil war because this wealth inequality just can t stand and it just won t stay up we can t have only a select number of winners in a select number of places where people are just sort of succeeding by geographic accident like that that s just not going to hold the country together
lthm earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 livent corp lthm q4 2019 earnings call 5 00 p m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator good morning and welcome to the fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings release conference call for the livent corporation i will now turn the conference over to mr daniel rosen manager investor relations for the livent corporation mr rosen you may begin daniel rosen manager investor relations thank you chelsea good evening everyone and welcome to livent s fourth quarter 2019 earnings call joining me today are paul graves president and chief executive officer and gilberto antoniazzi chief financial officer the slide presentation that accompanies our results along with our earnings release which includes our 2020 outlook can be found in the investor relations section of our website the prepared remarks from today s discussion will be made available after the call following our prepared remarks paul and gilberto will be available to address your questions we would ask that any questions be limited to two per caller we would be happy to address any additional questions after the call before we begin let me remind you that today s discussion will include forward looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning specific factors including but not limited to those factors identified in our release and in our filings with the securities and exchange commission the information presented represents our best judgment based on today s information actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties today s discussion will focus on adjusted earnings for all income statement and eps references reconciliations of these terms as well as other non gaap financial terms to which we may refer during today s conference call are provided on our website with that i ll turn the call over to paul paul graves president and chief executive officer thank you dan and good evening everyone starting with slide 3 there are a few key topics that we ll address today as part of our earnings release first livent has provided its financial guidance for the full year ahead we ll go into further detail on this guidance today but as we announced in early january we are expecting profitability in 2020 to be lower year over year as higher sold volumes are more than offset by lower average realized pricing and higher consumption of third party lithium carbonate we are guiding a wider range than usual due in part to the inherent uncertainty in the first half of the year arising from the potential impact of the coronavirus in this context livent reaffirms its prior guidance for 2020 volume growth in total lce terms and expect to sell roughly 30 higher total lces versus 2019 again reflecting the uncertainty inherent on the demand side in the first half of this year we are highlighting that we may shift more volume toward lithium carbonate sales depending on how and where demand is and where opportunities arise we will continue to provide significant volumes to key strategic customers as they increase their use of hydroxide based cathode chemistries in energy storage applications and finally we will provide an update on livent s expansion programs and the drivers behind the decision to slow down the execution of these projects on slide 4 i want to spend some time discussing where the lithium market stands today and its implications for 2020 and 2021 let me begin by characterizing what we saw in 2019 clearly there was a slowdown an electric vehicle demand growth in 2019 largely driven by a change in chinese subsidies even then lithium demand continued to grow at a healthy rate with lithium demand increasing by over 15 year on year to exceed 300 000 lce tons specifically for hydroxide we estimate demand grew to just under 100 000 product tons from approximately 65 000 tons in 2018 implying over 35 year on year growth if you strip out the base demand from industrial applications which did not meaningfully change demand for lithium hydroxide for energy storage applications likely grew by around 75 for the year despite this increase in demand the short term or non contracted lithium market experienced a decline in pricing over the course of 2019 as significant new supply came online this new supply was largely due to an increase in output of spodumene from australia combined with an increase in chinese conversion capacity a meaningful portion of the china conversion capacity was non integrated meaning the spodumene producers were separate from the converters that produce the final lithium products it is this non integrated supply chain which was largely responsible for the excess supply resulting in elevated spodumene inventory levels lower operating rates and therefore increased pricing pressure from converters it is this part of the supply chain in lithium hydroxide and carbonate that represents the marginal cost producer for the industry today given the inherent inefficiencies in this model it is increasingly clear that today s short term pricing levels are not sustainable for the lithium industry especially given the need to invest in growing future output to meet growing demand recent announcements across the industry underscore just how challenging it is to justify investment in most projects at current prices not surprisingly we have seen a number of development projects where traditional financing sources have been essentially non existent this difficulty extends to better capitalized lithium producers and new entrants who have announced pullbacks or delays in their own expansion plans in light of revised anticipated returns from these producers alone in the last few months roughly 300 000 lce tons of volume have been taken out of planned supply additions in the next few years beyond expansion delays and cancellations we ve reached a point where prices have also impacted existing operations higher cost producers have disclosed their struggle to cover operating costs at today s prices with some companies who even have a relatively low cost position struggling to achieve profitability and we ve seen hard rock producers concluding that it makes little sense to continue to deplete finite life resources at prices that are barely above cash operating costs and significantly curtailing concentrate production as a result in light of all of this it should come as no surprise that livent is slowing down its own capacity expansion we expect that the market will begin to see the impact of these production and expansion cuts particularly as we head into the latter part of 2020 and early 2021 in the near term however there remains an oversupply primarily due to elevated spodumene inventory levels that will need to be worked through as total demand continues to grow we therefore remain cautious in indicating when we expect to see an inflection in the market and have not included any recovery in pricing for the year from today s levels in our 2020 guidance today we re also facing the uncertainty created by the coronavirus and particularly the impact it may have on our end markets in the immediate term we restarted all of our operations in china after the lunar new year and have had no operating issues at the plants themselves however the logistics and transportation issues associated with moving products across provincial borders has created some disruption both in terms of getting raw materials to our plants and shipping product to customers in china and other asian countries the larger challenge today is understanding what the impact of these restrictions will be on our customers and competitors it is clear that there will be some headwinds in the first half of this year as a result of the epidemic and we are watching closely to understand how much of this will be recovered once china resumes normal operations consequently we cannot yet predict with any reasonable certainty what the impact on our business will be for 2020 and we have therefore attempted to reflect this uncertainty in wider guidance ranges compared to prior years i will now hand over to gilberto to review fourth quarter financial results and the 2020 outlook before i return to give more color on the status of our current expansion programs gilberto antoniazzi chief financial officer thank you paul and good evening everyone turning now to slide 5 and our financial results to close 2019 for the fourth quarter of 2019 we reported revenue of 78 million adjusted ebitda of 16 million and adjusted earnings per share of 0 05 versus original guidance provided in november performance was impacted primarily by about 800 fewer product tons of lithium hydroxide sold than anticipated largely due to orders that were delayed into 2020 by customers sequentially average realized pricing remained relatively flat for hydroxide compared to q3 while pricing for carbonate continued to decline for full year 2019 revenue was 388 million adjusted ebitda was 100 million and adjusted earnings per share was 0 42 the year over year revenue decline was driven by lower volumes and lower pricing higher hydroxide sales volumes were offset by a decline in carbonate volume sold we also saw a decline in average realized price of both hydroxide and carbonate with carbonate prices falling by roughly 20 percentage points more than hydroxide average pricing for butyllithium and high purity metals were higher on a constant currency basis specifically on the cost side the largest contributors to low year over year profitability were the higher cost of purchased third party carbonate one time air freight expenses and the vat incurred on exports from china as you recall we began 2019 with limited inventory an abnormal rain event in argentina in the first quarter of last year caused disruptions in our supply chain that resulted in livent incurring additional costs including air freighting certain material additionally the roughly 1 000 tons of lost carbonate production in argentina meant that we had to source additional third party carbonate above our initial plan to feed hydroxide customer commitments we ultimately purchased about 6 000 tons of third party carbonate in 2019 and used roughly 2 000 tons in hydroxide sales the remainder will be used in 2020 to meet hydroxide customer commitments and lastly while the vat rate on chinese exports was reduced in 2019 we incurred higher costs on a total dollar basis due to higher sold volumes rounding out 2019 results foreign exchange was a headwind for the year on the top line primarily from the rmb and the euro although it was more than offsets by cost benefit from the valuation in the argentine peso turning now to slide 6 and our full year guidance for 2020 we expect revenue to be in the range of 375 million to 425 million just above 2019 results at midpoint this is primarily driven by higher volumes being offset by lower pricing with average price on an lce basis across the portfolio down by mid teens 2020 adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per share are projected to be in the range of 60 million to 85 million and 0 18 to 0 31 per diluted share respectively on slide 7 we provide further detail on livent s expected sales volume growth in 2020 on an lce basis we plan to sell up to 28 500 tons of lithium in 2020 implying a roughly 30 increase from 2019 sales volumes at the midpoint of our guidance range there are two points i d like to call your attention to first you will see that we are projecting lithium hydroxide and carbonate sales volumes as one line item and as total lces while we previously stated an intention to sell less than 1 000 tons of carbonate in 2020 as paul mentioned earlier we want to ensure we maintain enough flexibility in our plans to sell higher volumes should it make sense to do so the sales will not be at the expense of any hydroxide customer commitments and we would not expect carbonate sales to exceed more than a few thousand tons second we have now provided projected sales volumes for lces related to our other product lines namely butyllithium high purity metal and other specialty compounds these products are all derived from lithium chloride as a feedstock and we expect sales volumes for these compounds to remain relatively flat year over year on slide 8 we provide additional detail on key drivers of our projected adjusted ebitda performance in 2020 versus the prior year first we expect to grow total lces sold by roughly 30 versus 2019 sales volumes the sales volumes which are higher than our annual production capacity are achievable given the decision to carry forward roughly 4 000 product tons of hydroxide inventory in order to meet customer commitments to reach these hydroxide sales volumes we will need to use up to 7 000 tons of third party lithium carbonate which represents an increase of 5 000 tons compared 2019 usage this incremental use of third party carbonate adds cost to our operations when compared to relying on our own low cost carbonate produced out of argentina additionally we expect average realized pricing for lithium hydroxide in 2020 to be low to mid teens percent lower than the average realized price for 2019 we also expect carbonate pricing to be down again year over year with respect to butyllithium we expect both volumes and pricing to be relatively flat compared to last year and finally we are anticipating some additional costs from inflation on some of our key raw material inputs as well as slight fx headwind i want to conclude on slide 9 by commenting on cash flow as well as give you an update on our capital spending plans for 2020 before paul addresses this in more detail for the full year 2019 livent generated adjusted cash from operations of 90 million in line with our expectations we deployed 189 million in capital spending for the year and while the spending accelerated in the fourth quarter as expected the total spend was below our guidance of 210 million to 240 million we ended 2019 with debt net of cash of 138 million for capital expenditures we are projecting total spending for 2020 to be in the range of 200 million to 230 million this number is inclusive of growth capital predominantly in argentina as well as maintenance spending across the business as a reminder capacity expansion related to capital in argentina is front loaded in both 2019 and 2020 as we build out infrastructure that will drive us through future expansion phases with that i will turn the call back to paul paul graves president and chief executive officer thank you gilberto as we mentioned in livent s january announcement we are revisiting what the most appropriate execution strategy is for our near term expansion plans let me start by being clear our expansions themselves and the strategy that underpins them have not changed we remain committed to expanding our low cost carbonate operations in argentina and to growing our capabilities in hydroxide to support our customers growth plans it is the pace of execution of the expansions that we are adjusting as part of the revised plan livent will be slowing down its phase one carbonate expansion in argentina primarily to preserve our financial flexibility in these market conditions as we outlined on slide 10 we have continued to hit our key expansion milestones we have completed construction camps are fully under way in key infrastructure build outs and have had a number of carbonate modules arrive in argentina from the fabrication yards in china we have elected to delay the installation of the first carbonate modules until after the argentine winter which will push the start up of these units into mid 2021 since our current 5 000 ton hydroxide expansion was lined up to process the additional carbonate from argentina we re also shifting the time frame for our hydroxide expansion completion to align with this we do not expect this revised timeline to impact our ability to meet the needs of customers many of whom see 2021 as the first year that they will look to increase their purchases from livent with a larger ramp up coming in subsequent years in this fluid and rapidly shifting environment we know it is critically important to stay flexible in our capital planning and we will remain agile and adapt our plans based on market dynamics and customer commitments i d like to finish on slide 11 by sharing some key developments to keep in mind today and as we look ahead first relative to even just a few years ago it s increasingly clear that the shift to evs is gaining traction even if the ability to predict the pace in the very near term remains difficult this is apparent in all of the announced partnerships between oems and battery producers as well as the substantial capital being committed and deployed across the supply chain it s even more visible in the number of new ev models nearing production and the growing number of electric vehicles on the road global oems are also much more active in engaging further down the supply chain as part of their electrification strategies there have been some challenges as the supply chain struggles to keep up with the ambitious electrification plan set by these oems the challenges to oems meeting their announced sales targets appear to be driven more from the supply side than the demand side for example there have been several examples of oems specifically referencing a lack of sufficient battery supply from top tier suppliers as a reason for changing forecasted sales it s also worth noting that there continue to be positive demand signals coming from both china and europe largely viewed as the key growth regions for electric vehicles over the next few years china began this year by issuing a strong statement to the market that it will not be making any significant cuts to its ev subsidy policy in 2020 despite rumors of a potential midyear phase out this is just one example in a growing list of actions from china that reiterate its commitment to playing a leading role in the global push toward electrification while china will continue to be the largest market for electric vehicles 2020 is widely viewed as a year when europe will begin to close that gap as oems need to sell more electric vehicles to avoid the financial penalties or reputational risk from not being compliant with co2 emission levels while it s still very early on in the year some of the initial data coming out of europe is positive despite the overall auto market being down in western europe in january year over year electric vehicles continue to gain momentum with penetration levels reaching all time highs in some countries longer term there has been additional support with the european commission s pledge of eur3 2 billion toward battery technology development unlocking an additional eur5 billion in expected private investment and additional announcements of planned european battery plants and cathode material production localization of supply chains is a growing topic and there is an increasing realization that for lithium particularly this cannot happen with the current concentration of the australia china supply axis there has also been a greater focus on the overall sustainability profile of the ev supply chain given that the transition to electric vehicles is rooted in green environmentally conscious goals and esg principles more broadly this is an area that will only continue to grow in importance over time today topics such as water usage carbon footprint and local community impact are all being examined by oems and especially consumers when they consider the realities of electric vehicle production we re proud of livent s ongoing efforts to be a responsible sustainable producer including the work we re doing to partner closely with the communities where we operate around the world especially in argentina we ve spent the last year as a stand alone public company focusing our efforts on tailoring and strengthening our sustainability program for the future we intend to provide a number of updates on this front as we move through 2020 and we will continue to work closely with customers local communities and other key stakeholders in closing despite the recent challenges experienced by the lithium industry as a whole we are excited about the opportunities ahead the low cost and sustainable nature of our brine based operations our partnerships with leading battery producers and automotive oems our continued investment in developing next generation engineered lithium products and our reputation for reliability safety and quality that is second to none are all key differentiators that position livent for future success i ll now turn the call back to dan for questions daniel rosen manager investor relations thank you paul chelsea you may now begin the q a session questions and answers operator and your first question comes from the line of bob koort with goldman sachs dylan campbell goldman sachs analyst good morning this is dylan campbell on for bob a couple of questions here on carbonate i mean it sounds like you are delaying your installation of the carbonate module i m curious kind of what the rationale is they are considering kind of the net short position on carbonate and that would be kind of a net cost saver and then i guess the second question on carbonate i guess you mentioned that you could shift more volumes to lithium carbonate sales is that in response to kind of recent chatter that you ve heard on the use of lfp cathodes in china paul graves president and chief executive officer so let me tackle those questions in that order so the rationale very simply is we want to make sure that we protect our financial flexibility i think we ve been pretty clear in the past that we see reaching leverage points of about 4 times debt to ebitda was being something we re comfortable reaching for periods of time but we don t feel comfortable going north of that and we made the decision that frankly it makes more sense to slow down and to pace out the execution in order to maintain that financial flexibility on the balance sheet it s an interesting trade off with carbonate pricing where it is today frankly the cost of buying carbonate relative to the build is not as punitive as perhaps it will be in the future and so what we re really doing is delaying by six months the ability to take those costs down now look i will say while it wasn t the basis for the decision i think one way or the other we likely would have had to delay expansion as well we certainly are going to have some issues getting our carbonate modules out of china given the coronavirus it s certainly slowed down the fabrication there and i think as we ve spoken about in the past we run quickly into and argentine winter where it is not particularly easy to do these installations at the 14 000 feet above sea level in the middle of winter and so it was never our expectation that we would be doing construction in the winter and so we ve delayed it on that basis in terms of the shift to the carbonate frankly the conversation around carbonate is always driven by our customers it s not that we sit there and try and be more strategic about it we certainly have customers asking if we can supply them lithium carbonate instead of lithium hydroxide certainly in the short term many of our customers make multiple types of cathodes and therefore have a need for both many of them themselves are just responding to signals that they receive from their customers it feels to us that and we certainly won t be selling generally that ability to bring flexibility and switch between hydroxide and carbonate at really very little cost is something that our customers appreciate and in this environment where there is still a lot of fluidity if you will about the technology developments and the pace at which they develop they value our ability to do that and reaching out was on that basis i certainly don t expect carbonate to suddenly be a massive peak in volumes for us but i can t imagine that we ll be a few thousand tons higher this year than we originally thought we would be dylan campbell goldman sachs analyst got it that s helpful and i guess a clarification question on capex despite the reduction in production plans i mean expansion plans it looks like capex grows in 2020 relative to 2019 what s driving that paul graves president and chief executive officer yeah frankly it s where we are in the projects so we will have the first phase of the lithium hydroxide construction will be completed so the modules will be completed we just won t install them and will delay that till next year and in argentina look it s a complex project in argentina and if we re going to hit these deadlines we continue to have to finish and complete some key aspects of the infrastructure rollout and once we start with these we re certainly not going to slow them down some of it is just simply a rollover a delay of costs from 2019 running into 2020 it was always expected regardless that 2020 would have been the peak capital spending year for this project dylan campbell goldman sachs analyst got it thank you operator and your next question comes from the line of christopher parkinson with credit suisse christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you so you spent a lot of time on the supply side unjustifiably so and you hit on this a little bit can you further comment on your demand outlook in 20 and 22 the development specifically you ve heard from your supply chain as it pertains to the adoption of nmc and nca technology just is there anything new on that front or is it kind of the status quo what you ve already given paul graves president and chief executive officer no look in terms of absolute levels of demand i think the demand for lithium on an lce basis continues to climb in that mid to high teen percentage rate year over year that s what certainly what we see happening in 2020 and we certainly are continuing to see a faster growth rate in lithium hydroxide which reflects that shift to the higher nickel applications i think we have frankly a lot more high nickel applications out there today than people realize i think this focus on nmc 811 or nca and some of the challenges in getting 811 into commercial applications has confused people and shrouded the fact that really we re making a lot of nmc materials today that are north of 65 nickel and that s the tipping point into lithium hydroxide use so while it may not be 811 or it may not be a broader adoption of nca it s certainly the case that the cathode materials today are rapidly shifting over to hydroxide it really hasn t changed christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst and i understand the delay in your argentine carbonate expansion relates to the pace of construction and to maintain your financial flexibility but how should investors take the announcement in the context of your intermediate to long term margin outlook we understand there is a natural benefit to reducing third party supplier once you re up and running but how should we assess the kind of the intermediate to long term margin framework just any color you could possibly give on that would be appreciated thank you paul graves president and chief executive officer yeah i ll deal with the cost side of it which is i think what you re pointing to because clearly supply is a completely different conversation but it doesn t really change anything frankly all it does is it means that we re going to be short carbonate for six more months that s the only real change instead of going online at the end of 2020 with that first phase of the expansion it will be middle of 2021 the second phase will follow right behind that we ve structured this so that there are significant infrastructure carryover benefits into the second phase and so we do not expect to go back into a short carbonate position once that first phase is up and running so the cost basis in argentina obviously allowing for some of the short term movements we can get in inflation and currency depreciation really hasn t changed its cost structure remains really where it has been for several years and again we don t expect that to change either christopher parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of chris kapsch with loop capital christopher kapsch loop capital markets analyst yeah good afternoon a question about pricing in 2020 is there any way you can characterize your outlook for pricing based and what is sort of locked in for the full year versus what could drift one way or another the reason i m asking is because i m trying to reconcile the downward revision in your guidance versus what you said earlier this year primarily on the basis of pricing versus just opposed against what a lot of my texts are saying that granted i understand we re oversupplied right now but in hydroxide there s definitely more evidence of a tightening hydroxide market for example and i know it s unique circumstances but they introduced a 10 price increase earlier last week but given the shift in demand favoring hydroxide that you just alluded to tightening hydroxide because there s not as much hydroxide in the in the inventory the channel inventories there is a notion that hydroxide pricing could be improving as we exit 2020 so that s why i m asking is there are you locked in on the pricing that you just sort the outlook that you just conveyed or through the possibility that you could kind of from a more favorable hydroxide pricing as we exit 2020 thanks paul graves president and chief executive officer sure hey chris thanks for that you ve kind of really gone to the heart of one of the key challenges that we ve had this year in terms of some of the decisions we ve had to make clearly there is a trade off we make do we sit here and leave more pricing open on the expectation there will be a recovery in pricing from here but it s hard to predict when or do we lock it all in and so we sort of tried to balance that we do have a bunch contracts that rolled over anyway and so those prices didn t change and haven t changed from 2019 to 2020 we have other customers where we elected to fix the pricing even though it s lower year over year with just the nature of those customers we chose to do that our guidance as i said does not assume an increase in pricing in the second half of the year i see the same external announcements that you ve seen from people like we ve seen some commentary about challenges bringing hydroxide material plants online successfully and so yes you can certainly see data points that suggest that tightening is going to happen it s really difficult today chris to answer the question as to whether it s changing because frankly it s not a normal market we re in as we look at the impact of the disruption that s in china that doesn t just impact china that impacts throughout the supply chain and even if it doesn t directly impact our supply chain for example lithium or the batteries themselves or the cathode materials it s certainly the case that it s more difficult to build vehicles today so even if you have enough material for the batteries and if batteries then you may not have enough other parts other components so it s frankly very difficult to parse through all the noise and to work out whether you are in fact seeing signals or whether you are in fact just seeing noise at the moment christopher kapsch loop capital markets analyst okay and just as a follow up and maybe it s just way too early to see how this may affect sort of i guess supply chain thinking of major oes but given the coronavirus and how disruptive it s been in sourcing from supply chains that rely on china and given that the vast majority of conversion of hydroxide happens in china say notwithstanding i guess your conversion in north carolina maybe a little bit at some others do you have any thoughts on as this industry evolves and matures would that put you in a better competitive positioning or worst competitive positioning do you have any sense that conversations with downstream customers are going to evolve to a point where they want to rely less on conversion that takes place in china any feel for how that may play out over time thanks paul graves president and chief executive officer but i think there has been for a while and it is too soon to know whether the coronavirus will be a direct factor driving this but there has been a concern for a while among many end users and oems particularly about the concentration of conversion capacity in china and specifically around the desire to localize supply chains there is political pressure to do that there is environmental pressure to do that but i think what is changing and has changed in recent months from my perspective at least is that the oems are now starting to spend a lot more time really truly understanding how and where lithium is produced and they are certainly starting to understand that it isn t like any other material that they ve ever had to deal with it s not like pgms it behaves differently and is produced on a different basis than things like nickel cobalt copper aluminum etc and so they started to scratch their head and say how do you localize a supply chain when it appears that most of the raw material is being mined in australia and shipped at 6 concentration levels because that is extremely difficult to localize when they ask that question they then turn to us and say you have a different model come and explain it to us is this more able to be localized into europe or into the us so the answer is yes we do have a lot more conversations around it i would not for one moment suggest that we are at the point where people are making actual decisions on that basis but they are certainly starting to ask the questions and depending on who it is express preferences for what they want their future supply chain to look like operator and your next question comes from the line of kevin mccarthy with vertical research kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst good evening a question on your sales guidance which at the midpoint seems to imply growth of 3 in 2020 trying to reconcile that level of sales growth with the 30 volume that you indicate on slide 7 and price erosion in the low to mid teens can you help me reconcile that paul graves president and chief executive officer sure i think it s probably fair to say that we are being very cautious on pricing and on mix you ve noticed that we also shifted a hydroxide and carbonate assumption into there as well so we have a price decline for sure in hydroxide absolutely a price decline continued in carbonate we also have price declines in certain other areas particularly ones that are largely referenced to carbonate as a feedstock like some of the metals based businesses that we have where with carbonate pricing declining it becomes more of an incentive to convert that into chloride and create metal based products so we also have some quite significant price declines in certain other areas as well i think it s probably fair to say that in that revenue guidance as i said we re being maybe a little overly cautious in some people s minds but there is as i said no assumption whatsoever of any price changes away from where the market is today and that s what s driving much of this kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst okay and so as a follow up paul is it the case that the total company average price erosion could be greater than the mid teens or is it the case rather that while you could sell 30 higher volume what is embedded is something less than that paul graves president and chief executive officer so i think a little bit of both there is certainly a potential that it goes from mid teens to high teens i don t see going much further than that just because of the mix of how much pricing is already committed and agreed across our contracts frankly it s more likely that we sell less volumes and i think when you look at the volume range that we have out there some of the volumes that we have in there are not particularly profitable business to be perfectly honest it s profitable but not hugely profitable and we re not going to place that with customers for no reason it s going to be placed with a little more important customers and want to make more sense if the market doesn t evolve that way if we do get an impact in china and it doesn t recover in the second half of the year we ll frankly just pull those volumes from the market we won t just sell them for the sake of it so you should assume that there is a degree of flexibility a wider degree of flexibility in that volume estimate than there is maybe in price kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst understood that s helpful and if i may i had a second question for gilberto what is the amount of working capital source or usage that s embedded in your cash flow from operations guidance range for 2020 gilberto antoniazzi chief financial officer so we expect as we guide we re going to generate about 85 million of cash with the midpoint of capex of 215 million and in terms of our working capital naturally we build up a lot of inventory beginning of the year kevin and for this 4 000 metric tons that we mentioned early in the call as we drawn on this inventory that is going to accelerate our cash generation as well so that s why our outlook for cash is actually higher than our ebitda guidance kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst okay so you plan to liberate some cash then from trade working capital gilberto antoniazzi chief financial officer yeah kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst okay very good thank you so much gilberto antoniazzi chief financial officer yeah in q4 kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst thanks again operator and your next question comes from the line of p j juvekar with citi p j juvekar citigroup analyst yeah good afternoon hey paul you mentioned that there is a desire to become less reliant on china for the supply chain how do you see that supply chain developing in europe and as the us seems to be lagging behind but is the industry doing anything to lobby the government in the us paul graves president and chief executive officer i think the issue in the us frankly is you can t really move the inputs like lithium locally until you ve really got the cathode material production locally and it s the lack of cathode materials and that chemical infrastructure in the us that really is lagging more than anything else in europe that s less the case there are certainly more people out there and there are some pretty important cathode material producers based in europe and committed to europe and there s also more state support or eu support in europe for that localization for multiple reasons i don t know how it s going to evolve if i m perfectly honest i don t know what appetite markets have to have large spodumene mining operations we know there are spodumene resources in the us and in parts of europe it s not entirely clear that there is an appetite for that mining to actually take place when you get into the local communities i also think there is an acknowledgment and recognition in europe anyway that this will result in higher costs we see that in the way that the very energy intensive cathode material producers in europe are paying extra to get wind or solar or other renewable energy sources even though a customer i don t know that that will be as acceptable in other parts of the world either so the dynamics as to how it localizes i think is starting to be understood more clearly by many of these interested parties it s not a very simple there is not a simple solution to it i mean clearly one way as you take lithium carbonate produced in south america and convert that locally which is as you know what we do but not everybody views that as a good long term solution p j juvekar citigroup analyst okay and then coming back to livent you mentioned that your capex in 2020 is still around that 200 million to 230 million mark what s the cadence beyond that particularly in 2021 and then based on your outlook today on lithium can you fund all that capex through your internal cash paul graves president and chief executive officer i ll let gilberto touch on 2021 the short answer is yes i mean it s always in terms of funding off our own internal cash it s not clearly ideal that we don t have the cash flow generation today that we had a couple of years ago but we do have the ability to just frankly slow down that expansion will it get done as quickly no it certainly won t i ll be honest with you my take on this is very straightforward i think the market is speaking customers are saying hey we ll take that risk we ll take the risk that there will be a delay to new capacity coming online we ll take advantage of oversupply today to drive prices down and we recognize that that s quite likely to create a spike in prices in the future that s the decision the market is making we re listening to the market we re slowing down we ll add capacity at a slower pace we ll add it frankly as quick as we can without taking undue financial risk gilberto antoniazzi chief financial officer p j regarding the capex for 2021 as you ask so we expect to be ramping up not only finishing in 21 the mga one expansion the phase one expansion in argentina but also the bc and we will continue to have the 30 about 30 million all combined in 2021 we re looking out at something in the magnitude between 175 million and 200 million p j juvekar citigroup analyst okay great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steve byrne with the bank of america steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst good evening these 7 000 tons of carbonate that you re purchasing from third parties and converting into hydroxide do you need to do this to meet volume commitments or to absorb fixed costs of your conversion capacity in china or this is just profitable for you paul graves president and chief executive officer a good question let me just be clear we won t purchase 7 000 tons of lithium carbonate this year some of that lithium carbonate is actually embedded in the inventory that we brought forward from 2019 into 2020 but the p l impact is 7 000 tons or so of lithium carbonate we re certainly not doing it to run the plants flat out our china plants don t have any fixed costs because of the way we operate them they have a higher variable operating fee but we can turn them on we can turn them off without any meaningful cost at all and we ve always been very clear if it doesn t make sense to run them and we can t sell the product comfortably we will just turn them off we ll just we ve got small lines that are 5 000 ton lines three of them and if we have to turn one of those lines off or slow down some of the lines we ll do so we certainly don t have a cost burden from doing that but it s a valid question though we certainly today this is profitable business we don t need to buy for example battery grade carbonate to convert into hydroxide we can use multiple grades so we have a lot of purchasing flexibility as to what we can use in those units and that gives us a cost saving our plants are very efficient especially the ones in china so even with no fixed cost to allocate the variable cost that we incur is competitive and competitive with what we do in the us and so today even china pricing today we can still and do still make money on that particular business it is not great business compared to what we want it to be and what the rest of our business is and we certainly will only do it if it makes sense for long term benefits for our customers we will not be trying to sell small amounts to non important non strategic customers on that basis steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst and paul you ve got a long history there of improving the selective absorption of the brine solutions on in argentina and continually improving that and reducing the amount of evaporation ponds do you see the potential for that technology to get to the point where you could eliminate the evaporation ponds paul graves president and chief executive officer it s a very good question our technical team would love to eliminate the evaporation ponds the short answer to that is yes we absolutely we do have a plan to retire our evaporation ponds we will keep the smaller ones i m sure you know we have two types of evaporation ponds there are very large pre evaporation ponds similar to what you see in chile and then we have much much smaller fraction of the size basically finishing ponds that the brine stays in for about a month or so after it s come out of the selective absorption process we will absolutely as part of the expansion eliminate those pre evaporation ponds for two reasons one of them is that evaporation a lot of water leaves the environment we know water is a scarce and valuable resource where we produce lithium not so much as it is in chile perhaps but still critically important and it s important to us first to reduce that water loss and eliminating the pre evaporation ponds does that the second is they re frankly expensive to maintain we get a lot of salt buildup in the bottom of these ponds and so every few years you have to drain them and one way or another move that salt that itself is expensive but it also creates another waste product which is the sodium magnesium chloride that builds up in the bottom of the pond so a long answer to say yeah we absolutely will expect that within the next couple of years we will be retiring those pre evaporation ponds steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you operator and your next question comes from mike harrison with seaport global michael harrison seaport global securities analyst hi good afternoon apologize if i missed this but can you comment at all on the expected cadence of earnings in 2020 obviously we re coming off a q4 that was 16 million in ebitda and at the low end your 60 million ebitda guidance 65 million implies something like 15 million a quarter for 2020 so any thoughts on how that progresses over the course of the year paul graves president and chief executive officer yeah response is going to be a huge surprise to anybody clearly the first part of the year is going to be more challenged given the disruption that we ve seen in china and given how much of our business and how much of our customers and how much of our product ultimately finds its way and other through china so we re certainly expecting the first half to be weaker than the second half i don t have the confidence yet from the data that i ve seen to know how long that lasts how deep it is or even whether in fact we will get everything that we lose in the first half back in the second half there are questions around all of those but what i can say reasonably confidently is that certainly compared to the second half the first half is going to be softer michael harrison seaport global securities analyst all right and in terms of the customer delays that you saw during q4 can you give a little bit of color on what led your customers to delay and i guess help us understand what s in your contracts that maybe give them flexibility around when they take deliveries i guess i would have assumed that those volumes are committed and that maybe they would have to take them paul graves president and chief executive officer look it s a complex question on the demand side number of customers as we ve mentioned before this is a fluid market we ve had they themselves have their own customers changing demand changing orders changing structures and so there is no single reason behind some of these delays other than perhaps this constant flux that we have in the supply chain today with maybe a higher degree of uncertainty over who is making what how much they re making our contracts we have various types of contracts with customers multiple ones we do not think it s in anybody s interest to force product down to customers that frankly don t need it lithium hydroxide especially does not have as long a shelf life as lithium carbonate it s not in our view a healthy relationship with a customer to force them to take material that they don t need at that point in time we have tended to find over time and we still see this holding up today that on a life of contract basis our customers live up to their commitments they take the volumes that they ve committed to take from us sometimes they take it more quickly than they think and that s an upside to us in the short term and in other times they have delays and that s a downside to us in the short term but we certainly don t have or have not had yet at least any major customers not living up to their volume commitments michael harrison seaport global securities analyst thanks very much operator and your last question comes from the line of joel jackson with bmo capital markets joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst hi good evening i want to follow up on some of the capex and the expansion question so beyond the first phase of carbonate and hydroxide or the next phase of carbonate and hydroxide expansion here what would be the cadence you think of that in the next round of expansion and then how would your capital budget kind of phase out here or phase down or project over 22 23 24 as you may be head on your next leg of capacity i think paul graves president and chief executive officer yeah good evening joel it s weird saying good evening by the way on an earnings call i have to say joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst yeah paul graves president and chief executive officer so phase two of argentina clearly we will continue to go ahead with the expansion was designed to essentially break into two groups phases one and two and then phases three and four and phases one and two really do go hand in hand and so once phase one is completed even before is completed we ll start to turn our attention to phase two hence the no real slowdown in capital spending likely to come in 2021 on the hydroxide side we do not expect to add any more units in hydroxide we certainly don t have enough visibility today at anything other than maybe a unit in china i think we see an opportunity to add another small unit in china but as you know that s a relatively low capital outlay for it s just a very different way that we do it in china compared to in the us beyond 2021 look i think we re not going to make any decisions yet at the moment the only the commitments we ve made are what i just described to you and on that basis we will see a significant ramp down in capital if there s a word ramp down in capital spending in 2022 i think we reserve the right that if market conditions change if customers make appropriate commitments then there is a likelihood that we will move into more phases either of hydroxide or lithium carbonate but we re certainly not making that commitment today joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst just the way i interpret that so right now the 9 500 ton addition to carbonate 5 000 tons addition to hydroxide that s that will finish you may add a little bit more hydroxide in china or somewhere but other than that nothing is in the plan right now paul graves president and chief executive officer and another 9 500 tons of lithium carbonate the phase two in argentina so when we re done with this joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst 9 500 tons yeah paul graves president and chief executive officer yeah so compared to today we will have more than double the carbonate and we ll have about 10 000 tons more hydroxide joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst and so the first year you might get down if you don t do anything other than that the first year you might get down to like a true maintenance capital cost might be 23 million or where would that be paul graves president and chief executive officer yeah probably second half of 22 will be in that phase so on a full year basis 23 million correct joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst okay and just my other question was have you do you have a view on the new argentine export royalty are you assuming that gets regulated into law full time gilberto antoniazzi chief financial officer you must be referring to the one that the previous president has issued that s supposed to be finished joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst yeah gilberto antoniazzi chief financial officer yeah so that has this year to go still so we haven t heard anything different from what was said before joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst so in short term gilberto antoniazzi chief financial officer yes joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst thank you very much operator and that is all the time that we have for today this concludes the livent corporation fourth quarter

the guardians of the world economy are convening amid mounting fears that the coronavirus outbreak poses a greater threat to global growth than first envisaged finance ministers and central bankers from the group of 20 nations began meetings on saturday in the saudi capital of riyadh for the first time since the virus forced much of china to be quarantined and then began to spread the consensus of economists remains for a short term hit to demand in china and then globally followed by a rebound the international monetary fund reiterated this week that the worldwide expansion is set to moderately strengthen this year after being hurt in 2019 by the u s china trade war but we are also looking at more dire scenarios where the spread of the virus continues for longer and more globally and the growth consequences are more protracted imf managing director kristalina georgieva said in riyadh the fallout is growing given chinese factories are still operating around half their capacity and many workers remain housebound the partial shutdown of the world s second biggest economy is having an effect elsewhere by weakening trade fraying manufacturing supply chains reducing tourism and fanning investor uncertainty the world economy is facing a clear slowdown and this slowdown might be reinforced by the so called coronavirus french finance minister bruno le maire said in riyadh the question remains open whether it will be a v shape with a quick recovery of the world economy or whether it would lead to an l shape with a persistent slowdown in world growth he said the v shaped scenario was more likely other topics discussed by the g20 include the use of digital currencies the imposition of taxes on technology companies and money laundering a statement will be released by the hosts on sunday but the virus will dominate the debate already on course for its worst expansion in three decades some analysts now reckon the chinese economy will contract this quarter from the previous three months france italy and japan already did so at the end of last year the imf s baseline scenario is now for china s economy to expand 5 6 per cent this year 0 4 percentage point lower than forecast in the fund s january outlook which would shave 0 1 percentage point off global growth fresh data on friday underscored the reason for concern at the g20 meeting as u s business activity shrank for the first time since 2013 while manufacturing gauges in australia and japan weakened and early export orders for south korea showed a slump in chinese demand china reported car sales sank 92 per cent in the first half of february the euro area went against the trend though with activity accelerating at the fastest pace in six months in february economists at standard chartered plc said in a report on friday that the virus could end up affecting 42 per cent of china s economy as they also cut their forecast for global growth this year to three per cent from 3 2 per cent even worse would be an international pandemic defined as a disease spreading across multiple continents oxford economics ltd calculates such an event could slash world output by more than us 1 trillion if growth continues to slide a key question for the g20 will be whether its members can coordinate a response said tom orlik chief economist at bloomberg economics in washington against a backdrop of resurgent nationalism fractious trade disputes and limited policy space common purpose might be difficult to achieve some g20 policy makers are already responding china has led the way by cutting market interest rates and could take the bolder step of reducing reserve requirements central banks in indonesia mexico turkey and south africa have also cut rates this year governments in more than half of the g20 economies are easing budgets with south korean president moon jae in this week calling for an emergency prescription others are adopting a wait and see stance while federal reserve and european central bank officials are on the alert to the risks posed by the virus they have so far not signaled any intention to loosen monetary policy several fed officials this week said the virus should only have a short lived impact on the u s and won t require lower rates ecb chief economist philip lane told bloomberg television on friday that the base case is a v shape trajectory in activity a dilemma for policy makers is that although the imf s georgieva has suggested there may be a need for synchronized or even better coordinated measures central banks and governments lack ammunition given the low level of interest rates and high level of budget deficits one reason for confidence is that stock investors still seem to be betting on the rapid recovery the standard poor s 500 index is up four per cent this year and 22 per cent from a year ago and the broader msci world index has also climbed over the same timeframes such gains however are a concern to economists at citigroup inc in the advanced economies alone they say easy financial conditions point to growth of 2 6 per cent this year twice the pace they predict financial markets could be overconfident in expecting an economic recovery said pernille henneberg an economist at citigroup the global economy and financial markets have not seen the full impact of the coronavirus outbreak yet with assistance

the federal reserve s extraordinary policy moves over the last 12 years have marched arm in arm with the biggest bull market in wall street history but the central bank s economists say the two really have little in common as part of the ongoing discussion fed officials are having about the effectiveness of past policy and the proper path forward staff members last month presented their findings about the impact that low interest rates have had on asset prices which generally refer to things like stocks corporate debt and commercial real estate their conclusion the available empirical evidence suggests that the effects of changes in policy rates on asset prices and risk premiums tend to be modest relative to the historical fluctuations in those measures according to minutes released wednesday from the jan 28 29 meeting watch now that s contrary to the conventional street wisdom which ties the low rates and money printing to a market bull run that is less than a month away from its 11th anniversary but the analysis also reflects a tightrope fed officials are trying to walk in which they want to keep policy accommodative enough to maintain the economic expansion while not fueling bubbles what they re saying is rates have affected the economy but what they re not doing is causing the rampant speculation that you saw in the late 90s said doug roberts head of channel capital research it could happen but right now they re trying to prevent it still the idea that the relationship is tenuous between ultra easy policy zero policy rates that prevailed for seven years and nearly 4 trillion worth of quantitative easing and a more than 400 rise in the s p 500 is a tough sell putting blinders on every time the fed has tried to tighten policy the markets have recoiled and the fed has relented they think that valuations are justified because rates are so low said danielle dimartino booth who was an advisor to former dallas fed president richard fisher and now is ceo of quill intelligence at the risk of saying it s different this time i think the fed is not factoring in its own policy in its risk premium calculus indeed st louis fed president james bullard told cnbc on friday that he is not very concerned about where the market stands the s p 500 is trading at 19 times forward earnings compared with the 10 year average of 15 about a 27 premium we watch financial stability issues and bubble type issues very carefully bullard said during a squawk box interview i think that the conventional wisdom is valuations look high but not at this level of interest rates and so to the extent that you think this level of interest rates is probably the future which i have been arguing you re probably ok for now but booth said that adjusting earnings for the historically low interest rate environment actually does put valuations around the dot com bubble era of the late 1990s she credits fed chairman jerome powell with trying to stay ahead of runaway asset prices but said current policy doesn t leave enough room for the central bank in case of an economic downturn it doesn t really work well to put blinders on that s what it feels like officials are doing booth said with interest rates so low you wonder what the next shock to the system will be they re running out of ammunition powell tried to guide the fed back to a more normal state of affairs regarding interest rates but markets recoiled and he was forced to backtrack four rate hikes in 2018 sparked a wave of selling on wall street and the fed responded with three cuts last year and a resolve in 2020 to hold policy steady if anything markets are expecting more rate cuts rather than increases the fed has become the enabler for the markets said quincy krosby chief market strategist at prudential financial they wanted to raise rates in 2019 but they didn t they saw within a couple of weeks what was happening then what they did was create this buy on the dip mentality you re never able to get off it that s the dilemma for this policy the news is good the fed also tried to undo at least some of the qe bond purchases it conducted during and after the financial crisis by allowing a capped level of proceeds to roll off its balance sheet each month rather than being reinvested that too prompted a market recoil and the fed is again building up its holdings by buying short term treasury bills in an operation it insists is not a fourth round of qe there is an ongoing debate about whether the current balance sheet expansion different though it may be is helping push stocks higher fed officials contend that the most recent leg up for the market has been more about the dovish rate stance members adopted in 2019 others have argued that bond buying if nothing else acts as a signaling device for the market that the fed is going to keep policy accommodative when that stops market expectations change markets should be paying less attention to this balance sheet expansion said ethan harris global economist at bank of america global research despite a close correlation in the qe operations and the rise in the stock market the fed is now just acting to keep liquidity flowing in the banking system rather than to promote larger economic objectives outside of the money markets we suggest that investors put very little weight on the fed s balance sheet actions harris said in a note to clients focus instead on interest rate policy here the news is good the fed is clearly taking no risk of recession and will repeat last year s easing if the economy falters officials said at the january meeting that they will continue to monitor financial risks from their policies minutes said the members noted elevated asset valuations and pointed out that business debt to gdp was high by historical standards we have a world where equity valuations are what they are fed vice chairman richard clarida told cnbc s steve liesman in an interview thursday morning i think the overall picture is that financial stability risks are moderate but we are closely monitoring the financial system as we should

for questions patrick patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer thank you bill and good morning everyone barnes group wrapped up 2019 with evidence that the power of our ongoing transformation has indeed changed the company for the better in a year where several of our industrial markets were soft excellent performance in our aerospace business helped barnes group to deliver record operating profit on total sales that were slightly lower than 2018 s record level across the company the barnes team navigated the choppiness and delivered adjusted earnings that were among the best achieved in the company s long history the results are a testament to our talented management team an engaged workforce and the barnes enterprise system which provides a solid bedrock to our operations for the fourth quarter sales decreased 4 both total and organic adjusted operating income increased 8 over last year s result while operating margin improved 190 basis points to 17 2 adjusted earnings per share were 0 86 up 2 from 0 84 last year looking at the full year sales were down slightly from a year ago with organic sales down 2 adjusted operating income was a record 244 million given the year s challenged industrial top line this represent solid performance adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points to 16 4 and adjusted earnings per share were 3 21 ending the year at the midpoint of our previous guidance let s move now to a discussion on the current business environment and a high level view of what 2020 may look like at industrial full year 2019 organic sales declined 8 while book to bill was just under 1 times select end markets remained stubbornly soft given persistent economic and trade uncertainties leading to deferred new program launches by customers in several of our industrial businesses at molding solutions 2019 organic sales declined 8 and as we ve seen for a few quarters now automotive hot runners personal care and packaging end markets have been weak medical molds on the other hand continue to see strong demand in fact our manner business saw record revenues for both the fourth quarter and full year relative to the five years of barnes ownership for 2020 we anticipate molding solutions organic growth to be up mid single digits primarily driven by sustained medical mold demand and some stabilization in automotive markets particularly new program releases in north america one word of caution we do anticipate the first quarter being down versus the prior year period with sequential improvement beginning in the second quarter at force motion control organic sales declined 7 in 2019 as mentioned previously tool die product lines which serve a wide range of metal forming end markets have been down while industrial markets have performed better for 2020 we see mid single digit organic growth with q1 at the run rate of the last couple of quarters after that we expect to see incremental improvement and the benefit of favorable comps moving to engineered components organic sales declined 9 driven by lingering weakness in auto production 2019 saw global auto production declining approximately 6 with reductions experienced across each of our major geographic regions the expectation for global auto production growth in 2020 is flat and given what s happening in china at present with the coronavirus outbreak i suspect that outlook might deteriorate while manufacturing pmis for the u s and china are above 50 and showed positive momentum exiting 2019 europe remains weak during the fourth quarter we announced the divestiture of our seeger business based in germany with the transaction closing in early february seeger is a leading brand of quality retaining and snap ring primarily serving automotive end markets i would like to thank all the employees at seeger orbis for their many contributions to barnes group and wish them continued success and growth in the future the impact of this divestiture on 2020 sales for our engineered components sku is about 60 million and with that we anticipate about 0 10 of foregone eps contribution for engineered components we expect 2020 organic sales to decline mid single digits at automation reduced robotics demand in germany and china coupled with customers deferring new program launches led to slower than anticipated growth in 2019 for the long term we see automation end market is poised for growth as the adoption as the outlook for adoption rates of robotics remains very favorable to aid further advances in industrial productivity for 2020 we anticipate high single digit organic growth driven by geographic expansion the build out of adjacent end markets and the leveraging of our molding solutions customer relations in 2020 as we continue to execute our vision of being a global leader of highly engineered products differentiated industrial technologies and innovative solutions we plan to make incremental investments of approximately 5 million in accelerating and capitalizing on our innovation efforts under the leadership of our chief technology officer pat hurley we will further advance our engineering development approach by expanding our applied and fundamental research capabilities and scientific resources creating a full spectrum of innovation to exceed our customers expectations and needs for the future initial focus will be on our industrial businesses and four key technology platforms materials software hardware and sensors each of which will be instrumental to the future success of the company these combined technologies will be at the core of the next generation of products and services we bring to market we re excited about these investments and believe they are the next logical step in the execution of our profitable growth strategy for 2020 at industrial our sales outlook is for low single digit organic revenue growth operating margin is expected to be around 12 to 14 given the incremental innovation investments before i move on to our aerospace discussion i would like to take a moment to welcome steve moule to barnes group as president of our industrial segment steve brings extensive experience in driving performance within diversified industrial businesses he is a strong leader who has successfully developed high performance teams with an operating system focus steve s skill set coupled with our barnes enterprise system sets up heightened expectations for our industrial segment moving now to our aerospace business aerospace delivered an excellent 2019 inclusive of continuing solid performance in the fourth quarter with strong oem and aftermarket sales in fact for 14 consecutive quarters now we ve seen year over year sales growth with eight quarters showing double digit increases continuation of this strong performance led to record sales and operating profit in 2019 for the quarter total aerospace sales were up 8 with oem and aftermarket both seeing an increase operating margin was once again solid up 230 basis points from a year ago to 22 3 as we look to the future certainly the biggest story in commercial aviation is the boeing 737 max production stop and the timing of its return to service for us the 737 max is a good platform helping to support growth in our oem business that said on a relative basis it s not our largest program and while we previously noted a slowing production line not having the meaningful effect on our oem expectations the current situation is more impactful our view on the 737 max as you would expect is not unlike what you ve heard from our customers boeing and ge this program will weigh on our oem growth expectation in 2020 as their return to service is not expected until mid year as such we anticipate our shipments on this platform to decline by approximately 50 this year impacting revenues by about 20 million the loss contribution of those sales will also serve to dampen earnings growth clearly this is a fluid situation with multiple complexities and the impact of all of this is expected to become more apparent in the coming months as the situation is resolved we will be prepared to reramp as required by our customers as to whether the current oem environment provide some offset in the aftermarket certainly the current fleet is being worked harder and that may provide some aftermarket benefit so keep in mind with the heightened utilization of existing aircraft they re just not coming out of service for aftermarket support at the level you would expect all in as we now look to our expectations for 2020 we expect oem sales to be relatively flat compared to 2019 as a result of the 737 max and in the aftermarket we forecast both mro and spare parts to be up low to mid single digits one final point on aerospace our estimates of oem sales per aircraft for our major programs are unchanged from our prior view before concluding my remarks i would be remiss not to acknowledge the serious public health concern playing out with respect to the coronavirus outbreak our primary concern relates to the safety and welfare of our associates in china and around the world we have temporarily suspended all travel for our entire workforce in and out of china and while our manufacturing facilities were closed for an extended period of time they are slowly coming back online at this point we are monitoring the situation daily for new developments and any additional government mandates at present we see potential risk revenue potential revenue risk in the first quarter of 10 million to 15 million so in conclusion 2019 presented us with a number of challenges in our industrial business while aerospace experienced sustained strength throughout the year the barnes team definitely navigated through the choppy environment to improve both operating profits and margin by leveraging the barnes enterprise system through our three pronged focus on commercial financial and operational excellence we look forward to another good year in 2020 and as always we remain committed to driving value for our many stakeholders now let me turn the call over to chris for a discussion on the financial details christopher j stephens senior vice president finance chief financial officer all right thank you patrick and good morning everyone let me begin with highlights on our fourth quarter results on slide 4 of our supplement fourth quarter sales were 370 million down 4 from the prior year period with organic sales declining 4 acquisition sales contributed 1 while fx negatively impacted sales by 1 operating income was 61 million versus 52 million a year ago on an adjusted basis operating income was 64 million up 8 from last year s fourth quarter adjusted operating margin increased 190 basis points reaching 17 2 net income was 41 million or 0 80 per diluted share compared to 39 million or 0 75 per diluted share a year ago on an adjusted basis net income per share of 0 86 was up 2 from 0 84 a year ago adjusted net income per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2019 excludes a 0 05 adjustment related to the finalization of gimatic short term purchase accounting and 0 11 non cash impairment charge related to the divestiture of seeger both in our industrial segment moving now to our 2019 full year highlights on slide 4 5 sorry of our supplement 2019 sales were 1 5 billion down slightly from the prior year as organic sales were down 2 acquisitions provided a 4 sales lift while unfavorable fx was 2 operating income was a record 236 million versus 232 million a year ago on an adjusted basis operating income of 244 million versus 240 million last year was up 2 adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points to 16 4 for the year interest expense was approximately 21 million an increase of 4 million primarily as a result of increased borrowings partially offset by the impact of lower average interest rates our effective tax rate in 2019 was 23 4 compared with 19 9 a year ago with most of the increase due to the absence of adjustments to certain valuation reserves and final adjustments related to u s tax reform for 2019 net income was 158 million or 3 07 per diluted share compared to 166 million or 3 15 per diluted share a year ago on an adjusted basis net income per share was 3 21 approximately flat to last year full year cash provided by operating activities was 248 million versus 237 million in 2018 in the third quarter of 2019 the company made a discretionary 15 million u s pension contribution which reduced full year operating cash flow clearly we continue to generate solid cash flows from our businesses with working capital a good story in 2019 free cash flow was 195 million compared to 180 million last year capital expenditures were 53 million down 4 million from a year ago and adjusted cash conversion of 119 was an excellent result with respect to the balance sheet our debt to ebitda ratio was 2 4 times down from 2 5 times at the end of the third quarter under our existing debt covenants additional borrowings of approximately 300 million of senior debt would have been allowed at quarter end our full year average diluted shares outstanding was 51 6 million shares we did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter for the full year we did repurchased 900 000 shares at a cost of 50 million there remains 4 1 million shares available for repurchase under the board s 2019 stock repurchase authorization let s now move to our segment performance beginning with industrial for the fourth quarter sales were 231 million down 9 from last year organic sales decreased 10 primarily due to the softness in certain end markets unfavorable fx decreased sales by 1 while acquisition revenues contributed 2 fourth quarter operating profit was 30 million up 14 from the prior year period excluding a short term purchase accounting true up adjustment for gimatic and a non cash impairment charge related to the seeger divestiture adjusted operating profit was 32 million versus 33 million a year ago adjusted operating margin was 14 1 up a 120 basis points driven by solid productivity gains for the full year sales were 939 million down 6 from last year organic sales were down 8 acquisitions contributed 5 while fx was unfavorable at 3 operating profit of 114 million was down 13 and on an adjusted basis operating profit was 122 million down 12 from 2018 adjusted operating margin declined 90 basis points to 13 at aerospace fourth quarter sales were a 139 million up 8 oem sales increased 7 while aftermarket sales increased 10 with mro up 12 and spares up 7 operating profit was 31 million up 21 primarily reflecting the profit impact of higher sales volumes operating margin was 22 3 up 230 basis points full year 2019 sales were a record 553 million up 10 while operating profit was a record 122 million up 21 as a result operating margin improved 200 basis points to 22 2 another great year for our aerospace team aerospace oem backlog ended the year at 801 million down 1 from the end of the third quarter of 2019 the company expects to ship approximately 50 of this backlog over the next 12 months turning to our 2020 outlook on slide 6 of our supplement we expect organic sales to be up 1 to 3 for the year with total revenue down slightly as a result of the seeger divestiture which has a 4 impact fx is not expected to have a meaningful impact operating margin is forecasted to be between 16 and 17 adjusted eps is expected to be in the range of 3 12 and 3 32 down 3 to up 3 from 2019 s adjusted earnings of 3 21 per share please keep in mind that the divestiture of the seeger business innovation investments lower 737 max deliveries and a 2 million pension headwind have been incorporated into our 2020 expectations also we do see a higher weighting of adjusted eps in the second half with a 45 first half 55 second half split in particular we see the first quarter of 2020 being approximately 0 05 lower than last year s first quarter adjusted eps of 0 71 per share a few other outlook items interest expense is anticipated to be approximately 17 million other expense approximately 7 million an effective tax rate of 24 to 24 5 excluding seeger divestiture taxes capex of approximately 60 million average diluted shares of approximately 51 million shares and again this year cash conversion of greater than 100 for modeling purposes one item to note we anticipate approximately a 5 million charge related to the seeger sale primarily related to taxes which will occur in the first quarter this charge worth approximately 0 10 will be excluded from our adjusted earnings and after tax cash proceeds from the sale will primarily be used to reduce debt lastly turning now to slide 7 let s discuss an update of our three year financial targets introduced at our 2017 investor day relative to our 2017 view we ve seen a stronger aerospace oem and aftermarket an improved view of the medical molds business benefits of global tax management actions and the benefit of incremental share repurchases to the downside automotive end markets remain weak there is a heightened level of uncertainty weighing in on global trade and we see the china economy and its contribution to our growth slowing in addition a lower production level in 2020 for the 737 max aircraft will have an impact taken together our current view which excludes the impact of our recent acquisitions as well as the u s tax reform benefit has us generating 2020 three year organic sales cagar of flat to up to 1 adjusted operating margins of 16 to 17 and adjusted three year eps cagr in the range of 4 to 5 our cash conversion target of greater than 100 remains unchanged while our roic target is expected to be approximately 9 we do plan on hosting another investor day this year on september 24th in new york city details will be forthcoming over the next few months so in summary we delivered overall solid performance in the face of some persistent headwinds in 2019 strong cash flow generation with excellent cash conversion coupled with a well positioned balance sheet allow for ongoing investments in innovation and growth that will help propel barnes group forward as we execute on our value creation strategy sharon let s open the call for questions questions and answers operator first question comes from myles walton with ubs myles walton ubs analyst thanks good morning just wondering if i could start with the free cash flow free cash flow chris so the 195 million in 2019 included that 50 million discretionary contribution as you look to 2020 any reason why operating cash flow can t be as good or better in 2020 just maybe talk about some of the moving parts on working capital if any christopher j stephens senior vice president finance chief financial officer sure so a good question so we when we look at 2019 clearly good strides in working capital reduction when you kind of net out the pension contribution we don t expect any meaningful pension contribution as we look to 2020 right now so nothing leads us to believe that we wouldn t continue to work on working capital reduction throughout 2020 and be able to provide a meaningful number probably consistent with if not somewhat better than our 19 performance myles walton ubs analyst okay and then on the investment that you re making on the industrial side 5 million on the basis of an r d base i think it s like 15 million today i don t know that 5 million investment you re talking about is all r d qualified but maybe just talk about the level of sustainability of that investment and what kind of pay off you think from an acceleration of growth that you ll get in 21 and beyond patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer so myles this is patrick and the investment is in line with our ongoing strategy with respect to differentiating ourselves clearly from the competition around the products and services that we bring to market the 5 million right now is aligned out for this year in terms of the addition of resources in terms of new levels of talent from an engineering and a scientific standpoint the emphasis that we re clearly targeting is materials hardware and software and sensors those four areas of technology the intent been that as we continue to differentiate our goal is to create a full spectrum of innovation that will go above and beyond meeting our customers expectations we think we re really nicely placed in the market relative to being in a position to truly become a solution to some of the current concerns within the plastics industry on the materials side as an example we re developing new materials and working with people that are developing those materials to process biodegradable polymers as an example which will be the next generation of earth friendly polymers on the hardware and software side what we re looking at is how to make barnes group and our in particular our molding solutions business even more relevant in terms of the products that we bring to market and that s based around data analytics advanced algorithms artificial intelligence just to name a few the investment is a long term investment we expect that we re going to continue to invest in these types of technologies for the coming years and the returns are expected to translate into the coming years with the products and services that we ll bring to market myles walton ubs analyst okay and so just to be clear this kind of is a step up it s not a one time investment it s kind of an elevated investment going forward we should think about and then in that context i guess back at the analyst day the targeted margin for industrial i think was around 18 to 19 or at the low end of that 18 to 19 i guess on a combined basis and now we re looking for 12 to 14 in 2020 and obviously a lot has happened but maybe just to look forward what is the what s the run rate on this business that we should think about as you get your footing back ex seeger and with these investments fully loaded patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer yeah so if you think about our industrial business over the last year we ve been targeting the mid teens and if you look at the innovation that i highlighted in terms of the 5 million and back that out it would put us back in the mid teens as we move forward we re going to continue to push toward the high teens as a goal for our industrial businesses and so we have not come off that as an internal goal and one which the teams collectively are focused on myles walton ubs analyst okay thank you patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer thank you christopher j stephens senior vice president finance chief financial officer thank you miles operator next question comes from pete skibitski with alembic global pete skibitski alembic global advisors analyst hey good morning guys patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer hey good morning pete christopher j stephens senior vice president finance chief financial officer good morning pete pete skibitski alembic global advisors analyst nice job on the margins and the cash flow again for sure i guess patrick just on the aero oem backlog as you look forward in 2020 certainly you had the max headwinds but with the 800 million in backlog and your comment about 50 of that being delivered this year just my math indicates that s pretty much all of your oem revenue 400 million or so so do you have essentially a 100 visibility right now in 2020 on the aero oem side patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer i think we have a lot of visibility and the 400 million that you referenced which is half 50 of the 800 million backlog is you know in the right ballpark pertaining to our oem business the aspect that has a lot of uncertainty and it is as i mentioned is 737 max and there you know there are many moving parts and none more so than the fact that what will happen on the corresponding airbus a320 neo side of the equation and if that might represent upside so all in we feel confident in terms of our aerospace oem business yes unfortunately due to current circumstances with the max see it has been relatively flat for the year pete skibitski alembic global advisors analyst yeah ok and then i did want to ask about the aftermarket as well and i know you touched on it in your opening remarks but from the standpoint of the grounding of all these chinese flights and now iata is predicting i think lower airline revenue are you have you started to see some headwinds to aftermarket just from fewer plane flying and are you thinking about that at all into 2020 patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer it hasn t translated into what we re seeing in terms of incoming orders pete so and clearly it s another new factor that s entered into the equation the as i said aircraft utilization around the rest of the globe continues to be pretty robust in fact with the with the delays around the max the current fleet continues to stay in the air even longer perhaps than what would be the norm so with all of those what we continue to watch very closely is incoming orders within our mro business which are very short lead time as you know and orders there have continued to be strong pete skibitski alembic global advisors analyst okay that s great that s great just one last one for me just switching to the divestiture of seeger maybe i missed it but can you give us your rationale for the divestiture maybe just want a less exposure to automotive production i m not sure and margin wise the way i did the math it looked like kind of maybe low double digit type margins there and just maybe how much cash you received for the sale given its closed now patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer yeah so basically as we continue to execute the strategy as we ve communicated i think very clearly the emphasis is to continue to transform the portfolio in 2019 our two major efforts were one on the integration of gimatic and two the divestiture of our seeger business and the seeger business was a great business overall as we moved forward we felt that it would be better served under a new owner that focus primarily into the end markets that seeger serves which is primarily automotive whilst we continue to support the automotive industry we are looking continually to differentiate ourselves in terms of our offerings and so as we move forward the transformation of the portfolio is something that we are keenly keenly focused on moving toward more intellectual property moving more toward enabling technologies and as we continue to raise the bar we ll continue to challenge each of our businesses to step up to that new level of performance christopher j stephens senior vice president finance chief financial officer yeah and pete maybe maybe i ll add what i ll add is on the financial side just and we ll disclose this since we closed it in the first quarter you ll see that in our q for the first quarter it is roughly that the headline price is around 47 million u s for the business we re going to get after tax cash proceeds roughly 36 million that we ll used to reduce debt it is from an ebitda margin point of view relative to the company s average less than our ebitda margin but the business is sizable enough not as large to kind of move the needle but to patrick s point happy to get the transaction done and conclude on that and continue to execute on our strategy pete skibitski alembic global advisors analyst appreciate all the color guys thanks christopher j stephens senior vice president finance chief financial officer yeah thanks patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer thank you pete operator next question comes from edward marshall with sidoti company edward marshall jr sidoti company analyst good morning good morning patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer good morning ed edward marshall jr sidoti company analyst i want to look looking at the divestiture of seeger and then the mix of business improvement that you anticipate for 2020 even adding back that 5 million of r d i would have thought the margin swing would have been a little bit higher than the 12 to 14 that you re guiding and then for the full business it looks like you re maybe you can just provide the operating profit margin in aero that you anticipate on the same kind of context that you gave us for industrial patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer yeah so with respect to aerospace we are targeting the 21 22 range for the full year again that will that could improve depending on the mix between aftermarket and oem but with everything we see at this moment we think that s a good range on the industrial side clearly the team did a really nice job if you look back at 2019 what we saw was a slower start to the year in terms of margins but with a nice sequential improvement for the first three quarters so you saw 10 5 12 3 15 for the first three quarters sequentially and then the fourth quarter came in at 14 so on an adjusted basis as we look into 2020 what i would say is that as noted some of the challenges that we re experiencing right now in the first quarter primarily coming out of asia is putting some pressure on will put some pressure on margins in the first quarter as i highlighted we re thinking right now with the best information we have about a 10 million to 15 million revenue impact out of our asian businesses and that coupled with basically just a slower start to the year i think what you re going to see is the same trend throughout the year a sequential improvement in margins quarter to quarter but with the investments we re making we put a range on that of the 12 to 14 the one area that i think i give the team tremendous credit for last year and i think they re just equally is focused on this year is productivity and that in itself i think through the barnes enterprise system continues to offer upside to those ranges given edward marshall jr sidoti company analyst got it and remind me again the mix of remind me where you re concentrated in the in asia i know it s asia auto but what else might be in there in the different business segments just remind me patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer so you re talking about our business in asia is about 10 of barnes group total and the primary businesses in there are molding solution in the form of molds and our automotive hot runners and fmc in terms of the tool die primarily through the nitrogen gas products spring products edward marshall jr sidoti company analyst got it so there is some higher margin stuff in there so really if i step back i just look at it so you re seeing some caution into the first quarter that s kind of laying up the guidance for the full year it doesn t seem like there s been much deterioration if any in the aerospace side it s just it s just really around the first quarter caution that you re kind of spelling out here patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer that s true and the other really bright spot is our medical end market demand what i know which i think is also another bright spot from our perspective is that we monitor as you can imagine ahead of orders is the quoting activity and what we saw in quoting activity in personal care packaging and medical molds was the strong fourth quarter and that heightened level of activity continuing into january so while what we ve seen in 2019 is a little bit of a pause in those end markets as a result of pending regulations but as i highlighted those regulations from our vantage point is something to be embraced because ultimately what it s going to drive is an emphasis on newer materials newer way of processing those materials and that goes hand in hand with the innovation that investment we re making as i highlighted around the materials the hardware software which is the mechanism by which you control the flow of the material and then sensor technology and as you know we acquired priamus a couple of years ago and now under our cto he is even more excited about where we can take that sensor technology edward marshall jr sidoti company analyst got it got it and i guess want to know if there is any change in the collection of receivables from your key customer on aerospace if you ve been able to kind of it doesn t seem like there is but i just want to double check patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer no no major change ed no significant change there edward marshall jr sidoti company analyst got it and then finally chris what s a good number for interest expense for with all the debt reduction and so forth what do you think 2020 looks like christopher j stephens senior vice president finance chief financial officer roughly 17 million is what is kind of what we look at for the full year 2020 right edward marshall jr sidoti company analyst got it thanks very much christopher j stephens senior vice president finance chief financial officer yeah thank you patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer thank ed operator next question comes from michael ciarmoli with suntrust michael ciarmoli suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hey good morning guys patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer good morning mike michael ciarmoli suntrust robinson humphrey analyst nice quarter patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer thank you michael ciarmoli suntrust robinson humphrey analyst just on the aerospace the spares the aftermarket spares growth only 7 year over year it was one of the easier comps you had all year i think you re only lapping a 12 the environment is good but i guess maybe if you saw any changes in the trends there and thinking about as we move into this first quarter does that 10 million to 15 million revenue headwind you contemplated does that include any potential aerospace aftermarket disruption from maybe some of these asian china carriers if they are seeing dramatically reduce traffic or if they pull back dramatically on their spending patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer the short answer is no relative to the 10 million to 15 million in corporate managing from the aerospace side of the equation so 10 million to 15 million is truly what we re seeing relative to our businesses that are located in china and have been subject to the closures that i mentioned and even as we speak are only slowly coming back online michael ciarmoli suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay okay and then any color on just the spares level of growth anything that you saw different in the fourth quarter or has it still been pretty steady because even on an absolute revenue dollar it did dip sequentially there patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer yeah well i think as i mentioned within aerospace right now we ve seen 14 consecutive quarters of year over year growth and what it is is that the rfps have been a key part of that and they have performed extremely well over the last few years so each year as we enter we revert back to what we see as the normalized growth rate of the shop visits that are driving those spares requirements and that s primarily the cfm56 and the cf6 engine models and so there when we look outward for the cfm we use a mid single digits growth rate as was is our benchmark if you like we clearly outstripped that and outperform that over the last couple of years but again the question becomes how many times can you lap it by double digits and so we ve been somewhat conservative and taken our low to mid single digit outlook both for spare parts and mro but as you know it s a very short visibility short lead time business so and as has been highlighted on this call a number of moving parts in the aftermarket that probably tend to have us be a little bit more cautious than bullish push in our outlook and in terms of percentage growth michael ciarmoli suntrust robinson humphrey analyst got it that s helpful and then just maybe one more on aero you clearly talked about the max impact and how much revenue you re taken out there what are the thoughts on the 787 reduction i think based on your most recent deck it s about 200 000 of content there does that start to show up this year or is that going to be more of a 21 impact and then even i guess tying in with the max volume reduction and maybe even a 787 does that does that complicate anything on driving that working capital down patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer it s not necessarily we don t necessarily see it as a complication and not that meaningful if you like in terms of the reduction that s taken place so we re confident that we can with the rest of the mix of everything we have both commercial and on the defense side that we can make up the any shortfall that may filter into the system from the 787 what the team has continued to do is streamline the whole process of npi within our aerospace business and to that end they feel very confident that they have enough new developments which is alternatives to existing manufacturing processes that are being used today they re very keenly focused on differentiating themselves by employing newer technologies that can differentiate even on existing platforms and put us in a great place as we continue to move forward so a lot of good things happening there that i think overall the guidance includes the outlook the 787 which you highlighted but also note that the 777x which was the spin off to a slow start is also forecasted to come online toward the end of the year into the new year michael ciarmoli suntrust robinson humphrey analyst got it no that s helpful and then maybe chris i ll just i ll try one year i don t want to put words in your mouth but i ll try anyway the september 17 operating margin target of 18 to 19 if i assume some sustaining investment maybe that s a 50 bps hit has anything in your view structurally changed obviously end markets aside anything that you guys looking at today that would prevent you from driving those same margins and again obviously if aero aftermarket were to rollover or something change but just as you re looking at the company today structurally has anything changed in your view to achieve those margins christopher j stephens senior vice president finance chief financial officer yeah no very good question i look at as we look at 2020 targets and we communicated kind of an update last year taking a look at this year we understand the implications of global trade uncertainties when we identified i ll call it drivers in terms of the upside and the downside it really for the most part are things that were market driven i ll call it out of our control somewhat clearly the tax actions we ve taken globally and the incremental share repurchase helps but getting back to the margin profile that was the that was the big driver you had the aerospace upside which provided a little bit lift to exceed our expectations of what we thought back in 2017 but the bigger drag was the implications of industrial specifically global trade uncertainty lately obviously with china so as we look to 2020 you kind of put those aside there was nothing necessarily that leads us to believe that we cannot continue to drive this company to a high high teens operating margin we do and as i did mentioned we do plan on having another investor day in september and a lot of obviously preparation will be done through that we re going to have our strategic planning reviews with our with our teams in the may june timeframe leading up to the september view but we re anxiously looking forward to that because we ve made a lot of transition with the portfolio over the past three years and we plan on putting out another three years so those are the main drivers michael ciarmoli suntrust robinson humphrey analyst got it perfect thanks guys christopher j stephens senior vice president finance chief financial officer thank you thanks mike patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer thank you operator we have a question from tim wojs with baird please go ahead timothy wojs robert w baird analyst hey guys good morning patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer good morning tim christopher j stephens senior vice president finance chief financial officer good morning timothy wojs robert w baird analyst maybe just the first one is a housekeeping question chris do you have the sbu growth rates by for the fourth quarter for the industrial businesses christopher j stephens senior vice president finance chief financial officer sure so from a fourth quarter point of view overall growth this is going to be a quarter over quarter look so our engineered components business was down 14 our force motion control business was down 10 and molding solutions was down it was down 11 and i will comment although we don t have comps because of the timing of when we bought gimatic but as we communicated last quarter that we expected gimatic to hit 55 million in revenue that s what they were able to achieve in the fourth quarter so for industrial overall it represents a on an absolute basis not so much organic 9 down timothy wojs robert w baird analyst okay christopher j stephens senior vice president finance chief financial officer is that helpful yeah timothy wojs robert w baird analyst yeah no no very much thank you and then just on the automotive programs and some of the new programs that are out there what type of visibility do you have to those happening in i guess 2020 just in terms of timelines is it is it kind of fluid between quarters and the commitments are there for the year how would you kind of describe the visibility there on the molding solutions piece patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer so tim i d say it s a combination of all of what you ve just highlighted which is that there are certain programs that are moving to the right in terms of being delayed while others have been launched and so between our businesses what are keeping very close tabs on is communication with the customers around the world because our businesses are such that one of the great advantages they have is that they can serve as a given customer anywhere in the world so we have that global footprint in that regard so what we re doing is we re keeping tabs at the headquarters of the oes as well as in the local regional areas and what ultimately translates is that any particular program is timed to launch it could launch in one region before another and then flow out and so there is an aspect of it s dynamic but overall we ve seen some nice green shoots in terms of north america over 2019 and we expect that to continue we also feel there s a little bit of pent up demand because if you consider all of the factors that are in play where not only existing models requiring refreshes which drives demand for our automotive hot runners but then also as the move to electrification and hybrids each of those comes with a new model configuration which drives demand not only for our molding solutions business but also then for our fmc so overall from an industry standpoint we think a great step in the right direction was the signing of the trade agreement in the first quarter in january between the u s and china not so much because it lifted the tariffs immediately but more because it sent a clear signal of alleviating some of the business uncertainty and that progress has been made and i think that gives you know comfort into the industry that we re moving forward timothy wojs robert w baird analyst okay okay great good luck to 2020 thanks for the time patrick j dempsey president and chief executive officer thank you christopher j stephens senior vice president finance chief financial officer thank you tim operator at this time i ll turn the call back over to mr pitts william e pitts director investor relations thank you sharon we would like to thank all of you for joining us this morning and we look

i look forward to continuing to collaborate with him at the board level chip lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer thanks jack and good afternoon everyone i ll begin by discussing our business results for the fourth quarter and full year and then review our outlook for 2020 for the fourth quarter net sales were 1 4 billion up 8 compared to the same period last year comparable store sales were 1 5 with the continued upward trend in the two year stack to 3 8 the non perishable categories were strong and we experienced the benefits of driving the right holiday trends early in the season like the expansion of our vegan and plant based holiday meals and sides for the fourth quarter gross profit increased by 11 to 469 million and our gross margin rate was 34 4 an increase of 120 basis points when compared to the same period last year while we were cycling tailwinds from deep promotions in the fourth quarter of 2018 our early efforts to balance our price position comp and improve margins paid off in the fourth quarter despite experiencing some early margin wins our traffic was still slightly negative as 2020 progresses the correct balance of driving comp and traffic while continuing to stabilize margins will remain a focus area for the team sg a increased 10 to 387 million or 28 4 of sales compared to 27 8 in the same period last year 35 basis points of this deleverage is from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard the remaining deleverage is due to higher healthcare costs the expansion of our home delivery program ongoing strategy work and cycling the california payroll tax benefit in 2018 for the fourth quarter our depreciation and amortization costs increased 10 to 31 million or 2 2 of sales an increase of five basis points compared to the same period last year store closure and other costs were 3 9 million mainly related to the noncash impairment of three stores our interest expense was 5 million for the quarter our earnings before taxes was 42 million an increase of 27 when compared to adjusted earnings before taxes in the same period last year our effective tax rate was 24 fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was 0 27 compared to diluted earnings per share of 0 10 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of 0 19 in the same period last year for fiscal year 2019 net sales grew to 5 6 billion up 8 gross profit increased 8 to 1 9 billion resulting in a gross margin rate of 33 6 an increase of approximately five basis points compared to 2018 mainly attributed to the more thoughtful promotional approach in the fourth quarter of 2019 sg a increased 10 to 1 5 billion an increase of 50 basis points to 27 5 of sales compared to last year 35 basis points of this deleverage is from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard the remaining deleverage is attributed to investments in new stores expansion of our home delivery program higher healthcare costs and increased credit card fees partially offset by increased rent credits during the year our interest expense was 21 million and our adjusted earnings before taxes was 197 million a decrease of 5 when compared to adjusted earnings before taxes in 2018 our effective tax rate was 24 for fiscal year 2019 diluted earnings per share was 1 25 compared to diluted earnings per share of 1 22 in 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share was 1 25 compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of 1 29 last year as a reminder the lease accounting standard resulted in a net incremental expense of 0 04 per share for fiscal 2019 shifting to the balance sheet and liquidity for 2019 we generated strong cash flow from operations of 355 million up 21 for the year the robust cash generation this business produces continues to support and self fund our unit growth and sales initiatives we invested 157 million in capital expenditures net of landlords reimbursements primarily for new stores for the fiscal year we opened 28 new stores and closed 1 ending the year with 340 stores in 22 states during the year we also repurchased 7 95 million shares for a total investment of 176 million we ended 2019 with 85 million in cash and cash equivalents and 538 million borrowed on our 700 million revolving credit facility reflective of a strong balance sheet we continue to maintain a low debt position ending the year with a net debt to ebitda ratio of 1 4 times now let me turn to our outlook for 2020 two items to point out one 2020 will be a 53 week year with the extra week falling in the fourth quarter the company estimates the impact for the 53rd week to be approximately 120 million in total sales 9 million in earnings before taxes and 0 06 in diluted earnings per share and two though we are encouraged by our fourth quarter results and are optimistic about the direction we are heading our strategic work is still ongoing therefore this outlook only factors our current business and does not factor any potential strategic changes for fiscal 2020 on a 52 week basis we expect net sales to grow 5 5 to 6 5 comps to be in the 0 to 1 range ebt to be 187 million to 197 million diluted earnings per share between 1 17 and 1 23 and an effective tax rate of 26 we expect our 2020 capex spend to be between 120 million and 130 million net of landlord reimbursements this is slightly lower than previous years due to opening fewer stores we anticipate opening approximately 20 stores in 2020 a few other items to note we expect gross margins to be slightly positive for the full year with more benefit expected during the first three quarters sg a will continue to be pressured from occupancy e commerce and labor and benefits we expect to utilize our strong cash generation to invest in our business and to pay down a portion of our revolver debt quarter to date we ve paid down 50 million on our credit facility and expect an additional 50 million to 60 million paydown before the end of q1 for the first quarter we expect comps to be in the 0 to 1 range and diluted earnings per share between 0 45 and 0 47 it has been a delight to serve as interim cfo during this transitional time period and work directly with jack as he leads our company and strategy moving forward i am confident to hand the reins of cfo over to denise whose knowledge and expertise in retail will help keep the business moving in the right direction now back to jack jack sinclair chief executive officer thanks chip over the last several months we challenged ourselves to make key fundamental shifts in how we run our business leading to some early signs of improvement during the fourth quarter we refined and balanced our promotional strategies to target our core customer and eliminate inefficient promotions to be clear we re still promoting and providing value to our customers but we re doing so differently we focused our promotional activity by responding to opportunities in the marketplace rather than reacting to promotional pricing elsewhere resulting in improved cost of merchandise we focused our display and presentation in store on items that differentiate us in the marketplace and provide uniqueness to the customer if the composition if the competition zigged we zagged in our core fresh categories we focused less on commodities and more on our strengths in assortment on apples we promoted unique varieties like lucy glo at the holidays we focused on greater attribute driven products like no antibiotic of our turkeys rather than commodity items this has been a profitable change and we re exploring how to develop this approach even more broadly across our portfolio we are becoming the platform for innovation where our vendors come to us first because we can move quickly to put new healthy products in our stores we ve implemented new initiatives to accelerate our innovation pipeline like our innovation summits targeting emerging brands and our new think tank panel comprised of partners in the industry that incubate start up brands these programs led to successes in our grocery aisle with the addition of pipcorn packed with nutrients and taste and van leeuwen oat milk vegan ice cream all these changes have created a platform from which we can build our brand can and will be known as a treasure hunt for healthy eating across this country enhanced cross collaboration has helped teams work together to better plan and source our products we reorganized our produce buying group to enhance our vendor partnerships increasing availability to sprouts and improving our costs these improved vendor relationships allowed us to highlight driscoll s sweetest batch blueberries which are bigger and sweeter increasing sales in the fourth quarter all these changes resulted in meaningful differences in how we promote price and source our goods and we did this all the while driving gross margins contributing to much of the quarter s success this progress and the team environment we created resonated across the entire organization and across the store portfolio as a result we re making progress across the country the east coast division opened half our new stores in 2019 and with relatively new leadership the results were commendable both florida and georgia improved their store operations and georgia greatly improved their financial position which had been lagging in past years and that s a testament to focused leadership with a clear set of priorities we plan to build on this success as both florida and georgia provide growth opportunities for the future a restructured store bonus plan laser focused on what our store team members can control has proved to be a successful incentive driving sales and engaging team members across the organization in 2019 we completed the production planning phase of fim resulting in workflow improvement better curation of assortment and a reduction in shrink in our fresh departments we also entered the second phase of fim deploying computer assisted ordering which when completed will provide fresher product to our customers improve sales floor conditions and reduce unproductive inventory additionally we completed industrial engineering labor standards on all in store activities and we ll be integrating the labor standards with our labor management system to properly schedule resources based on production needs by item these initial positive results are setting the foundation on which we will continue to build as chip mentioned we re keenly aware that our traffic remains negative we re taking a long term view and know as we move toward a new marketing strategy a stronger everyday price position and pulling back on unprofitable promotions may result in continued traffic headwinds we expect an adjustment period and then profitable customers will respond the retail landscape remains fluid and we continue to evolve how we connect with our customers i m pleased that during 2019 we enhanced our touch point with our customers we increased our digital subscribers to over two million accounts up more than 35 for the year as well our home delivery continues to expand ending the year up more than 150 and we continue to see increased adoption we tested self checkout in a handful of stores to a resounding positive response and we will extend the test in many more stores in 2020 there is much work ahead currently we re testing some tactical changes in our marketing including how we reallocate the mix of our media spend we re focusing less on print dollars and redirecting these funds to different channels and different content to drive brand awareness personalization and store traffic we ve experienced some positive test results in the early stages but have not yet declared victory and look forward to additional testing and data as the months progress looking ahead i want to share some of our initial conclusions from our strategic work to date the foundation that made sprouts will remain a healthy brand rooted in the farmers market heritage that is good for you good for your family and good for the planet we will lean on innovation either through market trends national partnerships or private label investments and will remain value orientated and accessible to the everyday consumer with considerable transformation work in front of us we ve identified a handful of opportunities one through our early segmentation work we have a deeper understanding of the current and future customer at sprouts we understand what is important to these customers where we have opportunities and how we will integrate changes to reflect their preferences two we expect that store growth should accelerate beyond our historical 30 stores a year with a smaller box size that is less complicated and more profitable similar to many of our older southern california stores which continue to produce above average profits three we will plan to enter new markets with a greater concentration of new stores four all markets both existing and new will be supported by a more effective and efficient supply chain network improving costs and guaranteeing freshness of products due to shorter distribution times this point is of great importance though we have 340 stores our supply chain has been disjointed with our growth this will be corrected in short order and will separate us from other competitors who lack this infrastructure and lastly marketing will evolve to promote more brand awareness so customers understand why they should shop with sprouts and their loyalty and a greater share of wallet the concentration of stores backed by our supply chain network and a focused marketing program on our target customers coupled together will create optimal store economics i look forward to sharing the detailed strategic vision with you all at our nextearnings call a new chapter is starting to take shape for sprouts with the positive fourth quarter results behind us the dynamic leadership in place and an inclusive team member culture we are all even more energized for the work and challenges ahead i want to thank all the team members at sprouts for their dedication and their enthusiasm displayed to our customers every day in the stores even more so today i remain confident in the team s ability to focus on creating a more efficient business while implementing a strategic plan to position us for long term profitable growth with that we would like to open up the call for questions operator questions and answers operator first question comes from the line of paul trussell of deutsche bank your line is open paul trussell deutsche bank analyst good afternoon and congrats on the early progress and welcome denise and i guess until next time chip my first question is really regarding the top line it sounds like traffic is still slightly negative so maybe talk a little bit more about the outperformance you saw versus initial expectations in the fourth quarter and then just looking at the strong two year stack that that produced at least relative to prior quarters just like a little bit more insight on the rationale behind the only flat to up 1 guidance for this upcoming year jack sinclair chief executive officer yes let s i ll talk a little bit about what s happened in q4 with regard to how our comp played out we made some changes in our promotional mix and made some changes in terms of how we invest and what products we invested in and that s clearly we weren t sure exactly how that would play out why it happened in the past is that the excessive investment in promotions wasn t driving the top line was actually deflating the sales rather than creating positive sales and as we ve evolved the promotional plans in terms of the products we re putting in our promotions and the pricing we re putting behind them and using different products the outcome has been what the outcome has been it hasn t significantly changed traffic trends but it significantly changed the underlying comp sales that we ve had from that from the volume that we re putting through going forward there s a lot of volatility in the year on year comparisons and as we look at the certainly in q1 q2 and q3 you ve got a very significant volatility in what we did last year and as we measure that i think it s prudent to be where we are at the moment in terms of our forecasts going forward on comp sales paul trussell deutsche bank analyst that s helpful just in terms of follow up pretty meaningful expansion on the gross margin line this past quarter how much of that is directly attributable to the pullback on promos versus other drivers impacting that number lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer paul it s chip the majority of that is coming from i don t want to say the pullback on promotions but promoting differently so we re promoting products that we can actually make money on it we re going to the marketplace with the vendors with the deals we re making finding unique products and then we re promoting those and then we re to some degree we re not promoting everything to everyone so we re not trying to chase every competitor to the bottom and we re being more selective about what those promos are and quite honestly that s driving the vast majority of the margin expansion year over year last year we had some benefit year over year which we anticipated going into the quarter but the performance of the strategy if you will in the quarter actually overperformed what we expected paul trussell deutsche bank analyst thank you buest of luck lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer thanks paul operator our next question comes from ken goldman of jpmorgan your line is open ken goldman jpmorgan analyst as a brooklyn resident i do have to thank you for the shout out for van leeuwen ice cream it is a good local brand so it s good to see it expanding out west and i just wanted to ask a little bit about i know you re not ready to talk about all your strategic changes but the last one where or the second to last part of the five elements you talked about with a more effective and efficient supply chain network can you give us just a little bit of insight into what you think that requires from a capex standpoint even if the numbers aren t exactly there yet it would be helpful to know if you re thinking about a meaningful step up something a little bit more modest or maybe nothing at all just curious for your insights there if you can jack sinclair chief executive officer yes regarding oh sorry lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer ken it s going to be really modest because expanding our dc network and expanding even the dcs are pretty small and relatively small from a capex perspective so anything that s going to materially change our capex profile going forward would be more stores not dcs jack sinclair chief executive officer and the crux of the supply chain initiatives going forward will be to increase we ve talked about this in the past as we ve built some of our stores the network has been stretched in terms of the distribution miles that we re traveling from our distribution centers to our stores and that causes obviously increased cost but also challenges somewhat the freshness in terms of how do we present the product that we wanted to be presented so we ll be investing in making sure that the distance that we travel and the opportunities for us to source more locally and more effectively will improve the not only the cost of the supply chain but the quality of the product we re putting in front of the customer as well ken goldman jpmorgan analyst okay and then just to confirm you talked about that adjustment period potentially coming on traffic just to confirm i assume that your guidance already factors that adjustment period with maybe traffic worsening a little bit as some consumers are a little slower to react to some of the pricing changes you re making is that a fair assumption lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer yes i think generally it s fair it s a long year and with slightly negative traffic and we re going to start to comp that negative traffic as we go through the year we hope that we re hopeful that we re going to start to get positive hope is not a strategy of course but it would be it would not be prudent for us to expect a big swing in traffic going into this kind of year ken goldman jpmorgan analyst thank you jack sinclair chief executive officer but in time really sorry ken in time we re expecting profitable customers to come that s the objective of our traffic ambitions going forward not chase unprofitable customers ken goldman jpmorgan analyst okay understood thank you so much susannah livingston vice president of investor relations and treasury thanks operator your next question comes from scott mushkin of r5 capital your line is open scott mushkin r5 capital analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions i kind of really want to follow up a little bit on a couple of the questions and the answers to them around the gross profit big move we saw in the margin rate and the expectations as we get into next year so it sounds like it worked pretty well it sounds like traffic really didn t deteriorate you were able to really tack i guess my question is that it would suggest that why deviate and why is the guidance where it is so i guess that s my first question lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer scott it s chip as it relates to the guidance so one we are expecting margin expansion in the year two as i said in the call it will be predominantly in the first three quarters i think the fourth quarter given our most recent performance it s pretty much a push right now it s the way we at least that far out the way we re thinking about it and so we will get gross profit increase over the year but at the same time we re still putting in 20 stores and so that s going to put it a little down on the bottom as it relates to sg a but on the gross profit side on a 0 to one comp that s the guidance on eps it s really driven by the comp scott mushkin r5 capital analyst okay terrific and as you guys think about markets that maybe you want to go into i know you said you want to concentrate the stores i think you said georgia performed better during the quarter is but i think you only have four stores there is the southeast a place where you still are fairly committed to outside of florida lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer parts of the southeast most definitely so georgia for sure florida for sure as we continue to do our work on our customers and understand where we have the greatest opportunity there will of the other parts of the southeast there s opportunities in the mid atlantic which we ve already started and there s continued to be opportunities in the markets where we are today like texas and the southwest jack sinclair chief executive officer yes so when you look at the individual markets we ve got 16 stores in georgia at the moment and we ve got 15 in florida both of those markets represent significant opportunities going forward to us and we also see opportunities in southern california and in some of our base market where there s a whole host of our new targeted customers which we ll be talking to you about in the future we see that market as a significant area of opportunity for us as well going forward i was highlighting some of the operational improvements i ve been pleased with in georgia and florida in our remarks scott mushkin r5 capital analyst do i get one more or do i need to go back in the queue jack sinclair chief executive officer you can have one more scott mushkin r5 capital analyst okay so then my final one is just kind of a quick on the gross profit was there were there any timing differences and i know you put rent through the for the gross profit that also helped with that big move of 120 bps and then i ll yield lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer no there was nothing there were no timing elements of significance and that was predominantly all driven by margin scott mushkin r5 capital analyst thanks guys appreciate it operator our next question comes from karen short of barclays your question please karen short barclays analyst hey thanks a couple of housekeeping and then a couple of bigger picture the first thing is new store productivity was fairly low this quarter i don t know if there s anything to talk to you on timing or anything and then second on housekeeping is a color on inflation in the quarter and what your expectations are for 2020 and then i have some bigger picture questions lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer yes as it relates to new store productivity it s predominantly timing and then the other item we re not it s a benign inflation deflation area and that s the way what we re assuming going forward and it s an area that quite honestly when it comes to inflation deflation is this has been kind of in the past the company has really used that as sort of i don t want to say a sort of a driver when the reality of it s our responsibility whether it s inflation deflation go drive sales and do that at a stable plus margin and that s what we re going to do going forward karen short barclays analyst okay and then just i guess bigger picture i guess jack you made some comments on how you d restructure the store bonus program so i was wondering if you could give a little color on that and then you also commented on having a deeper understanding of the customer so i guess i m wondering if you can elaborate on that a little bit and then the last thing i d just ask is you have talked in the past about specs and changing specs on some of the skus that you have and now especially in produce so wondering if you could give an update on that jack sinclair chief executive officer yes okay let s take what i was saying store bonus what we ve done in the store bonus particularly and in q4 we ended up paying more bonuses to more stores than we had in the previous few quarters which is encouraging but it was based on making asking the stores to take accountability for exactly the things they are accountable for top line sales shrink operating cost and non goods not for resale the operating of what they can buy more how they can manage the inventory in the back of the stores more effectively rather than holding them accountable for things like rent and things like issues that are out of their control and that s certainly helped i think get some real focus and energy behind the stores and achieving the bonuses and it s something we re encouraging them to develop even further going forward the second question was about customer issues we spent quite a lot of time trying to dig into exactly how the food market in the united states is split up and we split that up into six different groups and we ve seen some of those groups are far more relevant to our future strategy than others and we ll talk a lot more about this on our next call effectively there s such a huge opportunity for us if we focus in on those customers who already like us and there s a lot more customers like that out in the marketplace so how we communicate with those customers and how we manage those customers going forward is going to be a core part of our strategy both in terms of our category work and our store work going forward and the third question karen was all about product specs i think one of the things that i ve been encouraged with as we ve changed the structure of the produce team in particular is how you can be appropriate to the specifications by both the geographies that people are operating within and the time of the the timing in terms of what s available and what s not available and being in my view specifications are part of the equation of getting really high quality fresh produce in front of customers the biggest challenge and the biggest thing that can work is on quality is about the freshness of the product itself and sometimes we get a little bit to focus on exact size and shape and color as opposed to exactly how the customer would be interested in buying the product and we ve seen a lot of progress on that in different categories where we if you like let the specification loose at certain times in certain places and that s allowed us to put the right products in front of the right customer at the right time and there ll be a lot more of that going forward karen operator our next question comes from john heinbockel of guggenheim securities your question please john heinbockel guggenheim securities analyst so jack maybe two related big picture thoughts number one as you ve done your segmentation work where do you think your share of wallet is with your core customer do you want to i don t know think about upper decile or quartile or however you want to define it and then secondly when you think about the existing market storing opportunity right with a smaller box what do you think the residual storing opportunity is in those existing markets is it another 100 stores 200 have you gotten your arms around those two topics yet jack sinclair chief executive officer well certainly we ve got a very good handle in terms of how what the opportunity is with regard to the customer base going forward in terms of segmentation and think about it it s a fairly i can t give you a share of wallet by number because i don t have that number to hand over right i don t actually have that number but what i do have and clearly in my mind is we ve got a fairly tiny share of this market that we re going to be targeting and we re a 5 billion business and there s plenty of people out there who will the health enthusiast the innovation seeker the kind of people that we re going to be targeting we have got a tiny share of that marketplace as it exists today not only in the geographies that we re not but in the geographies that we are so it really is a matter of prioritizing going forward given the resources that we have and it may be i ll pass you on to chip to talk specifically about where we are in terms of store growth in the smaller store growth to tackle that market opportunity lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer john it s a little premature to talk about the runway i think that we ll talk to that specifically on the next call in two months but as it relates to opportunity i can say that we do believe there s a lot of white space when you look at sprouts like customers and you look at across the u s there are many many many places today where there are sprouts like customers that we don t serve today number one number two though what s most critical is that we can go after those customers and do it in a profitable way with an operating box that makes sense and creates the right kinds of returns that create shareholder value and that s the part that we re working on and that s a part that we re refining and we re making sure that we re going to get it right before we go after those customers and that s the work that you ll hear more about next quarter jack sinclair chief executive officer we do believe there s plenty of opportunity john going forward that s for sure john heinbockel guggenheim securities analyst okay thank you jack sinclair chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from chuck cerankosky of north coast research please go ahead chuck cerankosky north coast research analyst good afternoon everybody quick thing on the balance sheet you finished with the cash balance up significantly any particular reason for that was that timing and could you have been more aggressive on buying back stock and i have a follow up lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer well as it stands right now chuck our intention of buying back stock we bought back a big chunk earlier in the year we then made sure we were buying back any sort of dilution for the next year or this coming year that we re in today but as it relates to the we want to get through the strategy work first before we continue to buy back stock we don t have a new authorization our authorization i believe expired at the end of the year so we don t have a new authorization right now any cash proceeds we re going to use to pay down on our revolver and once we really refined our strategy to determine how much our capital needs are going to be each and every year we ll revisit what s left over and what we do with it chuck cerankosky north coast research analyst got it and look at the comp guidance for 2020 anything in the economy that influences you it does look conservative or are you just concerned about some of the traffic issues you re facing lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer there s nothing on the economy front we re a domestic u s we re not impacted by the things that are impacting the global economy which then have residual impacts locally but as it relates to the comp guidance yes we are being prudent we believe as it relates to the potential volatility that we re going to have ongoing through the year for traffic as it relates specifically to how we promote and where we promote chuck cerankosky north coast research analyst so you re talking about a little bit of experimenting perhaps realized some things might not work before people catch on to the treasure hunt aspects of it lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer absolutely we ve been doing experimenting ever since jack arrived we ve done a lot of experiments a lot have worked some have not and we ll continue to be experimenting through this fiscal year but we don t think we re going to be doing anything that s going to dramatically impact us negatively or positively at this stage chuck cerankosky north coast research analyst okay great thank you operator our next question comes from judah frommer of credit suisse your line is open judah frommer credit suisse analyst hi thanks so first question is regarding the language about the 2020 outlook i think it says something along the lines of the outlook doesn t contemplate strategic changes it sounds like the strategy is contemplating changes in pricing and promotion so what else could change within the strategy that may throw the outlook off course lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer well as it relates to strategic changes we re still working through the strategy it is as it relates to the promotional side of the house that work we re doing already that s not that s tactical work that we re working on every day to continue to make the business a better business while working on any sort of longer term what i would call impactful things like the store growth like the size of the box like the desired pace at which we grow shifting of categories a little bit so we re going to have more complete information on that at the next quarter but bear in mind the direction we re going or leaning is in our opinion is going to improve the runway of this company and the performance of this company along the way and there may be some short term wins or losses as well but we haven t articulated that to date judah frommer credit suisse analyst okay that s helpful and then maybe more broadly on the competitive environment clearly you ve seen i think some concepts that people would consider somewhat similar to sprouts go bankrupt recently obviously very different leverage profiles there but kind of similar fresh led concepts and you see kind of the bigger grocers in the country continue to focus on fresh so how do you think about your position do you think about price gaps or promotion within fresh and produce differently than center store than maybe you did previously jack sinclair chief executive officer we certainly spend a lot of time looking at our own business as opposed to looking at our competitors business i think the reality of our operation and this is the thing that i think i ve learned most in the last six months is we re pretty if we do it right we get good results irrespective of what our competitors do i ve been very encouraged when i go around the country and depending on who we re sitting next to we are very much a complementary retailer as opposed to a directly competitive retailer our fresh produce operation is better than most and will stay better than most our bulk operation is pretty unique our vitamin operation is pretty unique and our grocery when we have the categories are doing really well for us or when i can t do any price comparisons because the products that we re selling are totally different to what products i can find in conventional or mass market competitors so in that sense we are watching and aware of what s going on in particular in the produce pricing marketplace but we re creating a lot of differentiation by the type of products that we re putting in and the way we re buying it and the way we re focusing behind it and i think you identified pretty well the fact that well this is a strong cash generative business with a strong balance sheet which i think contrast that a little bit with where we ve been with some of the more direct competitors in this space and they don t really have the scale i don t think to be very meaningful in the sense of hurting us or not hurting us with regard to what we have been doing with our stores i think some things we probably have learned from one or two of those competitors is if you spend too much money and too much capital and invest too much in labor in certain categories and particularly in deli and prepared foods you can put yourself in a place where the cost base is it makes it very difficult to make the returns that you d want to make and that s something that we will be reversing in our as we went down that road over the course of the last few months operator next question comes from edward kelly of wells fargo your line is open edward kelly wells fargo analyst hi good afternoon guys thanks for taking my questions i wanted to ask about the promotional strategy and the changes that you re making there and maybe if you could just provide a bit more specific color on some of the adjustments and whether you re striking the right balance i think the concern maybe is that if you pulled back on from an opening pulled back a store online or if you adjust on promotions those promotions were probably driving some traffic at a minimum i guess right and is that why we could see continued softness of traffic in 2020 and just general thoughts around how you balance all that for the long term jack sinclair chief executive officer and that s certainly very much part of what the experimentation phase over the last six nine months over the last six months have been and will be over the next few months we still got to refine every aspect of it but the reality of it is we ve turned off unprofitable customers by not going so commodity focused on the products that we put in our promotional and the promotional vehicles that we use both in terms of what we put in the store and what we put in our flyer distribution so we ve tried to take away a lot of the commodity type promotions they do drive traffic but tend to be very promiscuous customers who will go to wherever the lowest price of chicken breast is as opposed to who is going to go and buy those products that are going to differentiate and make us different and better in the marketplace we ve tried to shape the promotions toward those things that are different and better and the outcome of that potentially is you lose some unprofitable customers but in the long run it builds us a kind of profitable traffic growth that we re going to be aspiring to over the course of the next few years that makes sense edward kelly wells fargo analyst yes okay and then just lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer and it s chip and i want to i just want to point out too is there was a period of time in the first half of the year that the company was negative on traffic as well and was continuing to heat up promotions so there were promotions being piled on top of promotions on top of promotions that weren t doing anything from a traffic perspective but they were burning down margin edward kelly wells fargo analyst right okay and just a question on the store format going forward any color you can provide on the changes that you plan to make how you might see the return metrics penciling out and then just talk about your decision to accelerate growth i think most of us look at food retail as a pretty saturated industry but you re obviously confident that you can take share profitably so just some thoughts there jack sinclair chief executive officer yes i m very confident that there s more and more people interested in healthy options in terms of buying for themselves and their family i don t i think that trend is pretty clear and is going to accelerate at all income levels and all age levels i think there s a real opportunity for us to be the leader in that space and that space is getting bigger within an overall food market there s got some issues as you re describing it we re trying to we re not really thinking about the overall business we re thinking specifically around those customers and those trends in the marketplace and as we work that one through we can supply that need in our unique farmer low profile great presentation of fresh foods the combination of how bulk can help that as well it gives us a uniqueness in it and i m i was in a we opened a new store yesterday it s not far away and the passion and energy of the customers coming into that store it was in arizona but the passion and energy of the customers coming into that store for the proposition that we ve put in front of them is something that makes me really excited and positive about the opportunities going forward lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer and add real quick i just want to point out i mean the simplest at its highest level the stuff we ve articulated the store is it is going to be smaller than the 30 that s for sure it is going to be less expensive to not only build but less expensive to operate and we believe and we have a strong belief based on the looking at our customers looking where the customers are looking at our merchandise looking at what s productive merchandise what s not we have a strong belief we can still present our value proposition on the corner of main and main in a box that s less expensive than the 30 that we re doing today and less costly to operate and really not lose any sales edward kelly wells fargo analyst great thanks jack sinclair chief executive officer if anything we can recreate the farmer s market better that s the really exciting thing part of it thanks operator our next question comes from chuck grom of gordon haskett your line is open derek green gordon haskett analyst hi guys this is actually derek green right on for chuck just regarding your the tweaks made into your supply chain do you anticipate any store closures regarding that going forward or right now just openings lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer derek well right now we re focused on the openings we are going to evaluate all of our stores we ll continue to evaluate all of our stores and see how that fits in our strategy and then we ll sort through that but right now we re still working on that work derek green gordon haskett analyst all right great and then just in terms of instacart any color you can give on the benefit you re still seeing from that lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer well i mean it s a great business i mean we re up 150 for the year on home delivery we re doing almost 11 000 on a per box basis we ve got it at all 340 of our stores on the home delivery side the pickup side of the house is not really that exciting and we ve got it in 55 of our stores today it s running at about 1 4 of what the home delivery is it s not something our customers seem to be that excited about but as it relates to the delivery we re excited about that we have a great relationship with instacart and we re going to continue down that path jack sinclair chief executive officer and we got some stores doing a lot of money and that s dependent on the market a big area in particular thinking through has been performing well for us in this space and instacart doing a good job for us derek green gordon haskett analyst i understand thank you operator thank you our next question comes from robby ohmes of bank of america your line is open robby ohmes bank of america analyst hello hey guys jack just i guess two follow ups just on the fourth quarter with the less promotions and everything any impact at all from the six less shopping days or anything in your seasonal that impacted the quarter negatively any way to look at it and say that your traffic maybe would have been positive in the quarter given anything that happened jack sinclair chief executive officer i ve read that from some of the other retailers that have released and i m not we are not seeing that i think that impact has been more in the toys and nonfood side of things and it s been an impact in terms of our food business so i don t think that s a factor and we ve certainly not identified that as such robby ohmes bank of america analyst that s helpful and then just a follow up on the smaller stores and maybe home delivery penetration how are you thinking about home delivery penetration going forward and pickup and is that factored into smaller stores matter does it help or hurt home delivery penetration or pickup i m just curious how you re thinking about the role of delivery and pickup in sort of the new store formats jack sinclair chief executive officer yes i think in terms of the broader strategic challenge of this or thinking through of this one is pickup doesn t seem to be something that s really a big part of how our customers want to interface with our brand in terms of delivery smaller stores or bigger stores we can we ve got both those types of stores in our network at the moment both of them fulfill the need for home delivery for our customers pretty effectively when we do it so going forward we ll certainly pay attention to in terms of the formats we put in place and make sure it can be executed efficiently but it s not something we re seeing as a huge challenge and going forward we want to be a business where customers come to the store for the reason that they seek there s a reason to be there because there s something that they weren t expecting or something new or something fresh i always use with the team internally is farmers market is probably the fastest growing retail in the united states at the moment if we can just capture some of that growth in farmers markets we ll be pretty well placed and that requires experiential retailing it requires people to really want to be there and that s what our aspiration would be in terms of what we create in these small stores and we ve certainly got it in some of our stores today that s for sure robby ohmes bank of america analyst really helpful thanks jack jack sinclair chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from kelly bania of bmo capital your line is open kelly bania bmo capital analyst hi good evening thanks for taking my questions i think this has been asked but i m going to try again it seems to be there s a little bit of a disconnect between your more cautious comp outlook for 2020 relative to the success you ve seen with this tactical change in the promotional strategy maybe just over the last couple of quarters so i guess i m just curious is the concern maybe about is there any concern about the longer term impact of this as consumers get more accustomed to what you re promoting and how you re promoting and maybe can you help us understand if your with your comp guidance is within if your comps are within your guidance for the first quarter so far lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer well kelly this is chip first off as it relates to long term no we don t think that there s going to be this is a short term belief as we start to change the way we go to market on the promotional side that we are going to lose some traffic we continue to lose some traffic that started before we ever even started to shift so that part of it we re working through we expect that that will continue through this coming year there are it is volatile we ll see the volatility from week to week from promotion to promotion so it would be like i said earlier it would be not it would not be prudent for us to just sit here and throw out a higher comp when that s not the work that we re doing as it relates to what was the second part i apologize what kelly bania bmo capital analyst q1 lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer oh q1 q1 we re more than halfway through q1 and we gave a guidance of 0 to 1 so that s what we believe is where we ll be for the quarter kelly bania bmo capital analyst okay and i guess just another follow up in my understanding of sprouts its historical strategy was to kind of lure new consumers in with aggressively priced produce and transition them over time to some of the higher margin parts of the store and just curious how you feel about that and if you re seeing that progression and how that plays into your outlook and what kind of strategy you re it sounds like you re still developing jack sinclair chief executive officer certainly going forward kelly the strategy will be will have a foundation of very strong value produce in terms of both pricing quality product and that will be a fundamental part it was a fundamental part of the origins of the sprouts farmers market business and it will be a fundamental part of this business going forward in terms of what you then do with that traffic when it s there which is what this business and it that s not going to change either those elements across the mix of the business that will come together to create the business model that we need going forward so in some ways it will be more of the same or going back to the future in terms of how we think that went through because that s what s kind of worked and made this business great in the first place and there s no reason why that thing can t work just as efficiently going forward kelly bania bmo capital analyst thank you operator next question comes from bob summers of buckingham your line is open bob summers buckingham analyst thanks good afternoon so just to beat this to death a little bit so as you re rebalancing the promotional posture i m curious as to what type of consumer work you re doing on price or value perception and whether you re breaking that down between loyal customers cherry pickers or whatever segments you might have because i guess as we think about this with traffic negative the basket is up and then is that driven by the baskets per item product rate mix just trying to get a feel for how close on price perception you are with the customer because i think that s really with what you re doing could get away from you jack sinclair chief executive officer yes the work with again the traffic hasn t changed significantly since we ve changed it stayed at kind of negative level over the course of that time as we ve been changing around and doing experiments on our promotional strategies i think the issue that we ve done in terms of resets going forward has highlighted those pricing areas in certain categories that we need to look at and we ll talk about that a little bit in our strategy as we focus different investments in different categories we ll see there will be some elements of the customers that we re trying to target who are looking for more aggressive pricing in certain places and that will be part of our strategy going forward as we prioritize certain categories or other categories and we ll manage that within our mix and in terms of how the customers are viewing this value is an important part of our proposition and we re not seeing we re certainly not seeing anything in the short term that s doing anything other than losing some highly promotional unprofitable customers that will be promiscuous no matter what we do so getting away from that those type of customers and targeting what are we going to do to build long term profitable customers is the key to the whole strategy going forward and that s why there s some volatility in the numbers because you ll lose the immediate promiscuous customers faster than you ll gain the other customers coming through and that s what we re trying to evaluate when we re putting together everything that we ve been talking about over the last little while lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer bob i would one other thing i d make add to that is the work that we ve done and the customer research that we ve done at the end of the day we re getting very little credit historically for being a value provider to begin with bob summers buckingham analyst okay okay that makes sense and then just on any strategic changes i think a lot of us will view that as really will equate to investment spending clearly still early for you but just as a way to think about guardrails and i guess what i mean is conceptually what do you think is the organization s ability to absorb investment define the rates somehow i don t know dollars pressure on earnings what have you do you have any view on what the right way to think about that would be lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer well one i would think about it as from a capital perspective capital may go up but from a p l perspective i don t see from an ongoing operating of the business p l i don t see any major investments in the ongoing business that s going to dilute the p l if anything it s going to be positive bob summers buckingham analyst okay thanks operator thank you at this time i d like to turn the call back over to ceo jack sinclair for closing remarks sir jack sinclair chief executive officer well thanks everybody for taking time to listen to our call today we re very pleased with the progress we ve made in q4 and we re very excited

thanks jack and good afternoon everyone i ll begin by discussing our business results for the fourth quarter and full year and then review our outlook for 2020 for the fourth quarter net sales were 1 4 billion up 8 compared to the same period last year comparable store sales were 1 5 with the continued upward trend in the two year stack to 3 8 the non perishable categories were strong and we experienced the benefits of driving the right holiday trends early in the season like the expansion of our vegan and plant based holiday meals and sides for the fourth quarter gross profit increased by 11 to 469 million and our gross margin rate was 34 4 an increase of 120 basis points when compared to the same period last year while we were cycling tailwinds from deep promotions in the fourth quarter of 2018 our early efforts to balance our price position comp and improve margins paid off in the fourth quarter despite experiencing some early margin wins our traffic was still slightly negative as 2020 progresses the correct balance of driving comp and traffic while continuing to stabilize margins will remain a focus area for the team sg a increased 10 to 387 million or 28 4 of sales compared to 27 8 in the same period last year 35 basis points of this deleverage is from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard the remaining deleverage is due to higher healthcare costs the expansion of our home delivery program ongoing strategy work and cycling the california payroll tax benefit in 2018 for the fourth quarter our depreciation and amortization costs increased 10 to 31 million or 2 2 of sales an increase of five basis points compared to the same period last year store closure and other costs were 3 9 million mainly related to the noncash impairment of three stores our interest expense was 5 million for the quarter our earnings before taxes was 42 million an increase of 27 when compared to adjusted earnings before taxes in the same period last year our effective tax rate was 24 fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was 0 27 compared to diluted earnings per share of 0 10 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of 0 19 in the same period last year for fiscal year 2019 net sales grew to 5 6 billion up 8 gross profit increased 8 to 1 9 billion resulting in a gross margin rate of 33 6 an increase of approximately five basis points compared to 2018 mainly attributed to the more thoughtful promotional approach in the fourth quarter of 2019 sg a increased 10 to 1 5 billion an increase of 50 basis points to 27 5 of sales compared to last year 35 basis points of this deleverage is from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard the remaining deleverage is attributed to investments in new stores expansion of our home delivery program higher healthcare costs and increased credit card fees partially offset by increased rent credits during the year our interest expense was 21 million and our adjusted earnings before taxes was 197 million a decrease of 5 when compared to adjusted earnings before taxes in 2018 our effective tax rate was 24 for fiscal year 2019 diluted earnings per share was 1 25 compared to diluted earnings per share of 1 22 in 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share was 1 25 compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of 1 29 last year as a reminder the lease accounting standard resulted in a net incremental expense of 0 04 per share for fiscal 2019 shifting to the balance sheet and liquidity for 2019 we generated strong cash flow from operations of 355 million up 21 for the year the robust cash generation this business produces continues to support and self fund our unit growth and sales initiatives we invested 157 million in capital expenditures net of landlords reimbursements primarily for new stores for the fiscal year we opened 28 new stores and closed 1 ending the year with 340 stores in 22 states during the year we also repurchased 7 95 million shares for a total investment of 176 million we ended 2019 with 85 million in cash and cash equivalents and 538 million borrowed on our 700 million revolving credit facility reflective of a strong balance sheet we continue to maintain a low debt position ending the year with a net debt to ebitda ratio of 1 4 times now let me turn to our outlook for 2020 two items to point out one 2020 will be a 53 week year with the extra week falling in the fourth quarter the company estimates the impact for the 53rd week to be approximately 120 million in total sales 9 million in earnings before taxes and 0 06 in diluted earnings per share and two though we are encouraged by our fourth quarter results and are optimistic about the direction we are heading our strategic work is still ongoing therefore this outlook only factors our current business and does not factor any potential strategic changes for fiscal 2020 on a 52 week basis we expect net sales to grow 5 5 to 6 5 comps to be in the 0 to 1 range ebt to be 187 million to 197 million diluted earnings per share between 1 17 and 1 23 and an effective tax rate of 26 we expect our 2020 capex spend to be between 120 million and 130 million net of landlord reimbursements this is slightly lower than previous years due to opening fewer stores we anticipate opening approximately 20 stores in 2020 a few other items to note we expect gross margins to be slightly positive for the full year with more benefit expected during the first three quarters sg a will continue to be pressured from occupancy e commerce and labor and benefits we expect to utilize our strong cash generation to invest in our business and to pay down a portion of our revolver debt quarter to date we ve paid down 50 million on our credit facility and expect an additional 50 million to 60 million paydown before the end of q1 for the first quarter we expect comps to be in the 0 to 1 range and diluted earnings per share between 0 45 and 0 47 it has been a delight to serve as interim cfo during this transitional time period and work directly with jack as he leads our company and strategy moving forward i am confident to hand the reins of cfo over to denise whose knowledge and expertise in retail will help keep the business moving in the right direction now back to jack jack sinclair chief executive officer thanks chip over the last several months we challenged ourselves to make key fundamental shifts in how we run our business leading to some early signs of improvement during the fourth quarter we refined and balanced our promotional strategies to target our core customer and eliminate inefficient promotions to be clear we re still promoting and providing value to our customers but we re doing so differently we focused our promotional activity by responding to opportunities in the marketplace rather than reacting to promotional pricing elsewhere resulting in improved cost of merchandise we focused our display and presentation in store on items that differentiate us in the marketplace and provide uniqueness to the customer if the composition if the competition zigged we zagged in our core fresh categories we focused less on commodities and more on our strengths in assortment on apples we promoted unique varieties like lucy glo at the holidays we focused on greater attribute driven products like no antibiotic of our turkeys rather than commodity items this has been a profitable change and we re exploring how to develop this approach even more broadly across our portfolio we are becoming the platform for innovation where our vendors come to us first because we can move quickly to put new healthy products in our stores we ve implemented new initiatives to accelerate our innovation pipeline like our innovation summits targeting emerging brands and our new think tank panel comprised of partners in the industry that incubate start up brands these programs led to successes in our grocery aisle with the addition of pipcorn packed with nutrients and taste and van leeuwen oat milk vegan ice cream all these changes have created a platform from which we can build our brand can and will be known as a treasure hunt for healthy eating across this country enhanced cross collaboration has helped teams work together to better plan and source our products we reorganized our produce buying group to enhance our vendor partnerships increasing availability to sprouts and improving our costs these improved vendor relationships allowed us to highlight driscoll s sweetest batch blueberries which are bigger and sweeter increasing sales in the fourth quarter all these changes resulted in meaningful differences in how we promote price and source our goods and we did this all the while driving gross margins contributing to much of the quarter s success this progress and the team environment we created resonated across the entire organization and across the store portfolio as a result we re making progress across the country the east coast division opened half our new stores in 2019 and with relatively new leadership the results were commendable both florida and georgia improved their store operations and georgia greatly improved their financial position which had been lagging in past years and that s a testament to focused leadership with a clear set of priorities we plan to build on this success as both florida and georgia provide growth opportunities for the future a restructured store bonus plan laser focused on what our store team members can control has proved to be a successful incentive driving sales and engaging team members across the organization in 2019 we completed the production planning phase of fim resulting in workflow improvement better curation of assortment and a reduction in shrink in our fresh departments we also entered the second phase of fim deploying computer assisted ordering which when completed will provide fresher product to our customers improve sales floor conditions and reduce unproductive inventory additionally we completed industrial engineering labor standards on all in store activities and we ll be integrating the labor standards with our labor management system to properly schedule resources based on production needs by item these initial positive results are setting the foundation on which we will continue to build as chip mentioned we re keenly aware that our traffic remains negative we re taking a long term view and know as we move toward a new marketing strategy a stronger everyday price position and pulling back on unprofitable promotions may result in continued traffic headwinds we expect an adjustment period and then profitable customers will respond the retail landscape remains fluid and we continue to evolve how we connect with our customers i m pleased that during 2019 we enhanced our touch point with our customers we increased our digital subscribers to over two million accounts up more than 35 for the year as well our home delivery continues to expand ending the year up more than 150 and we continue to see increased adoption we tested self checkout in a handful of stores to a resounding positive response and we will extend the test in many more stores in 2020 there is much work ahead currently we re testing some tactical changes in our marketing including how we reallocate the mix of our media spend we re focusing less on print dollars and redirecting these funds to different channels and different content to drive brand awareness personalization and store traffic we ve experienced some positive test results in the early stages but have not yet declared victory and look forward to additional testing and data as the months progress looking ahead i want to share some of our initial conclusions from our strategic work to date the foundation that made sprouts will remain a healthy brand rooted in the farmers market heritage that is good for you good for your family and good for the planet we will lean on innovation either through market trends national partnerships or private label investments and will remain value orientated and accessible to the everyday consumer with considerable transformation work in front of us we ve identified a handful of opportunities one through our early segmentation work we have a deeper understanding of the current and future customer at sprouts we understand what is important to these customers where we have opportunities and how we will integrate changes to reflect their preferences two we expect that store growth should accelerate beyond our historical 30 stores a year with a smaller box size that is less complicated and more profitable similar to many of our older southern california stores which continue to produce above average profits three we will plan to enter new markets with a greater concentration of new stores four all markets both existing and new will be supported by a more effective and efficient supply chain network improving costs and guaranteeing freshness of products due to shorter distribution times this point is of great importance though we have 340 stores our supply chain has been disjointed with our growth this will be corrected in short order and will separate us from other competitors who lack this infrastructure and lastly marketing will evolve to promote more brand awareness so customers understand why they should shop with sprouts and their loyalty and a greater share of wallet the concentration of stores backed by our supply chain network and a focused marketing program on our target customers coupled together will create optimal store economics i look forward to sharing the detailed strategic vision with you all at our next earnings call a new chapter is starting to take shape for sprouts with the positive fourth quarter results behind us the dynamic leadership in place and an inclusive team member culture we are all even more energized for the work and challenges ahead i want to thank all the team members at sprouts for their dedication and their enthusiasm displayed to our customers every day in the stores even more so today i remain confident in the team s ability to focus on creating a more efficient business while implementing a strategic plan to position us for long term profitable growth with that we would like to open up the call for questions operator questions and answers operator first question comes from the line of paul trussell of deutsche bank your line is open paul trussell deutsche bank analyst good afternoon and congrats on the early progress and welcome denise and i guess until next time chip my first question is really regarding the top line it sounds like traffic is still slightly negative so maybe talk a little bit more about the outperformance you saw versus initial expectations in the fourth quarter and then just looking at the strong two year stack that that produced at least relative to prior quarters just like a little bit more insight on the rationale behind the only flat to up 1 guidance for this upcoming year jack sinclair chief executive officer yes let s i ll talk a little bit about what s happened in q4 with regard to how our comp played out we made some changes in our promotional mix and made some changes in terms of how we invest and what products we invested in and that s clearly we weren t sure exactly how that would play out why it happened in the past is that the excessive investment in promotions wasn t driving the top line was actually deflating the sales rather than creating positive sales and as we ve evolved the promotional plans in terms of the products we re putting in our promotions and the pricing we re putting behind them and using different products the outcome has been what the outcome has been it hasn t significantly changed traffic trends but it significantly changed the underlying comp sales that we ve had from that from the volume that we re putting through going forward there s a lot of volatility in the year on year comparisons and as we look at the certainly in q1 q2 and q3 you ve got a very significant volatility in what we did last year and as we measure that i think it s prudent to be where we are at the moment in terms of our forecasts going forward on comp sales paul trussell deutsche bank analyst that s helpful just in terms of follow up pretty meaningful expansion on the gross margin line this past quarter how much of that is directly attributable to the pullback on promos versus other drivers impacting that number lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer paul it s chip the majority of that is coming from i don t want to say the pullback on promotions but promoting differently so we re promoting products that we can actually make money on it we re going to the marketplace with the vendors with the deals we re making finding unique products and then we re promoting those and then we re to some degree we re not promoting everything to everyone so we re not trying to chase every competitor to the bottom and we re being more selective about what those promos are and quite honestly that s driving the vast majority of the margin expansion year over year last year we had some benefit year over year which we anticipated going into the quarter but the performance of the strategy if you will in the quarter actually overperformed what we expected paul trussell deutsche bank analyst thank you buest of luck lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer thanks paul operator our next question comes from ken goldman of jpmorgan your line is open ken goldman jpmorgan analyst as a brooklyn resident i do have to thank you for the shout out for van leeuwen ice cream it is a good local brand so it s good to see it expanding out west and i just wanted to ask a little bit about i know you re not ready to talk about all your strategic changes but the last one where or the second to last part of the five elements you talked about with a more effective and efficient supply chain network can you give us just a little bit of insight into what you think that requires from a capex standpoint even if the numbers aren t exactly there yet it would be helpful to know if you re thinking about a meaningful step up something a little bit more modest or maybe nothing at all just curious for your insights there if you can jack sinclair chief executive officer yes regarding oh sorry lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer ken it s going to be really modest because expanding our dc network and expanding even the dcs are pretty small and relatively small from a capex perspective so anything that s going to materially change our capex profile going forward would be more stores not dcs jack sinclair chief executive officer and the crux of the supply chain initiatives going forward will be to increase we ve talked about this in the past as we ve built some of our stores the network has been stretched in terms of the distribution miles that we re traveling from our distribution centers to our stores and that causes obviously increased cost but also challenges somewhat the freshness in terms of how do we present the product that we wanted to be presented so we ll be investing in making sure that the distance that we travel and the opportunities for us to source more locally and more effectively will improve the not only the cost of the supply chain but the quality of the product we re putting in front of the customer as well ken goldman jpmorgan analyst okay and then just to confirm you talked about that adjustment period potentially coming on traffic just to confirm i assume that your guidance already factors that adjustment period with maybe traffic worsening a little bit as some consumers are a little slower to react to some of the pricing changes you re making is that a fair assumption lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer yes i think generally it s fair it s a long year and with slightly negative traffic and we re going to start to comp that negative traffic as we go through the year we hope that we re hopeful that we re going to start to get positive hope is not a strategy of course but it would be it would not be prudent for us to expect a big swing in traffic going into this kind of year ken goldman jpmorgan analyst thank you jack sinclair chief executive officer but in time really sorry ken in time we re expecting profitable customers to come that s the objective of our traffic ambitions going forward not chase unprofitable customers ken goldman jpmorgan analyst okay understood thank you so much susannah livingston vice president of investor relations and treasury thanks operator your next question comes from scott mushkin of r5 capital your line is open scott mushkin r5 capital analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions i kind of really want to follow up a little bit on a couple of the questions and the answers to them around the gross profit big move we saw in the margin rate and the expectations as we get into next year so it sounds like it worked pretty well it sounds like traffic really didn t deteriorate you were able to really tack i guess my question is that it would suggest that why deviate and why is the guidance where it is so i guess that s my first question lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer scott it s chip as it relates to the guidance so one we are expecting margin expansion in the year two as i said in the call it will be predominantly in the first three quarters i think the fourth quarter given our most recent performance it s pretty much a push right now it s the way we at least that far out the way we re thinking about it and so we will get gross profit increase over the year but at the same time we re still putting in 20 stores and so that s going to put it a little down on the bottom as it relates to sg a but on the gross profit side on a 0 to one comp that s the guidance on eps it s really driven by the comp scott mushkin r5 capital analyst okay terrific and as you guys think about markets that maybe you want to go into i know you said you want to concentrate the stores i think you said georgia performed better during the quarter is but i think you only have four stores there is the southeast a place where you still are fairly committed to outside of florida lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer parts of the southeast most definitely so georgia for sure florida for sure as we continue to do our work on our customers and understand where we have the greatest opportunity there will of the other parts of the southeast there s opportunities in the mid atlantic which we ve already started and there s continued to be opportunities in the markets where we are today like texas and the southwest jack sinclair chief executive officer yes so when you look at the individual markets we ve got 16 stores in georgia at the moment and we ve got 15 in florida both of those markets represent significant opportunities going forward to us and we also see opportunities in southern california and in some of our base market where there s a whole host of our new targeted customers which we ll be talking to you about in the future we see that market as a significant area of opportunity for us as well going forward i was highlighting some of the operational improvements i ve been pleased with in georgia and florida in our remarks scott mushkin r5 capital analyst do i get one more or do i need to go back in the queue jack sinclair chief executive officer you can have one more scott mushkin r5 capital analyst okay so then my final one is just kind of a quick on the gross profit was there were there any timing differences and i know you put rent through the for the gross profit that also helped with that big move of 120 bps and then i ll yield lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer no there was nothing there were no timing elements of significance and that was predominantly all driven by margin scott mushkin r5 capital analyst thanks guys appreciate it operator our next question comes from karen short of barclays your question please karen short barclays analyst hey thanks a couple of housekeeping and then a couple of bigger picture the first thing is new store productivity was fairly low this quarter i don t know if there s anything to talk to you on timing or anything and then second on housekeeping is a color on inflation in the quarter and what your expectations are for 2020 and then i have some bigger picture questions lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer yes as it relates to new store productivity it s predominantly timing and then the other item we re not it s a benign inflation deflation area and that s the way what we re assuming going forward and it s an area that quite honestly when it comes to inflation deflation is this has been kind of in the past the company has really used that as sort of i don t want to say a sort of a driver when the reality of it s our responsibility whether it s inflation deflation go drive sales and do that at a stable plus margin and that s what we re going to do going forward karen short barclays analyst okay and then just i guess bigger picture i guess jack you made some comments on how you d restructure the store bonus program so i was wondering if you could give a little color on that and then you also commented on having a deeper understanding of the customer so i guess i m wondering if you can elaborate on that a little bit and then the last thing i d just ask is you have talked in the past about specs and changing specs on some of the skus that you have and now especially in produce so wondering if you could give an update on that jack sinclair chief executive officer yes okay let s take what i was saying store bonus what we ve done in the store bonus particularly and in q4 we ended up paying more bonuses to more stores than we had in the previous few quarters which is encouraging but it was based on making asking the stores to take accountability for exactly the things they are accountable for top line sales shrink operating cost and non goods not for resale the operating of what they can buy more how they can manage the inventory in the back of the stores more effectively rather than holding them accountable for things like rent and things like issues that are out of their control and that s certainly helped i think get some real focus and energy behind the stores and achieving the bonuses and it s something we re encouraging them to develop even further going forward the second question was about customer issues we spent quite a lot of time trying to dig into exactly how the food market in the united states is split up and we split that up into six different groups and we ve seen some of those groups are far more relevant to our future strategy than others and we ll talk a lot more about this on our next call effectively there s such a huge opportunity for us if we focus in on those customers who already like us and there s a lot more customers like that out in the marketplace so how we communicate with those customers and how we manage those customers going forward is going to be a core part of our strategy both in terms of our category work and our store work going forward and the third question karen was all about product specs i think one of the things that i ve been encouraged with as we ve changed the structure of the produce team in particular is how you can be appropriate to the specifications by both the geographies that people are operating within and the time of the the timing in terms of what s available and what s not available and being in my view specifications are part of the equation of getting really high quality fresh produce in front of customers the biggest challenge and the biggest thing that can work is on quality is about the freshness of the product itself and sometimes we get a little bit to focus on exact size and shape and color as opposed to exactly how the customer would be interested in buying the product and we ve seen a lot of progress on that in different categories where we if you like let the specification loose at certain times in certain places and that s allowed us to put the right products in front of the right customer at the right time and there ll be a lot more of that going forward karen operator our next question comes from john heinbockel of guggenheim securities your question please john heinbockel guggenheim securities analyst so jack maybe two related big picture thoughts number one as you ve done your segmentation work where do you think your share of wallet is with your core customer do you want to i don t know think about upper decile or quartile or however you want to define it and then secondly when you think about the existing market storing opportunity right with a smaller box what do you think the residual storing opportunity is in those existing markets is it another 100 stores 200 have you gotten your arms around those two topics yet jack sinclair chief executive officer well certainly we ve got a very good handle in terms of how what the opportunity is with regard to the customer base going forward in terms of segmentation and think about it it s a fairly i can t give you a share of wallet by number because i don t have that number to hand over right i don t actually have that number but what i do have and clearly in my mind is we ve got a fairly tiny share of this market that we re going to be targeting and we re a 5 billion business and there s plenty of people out there who will the health enthusiast the innovation seeker the kind of people that we re going to be targeting we have got a tiny share of that marketplace as it exists today not only in the geographies that we re not but in the geographies that we are so it really is a matter of prioritizing going forward given the resources that we have and it may be i ll pass you on to chip to talk specifically about where we are in terms of store growth in the smaller store growth to tackle that market opportunity lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer john it s a little premature to talk about the runway i think that we ll talk to that specifically on the next call in two months but as it relates to opportunity i can say that we do believe there s a lot of white space when you look at sprouts like customers and you look at across the u s there are many many many places today where there are sprouts like customers that we don t serve today number one number two though what s most critical is that we can go after those customers and do it in a profitable way with an operating box that makes sense and creates the right kinds of returns that create shareholder value and that s the part that we re working on and that s a part that we re refining and we re making sure that we re going to get it right before we go after those customers and that s the work that you ll hear more about next quarter jack sinclair chief executive officer we do believe there s plenty of opportunity john going forward that s for sure john heinbockel guggenheim securities analyst okay thank you jack sinclair chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from chuck cerankosky of north coast research please go ahead chuck cerankosky north coast research analyst good afternoon everybody quick thing on the balance sheet you finished with the cash balance up significantly any particular reason for that was that timing and could you have been more aggressive on buying back stock and i have a follow up lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer well as it stands right now chuck our intention of buying back stock we bought back a big chunk earlier in the year we then made sure we were buying back any sort of dilution for the next year or this coming year that we re in today but as it relates to the we want to get through the strategy work first before we continue to buy back stock we don t have a new authorization our authorization i believe expired at the end of the year so we don t have a new authorization right now any cash proceeds we re going to use to pay down on our revolver and once we really refined our strategy to determine how much our capital needs are going to be each and every year we ll revisit what s left over and what we do with it chuck cerankosky north coast research analyst got it and look at the comp guidance for 2020 anything in the economy that influences you it does look conservative or are you just concerned about some of the traffic issues you re facing lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer there s nothing on the economy front we re a domestic u s we re not impacted by the things that are impacting the global economy which then have residual impacts locally but as it relates to the comp guidance yes we are being prudent we believe as it relates to the potential volatility that we re going to have ongoing through the year for traffic as it relates specifically to how we promote and where we promote chuck cerankosky north coast research analyst so you re talking about a little bit of experimenting perhaps realized some things might not work before people catch on to the treasure hunt aspects of it lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer absolutely we ve been doing experimenting ever since jack arrived we ve done a lot of experiments a lot have worked some have not and we ll continue to be experimenting through this fiscal year but we don t think we re going to be doing anything that s going to dramatically impact us negatively or positively at this stage chuck cerankosky north coast research analyst okay great thank you operator our next question comes from judah frommer of credit suisse your line is open judah frommer credit suisse analyst hi thanks so first question is regarding the language about the 2020 outlook i think it says something along the lines of the outlook doesn t contemplate strategic changes it sounds like the strategy is contemplating changes in pricing and promotion so what else could change within the strategy that may throw the outlook off course lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer well as it relates to strategic changes we re still working through the strategy it is as it relates to the promotional side of the house that work we re doing already that s not that s tactical work that we re working on every day to continue to make the business a better business while working on any sort of longer term what i would call impactful things like the store growth like the size of the box like the desired pace at which we grow shifting of categories a little bit so we re going to have more complete information on that at the next quarter but bear in mind the direction we re going or leaning is in our opinion is going to improve the runway of this company and the performance of this company along the way and there may be some short term wins or losses as well but we haven t articulated that to date judah frommer credit suisse analyst okay that s helpful and then maybe more broadly on the competitive environment clearly you ve seen i think some concepts that people would consider somewhat similar to sprouts go bankrupt recently obviously very different leverage profiles there but kind of similar fresh led concepts and you see kind of the bigger grocers in the country continue to focus on fresh so how do you think about your position do you think about price gaps or promotion within fresh and produce differently than center store than maybe you did previously jack sinclair chief executive officer we certainly spend a lot of time looking at our own business as opposed to looking at our competitors business i think the reality of our operation and this is the thing that i think i ve learned most in the last six months is we re pretty if we do it right we get good results irrespective of what our competitors do i ve been very encouraged when i go around the country and depending on who we re sitting next to we are very much a complementary retailer as opposed to a directly competitive retailer our fresh produce operation is better than most and will stay better than most our bulk operation is pretty unique our vitamin operation is pretty unique and our grocery when we have the categories are doing really well for us or when i can t do any price comparisons because the products that we re selling are totally different to what products i can find in conventional or mass market competitors so in that sense we are watching and aware of what s going on in particular in the produce pricing marketplace but we re creating a lot of differentiation by the type of products that we re putting in and the way we re buying it and the way we re focusing behind it and i think you identified pretty well the fact that well this is a strong cash generative business with a strong balance sheet which i think contrast that a little bit with where we ve been with some of the more direct competitors in this space and they don t really have the scale i don t think to be very meaningful in the sense of hurting us or not hurting us with regard to what we have been doing with our stores i think some things we probably have learned from one or two of those competitors is if you spend too much money and too much capital and invest too much in labor in certain categories and particularly in deli and prepared foods you can put yourself in a place where the cost base is it makes it very difficult to make the returns that you d want to make and that s something that we will be reversing in our as we went down that road over the course of the last few months operator next question comes from edward kelly of wells fargo your line is open edward kelly wells fargo analyst hi good afternoon guys thanks for taking my questions i wanted to ask about the promotional strategy and the changes that you re making there and maybe if you could just provide a bit more specific color on some of the adjustments and whether you re striking the right balance i think the concern maybe is that if you pulled back on from an opening pulled back a store online or if you adjust on promotions those promotions were probably driving some traffic at a minimum i guess right and is that why we could see continued softness of traffic in 2020 and just general thoughts around how you balance all that for the long term jack sinclair chief executive officer and that s certainly very much part of what the experimentation phase over the last six nine months over the last six months have been and will be over the next few months we still got to refine every aspect of it but the reality of it is we ve turned off unprofitable customers by not going so commodity focused on the products that we put in our promotional and the promotional vehicles that we use both in terms of what we put in the store and what we put in our flyer distribution so we ve tried to take away a lot of the commodity type promotions they do drive traffic but tend to be very promiscuous customers who will go to wherever the lowest price of chicken breast is as opposed to who is going to go and buy those products that are going to differentiate and make us different and better in the marketplace we ve tried to shape the promotions toward those things that are different and better and the outcome of that potentially is you lose some unprofitable customers but in the long run it builds us a kind of profitable traffic growth that we re going to be aspiring to over the course of the next few years that makes sense edward kelly wells fargo analyst yes okay and then just lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer and it s chip and i want to i just want to point out too is there was a period of time in the first half of the year that the company was negative on traffic as well and was continuing to heat up promotions so there were promotions being piled on top of promotions on top of promotions that weren t doing anything from a traffic perspective but they were burning down margin edward kelly wells fargo analyst right okay and just a question on the store format going forward any color you can provide on the changes that you plan to make how you might see the return metrics penciling out and then just talk about your decision to accelerate growth i think most of us look at food retail as a pretty saturated industry but you re obviously confident that you can take share profitably so just some thoughts there jack sinclair chief executive officer yes i m very confident that there s more and more people interested in healthy options in terms of buying for themselves and their family i don t i think that trend is pretty clear and is going to accelerate at all income levels and all age levels i think there s a real opportunity for us to be the leader in that space and that space is getting bigger within an overall food market there s got some issues as you re describing it we re trying to we re not really thinking about the overall business we re thinking specifically around those customers and those trends in the marketplace and as we work that one through we can supply that need in our unique farmer low profile great presentation of fresh foods the combination of how bulk can help that as well it gives us a uniqueness in it and i m i was in a we opened a new store yesterday it s not far away and the passion and energy of the customers coming into that store it was in arizona but the passion and energy of the customers coming into that store for the proposition that we ve put in front of them is something that makes me really excited and positive about the opportunities going forward lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer and add real quick i just want to point out i mean the simplest at its highest level the stuff we ve articulated the store is it is going to be smaller than the 30 that s for sure it is going to be less expensive to not only build but less expensive to operate and we believe and we have a strong belief based on the looking at our customers looking where the customers are looking at our merchandise looking at what s productive merchandise what s not we have a strong belief we can still present our value proposition on the corner of main and main in a box that s less expensive than the 30 that we re doing today and less costly to operate and really not lose any sales edward kelly wells fargo analyst great thanks jack sinclair chief executive officer if anything we can recreate the farmer s market better that s the really exciting thing part of it thanks operator our next question comes from chuck grom of gordon haskett your line is open derek green gordon haskett analyst hi guys this is actually derek green right on for chuck just regarding your the tweaks made into your supply chain do you anticipate any store closures regarding that going forward or right now just openings lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer derek well right now we re focused on the openings we are going to evaluate all of our stores we ll continue to evaluate all of our stores and see how that fits in our strategy and then we ll sort through that but right now we re still working on that work derek green gordon haskett analyst all right great and then just in terms of instacart any color you can give on the benefit you re still seeing from that lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer well i mean it s a great business i mean we re up 150 for the year on home delivery we re doing almost 11 000 on a per box basis we ve got it at all 340 of our stores on the home delivery side the pickup side of the house is not really that exciting and we ve got it in 55 of our stores today it s running at about 1 4 of what the home delivery is it s not something our customers seem to be that excited about but as it relates to the delivery we re excited about that we have a great relationship with instacart and we re going to continue down that path jack sinclair chief executive officer and we got some stores doing a lot of money and that s dependent on the market a big area in particular thinking through has been performing well for us in this space and instacart doing a good job for us derek green gordon haskett analyst i understand thank you operator thank you our next question comes from robby ohmes of bank of america your line is open robby ohmes bank of america analyst hello hey guys jack just i guess two follow ups just on the fourth quarter with the less promotions and everything any impact at all from the six less shopping days or anything in your seasonal that impacted the quarter negatively any way to look at it and say that your traffic maybe would have been positive in the quarter given anything that happened jack sinclair chief executive officer i ve read that from some of the other retailers that have released and i m not we are not seeing that i think that impact has been more in the toys and nonfood side of things and it s been an impact in terms of our food business so i don t think that s a factor and we ve certainly not identified that as such robby ohmes bank of america analyst that s helpful and then just a follow up on the smaller stores and maybe home delivery penetration how are you thinking about home delivery penetration going forward and pickup and is that factored into smaller stores matter does it help or hurt home delivery penetration or pickup i m just curious how you re thinking about the role of delivery and pickup in sort of the new store formats jack sinclair chief executive officer yes i think in terms of the broader strategic challenge of this or thinking through of this one is pickup doesn t seem to be something that s really a big part of how our customers want to interface with our brand in terms of delivery smaller stores or bigger stores we can we ve got both those types of stores in our network at the moment both of them fulfill the need for home delivery for our customers pretty effectively when we do it so going forward we ll certainly pay attention to in terms of the formats we put in place and make sure it can be executed efficiently but it s not something we re seeing as a huge challenge and going forward we want to be a business where customers come to the store for the reason that they seek there s a reason to be there because there s something that they weren t expecting or something new or something fresh i always use with the team internally is farmers market is probably the fastest growing retail in the united states at the moment if we can just capture some of that growth in farmers markets we ll be pretty well placed and that requires experiential retailing it requires people to really want to be there and that s what our aspiration would be in terms of what we create in these small stores and we ve certainly got it in some of our stores today that s for sure robby ohmes bank of america analyst really helpful thanks jack jack sinclair chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from kelly bania of bmo capital your line is open kelly bania bmo capital analyst hi good evening thanks for taking my questions i think this has been asked but i m going to try again it seems to be there s a little bit of a disconnect between your more cautious comp outlook for 2020 relative to the success you ve seen with this tactical change in the promotional strategy maybe just over the last couple of quarters so i guess i m just curious is the concern maybe about is there any concern about the longer term impact of this as consumers get more accustomed to what you re promoting and how you re promoting and maybe can you help us understand if your with your comp guidance is within if your comps are within your guidance for the first quarter so far lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer well kelly this is chip first off as it relates to long term no we don t think that there s going to be this is a short term belief as we start to change the way we go to market on the promotional side that we are going to lose some traffic we continue to lose some traffic that started before we ever even started to shift so that part of it we re working through we expect that that will continue through this coming year there are it is volatile we ll see the volatility from week to week from promotion to promotion so it would be like i said earlier it would be not it would not be prudent for us to just sit here and throw out a higher comp when that s not the work that we re doing as it relates to what was the second part i apologize what kelly bania bmo capital analyst q1 lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer oh q1 q1 we re more than halfway through q1 and we gave a guidance of 0 to 1 so that s what we believe is where we ll be for the quarter kelly bania bmo capital analyst okay and i guess just another follow up in my understanding of sprouts its historical strategy was to kind of lure new consumers in with aggressively priced produce and transition them over time to some of the higher margin parts of the store and just curious how you feel about that and if you re seeing that progression and how that plays into your outlook and what kind of strategy you re it sounds like you re still developing jack sinclair chief executive officer certainly going forward kelly the strategy will be will have a foundation of very strong value produce in terms of both pricing quality product and that will be a fundamental part it was a fundamental part of the origins of the sprouts farmers market business and it will be a fundamental part of this business going forward in terms of what you then do with that traffic when it s there which is what this business and it that s not going to change either those elements across the mix of the business that will come together to create the business model that we need going forward so in some ways it will be more of the same or going back to the future in terms of how we think that went through because that s what s kind of worked and made this business great in the first place and there s no reason why that thing can t work just as efficiently going forward kelly bania bmo capital analyst thank you operator next question comes from bob summers of buckingham your line is open bob summers buckingham analyst thanks good afternoon so just to beat this to death a little bit so as you re rebalancing the promotional posture i m curious as to what type of consumer work you re doing on price or value perception and whether you re breaking that down between loyal customers cherry pickers or whatever segments you might have because i guess as we think about this with traffic negative the basket is up and then is that driven by the baskets per item product rate mix just trying to get a feel for how close on price perception you are with the customer because i think that s really with what you re doing could get away from you jack sinclair chief executive officer yes the work with again the traffic hasn t changed significantly since we ve changed it stayed at kind of negative level over the course of that time as we ve been changing around and doing experiments on our promotional strategies i think the issue that we ve done in terms of resets going forward has highlighted those pricing areas in certain categories that we need to look at and we ll talk about that a little bit in our strategy as we focus different investments in different categories we ll see there will be some elements of the customers that we re trying to target who are looking for more aggressive pricing in certain places and that will be part of our strategy going forward as we prioritize certain categories or other categories and we ll manage that within our mix and in terms of how the customers are viewing this value is an important part of our proposition and we re not seeing we re certainly not seeing anything in the short term that s doing anything other than losing some highly promotional unprofitable customers that will be promiscuous no matter what we do so getting away from that those type of customers and targeting what are we going to do to build long term profitable customers is the key to the whole strategy going forward and that s why there s some volatility in the numbers because you ll lose the immediate promiscuous customers faster than you ll gain the other customers coming through and that s what we re trying to evaluate when we re putting together everything that we ve been talking about over the last little while lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer bob i would one other thing i d make add to that is the work that we ve done and the customer research that we ve done at the end of the day we re getting very little credit historically for being a value provider to begin with bob summers buckingham analyst okay okay that makes sense and then just on any strategic changes i think a lot of us will view that as really will equate to investment spending clearly still early for you but just as a way to think about guardrails and i guess what i mean is conceptually what do you think is the organization s ability to absorb investment define the rates somehow i don t know dollars pressure on earnings what have you do you have any view on what the right way to think about that would be lawrence p molloy interim chief financial officer well one i would think about it as from a capital perspective capital may go up but from a p l perspective i don t see from an ongoing operating of the business p l i don t see any major investments in the ongoing business that s going to dilute the p l if anything it s going to be positive bob summers buckingham analyst okay thanks operator thank you at this time i d like to turn the call back over to ceo jack sinclair for closing remarks sir jack sinclair chief executive officer well thanks everybody for taking time to listen to our call today we re very pleased with the progress we ve made in q4 and we re very excited about sharing with you the future of the business starting
