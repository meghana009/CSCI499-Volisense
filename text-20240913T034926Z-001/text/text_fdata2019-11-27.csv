the field of democrats vying to win their party s nomination for a chance to oust president donald trump in 2020 is the biggest and most diverse in history what unites them is an allegiance to varying degrees to a controversial policy framework that seeks to reforge america s economy in line with the vision of a clean energy future a successful democratic challenge to trump would likely see a figure in the oval office whose policies are based on or in sympathy with the expensive and expansive green new deal gnd it is both a concept for a radically new clean energy economy and the engine that is supposed to drive growth and jobs the gnd resolution calls for a new national social industrial and economic mobilization on a scale not seen since world war ii and the new deal seeking to spurn carbon dioxide producing fossil fuels while spurring carbon free sources of energy the gnd charts a set of goals and guiding principles for the candidates to then flesh out with specific policy proposals most of the democratic 2020 contenders have expressed support for the gnd including the entire leaderboard rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y and sen ed markey d mass announce the green new deal at a press conference outside the capitol in washington on feb 7 2019 saul loeb afp getty images economically the trillions of dollars the gnd is projected to cost is also envisaged as the stimulus that will contribute to gdp and jobs employment related promises by the gnd inspired democratic candidates range from tom steyer s 46 million job years 4 6 million jobs held for 10 years to bernie sanders 20 million joe biden s 10 million pete buttigieg s 3 million and elizabeth warren s 1 million jobs economically scientifically and numerically illiterate program critics of the gnd including trump and the republicans denounce the scheme as costly radical and socialist stanford professor michael boskin has called the 10 trillion green new deal an economically scientifically and numerically illiterate program the american action forum led by former director of the congressional budget office douglas holtz eakin estimated the plan could cost between 51 93 trillion over the next decade this is a nonsensical plan that basically gives away trillions of dollars said daniel turner founder and executive director of power the future in a conversation with the epoch times bernie wants to do this to the tune of 16 trillion dollars this is totally devoid of math it s devoid of physics it s devoid of economics sanders claims his 16 3 trillion gnd inspired plan will pay for itself over 15 years by raising taxes and fees on fossil fuel companies through revenue generated by renewable energy produced by federal power authorities over 1 trillion in reduced military spending and from income tax collected from the 20 million new jobs he says his plan will create democratic presidential candidate sen bernie sanders i vt speaks during an event at drake university in des moines iowa on nov 9 2019 scott morgan reuters he wants to give 2 trillion to american consumers to buy electric vehicles turner said adding 2 trillion is half our federal budget right now where is this 2 trillion coming from look at the amount of tens of millions of dollars that the fossil fuel industry pumps into our economy through tax revenue we eliminate that but we re supposed to have the same amount of revenue in the treasury that s nonsense in his plan sanders has proposed bolder energy related goals and on a tighter timeline than the net zero emissions by 2050 called for in the gnd resolution reaching 100 percent renewable energy for electricity and transportation by no later than 2030 and complete decarbonization of the economy by 2050 at the latest sanders says on his campaign page when he says we are going to be carbon free by 2030 we re going to produce all of our electricity and all of our transportation without fossil fuels that s just a myth turner said that s just not physically technologically possible to do that right now turner argues that a top down state driven push to reject fossil fuels and adopt green energy would cause massive job losses and spikes in prices of food and electricity hitting america s poorest the hardest besides turner adds a gnd inspired transition is only possible under circumstances of greater government control and reduced civil liberties the green new deal is not about the environment and it s not about climate change turner argues it s a socialist manifesto this is a way to restructure america saikat chakrabarti former chief of staff to rep alexandria ocasio cortez and author of the gnd appeared to admit as much the interesting thing about the green new deal is it wasn t originally a climate thing at all chakrabarti said we really think of it as a how do you change the entire economy thing geologist gregory wrightstone author of inconvenient facts the science that al gore doesn t want you to know told the epoch times that a radical shift away from fossil fuels into unproven and unreliable sources of energy would cause not just economic contraction but more human misery we re being told no don t use our resources to better mankind you need to quit using fossil fuels that are actually lifting people out of generational poverty wrightstone said there are an estimated 4 billion people around the earth who are living in energy poverty there are 4 million deaths a year from lung disease from people cooking in their homes with wood a lot of it dried dung they could benefit from more electrification propane compressed natural gas so they don t have to die an early death what these people are doing who are pushing the green new deal and the paris climate accord they re destining billions of people around the world to continued generational poverty wrightstone said we ve been lifting people out of poverty using fossil fuels by providing abundant affordable reliable energy and not one of those three words are associated with wind or solar destroyer of societies in the economic arena trump believes his fight in next year s election is to counter a risky socialist experiment that would throw his roaring trumponomics fueled economy into a tailspin more fundamentally trump views the election as a battle for the soul of the nation here in the united states we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country tonight we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country he said during the state of the union address later during an address at the united nations trump called socialism a destroyer of societies one of the most serious challenges our countries face is the specter of socialism trump said it s the wrecker of nations and the destroyer of societies trump s economic policies have been forged in the spirit of reaganomics market led not government driven and based on tax cuts deregulation and an embrace of fossil fuel production lawrence kudlow former financial analyst and current head of the national economic council under trump characterized the president s position on the economy in the foreword to the book trumponomics writing that trump says we can get to 3 4 or even 5 percent growth through tax reduction deregulation american energy production and fairer trade deals and he is exactly right he wanted tax cuts he wanted to deregulate he wanted to get the government out of the way is how kudlow explained the policy rationale of the trump administration economic policies of 2020 democratic leaderboard the democratic white house race has featured a three way battle at the top of recent national polls between moderate biden and progressive leaders warren and sanders buttigieg took the lead in two recent polls in iowa and is also rising in new hampshire another early voting state the mayor of south bend indiana could count on the support of 26 percent of likely democratic iowa caucusgoers in the civiqs iowa state university poll released thursday while warren and sanders followed at 19 percent and 18 percent respectively biden was fourth at 12 percent an average of a dozen or so polls between nov 11 and nov 20 compiled by realclearpolitics shows biden in the lead with 29 8 percent followed by sanders at 19 3 percent and warren at 18 5 percent joe biden the early democratic front runner in opinion polls biden waited until april to enter the race the 77 year old served eight years as president barack obama s vice president and 36 years in the u s senate he stands at the center of the democratic debate over whether the party s standard bearer should be a veteran politician or a newcomer and whether a liberal or a moderate has a better chance of defeating trump the early democratic front runner in opinion polls biden waited until april to enter the race the 77 year old served eight years as president barack obama s vice president and 36 years in the u s senate he stands at the center of the democratic debate over whether the party s standard bearer should be a veteran politician or a newcomer and whether a liberal or a moderate has a better chance of defeating trump as part of his plan biden promises to invest in infrastructure and thus create good union jobs that expand the middle class biden has also promised to boost federal investments in low income neighborhoods to ensure that every american has access to clean drinking water well paved roads high speed broadband safe schools and affordable housing his plan includes workforce retraining and apprenticeship programs to help displaced workers transition to a green economy the former vp cited an international monetary fund study that found increasing infrastructure investment by 1 percent of gdp in advanced countries can raise growth by 0 4 percent to 1 5 percent and foster technological innovation to that end biden said he would build a new resilient infrastructure economy which would involve things like large scale tree planting to fight urban heat and resilient infrastructure design like the construction of bridges that don t wash out during storms and floods biden claims his plan would turn america into a the world s clean energy superpower and would lead to the creation of a new class of well paying jobs and job training around climate resilient industries biden says he would launch a new generation of low carbon trucking shipping and aviation technologies and incentivize the adoption of electric vehicles he said he would ensure that the u s department of energy invests 5 billion over five years in battery and energy storage technology to spur breakthroughs that can boost the range and slash the price of electric cars his plan to help america s small manufacturers involves quadrupling funding for the manufacturing extension partnership a program designed to provide small manufacturers with the technical expertise needed to compete in a global economy he would also support budding farmers by expanding the obama biden administration s microloan program for new and beginning farmers doubling the maximum loan amount to 100 000 biden also promises to spark the second great railroad revolution and vows to make the largest ever investment in clean energy research and innovation amounting to 400 billion over 10 years which he says is twice the investment of the apollo program which put a man on the moon in today s dollars in terms of taxation biden proposes to change the tax code to increase the tax burden on the wealthy who according to his campaign website have gotten too many tax breaks for too long he has argued for a blanket repeal of trump s tax cut arguing that it has disproportionately benefited the rich and fueled income inequality biden s proposal to bring the tax rate back to pre trump levels would mean raising rates across the board for all taxpayers raising taxes on family owned businesses and bringing the corporate income tax rates back from the current 21 percent up to 35 percent one of the highest rates in the world he also said he wants to raise taxes on long term capital gains and qualified dividends the capital gains tax should be at what the highest minimum tax should be we should raise the tax back to 39 6 percent instead of 20 percent biden said in an interview on iowa public television biden has also called for the elimination of special tax breaks that reward special interests he has also vowed to close 1 6 trillion in tax loopholes including pledging to eliminate the stepped up basis loophole which allows heirs to pay less in taxes on their inheritance an exchange between biden and a reporter at a campaign stop in iowa in september cast the ideological divide between him and his fellow democratic primary candidates into vivid relief biden was asked why if the unemployment rate in iowa was 3 4 percent when trump first took office and is now down to around 2 5 percent would voters want to risk changing course along the lines that biden was proposing make your case the reporter insisted the former vp declined saying i m not going to thanks to president trump s pro growth agenda unemployment is at record lows wage growth is strong and household incomes are higher than they were under obama biden trump campaign spokeswoman sarah matthews told the wall street journal on nearly every indicator americans are better off than they were four years ago with joe biden in office paul driessen a senior policy adviser for the committee for a constructive tomorrow cfact and author of eco imperialism green power black death argues that biden s job creation claims within his gnd based clean energy revolution scheme will be foiled and offset many times over by job losses in the traditional energy production sector modern industrialized societies simply cannot function on expensive intermittent weather dependent electricity driessen said in an op ed titled reality bites joe biden s clean energy revolution as germany britain spain australia and other countries have shown that kind of energy eliminates 3 4 times more jobs than it creates especially in factories and assembly lines which cannot operate with repeated electricity interruptions bernie sanders for the 2020 presidential race the 78 year old sanders is fighting to stand out in a field of progressives running on issues he brought into the democratic party mainstream four years ago the centerpiece of his economic proposals is a radical 16 3 trillion version of the green new deal which he calls a 10 year nationwide mobilization centered around justice and equity during which climate change will be factored into virtually every area of policy from immigration to trade to foreign policy and beyond sixteen trillion why not 400 trillion money doesn t have a value at a certain point when you re a socialist turner told the epoch times about sanders s scheme which he called a plan for a complete restructuring of the whole economy from the top down according to the plan the united states would generate 100 percent of its electricity from renewable energy by 2030 and achieve full decarbonization by 2050 we are going to invest massively in wind solar and other sustainable energies sanders told a crowd in sacramento this summer we have got to lead the entire world in a new energy direction sanders said other components of sanders s economic policy involve supporting small family farms by investing in ecologically regenerative and sustainable agriculture he has also promised to invest in conservation and public lands to heal our soils forests and prairie lands according to sanders his plan would create 20 million jobs needed to solve the climate crisis these jobs will be good paying union jobs with strong benefits and safety standards in steel and auto manufacturing construction energy efficiency retrofitting coding and server farms and renewable power plants sanders said we will also create millions of jobs in sustainable agriculture engineering a reimagined and expanded civilian conservation corp and preserving our public lands he said his plan would pay for itself over 15 years by raising taxes and fees on fossil fuel companies through revenue generated by renewable energy produced by federal power authorities over 1 trillion in reduced military spending and from income tax collected from the new jobs he claims his plan will create the benefits are enormous sanders claims on his campaign website by taking bold and decisive action we will save 2 9 trillion over 10 years 21 trillion over 30 years and 70 4 trillion over 80 years his plan also outlines dozens of policies to aggressively move the united states off fossil fuels in the electricity transportation and building sectors it bans the practice of fracking to extract natural gas and oil the import and export of fossil fuels and sets a moratorium on nuclear power plant license renewals turner argues sanders is seeking to move too quickly into new technologies that aren t ready to offer realistic solutions or opportunities i think green technology is fascinating he said i think there s a lot of hope there a lot of potential and the future is going to be green and one day we will discover the perfect fuel source and it will have no byproduct and it will be totally free but we haven t discovered it yet i can guarantee you this the genius scientists the men and women who will make that discovery right now are driving to work they are working in laboratories that run on conventional energy and if we hamper ourselves now we will not be able to power the future so why are we going to cripple ourselves now to give ourselves a worse tomorrow sanders has also come out in favor of an annual tax on the extreme wealth of the top 0 1 percent of u s households which would apply to anyone with a net worth over 32 million sanders says on his campaign website that he expects his wealth tax to bring in an estimated 4 35 trillion over the next decade and cut the wealth of billionaires in half over 15 years that s why it costs 16 trillion turner argues if you want to destroy capitalism and implement socialism you have take over all the means of control and all of the private property from people and by forcing them to buy green by forcing them to buy this car or build that type of house they will effectively do it elizabeth warren the 70 year old u s senator from massachusetts is a leader of the party s progressive wing and a fierce critic of wall street she has focused her presidential campaign on a populist anti corruption message promising to fight what she calls a rigged system that favors the wealthy she has released an array of policy proposals on everything from breaking up big tech companies to implementing a wealth tax on the richest americans warren s pitch is for big structural changes to the economy to help americans pushed to the ragged edge of the middle class and who can barely breathe after decades of largely flat wages and exploding household costs experts contend that her perspective overlooks the facts about how well the economy is performing lee ohanian economics professor at ucla and senior fellow at the hoover institute says warren s type of rhetoric such as dismissing the strength of the economy by arguing that higher equity values only benefit the wealthy is misleading more than half of americans indirectly hold stocks through various retirement plans moreover higher stock values promote business expansion and economic growth real gdp growth averaged 2 1 percent under obama but is averaging around 2 9 percent under trump ohanian wrote in an op ed with the lowest unemployment rate in about 50 years and the strongest real gdp and productivity growth in about 20 years there is no doubt that this is one of the best economies we have had in a long time he added her green manufacturing plan which she calls the first example of economic patriotism in action would entail big and bold investments in american research american industry and american workers she claims that by leading the global effort to combat climate change it will be possible to create more than a million good jobs here at home the first part of warren s plan calls for spending 400 billion over 10 years on clean energy research and development warren said she believes the united states could one day use no fossil fuels it s part of our technological bandwidth she said in a brief news conference after a rally in detroit earlier this year next warren proposed increasing the amount the united states spends on american made clean renewable and emission free energy products for federal state and local use and for export warren said the united states currently spends 1 5 trillion on defense procurement which she called bloated and argued that an equal amount should be spent on clean energy overall her plan calls for a 1 1 trillion investment that claims to be able to create 3 million jobs warren has proposed to raise the minimum wage to 15 an hour and has vowed to strengthen unions both are moves that ohanian argues will stunt economic growth private sector unionization has declined from about 35 percent in the 1950s to only about 6 percent today he said an important reason for the decline is that the old school union model of chronic labor conflict and strikes makes u s industry uncompetitive which in turn destroys jobs another reason for lower unionization today is that today s workers value flexibility and the opportunity to negotiate for themselves neither of which are present within a union collective bargaining contract in her plan warren pledged to increase protections for home healthcare workers a growing segment of the workforce as well as employees who entered the country illegally she would roll back trump era restrictions on the power of unions representing federal workers and work to restore public employee bargaining rights that have been reduced in several states warren has also pledged to put a total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases for drilling offshore and on public lands and ban fracking everywhere on her first day in office this is a proposal wrightstone has sharply criticized we ve got people in the democrat candidates they re really in a competition to see who can de industrialize america the quickest he told the epoch times they re demonizing co2 what should be considered the miracle molecule wrightstone said what they want to do is rein in carbon dioxide emissions by cutting fossil fuel use they re also proposing banning fracking he added some want to ban fracking from the first day if they take office some soon after but it s fracking a combination of fracking and horizontal drilling that s allowed the united states to produce these vast amounts of really low cost natural gases that are driving a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions warren also proposes to change corporate law to let workers at large american companies elect at least 40 percent of the company s board members to give them a powerful voice in decisions about wages and outsourcing she plans to get tough on corporations with a new era of strong antitrust enforcement and has vowed to make a historic investment in housing that would bring down rents by 10 percent across america and create 1 5 million new jobs warren has proposed the most aggressive tax the rich scheme in the field called the ultra millionaire wealth tax the scheme would target about 75 000 households in total those with a net worth of more than 50 million would be taxed 2 cents on every dollar of net worth above 50 million and a 3 cents on every dollar of net worth above 1 billion when you re above 50 million it s not only about the real estate it s about your stock portfolio the diamonds the rembrandt and the yacht warren said a simulation on her campaign website shows that a hypothetical heir with a net worth of 20 billion would pay a 2 percent tax on the 950 million between 50 million and 1 billion and a 3 percent tax on the remaining 19 billion for a total annual liability of 589 million according to estimates by economists emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman the tax would bring in 2 75 trillion in revenue over 10 years warren a former harvard bankruptcy law professor has not specified how much of the trump tax cut she would repeal but according to forbes contributor and licensed cpa tony nitti warren has proposed repealing enough of the tax cuts and jobs act to raise another 1 trillion of revenue in his deep dive into warren s tax plan nitti says it s not clear where that revenue would come from but notes that it s likely that she intends to cut corporate deductions or repeal the new 20 percent deduction against pass through income earned by sole proprietors s corporation shareholders and partners in partnerships on her campaign website warren has proposed a real corporate profits tax scheme which would apply to companies that report more than 100 million in profits last year this was around 1 200 companies that first 100 million is left alone but for every dollar of profit above 100 million the corporation will pay a 7 percent tax warren said that means amazon would pay 698 million in taxes instead of paying zero and occidental petroleum would pay 280 million in taxes instead of paying zero she said economists saez and zucman estimate her real corporate profits tax scheme will bring in 1 trillion in revenue over the next 10 years some wall street investors and democratic donors have sharply criticized warren s policies on issues from taxation to affordable healthcare because they are impractical speaking at the reuters global investment outlook 2020 summit several investors said however they were not too worried by a potential warren presidency because many of her plans would struggle to pass what is likely to be a divided congress her policies scare the heck out of every wealthy guy i know said mike novogratz ceo of galaxy digital which invests in cryptocurrency and blockchain but he added they don t scare me as much because i don t think they re practical while cool on warren s specific policy proposals several donors and investors credited her political savvy and financial knowledge and agreed that policymakers needed to confront rising income inequality or face long term adverse social and economic repercussions but many questioned whether warren s proposals would successfully address these issues saying they feared her plan to fund trillions of dollars in social projects through a range of taxes could have unintended adverse consequences such as reducing economic growth or dampening the stock market senator warren is saying things that are difficult to enact and i don t know how you end up paying for them said marc lasry

infrastructure as previously reported the company undertook to purchase iru as long as the network is active to 10 15 of ibc s fiber optic home pass i e fiber optic actually reaching connected to the building as shall be deployed by ibc in the next 15 years current undertaking of 15 and may decrease to 10 under certain conditions the iru consideration is subject to actual ibc s home pass deployment currently the annual consideration the company pays ibc for the iru amounts to approximately nis 18 million substantially lower than the alternative payment to bezeq and is expected to increase in accordance with the actual addition of home passes deployed in the future the iru consideration is paid to ibc in installments over a period of 9 years as the company is presently ibc s sole iru customer ibc s revenues and financial position depend largely on the company and therefore adverse effects to the company s financial position as previously discussed may adversely affect ibc s ability to raise debt to finance its operations should ibc require additional investments in order to fund its operations the company as indirect shareholder of ibc is expected to invest additional funds in ibc for the continued deployment of its network thereby adding further burden on the company itself further any adverse changes to ibc s competitive standing and increase of the competition level which ibc faces such as bezeq the israeli communications company ltd or bezeq commencing to operate its fiber optic network bezeq has already executed a substantial part of the investments thereof may adversely affect the company as ibc s indirect shareholder as well as its customer given the company s 15 year undertaking to purchase iru to ibc s network at the agreed price regardless more favorable proposals should such be available to the company in the future for developments which may influence the competition level in the fiber optic infrastructure field and ibc s competitive standing see also public hearing regarding fiber optic deployment policy below for additional details see the company s 2018 20 f under item 4 information on the company b business overview networks and infrastructure fixed line segment fixed line infrastructure investment in ibc the company s current report on form 6 k dated august 15 2019 under other developments during the second quarter of 2019 and subsequent to the end of the reporting period company s investment transaction in ibc and company s sale of fiber optic infrastructure transaction completed and elsewhere in this report under adverse effects on our financial condition and restructuring plan labor dispute frequencies tender in july 2019 the company reported that the israeli ministry of communications published a frequencies tender including for 5g services expected to be conducted in q4 2019 after carefully reviewing the tender documents including the tender principles and license requirements the company is of the opinion that certain tender principles and license requirements are unreasonable and must be corrected before the tender process proceeds any further the company and its network sharing partners requests to the ministry of communications or moc to remedy the material failures noted by the operators and delay the tender process until such corrections are made were not answered to the point and therefore the company and its network sharing partners intend to petition the competent court to instruct the moc to remedy the failures and delay the tender process until such failures were corrected the company cannot guarantee a favorable outcome to such petitions failure to remedy such shortcomings may result in the company having to pay sums substantially higher than those paid by other contenders in the tender not win frequencies or win a smaller quantity of frequencies than the quantity it requires and undertake to make material investments regardless of their economic viability in order to maintain its competitive standing in the cellular market further more the tender includes additional material economic uncertainties some of which are relevant to all contenders such as whether certain frequencies fees discounts proposed by the tender committee would be approved by the relevant ministries and others relevant only to part of the contenders the company included such as in relation to the previously reported frequencies transfer failure to resolve such uncertainties before the tender is held would require the company to participate in the tender under material uncertain conditions and under unequal burdens at this time before the company and its network sharing partners have submitted a joined proposal agreement for the tender committee s prior approval as the company may only participate through a joined proposal with its network sharing partners under the principles of the tender and as the company cannot anticipate what would be the minimum bids set by the moc nor what would be the final payment the company would have to pay for the frequencies the company cannot evaluate its implications on the company failure to agree on a joint proposal agreement or other solution if possible may prevent the company from participating in the frequency tender and thereby materially adversely affect its competitive abilities further winning additional frequencies would require the company to make substantial investments in its cellular network thereby imposing additional financial burden on the company which may have adverse effects on the company s financial condition and may lead to additional downgrade of its debentures related rating in addition the additional frequencies require the construction or change of hundreds of cell sites the difficulties in obtaining the required consents and permits particularly building permits for cell sites from local planning and building authorities none of the frequencies proposed in the tender are specifically detailed in the charts attached to the israeli national zoning plan 36 to which several local planning and building authorities refuse to provide building permits in reliance on such plan and the substantial limitations on the company s ability to construct new cell sites or change existing cell sites based on an exemption from the requirement to obtain a building permits may prevent the company from meeting the deployment requirements which will be set in its license with relation to the frequencies proposed in the tender should the company win them and from meeting the deployment requirements which may entitle the company to performance based incentives as well as expose the company to additional litigation and such litigation s consequences for additional details

israeli communications and treasury offices and the competition authority tasked with examining the need for updating fiber optic deployment and service obligations of landline operators who own their own infrastructure and under current regulation are required to universally deploy each network they deploy and the need for deployment incentives in areas where no deployment obligations be determined after economic viability tests published its recommendations for public hearing the recommendations include under reasonable scenarios no economic viability exists for one company s universal deployment bezeq will not be subject to universal deployment requirement in regards to deploying fiber optics but would rather select the areas in which to deploy its fiber optics and in those areas bezeq will be obligated to provide service to all homes within 5 years a trust established by the state of israel for that purpose the trust will conduct tenders to subsidize deployment of fiber optic by bezeq s competitors in areas where bezeq chooses not to deploy fiber optic non bezeq areas based on economic viability and efficiency the winner would be obligated to provide wholesale services to other competitors at wholesale rates bezeq may not participate in the tenders nor acquire wholesale service in those areas though its subsidiaries may do so the winner of the subsidy tender may use bezeq s infrastructure in the non bezeq areas for rates significantly lower than the current wholesale rates only the winner will be entitled to the subsidy as well for that purpose the

company s rating in relation to the company s debentures traded on the tel aviv stock exchange was downgraded to ila and the company s rating outlook was maintained at negative our and another cellular operator s controlling shareholder recognized a substantial impairment of goodwill expense associated with the company and the other cellular operator in their respective financial reports for the second quarter of 2019 and the already intense competition in the cellular market further heightened with campaigns announcing tariffs as low as us 3 4 per month for a cellular package these developments had an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and the perception of the israeli telecommunications market in general and more specifically of the company given its substantial debt resulting in the substantial decrease of the company s shares hardening requirements to access additional credit from banks and increase of the company debentures yield signifying increased cost of future debt raised from the capital market therefore the company may be required to raise debt on less favorable and costly terms to the company than in previous debt raisings assuming there will be no adverse effects on the company s condition the company expects to raise additional debt before 2021 year end or earlier depending on market conditions as previously reported the company is taking actions to improve its financial condition and strengthen the company in light of the intense competition in the market in september 2019 the company announced that following

expenses and payments to suppliers substantial reduction in manpower which at this point will not include sale and service customer facing personnel and reduction of landline wholesale access fees cost cutting initiatives have begun immediately following the publication of the plan and includes reduction of consideration to suppliers for a certain period sale of internet services using ibc israel broadband company 2013 ltd ibc s infrastructure under the previously reported indefeasible right of use agreement or iru instead of the more costly landline wholesale arrangement and entering negotiations with the employees representatives in order to change the current collective employment agreement and reach new agreements as previously reported in september 2019 the histadrut the union representing the company s employees sent the company a labor dispute announcement under the announcement the company s employees would be entitled to take organizational steps including a strike as of october 10 2019 notwithstanding the aforesaid the employees representatives commenced a sudden and unlawful strike encompassing the vast majority of the company s operations which ended the following day following an understanding that negotiations would commence after the jewish holidays of october which happened the negotiations do not annul the labor dispute announcement and do not prevent the employees representatives from taking additional organizational steps including a strike 2 cutting investments reduction of the company capex level to appx nis 450 500 million per annum to

and results as they are subject to uncertainties and assumptions about the company s ability to carry out the plan including its ability to reach agreements with the relevant parties and receive required approvals including the company s ability to reach agreement with the employees representatives on changes to current collective employment agreement the terms under which such agreements will be reached and their timing israeli capital market conditions and israeli telecommunications market conditions the final agreements and conditions could lead to materially different outcome than that set forth above furthermore whereas successful outcome of the plan is expected to strengthen the company and enable the company to participate in mergers acquisitions and other opportunities that may present themselves arise in the telecommunications arena in the next few years a less successful outcome or other adverse effects on the company s results of operations may result in the strengthening of other competitors through mergers acquisitions and the likes to which the company is not a party which may result in further weakening of the company s competitive standing including

of an investment transaction in ibc and the sale of the company s independent fiber optic infrastructure in residential areas to ibc which joins ibc s existing and future deployed fiber optic infrastructure as previously reported the company undertook to purchase iru as long as the network is active to 10 15 of ibc s fiber optic home pass i e fiber optic actually reaching connected to the building as shall be deployed by ibc in the next 15 years current undertaking of 15 and may decrease to 10 under certain conditions the iru consideration is subject to actual ibc s home pass deployment currently the annual consideration the company pays ibc for the iru amounts to approximately nis 18 million substantially lower than the alternative payment to bezeq and is expected to increase in accordance with the actual addition of home passes deployed in the future the iru consideration is paid to ibc in installments over a period of 9 years as the company is presently ibc s sole iru customer ibc s revenues and financial position depend largely on the company and therefore adverse effects to the company s financial position as previously discussed may adversely affect ibc s ability to raise debt to finance its operations should ibc require additional investments in order to fund its operations the company as indirect shareholder of ibc is expected to invest additional funds in ibc for the continued deployment of its network thereby adding further burden on the company itself further any adverse changes to ibc s competitive standing and increase of the competition level which ibc faces such as bezeq the israeli communications company ltd or bezeq commencing to operate its fiber optic network bezeq has already executed a substantial part of the investments thereof may adversely affect the company as ibc s indirect shareholder as well as its customer given the company s 15 year undertaking to purchase iru to ibc s network at the agreed price regardless more favorable proposals should such be available to the company in the future for developments which may influence the competition level in the fiber optic infrastructure field and ibc s competitive

adverse effects on our financial condition and restructuring plan labor dispute frequencies tender in july 2019 the company reported that the israeli ministry of communications published a frequencies tender including for 5g services expected to be conducted in q4 2019 after carefully reviewing the tender documents including the tender principles and license requirements the company is of the opinion that certain tender principles and license requirements are unreasonable and must be corrected before the tender process proceeds any further the company and its network sharing partners requests to the ministry of communications or moc to remedy the material failures noted by the operators and delay the tender process until such corrections are made were not answered to the point and therefore the company and its network sharing partners intend to petition the competent court to instruct the moc to remedy the failures and delay the tender process until such failures were corrected the company cannot guarantee a favorable outcome to such petitions failure to remedy such shortcomings may result in the company having to pay sums substantially higher than those paid by other contenders in the tender not win frequencies or win a smaller quantity of frequencies than the quantity it requires and undertake to make material investments regardless of their economic viability in order to maintain its competitive standing in the cellular market further more the tender includes additional material economic uncertainties some of which are relevant to all contenders such as whether certain frequencies fees discounts proposed by the tender committee would be approved by the relevant ministries and others relevant only to part of the contenders the company included such as in relation to the previously reported frequencies transfer failure to resolve such uncertainties before the tender is held would require the company to participate in the tender under material uncertain conditions and under unequal burdens at this time before the company and its network sharing partners have submitted a joined proposal agreement for the tender committee s prior approval as the company may only participate through a joined proposal with its network sharing partners under the principles of the tender and as the company cannot anticipate what would be the minimum bids set by the moc nor what would be the final payment the company would have to pay for the frequencies the company cannot evaluate its implications on the company failure to agree on a joint proposal agreement or other solution if possible may prevent the company from participating in the frequency tender and thereby materially adversely affect its competitive abilities further winning additional frequencies would require the company to make substantial investments in its cellular network thereby imposing additional financial burden on the company which may have adverse effects on the company s financial condition and may lead to additional downgrade of its debentures related rating in addition the additional frequencies require the construction or change of hundreds of cell sites the difficulties in obtaining the required consents and permits particularly building permits for cell sites from local planning and building authorities none of the frequencies proposed in the tender are specifically detailed in the charts attached to the israeli national zoning plan 36 to which several local planning and building authorities refuse to provide building permits in reliance on such plan and the substantial limitations on the company s ability to construct new cell sites or change existing cell sites based on an exemption from the requirement to obtain a building permits may prevent the company from meeting the deployment requirements which will be set in its license with relation to the frequencies proposed in the tender should the company win them and from meeting the deployment requirements which may entitle the company to performance based incentives as well as expose the company to additional litigation and such litigation s consequences for additional details

overview in 2019 the tax cuts and jobs act the act and its resulting tax reform continued to dominate the planning landscape as outlined in our 2018 year end estate planning advisory the act made significant changes to individual and corporate income taxes restructured international tax rules provided a deduction for pass through income and eliminated many itemized deductions most significantly for estate planning purposes the act temporarily doubled the estate gift and generation skipping transfer gst tax exemptions absent legislative action many of the changes imposed under the act including the increased exemptions will sunset after december 31 2025 with the laws currently scheduled to revert back to those that existed prior to the act given the uncertain political landscape practitioners continue to view this temporary increase in exemption amounts as an unprecedented opportunity for valuable estate planning this year the internal revenue service service issued technical corrections and guidance on several provisions of the act including addressing differences between the exemption amounts at the date of a gift and exemption amounts at the date of a taxpayer s death often referred to as clawback additionally one of the most significant cases decided in 2019 was the supreme court s long awaited decision in north carolina department of revenue v kimberly rice kaestner 1992 family trust kaestner was the first case in decades in which the supreme court addressed the limits of the constitutionality of state taxation of trusts while the permanency of the act s provisions still remains uncertain the current environment provides a great deal of opportunity for new planning we are encouraging clients to build flexibility into their estate plans and to use this window of opportunity to engage in planning to take advantage of the increased estate gift and gst tax exemptions the following are some key income and transfer tax exemption and rate changes under the act including inflation adjusted amounts for 2020 federal estate gst and gift tax rates for 2019 the estate gift and gst applicable exclusion amounts are 11 4 million for 2020 the estate gift and gst applicable exclusion amounts will be 11 58 million the maximum rate for estate gift and gst taxes will remain at 40 percent annual gift tax exemption each year individuals are entitled to make gifts using the annual exclusion amount without incurring gift tax or using any of their lifetime applicable exclusion amount against estate and gift tax the annual exclusion amount is 15 000 per donee in 2019 thus this year a married couple together can gift 30 000 to each donee without gift tax consequences in 2020 the annual exclusion for gifts will remain at 15 000 the limitation on tax free annual gifts made to noncitizen spouses will increase from 155 000 in 2019 to 157 000 in 2020 federal income tax rates the act provides for seven individual income tax brackets with a maximum rate of 37 percent the 37 percent tax rate will affect single taxpayers whose income exceeds 500 000 indexed for inflation and 518 400 in 2020 and married taxpayers filing jointly whose income exceeds 600 000 indexed for inflation and 622 050 in 2020 estates and trusts will reach the maximum rate with taxable income over 12 500 adjusted for inflation and 12 950 in 2020 a 0 percent capital gains rate applies for single filers with an income up to 38 600 40 000 for 2020 or married taxpayers filing jointly with an income up to 77 200 80 000 in 2020 a 15 percent capital gains rate applies for income above this threshold up to 425 800 for single taxpayers 441 450 in 2020 and 479 000 for married taxpayers filing jointly 496 600 in 2020 the 20 percent capital gains rate applies above these thresholds the standard deduction was increased to 24 000 24 800 in 2020 for married individuals in 2019 the threshold for the imposition of the 3 8 percent medicare surtax on investment income and 0 9 percent medicare surtax on earned income is 200 000 for single filers 250 000 for married filers filing jointly and 12 750 for trusts and estates 12 950 in 2020 tax cuts and jobs act the act has proven to have many implications for domestic corporate and individual income tax as well as federal gift estate and gst tax fiduciary income tax and international tax implications since the act s enactment various technical corrections have been issued as has the service guidance on certain aspects of the new tax regime in light of the act and recent guidance from the service it is important to review existing estate plans consider future planning to take advantage of the increased exemption amounts and maintain flexibility to allow for future strategic planning because of the continued importance of the act s new tax laws the most significant changes and recent guidance are summarized below gift estate and gst exemptions rates and stepped up basis the act retained the federal estate gift and gst tax rates at a top rate of 40 percent as well as the marked to market income tax basis for assets includible in a decedent s taxable estate at death while the federal gift estate and gst taxes were not repealed by the act fewer taxpayers will be subject to these transfer taxes due to the act s increase of the related exemption amounts under the act the base federal gift estate and gst tax exemptions doubled from 5 million per person to 10 million per person indexed for inflation as noted above the relevant exemption amount for 2019 is 11 4 million per person resulting in a married couple s ability to pass 22 8 million worth of assets free of federal estate gift and gst taxes these amounts will increase each year until the end of 2025 with inflation adjustments to be determined by the chained consumer price index cpi which will lead to smaller increases in the relevant exemption amounts in future years than would have resulted from the previously used traditional cpi the exemption amount in 2020 will be 11 58 million without further legislative action the increased exemption amounts will sunset and the prior exemption amounts indexed for inflation using the chained cpi figure will be restored beginning in 2026 while the federal estate tax exemption amount has increased note that multiple u s states impose a state level estate tax the estate tax exemption amount in some of these states matches or will match the increased federal estate tax exemption amount however in other states such as illinois and new york the state estate tax exemption amount will not increase with the federal estate tax exemption amount absent a change in relevant state law additionally states may have their own laws that impact planning in that state the federal estate tax exemption that applies to nonresident aliens was not increased under the act under current law the exemption for nonresident aliens remains at 60 000 absent the application of an estate tax treaty anti clawback regulations while there is uncertainty about whether future legislation will address the sunset either by extending the new exemption amounts beyond 2025 or changing the exemption amounts further the service has issued guidance on how it will address differences between the exemption amounts at the date of a gift and exemption amounts at the date of a taxpayer s death often referred to as a clawback in proposed regulations reg 106706 18 the service clarified that a taxpayer who takes advantage of the current lifetime gift tax exemption will not be penalized if the exemption amount is lower at the taxpayer s death if a taxpayer dies after january 1 2026 having used more than the statutory 5 million basic exclusion indexed for inflation but less than the 10 million basic exclusion indexed for inflation the taxpayer will be allowed a basic exclusion equal to the amount of the basic exclusion the taxpayer had used however any exemption unused during a period of higher basic exclusion amounts will not be allowed as an additional basic exclusion upon death additionally the service clarified that if a taxpayer exhausted his or her basic exclusion amount with pre 2018 gifts and paid gift tax then made additional gifts or died during a period of high basic exclusion amounts the higher exclusion will not be reduced by a prior gift on which gift tax was paid the proposed regulations do not permit gifts made during the period that the basic exclusion amount is 10 million indexed for inflation to come off the top of the higher basic exclusion amount for example if a taxpayer who has never made a taxable gift makes a gift of 5 million and then dies after the basic exclusion amount has decreased back to 5 million the gift will not be deemed to use the extra indexed 5 million of basic exclusion amount available until 2026 instead the gift would be deemed to use the taxpayer s 5 million basic exclusion amount the service could have provided that any gifts prior to 2026 come off the top of the 10 million exclusion amount in that case a taxpayer who makes a 5 million gift when the basic exclusion amount is 10 million could still retain all of the taxpayer s 5 million exclusion amount after the basic exclusion amount is reduced to 5 million in 2026 additionally the proposed regulations did not address how the reduction in the basic exclusion amount would affect portability of estate tax upon the death of a spouse income taxation of trusts and estates the act added new code section 67 g which applies to trusts and estates as well as individuals and provides that no miscellaneous itemized deductions all deductions other than those specifically listed in code section 67 b are available until the act sunsets after december 31 2025 while the act doubled the standard deduction for individuals taxpayers that are trusts and estates are not provided a standard deduction under the act trust investment management fees will no longer be deductible after the enactment of the act there was uncertainty about the deductibility of fees directly related to the administration of a trust or estate e g fiduciary compensation legal fees appraisals accountings etc historically these fees had been deductible under code section 67 e and without regard to whether they were miscellaneous itemized deductions or not in notice 2018 61 the treasury issued guidance on whether new code section 67 g eliminates these deductions this notice provides that expenses under code section 67 e are not itemized deductions and therefore are not suspended under new code section 67 g note that only expenses incurred solely because the property is held in an estate or trust will be deductible while the notice was effective july 13 2018 estates and non grantor trusts may rely on its guidance for the entire taxable year beginning after december 31 2017 new code section 67 g may also impact a beneficiary s ability to deduct excess deductions or losses of an estate or trust upon termination prior to the act it was common tax planning to carry out unused deductions of a trust or estate to the beneficiary upon termination so the deductions could be used on the beneficiary s personal income tax return under new code section 67 g these deductions are miscellaneous itemized deductions and therefore would no longer be deductible by the beneficiary notice 2018 61 notes that the service and the treasury recognize that section 67 g may impact a beneficiary s ability to deduct unused deductions upon the termination of a trust or an estate and the service and treasury intend to issue regulations in this area and request comments on this issue in the interim taxpayers should consult with their advisors about whether it would be prudent to engage in planning to utilize to the extent permissible these deductions at the trust or estate level finally the act made a number of taxpayer friendly changes to the taxation of electing small business trusts esbts nonresident aliens are now permissible potential beneficiaries of esbts as discussed below also the charitable deduction rules for esbts are now governed by code section 170 instead of code section 642 c which means that several restrictions imposed by code section 642 c e g that the charitable donation be paid out of income and pursuant to the terms of the trust no longer apply additionally an esbt s excess charitable deductions can now be carried forward five years but the percentage limitations and substantiation requirements will now apply income tax the act made significant changes to the federal income tax while many federal income tax changes under the act are beyond the scope of this advisory some are particularly relevant to estate planning the deduction for state and local taxes salt deduction was retained but is now limited to 10 000 for jointly filing taxpayers or unmarried taxpayers the 10 000 limit also applies to trusts almost immediately after the act s passage a number of states implemented workarounds to the salt deduction limit by allowing residents to contribute to state controlled charitable funds in exchange for salt credits the aim of these workarounds was to allow residents to characterize such contributions as fully deductible charitable contributions for federal income tax purposes while simultaneously permitting a credit for state or local income real estate or other taxes for the same contribution in the final regulations issued in august 2018 and published on june 13 2019 the service responded to these workarounds by limiting federal income tax deductions that taxpayers including trusts or estates are able to take upon charitable contributions to such state controlled charitable funds under code section 170 under the proposed regulations a taxpayer who makes payments or transfers property to an entity eligible to receive tax deductible contributions would have to reduce the taxpayer s charitable deduction by the amount of any state or local tax credit the taxpayer receives or expects to receive therefore a tax credit received in return for the contribution is treated as a quid pro quo benefit for the contribution reducing the amount of the charitable income tax deduction otherwise available dollar for dollar however there is a de minimis exception if the amount of the salt credit does not exceed 15 percent of the amount of the contribution the taxpayer s charitable income tax deduction is not required to be reduced in response to inquiries about how these rules would apply to businesses making charitable contributions rev proc 2019 12 was issued to provide safe harbors for c corporations and pass through entities that make charitable contributions receive a state and local tax credit and deduct the payments as a business expense under the revenue procedure c corporations may deduct the entire payment as a business expense even if the corporation receives a state tax credit pass through entities may deduct the payment as a business expense if the credit offsets a state or local tax other than an income tax for example franchise tax or property tax the act also has implications for married couples who are divorcing or contemplating a divorce the act changed prior law to provide that alimony payments will not be deductible by the payor and will not be deemed to be income to the recipient the act also repealed code section 682 which generally provided that if a spouse created a grantor trust for the benefit of his or her spouse the trust income would not be taxed as a grantor trust as to the grantor spouse after divorce to the extent of any fiduciary accounting income the recipient spouse is entitled to receive due to the repeal of code section 682 a former spouse s beneficial interest in a trust may cause the trust to be taxed as a grantor trust as to the grantor spouse even after divorce these changes to the taxation of alimony and the repeal of code section 682 do not sunset after 2025 they apply to any divorce or separation instrument executed after december 31 2018 or any divorce or separation instrument executed before that date but later modified if the modification expressly provides that changes made by the act should apply to the modification charitable deduction the act increases the percentage limitation on cash contributions to public charities from 50 percent of the donor s contribution base generally the donor s adjusted gross income to 60 percent this 60 percent limitation applies if only cash gifts are made to public charities the deduction limitations remain the same for donations of other assets such as stock real estate and tangible property business entities the act reduced the top corporate income tax rate to 21 percent to decrease the discrepancy in the tax rates between c corporations and pass through entities the act also addressed taxation of pass through entities partnerships limited liability companies s corporations or sole proprietorships that would typically be taxed at the rate of the individual owners generally new section 199a provides a deduction for the individual owner of 20 percent of the owner s qualified business income qbi this deduction has the effect of reducing the effective income tax rate for an owner in the highest tax bracket from 37 percent to 29 6 percent the deduction is subject to numerous limitations and exceptions notably the deduction may be limited for taxpayers over a certain taxable income threshold 315 000 for married taxpayers filing jointly and 157 500 for other taxpayers to be adjusted for inflation in future years for these taxpayers the deduction may be subject to limitations based on whether the entity is a specified service business an sstb which is generally a trade or business involving the performance of services in health law accounting actuarial science performing arts consulting athletics financial services investing and investment management trading or where the principal asset is the reputation or skill of one or more employees the w 2 wages paid by the business entity and the unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition ubia of qualified property held by the trade or business the service issued final regulations on section 199a on january 18 2019 followed by a slightly corrected version on february 1 2019 the service also issued rev proc 2019 11 providing guidance on calculating w 2 wages for the purposes of section 199a and notice 2019 07 providing a safe harbor for when a rental real estate enterprise will qualify as a business for purposes of section 199a the rules surrounding the deduction as well as the final regulations are very complex and taxpayers should consult with their tax advisors to determine the implications of the section 199a deduction section 199a is effective until december 31 2025 qualified opportunity zones the act provides federal income tax benefits for investing in businesses located in qualified opportunity zones opportunity zones are designed to spur economic development and job creation in distressed low income communities in all 50 states the district of columbia and u s possessions by investing eligible capital in a qualified opportunity fund a corporation or partnership that has at least 90 percent of its assets invested in qualified opportunity zone property on two measuring dates each year that has invested in qualified opportunity zone property in any of these communities and meeting certain other requirements investors can gain certain tax benefits including the deferral or exclusion of existing gain or nonrecognition of gain the service issued proposed regulations and rev rul 2018 29 on october 19 2018 and a second set of proposed regulations on april 17 2019 which addressed among other issues what transactions would trigger recognition of previously deferred gains the qualified opportunity zone regime is complex and may impact the tax and estate planning of investors taxpayers should consult with their tax and estate planning advisors to discuss the potential tax benefits and implications secure act as of the date of this advisory the setting every community up for retirement enhancement act of 2019 secure act is pending in congress but has not yet been enacted under current law an ira owner must begin withdrawing required minimum distributions rmds from a traditional ira by april 1 of the year following the year the account owner turns 70y2 the secure act would increase the required minimum distribution age for taking rmds from traditional iras from 70y2 to 72 this change would be effective for distributions required to be made after december 31 2019 for individuals who attain age 70y2 after that date additionally the secure act would change the distributions of retirement accounts after the death of an ira account owner under current law a non spouse designated beneficiary of an ira may be able to take distributions over the beneficiary s own life expectancy under the secure act non spouse beneficiaries would generally be required to take complete distribution of inherited ira benefits by the end of the 10th calendar year following the ira owner s death the 10 year term would apply regardless of whether the ira owner died before his or her required beginning date a designated beneficiary who is a spouse minor child disabled or chronically ill person or person not more than 10 years younger than the ira owner would be exempt from this rule however with respect to a minor child the benefits must be distributed within 10 years from when the child attains the age of majority this change would become generally effective for persons dying after december 31 2019 important cases decided in 2019 constitutionality of state taxation of trusts north carolina department of revenue v kimberley rice kaestner 1992 family trust 588 u s __ june 21 2019 states have varying requirements to determine whether and to what extent a state can tax the undistributed income of a trust some states consider the residence of the grantor when the trust was established some states look at the residence of the trustee and some states impose tax liability on a trust if one or more trust beneficiaries are residents of that state however some attempts by states to impose state income taxation on trusts using existing statutes have been found to violate the u s and state constitutions on june 21 2019 the u s supreme court issued an opinion in north carolina department of revenue v kimberley rice kaestner 1992 family trust holding that the north carolina statute subjecting the trust to state income taxation based solely on a beneficiary s residence in the state violates the due process clause as applied to that particular trust where the beneficiaries received no income in the tax years at issue had no right to demand income in the tax years at issue and had no certainty of ever receiving distributions of income from the trust the kaestner 1992 family trust the trust was created in new york and governed by new york law when the trust was created no beneficiaries lived in north carolina in 1997 kimberly rice kaestner the grantor s daughter and a primary beneficiary became a north carolina resident the trust had no other connections to north carolina during the years at issue the trustee was a connecticut resident the trust records documents and books were kept in new york all trust tax returns and accountings were prepared in new york the custodians of the trust s assets were located in massachusetts and no trust income was generated from investments located in north carolina all trust distributions were made in the trustee s sole discretion so the north carolina resident beneficiary had no absolute right to the trust s assets or income additionally no distributions were actually made to the north carolina resident beneficiary during the years at issue the trust instrument did instruct the trustee to distribute the assets to the north carolina resident beneficiary when she reached a specified age but this did not occur during the tax years at issue north carolina imposes income tax on trusts based on the residence of the beneficiaries pursuant to n c g s section 105 160 2 ax is computed on the amount of the taxable income of the estate or trust that is for the benefit of a resident of this state for the tax years of 2005 2008 the trust paid in excess of 1 3 million in taxes on its accumulated income to the north carolina department of revenue based on ms kaestner s residence in north carolina the trust sought a refund of tax previously paid for the tax years 2005 2008 arguing that the relevant portion of the north carolina statute that imposed a tax on trust income was unconstitutional when the refund claim was denied the trust brought suit challenging the constitutionality of the statute both on its face and as applied to the trust the north carolina business court the north carolina court of appeals and the north carolina supreme court held that the statute as applied to the trust was unconstitutional in evaluating the basis for taxation the supreme court noted that the possession control and enjoyment of trust assets within a state is a significant factor to support taxation of a trust under the due process clause in kaestner the supreme court highlighted that in the years at issue the in state beneficiaries had not received any distributions from the trust and had no rights to control possess or enjoy the trust assets or to compel distribution from the trust therefore the mere residence of the beneficiaries in north carolina does not supply the required minimum connection necessary to support state taxation of the trust this case was significant as practitioners and taxpayers hoped that the supreme court would offer guidance on the factors used by other statutes and other situations in determining whether a state can impose income tax on the undistributed income of trusts while the decision is a taxpayer victory the opinion provides little guidance as to the constitutionality of applying those various factors to determine income taxation however the opinion does highlight that due process requires minimum contacts and an inquiry into the reasonableness of the government s action some points of the supreme court s ruling may have implications on other state s laws the supreme court s ruling discussed prior decisions on state income taxation of trusts and reiterated that the relationship between the relevant parties to the trust and the assets of the trust is highly significant in a due process analysis for example many states impose state income tax on a trust if the grantor is a resident of that state while the opinion provides little guidance regarding whether taxation based on that factor alone will satisfy the due process requirements the supreme court did note that prior cases have upheld taxation of a trust based on the grantor s residence when the grantor had the power to control or possess the trust property however no resolution was reached on whether a lesser degree of control would pass a due process analysis finally last year in fielding v commissioner of revenue minnesota supreme court no a17 1177 july 18 2018 a minnesota statute subjecting irrevocable trusts to income tax liability based on the residency of the grantor was found unconstitutional by the minnesota supreme court on june 28 2019 the u s supreme court declined to grant certiorari in this case which means that the u s supreme court will not review the decision of the lower court charitable deduction only allowed for value of assets received by private foundation in dieringer v commissioner 917 f 3d 1135 9th cir mar 12 2019 a decedent s estate planning documents provided that the residuary of the decedent s estate would pass to a private foundation the primary assets allocated to the residuary estate were comprised mostly of voting and nonvoting shares of stock in a closely held corporation with an aggregate value of approximately 14 2 million during the administration of the decedent s estate the corporation redeemed a majority of the shares from the decedent s revocable trust and the redemption price reflected significant valuation discounts for lack of marketability and lack of control as a result when the residuary estate passed to the foundation the foundation actually received promissory notes with a value of approximately 5 2 million and nonvoting shares with a discounted value of approximately 1 85 million the estate claimed an estate tax charitable deduction for the undiscounted value of the shares the ninth circuit affirmed the tax court s ruling that a charitable deduction would only be allowed for the value of the property that actually passed to the charity the ninth circuit also affirmed accuracy related penalties that the service assessed on the estate due to the disallowed portion of the charitable deduction tax court approves tax affecting for valuing limited partnership and s corporations in estate of aaron u jones v commissioner t c memo 2019 101 the taxpayer previously made gifts of voting and nonvoting interests in an s corporation and limited partnership to his children and trusts for their benefit the taxpayer reported these gifts on a timely filed gift tax return assigning a value of approximately 21 million however the service issued a notice of deficiency asserting a value of approximately 120 million and a resulting gift tax deficiency of approximately 45 million the tax court ultimately agreed with the taxpayer s appraiser that the value was approximately 24 million more significantly the tax court held that tax affecting the earnings of the s corporation and limited partnership was appropriate in determining the values of these entities under the income method in valuing the entities the taxpayer s appraiser adjusted for the differences between c corporations and pass through entities by taking into account the combined federal and state income tax rates that the entities would incur if they were c corporations though the tax court has been hesitant to accept tax affecting for almost two decades in this case the tax court found that tax affecting was appropriate given the facts important planning considerations for 2019 and 2020 given the changes implemented by the act taxpayers should review their existing estate plans and consult with their tax advisors about how to best take advantage of the higher exemption amounts while they are available the following is a summary of several items that should be considered review formula bequests many estate plans utilize formula clauses that divide assets upon the death of the first spouse between a credit shelter trust which utilizes the client s remaining federal estate tax exemption amount and a marital trust which qualifies for the federal estate tax marital deduction and postpones the payment of federal estate taxes on the assets held in the marital trust until the death of the surviving spouse while the surviving spouse is the only permissible beneficiary of the marital trust the credit shelter trust may have a different class of beneficiaries such as children from a prior marriage with the act s increase in the exemption amounts an existing formula clause could potentially fund the credit shelter trust with up to the full federal exemption amount of 11 58 million in 2020 this formula could potentially result in a smaller bequest to the marital trust for the benefit of the surviving spouse than was intended or even no bequest for the surviving spouse at all there are many other examples of plans that leave the exemption amount and the balance of the assets to different beneficiaries taxpayers should review any existing formula clauses in their current estate plans to ensure they are still appropriate given the increase in the federal exemption amounts and the implications of the potential sunset of these exemption amounts in addition taxpayers should consider alternative drafting strategies such as disclaimers to maintain flexibility in their plans income tax basis planning taxpayers should consider the potential trade offs of utilizing the increased exemption amounts during their lifetimes to gift assets to others as opposed to retaining appreciated assets until their death so that those assets receive a stepped up income tax basis taxpayers may want to consider retaining low basis assets which would then be included in their taxable estates and receive a step up in income tax basis while prioritizing high income tax basis assets for potential lifetime gift transactions in addition if a trust beneficiary has unused federal estate tax exemption consideration should be given to strategies that would lead to low income tax basis assets currently held in trust and otherwise not includable in a beneficiary s taxable estate being included in the beneficiary s taxable estate such as granting the beneficiary a general power of appointment over the trust assets utilizing the trust s distribution provisions to distribute assets directly to the beneficiary so that the assets may obtain a step up in basis upon the death of the beneficiary to whom it was distributed or converting a beneficiary s limited power of appointment into a general power of appointment by a technique commonly known as tripping the delaware tax trap consequently the assets included in the beneficiary s estate would receive a step up in income tax basis at the beneficiary s death and would take advantage of the beneficiary s unused federal estate tax exemption amount whether these techniques should be implemented depends on a careful analysis of the basis of the assets held in trust and the beneficiary s assets and applicable exclusion amounts and should be discussed with advisors 529 plan changes the act expanded the benefits of 529 plans for federal income tax purposes historically withdrawals from 529 plans have been free from federal income tax if the funds were used towards qualified higher education expenses under the act qualified withdrawals of up to 10 000 can now also be made from 529 plans for tuition in k 12 schools as a result the owner of the 529 plan can withdraw up to 10 000 per beneficiary each year to use towards k 12 education the earnings on these withdrawals will be exempt from federal income tax under the act however because each state has its own specific laws addressing 529 plan withdrawals and not all states provide that withdrawals for k 12 tuition will be exempt from state income taxes taxpayers should consult with their advisors to confirm the rules in their respective states planning to utilize increased federal exemptions given that the increased federal exemption amounts are currently set to sunset at the end of 2025 it may be prudent to make use of these increased amounts before they disappear with a caveat that the law may of course change gifting techniques to take advantage of the increased applicable exclusion amount taxpayers may want to consider making gifts to utilize the increased federal exclusion amount it is less expensive to make lifetime gifts rather than making gifts at death because tax is not imposed on dollars used to pay gift tax but estate tax is imposed on the dollars used to pay estate tax in addition taxpayers may benefit by removing any income and appreciation on the gift from their estate however taxpayers should seek advice if they have used all of their applicable exclusion amount and would pay federal gift tax on any gifts making gifts that result in significant gift tax payments may not always be advisable in the current environment a countervailing consideration of lifetime gifting is that the gifted assets will not get a step up in basis upon death as would assets held at death and will thus generate capital gains tax if they are subsequently sold for an amount higher than their basis accordingly the decision of whether and how to embark on a lifetime gifting strategy depends on a number of factors including the bases of the transferor s various assets their projected income and appreciation the total amount of the transferor s assets and the transferor s remaining applicable exclusion amount for individuals with assets far exceeding their applicable exclusion amounts lifetime gifting of high basis assets generally may be recommended however individuals with total assets close to or below their applicable exclusion amounts should exercise caution before making gifts of low basis assets instead those individuals should consider holding their assets until death in order to achieve a step up in basis upon death while minimizing estate taxes of course maintaining a comfortable standard of living is a factor that also must be considered we are available to discuss this analysis with you in more detail if undertaking a gifting strategy gifts to utilize the increased exemption may be made to existing or newly created trusts for instance a taxpayer could create a trust for the benefit of the taxpayer s spouse a spousal lifetime access trust or a slat and gift assets to the slat utilizing the taxpayer s increased federal exemption amounts the gifted assets held in the slat should not be includible in the taxpayer s or spouse s respective taxable estates and distributions could be made to the spouse from the slat to provide the spouse with access to the gifted funds if needed in the future additionally gifts could be made by a taxpayer to dynasty trusts to which gst exemption is allocated which would allow the trust property to benefit future generations without the imposition of estate or gst tax absent legislative reform the federal applicable exclusion amount will increase by 180 000 360 000 for a married couple in 2020 therefore even if a taxpayer uses some or even all of the available applicable exclusion amount before the end of 2019 additional gifts may be made in 2020 without paying any federal gift tax based on current law the applicable exclusion amount also will be adjusted for inflation in future years those resident in connecticut should be mindful that connecticut is the only state with a state level gift tax other techniques to take advantage of the increased applicable exclusion amount in addition to making gifts to utilize the increased exemption below is a summary of several other widely applicable recommendations sales to trusts taxpayers should also consider utilizing the increased federal exemption amounts through sale transactions to grantor trusts the increased federal exemption may provide a cushion against any asset valuation risk attendant with such sales taxpayers who enter into such sale transactions should consider taking advantage of the adequate disclosure rules to start the three year statute of limitations running taxpayers should also consider utilizing the increased federal exemption amounts through sale transactions to grantor trusts the increased federal exemption may provide a cushion against any asset valuation risk attendant with such sales taxpayers who enter into such sale transactions should consider taking advantage of the adequate disclosure rules to start the three year statute of limitations running loan forgiveness if taxpayers are holding promissory notes from prior estate planning transactions from loans to family members or otherwise they should consider utilizing some or all of the increased federal exemption amounts to forgive these notes if taxpayers are holding promissory notes from prior estate planning transactions from loans to family members or otherwise they should consider utilizing some or all of the increased federal exemption amounts to forgive these notes allocation of gst exemption to gst nonexempt trusts if a taxpayer s existing estate plan utilizes trusts that are subject to gst tax gst nonexempt trusts consideration should be given to allocating some or all of the taxpayer s increased gst exemption amount to such trusts if a taxpayer s existing estate plan utilizes trusts that are subject to gst tax gst nonexempt trusts consideration should be given to allocating some or all of the taxpayer s increased gst exemption amount to such trusts balancing spouses estates for married taxpayers if the value of the assets owned by one spouse is greater than the increased federal exemption amounts and greater than the value of the assets owned by the other spouse consideration should be given to transferring assets to the less propertied spouse such a transfer would provide the less propertied spouse with more assets to take advantage of the increased federal exemption amounts especially the increased gst exemption which is not portable to the surviving spouse upon the first spouse s death taxpayers should be mindful however that transfers to non u s citizen spouses are not eligible for the unlimited marital deduction for federal gift tax purposes and such transfers should stay within the annual exclusion for such gifts 155 000 in 2019 to avoid federal gift tax note that the annual exclusion for gifts to donees other than a spouse is 15 000 in 2019 for married taxpayers if the value of the assets owned by one spouse is greater than the increased federal exemption amounts and greater than the value of the assets owned by the other spouse consideration should be given to transferring assets to the less propertied spouse such a transfer would provide the less propertied spouse with more assets to take advantage of the increased federal exemption amounts especially the increased gst exemption which is not portable to the surviving spouse upon the first spouse s death taxpayers should be mindful however that transfers to non u s citizen spouses are not eligible for the unlimited marital deduction for federal gift tax purposes and such transfers should stay within the annual exclusion for such gifts 155 000 in 2019 to avoid federal gift tax note that the annual exclusion for gifts to donees other than a spouse is 15 000 in 2019 life insurance taxpayers may wish to review or reevaluate their life insurance coverage and needs with their insurance advisors taxpayers may wish to review or reevaluate their life insurance coverage and needs with their insurance advisors other planning options taxpayers should also consider other means for utilizing the increased federal exemption amounts such as triggering a transfer under code section 2519 of a surviving spouse s qualified terminal interest property in a marital trust or the formation and funding of an entity that purposely violates code section 2701 in each case utilizing the increased federal gift tax exemption amount review and revise your estate plan to ensure it remains appropriate as noted above any provisions in wills and trust agreements that distribute assets according to tax formulas and or applicable exclusion amounts should be reviewed to ensure that the provisions continue to accurately reflect the testator s or grantor s wishes when taking into account the higher applicable exclusion amounts consideration should also be given to including alternate funding formulas in wills or trust agreements that would apply if the federal estate tax exemption amounts do sunset in 2026 additionally in light of the increased exemption amounts taxpayers should also consider whether certain prior planning is now unnecessary and should be unwound such as certain qualified personal residence trusts qprts family limited partnerships flps and split dollar arrangements allocation of gst applicable exclusion amounts should be reviewed to ensure that it is utilized most effectively if one wishes to plan for grandchildren or more remote descendants in addition due to the increased gst exemption amounts available under the act allocating some or all of one s increased gst exemption amounts to previously established irrevocable trusts that are not fully gst exempt may be advisable taxpayers should continue to be cautious in relying on portability in estate planning as portability may not be the most beneficial strategy based on your personal situation in addition a deceased spouse s unused exemption dsue may not be available upon remarriage of the surviving spouse however portability may be a viable option for some couples with estates below the combined exemption amounts portability can be used to take advantage of the first spouse to die s estate tax exemption amount which for taxpayers dying before 2026 should be 10 million adjusted for inflation as well as obtain a stepped up basis at each spouse s death portability can also be used in conjunction with a trust for the surviving spouse a qtip trust in order to incorporate flexibility for post mortem planning options factors such as the asset protection benefits of utilizing a trust the possibility of appreciation of assets after the death of the first spouse to die the effective use of both spouses gst exemption and state estate tax should be discussed with advisors in determining if relying on a portability election may be advisable same sex couples should continue to review and revise their estate planning documents and beneficiary designations now that same sex marriages must be recognized by every state as well as the federal government same sex couples may want to ensure that the amount and structure of any bequests to the spouse are appropriate as well as consider the benefits of split gifting for gift tax purposes same sex couples should also consider amending previously filed federal estate gift and income tax returns and state income tax returns as well as reclaiming applicable exclusion and gst exemption amounts for transfers between the spouses made before same sex marriages were recognized for federal tax purposes unmarried couples should particularly continue to review and revise their estate planning documents and beneficiary designations as since the advent of same sex marriage it is now clear that domestic partners even if registered as such do not qualify for the federal and in many cases state tax and other benefits and presumptions that are accorded to married couples finally in view of the potential sunset of many pertinent provisions of the act estate plans should provide for as much flexibility as possible as noted above formula bequests should be reviewed to ensure they are appropriate under current law and consideration should be given to granting limited powers of appointment to trust beneficiaries to provide flexibility for post mortem tax planning a trust protector or trust protector committee may also be appointed to give a third party the ability to modify or amend a trust document based on changes in the tax laws or unforeseen future circumstances or to grant certain powers to trust beneficiaries that may have tax advantages under a new tax regime such as the granting of a general power of appointment to trust beneficiaries in order to obtain a stepped up basis in trust assets at the beneficiary s death mitigate trust income tax and avoid the medicare surtax with trust income tax planning non grantor trusts should consider making income distributions to beneficiaries trust beneficiaries may be taxed at a lower tax rate especially due to the compressed income tax brackets applicable to non grantor trusts additionally a complex non grantor trust with undistributed annual income over 12 500 adjusted for inflation will be subject to the 3 8 percent medicare surtax however some or all of the medicare surtax may be avoided by distributing such income directly to beneficiaries who are below the individual net investment income threshold amount for the medicare surtax 200 000 for single filers 250 000 for married couples filing jointly and 125 000 for married individuals filing separately careful evaluation of beneficiaries circumstances and tax calculations should be made to determine whether trusts should distribute or retain their income transfer techniques many techniques that have been utilized in prior years continue to be advantageous planning techniques under the act due to potential sunset of many applicable provisions of the act consideration should be given to planning that minimizes the risk of paying current gift taxes but still allows taking advantage of the increased exemptions amounts to shift assets and appreciation from the taxable estate additionally consideration should be given to selling hard to value assets due to the increased exemption available to shelter any valuation adjustment of these assets upon audit lifetime gifting and sales transactions remain very important in providing asset protection benefits for trust beneficiaries shifting income to beneficiaries in lower tax brackets and providing funds for children or others whose inheritance may be delayed by the longer life expectancy of one s ancestors grantor retained annuity trusts grats grats remain one of our most valuable planning tools particularly in times of low interest rates due to the current lower interest rates and the fact that prior administrations presidential budget proposals frequently called for adverse changes in how grats may be structured grats should be created as soon as possible under current law grats may be structured without making a taxable gift therefore even if one has used all of his or her applicable exclusion amount grats may be used without incurring any gift tax because grats may be created without a gift upon funding they are an increasingly attractive technique for clients who want to continue planning to pass assets to their descendants without payment of gift tax in the uncertain tax environment a grat provides the grantor with a fixed annual amount the annuity from the trust for a term of years which may be as short as two years the annuity the grantor retains may be equal to 100 percent of the amount the grantor used to fund the grat plus the irs assumed rate of return applicable to grats which for transfers made in november 2019 is 2 percent as long as the grat assets outperform the applicable rate at the end of the annuity term the grantor will be able to achieve a transfer tax free gift of the spread between the actual growth of the assets and the service assumed rate of return although the grantor will retain the full value of the grat assets if the grantor survives the annuity term the value of the grat assets in excess of the grantor s retained annuity amount will then pass to whomever the grantor has named either outright or in further trust with no gift or estate tax sales to intentionally defective grantor trusts idgts sales to idgts have become an increasingly popular planning strategy due to the increased exemption amounts under the act in utilizing a sale to an idgt a taxpayer would transfer assets likely to appreciate in value to the idgt in exchange for a commercially reasonable down payment and a promissory note from the trust for the balance from an income tax perspective no taxable gain would be recognized on the sale of the property to the idgt because it is a grantor trust which makes this essentially a sale to one s self for the same reason the interest payments on the note would not be taxable to the seller or deductible by the trust if the value of the assets grows at a greater pace than the prevailing applicable federal rate which for sales in november 2019 is as low as 1 68 percent for a short term sale as with a grat the appreciation beyond the federal rate will pass free of gift and estate tax due to the current low interest rates now is an opportune time to structure sales to idgts the current environment creates a window of opportunity for sales to grantor trusts the increased federal exemption amounts may provide a cushion against any asset valuation risk attendant to such sales additionally the increased exemption amounts permit the sale of a substantially larger amount of assets to grantor trusts typically grantor trusts should be funded with at least 10 percent of the value of the assets that will be sold to the trust with the higher exemption amounts those who have not used any of their exemptions could contribute up to 11 4 million or 22 8 million if splitting assets with a spouse to a grantor trust in 2019 this would permit the sale of up to 102 6 million or 205 2 million of assets to the trust in exchange for a promissory note with interest at the appropriate afr consider a swap or buy back of appreciated low basis assets from grantor trusts if a grantor trust has been funded with low basis assets the grantor should consider swapping or buying back those low basis assets in exchange for high basis assets or cash if the grantor sold or gave through a grat or other grantor trust an asset with a low basis when that asset is sold the gain will trigger capital gains tax however if the grantor swaps or purchases the asset back from the grantor trust for fair market value no gain or loss is recognized the trust would then hold cash or other assets equal to the value of the asset that was repurchased alternatively many grantor trust instruments give the grantor the power to substitute the trust s assets with other assets which would allow the low basis assets to be removed from the trust in exchange for assets of equal value that have a higher basis then on the grantor s death the purchased or reacquired asset will be included in the grantor s taxable estate and will receive a step up in basis equal to fair market value eliminating the income tax cost to the beneficiaries those whose estates may not be subject to estate taxes due to the current high exemption amounts may utilize swaps or buy backs to undo prior planning strategies that are no longer needed in today s environment consider the use of life insurance life insurance presents significant opportunities to defer and or avoid income taxes as well as provide assets to pay estate tax or replace assets used to pay estate tax generally speaking appreciation and or income earned on a life insurance policy accumulates free of income taxes until the policy owner makes a withdrawal or surrenders or sells the policy thus properly structured life insurance may be used as an effective tax deferred retirement planning vehicle proceeds distributed upon the death of the insured are completely free of income taxes taxpayers should consider paying off any outstanding loans against existing policies in order to maximize the proceeds available tax free at death although potential gift tax consequences must be examined note that the decision to pay off such loans requires a comparison of the alternative investments that may be available with the assets that would be used to repay the loans and the interest rate on the loans use intra family loans and consider refinancing existing intra family loans because interest rates are currently low and the exemption amounts are so high many techniques involving the use of intra family loans should be considered including the purchase of life insurance on the life of one family member by an irrevocable life insurance trust with premium payments funded by loans from other family members the creation of trusts by older generation members for the benefit of younger family members to which the older generation members loan funds the spread between the investment return earned by the trust and the interest owed will create a transfer tax free gift forgiving loans previously made to family members the amount that is forgiven in excess of the annual gift tax exclusion amount will be a gift and thus will use a portion of one s applicable gift tax and or gst tax exclusion amount this may be a beneficial strategy considering the increased exemption amounts installment sale to third party settled gst tax exempt trust unique planning opportunities and transfer tax benefits may be available if a relative or friend of the taxpayer has an interest in creating and funding a trust for the benefit of the taxpayer and or the taxpayer s family for example a third party grantor e g a relative or friend of the taxpayer could contribute cash to a trust for the benefit of the taxpayer allocate gst tax exemption to that gift and then that trust could purchase assets from the taxpayer in exchange for such cash and a secured promissory note in the remaining principal amount of assets purchased while this sale could result in payment of capital gains tax to the taxpayer ideally at an earlier lower value this planning could present the following potential benefits there should be no transfer tax concerns for the third party grantor if the grantor s other assets even when added to the value of the foregoing gift would not be sufficient to cause the estate tax to apply at the grantor s death this depends on what the estate tax exemption amount is at the grantor s subsequent death the taxpayer could receive a step up in basis as of the date of the initial sale the taxpayer could be a beneficiary hold a limited power of appointment over and control who serves as trustee of the trust and the appreciation in the value of the asset being sold from the date of the initial sale above the interest rate on the promissory note e g 1 59 percent is the mid term afr in november 2019 would accrue transfer tax free for the benefit of the taxpayer and or the taxpayer s family and the trust could be structured in such a way as to provide protection from the taxpayer s creditors and remove the trust assets from the taxpayer s and his her family members taxable estates in order to achieve the foregoing benefits it is important that only the third party grantor makes any gratuitous transfers to the trust and that the third party grantor not be reimbursed for any such transfers purposely triggering application of code section 2701 a taxpayer may desire to utilize the increased gift and estate tax exemption prior to the scheduled sunset and may also desire to shift appreciation on this amount to a trust for the benefit of the taxpayer s children that is removed from the estate tax system this desire may be met with hesitation to part with 11 4 million of assets the taxpayer may also be concerned about losing cash flow from the transferred assets and not having the option of taking the property back if needed in the future finally the taxpayer may also have concerns that assets available for transfer have a low income tax basis which will carry over if a traditional gift is made a planning alternative exists which can potentially address each of these concerns the strategy is to create and fund a preferred partnership which is structured to purposely violate code section 2701 assume a taxpayer gifts 1 1 million to an irrevocable trust for the benefit of the taxpayer s children the family trust taxpayer and family trust create a preferred partnership pp taxpayer transfers to the pp 9 9 million of low basis assets in exchange for a preferred interest entitling the taxpayer to a 5 percent noncumulative preferred return and the right to put the preferred interest to the pp for an amount equal to its associated capital account the family trust contributes 1 1 million to the pp in exchange for a common interest entitling the family trust to all cash flow above the 5 percent payment made to the preferred interest and all appreciation on the pp s assets structuring the preferred interest in this manner violates code section 2701 the result is a deemed gift of 9 9 million which combined with the taxpayer s gift of 1 1 million to the family trust means the taxpayer has consumed 11 million of gift and estate tax exemption also when the taxpayer dies the preferred interest will be included in the taxpayer s estate under code section 2033 resulting in an income tax basis step up of the preferred interest the estate tax calculation will include a reduction in the taxpayer s tentative taxable estate of 9 9 million to account for the prior taxable gift and avoid double taxation this structure has addressed each of the taxpayer s concerns the taxpayer has consumed the increased exemption amount but has done so in a manner that preserves an income tax basis step up the taxpayer has also retained a 5 percent return on the preferred interest and the right to put the interest back to the pp and take back the value of the taxpayer s capital account finally cash flow above the 5 percent preferred return and appreciation on the pp s assets have been shifted to the family trust free of transfer taxes consider charitable planning as noted above the act increased the agi percentage limit for cash contributions to public charities from 50 60 percent because of the increased percentage limitation consideration should be given to accelerating charitable giving to possibly obtain a current income tax deduction and potentially reduce one s taxable estate of both the contributed asset as well as future appreciation a planning tool that is very effective in a low interest rate environment is a charitable lead annuity trust clat which combines philanthropy with tax planning a clat is an irrevocable trust that pays one or more named charities a specified annuity payment for a fixed term at the end of the charitable term any remaining assets in the clat pass to the remainder noncharitable beneficiaries as with a grat to the extent the assets outperform the irs assumed rate of return 2 percent for november 2019 those assets can pass transfer tax free to the chosen beneficiaries alternatively a strategy that works better in a high interest rate environment is a charitable remainder annuity trust a crat a crat is an irrevocable trust that pays an annual payment to an individual typically the grantor during the term of the trust with the remainder passing to one or more named charities the grantor may receive an income tax deduction for the value of the interest passing to charity because the value of the grantor s retained interest is lower when interest rates are high the value of the interest passing to charity and therefore the income tax deduction is higher a crat may become an attractive option if interest rates rise the qualified charitable distribution rules were made permanent by the tax hikes path act of 2015 on december 18 2015 the path act permanently extended the ability to make ira charitable rollover gifts which allow an individual who is age 701 2 or over to make a charitable rollover of up to 100 000 to a public charity without having to treat the distribution as taxable income other types of charitable organizations such as supporting organizations donor advised funds or private foundations are not eligible to receive the charitable rollover therefore if a taxpayer needs to take a required minimum distribution for 2019 he or she may arrange for the distribution of up to 100 000 to be directly contributed to a favorite public charity and receive the income tax benefits of these rules due to new limitations on itemized deductions i e the cap on the state and local tax deduction some taxpayers may no longer itemize deductions on their personal income tax returns without itemizing deductions these taxpayers could not receive the income tax benefit of a charitable deduction for charitable contributions the qualified charitable distribution rules allow taxpayers who are claiming a standard deduction to still obtain a financial benefit from charitable donations year end checklist for 2019 in addition to the above planning ideas consider the following before 2019 is over make year end annual exclusion gifts of 15 000 30 000 for married couples make year end ira contributions create 529 plan accounts before year end for children and grandchildren and consider front loading the accounts with five years worth of annual exclusion gifts taking into account any gifts made during the year to children and grandchildren pay tuition and nonreimbursable medical expenses directly to the school or medical provider consider making charitable gifts including charitable ira rollovers before year end to use the deduction on your 2019 income tax return below is an overview of national international and local developments that occurred in 2019 international developments in 2019 as highlighted in the 2018 year end estate planning advisory the act had sweeping implications on private client international tax planning much of the impact on this planning involved the substantially revised rules related to controlled foreign corporations cfcs such changes included the expansion of what constitutes a u s shareholder the new tax on global intangible low taxed income gilti the removal of the rule that a foreign corporation must be a cfc for an uninterrupted period of 30 days before a u s shareholder had a subpart f income inclusion the expansion of the constructive ownership rules to allow downward attribution from a non u s person to a u s person the downward attribution rule and the addition of a repatriation tax a smaller but yet important change permitted a nonresident alien to indirectly constitute a shareholder of an s corporation via an electing small business trust esbt by and large in the united states 2019 has been marked by the service and treasury working to provide much needed guidance on both the international tax changes implemented by the act and legacy international tax provisions needing more clarity as for the rest of the globe throughout 2019 jurisdictions including the united states continued to pass broad legislative and regulatory measures designed to foster increased transparency proposed and final treasury regulations were issued in respect of subpart f income and gilti to address how the attribution principles should be applied where a u s person indirectly invests in a cfc through a domestic partnership in short the regulations adopt an aggregate approach for determining a partner s subpart f or gilti inclusion with respect to a cfc owned through a u s partnership in each case however the domestic partnership is treated as an entity for purposes of determining whether a partnership and its partners are u s shareholders for purposes of cfc qualification as well as whether the foreign corporation at issue is a cfc the treasury promulgated proposed regulations that expand the application of the high tax exception election in determining a cfc s tested income for purposes of gilti prior to the proposed guidance the high tax exception election in respect of gilti only applied to income that was otherwise characterized as foreign insurance income or foreign base company income under the subpart f rules however the proposed regulations provide that the exception covers any gross income subject to foreign income tax at an effective rate greater than 90 percent of the u s corporate income tax rate e g 18 9 percent based on the current 21 percent rate once made the election applies to all subsequent years unless revoked if revoked unless an exception applies the election may not be made again for at least 60 months the downward attribution rule as implemented by the act inadvertently resulted in many foreign corporations constituting cfcs despite u s persons directly or indirectly owning nominal interests legislative history made it clear that the downward attribution rule was to be limited in scope and narrowly targeted to apply to certain abusive transactions in light of this legislative intent recently issued proposed regulations seek to clarify situations on a code section by code section basis as to how the downward attribution rule should be applied to prevent unintended cfc qualification that said such guidance in our view provides limited relief rev proc 2019 40 accompanied the foregoing proposed regulations to provide among other guidance u s persons with a safe harbor for determining cfc status that is the service will not challenge a u s person s determination that a foreign corporation is not a cfc where 1 the u s person does not have actual knowledge has not received information and cannot obtain reliable public information to determine whether a foreign corporation constitutes a cfc and 2 if the u s person directly owns an interest such person inquires of the foreign corporation whether it is a cfc and asks for information relevant to whether any subsidiaries could be cfcs the treasury issued final regulations in respect of nonresident aliens within the class of permissible potential current beneficiaries of an esbt the regulations ensure that all of an s corporation s income will continue to be subject to u s federal income tax for a shareholder that is a grantor trust deemed to be owned by a nonresident alien and constituting an esbt in essence the final regulations preclude the grantor trust rules from trumping the esbt rules where the owner of the grantor trust is a nonresident alien without this rule s corporation income earned by such a grantor trust could escape u s federal income taxation the treasury issued proposed regulations that address longstanding issues involving passive foreign investment companies pfics specifically the pfic rules expressly incorporate the subpart f income rules for determining whether income earned by a foreign corporation constitutes passive income the proposed regulations clarify to what extent the exclusions under the subpart f income rules apply when determining whether a foreign corporation is a pfic in providing such clarity the proposed regulations deny various look through rules that typically apply under the subpart f provisions for pfic testing purposes in addition consistent with the aggregate treatment discussed above the proposed regulations take a top down approach in determining the extent of a u s partner s indirect ownership in a pfic through a domestic partnership effectively the rule attempts to disregard the partnership when determining a u s partner s indirect interest in a pfic turning to the rest of the world participating jurisdictions under the so called common reporting standards crs including european union jurisdictions guided by the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd continue to legislate and regulate expansive rules to foster increased transparency much debate and discussion revolves around the potential implementation of the oecd s mandatory disclosure rules mdr the mdr requires intermediaries in crs jurisdictions ultimately adopting the mdr to disclose information in respect of certain so called crs avoidance arrangements or opaque offshore structures taken largely from the principles of the oecd s mdr the european union adopted directive 2018 922 directive which requires disclosure by intermediaries of certain cross border arrangements bearing certain hallmarks enumerated under the directive provided one of the parties of such arrangement is from the european union notably each eu member state is required to implement the directive into its local law by december 31 2019 although the united states is not a signatory to crs the u s congress has shown an appetite to legislate increased transparency in late october the u s house of representatives passed the corporate transparency act of 2019 cta the goal of which is to require the disclosure of beneficial owners of u s corporations and limited liability companies the stated purpose of the cta is to prevent the use of u s corporations and limited liability companies for criminal activities such as money laundering under current draft legislation the beneficial ownership information would be reported to fincen and not accessible to the general public however the information would be available to governmental bodies and federal agencies for certain limited uses e g law enforcement national security or intelligence purposes as well as to financial institutions with the customer s consent to foster compliance with due diligence requirements imposed under the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act and other applicable federal state or tribal laws in light of the continuing complex and rapid changes in international tax planning taxpayers should consult their international private client advisors for assistance and guidance in navigating these issues local developments in 2019 state specific considerations california undue influence presumption for care custodians expanded on june 26 2019 governor newsom approved assembly bill 328 which extends the presumption of undue influence to donative transfers made to caregivers who subsequently marry their adult dependents this legislation closes a prior loophole which allowed a caregiver who received gifts from a dependent to avoid the presumption of undue influence by becoming a spouse cohabitant or domestic partner effective january 1 2020 the presumption of undue influence would extend to a caregiver who marries a dependent adult while providing services to that dependent adult or within 90 days after those services were last provided the presumption will apply to a any gift or bequest made by a dependent adult to his or her caregiver within six months of their marriage cohabitation or domestic partnership and b any omitted spouse doctrine claims under probate code section 21611 raised by a caregiver if the dependent adult spouse dies within six months of the marriage the presumption of undue influence can be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence increased dollar limitation for small estate procedure on july 30 2019 governor newsom approved assembly bill 473 raising the dollar limitation for an estate to qualify for disposition without a full probate administration effective january 1 2020 the small estate limitation will increase from 150 000 to 166 250 to be adjusted for inflation on april 1 2022 and every three years thereafter in addition the interest penalties owed to a person with a superior claim to property received under the small estate procedure have been reduced from 10 percent to 7 percent and the courts have been given discretion to waive interest penalties if the small estate procedure was used in good faith proposed california transfer tax fails to come to vote on march 26 2019 california state senator scott weiner introduced senate bill 378 which proposed to impose an estate tax gift tax and gst on california residents the proposed transfer taxes would mirror federal taxes and be subject to a rate of 40 percent however the exemption for california purposes would be 3 5 million per person and would phase out entirely at the federal exemption amount which is currently 11 4 million per person the bill never came out of committee for a floor vote trustees must terminate trust if trust agreement provides for mandatory distribution in trolan v trolan six siblings became cotrustees of an irrevocable trust with the power to act by majority vote on their mother s death the trust provided that on the mother s death the trust was to be divided into equal shares with each sibling s share to be distributed outright to him or her at age 30 at the time of the mother s death each sibling was over the age of 30 five of the siblings wanted to continue to hold the assets of the trust in trust while the sixth sibling wanted her share distributed outright in cash after several disagreements over the value of the sixth sibling s share the trustees petitioned the court to determine the value of her share and to leave the other five siblings shares in trust the trial court a ruled that the mandatory distribution at age 30 provision required the trustees to distribute the shares outright to the siblings b on its own motion removed the siblings as trustees for failing to liquidate the trust and appointed a professional fiduciary as successor trustee and c ordered the trustee to liquidate the trust pay the expenses attorneys fees and costs of both sides from the trust and then distribute the trust s corpus the five siblings subsequently appealed arguing that the trial court erred in finding that the trust had to be liquidated and distributed pursuant to the mandatory provision requiring distribution at age 30 the california court of appeal affirmed the trial court s ruling that distribution was mandatory at age 30 but found that the trial court abused its discretion when it required the liquidation of trust assets prior to distribution because the trust instrument allowed the trustees to make distributions in cash or in kind consequently the trial court order mandating the removal of the trustees was reversed because the sibling trustees did not breach their duty by failing to liquidate the trust unsigned interlineations do not constitute valid trust amendment in pena v day the settlor of a trust made handwritten interlineations to his trust and affixed a signed sticky note instructing his attorney to incorporate such changes into a new trust amendment the settlor died prior to the attorney preparing the amendment the california court of appeal found that the handwritten interlineations to the trust did not validly amend the trust because the trust required amendments to be in a signed writing and there was no signature the california court of appeal further found that the signed sticky note affixed to the interlineated trust was a separate writing rather than part of the amendment itself because the sticky note merely contained instructions for the settlor s attorney to draft an amendment to be executed at a later point gift of life insurance policy can be conveyed by reference in trust in dudek v dudek the california court of appeals found that listing a life insurance policy as an asset of an irrevocable trust was sufficient to transfer ownership in that policy despite the settlor s failure to perfect such transfer with the life insurance company in 2009 settlor established a life insurance trust and listed a life insurance policy as an asset of the trust under the trust s schedule of assets the settlor then submitted forms to the life insurance company transferring the policy to the trust and naming the trust as the beneficiary the life insurance company rejected the forms due to the settlor failing to initial certain changes and corrected forms were never resubmitted six years later without the trustee s knowledge the settlor filed updated beneficiary designations naming the respondents as beneficiaries of the policy on the settlor s death the respondents received the life insurance proceeds and the life insurance company rejected the trustee s claims under the policy the trustee subsequently filed a petition seeking an order directing that the respondents transfer the life insurance proceeds to him as trustee of the trust the trial court ruled in favor of the respondents and found that the settlor failed to fund the trust by not filing documents with the life insurance company naming the trust as the owner and beneficiary of the policy the trustee appealed claiming that the trial court erred and claimed that the trust agreement irrevocably transferred the policy from the settlor to the trust to determine whether the policy was transferred to the trust the california court of appeal analyzed whether the following elements of a gift under california law were satisfied a intent b delivery actual or symbolic and c acceptance it found that a the trust agreement evidenced an intent to make an immediate and irrevocable transfer to the trust b there was a symbolic delivery when the settlor delivered the trust agreement to the trustee and c there was acceptance when the trustee signed the trust agreement as a result the later change in beneficiary designations naming the respondents was ineffective because the settlor no longer owned of the policy therefore the trustee was allowed to pursue his claims against the respondents to recover the life insurance proceeds previously distributed to them death of trustee will not cause dissociation from partnership in han v hallberg the california court of appeal found that a living trust did not dissociate from a partnership on the death of its settlor because the trust was deemed to be the partner in 1975 four dentists entered into a partnership agreement providing that certain buy out provisions would apply on a partner s death in 1994 the partnership was amended to reflect the assignment of one of its partners dr hallberg to his living trust and to substitute the trustee of the living trust as a general partner of the partnership when dr hallberg subsequently died the other partners tried to exercise the buy out provisions and purchase dr hallberg s interests the trial court found in favor of the other partners because it concluded that dr hallberg was a partner at the time of his death the california court of appeal reversed the trial court s decision and found that the trustee of the trust not dr hallberg was and remained the partner at the time of dr hallberg s death the california court of appeal based its decision on the uniform partnership act of 1994 s definition of a person which includes a trust and concluded that a trust does not dissociate from a partnership upon the death of a trustee rather a trust dissociates by distribution of its entire transferrable interest in the partnership and not by the substitution of a successor trustee california superior court reverses long standing franchise tax board position on trust taxation in paula trust v california franchise tax board the san francisco county superior court reversed the california franchise tax board s long standing position that all of a trust s california source income is fully taxable and not subject to the apportionment regime california s apportionment regime is a two tier regime used for determining whether a trust s income is taxable in california based on the residence of the trust s fiduciaries and noncontingent beneficiaries taxable income is first apportioned in proportion to the number of california fiduciaries over the number of total fiduciaries the amount remaining after applying the first tier is then apportioned in proportion to the number of california noncontingent beneficiaries over non california noncontingent beneficiaries in paula a trust was created for a california beneficiary which provided for discretionary distributions moreover the trust had two trustees a california resident and a non california resident the trust was funded with business interests that were subsequently sold the sale resulted in a capital gain of 2 8 million which was treated as california source income the trustees reported the entire amount as a capital gain on the trust s california return several years later the trustees filed a claim for refund claiming that only 50 percent of the 2 8 million gain was taxable in california under california s apportionment regime since only 50 percent of the trustees resided in california and there were no noncontingent beneficiaries because the sole beneficiary was only entitled to discretionary distributions the franchise tax board denied the claim for refund on the ground that all of a trust s california source income is fully taxable the trustees filed suit in california superior court the superior court held that the sourcing rules are not intended to apply to trusts and that the apportionment rules apply in determining a trust s california income whether such income is california source or not therefore the trustees claim for refund was granted the franchise tax board appealed the superior court s decision and the matter is currently pending before the california court of appeal illinois illinois trust code on july 12 2019 illinois house bill 1471 was signed into law as public act 101 0048 and is known as the illinois trust code this law is effective january 1 2020 adoption of the illinois trust code represents the most significant statutory overhaul with respect to the field of trusts in many years the illinois trust code is modeled after the uniform law commission s uniform trust code which has been adopted in 34 states including illinois and the district of columbia the illinois trust code updates and revises many aspects of trusts created and administered in illinois and brings illinois law concerning trusts in line with a majority of the other states adoption of the illinois trust code caused the repeal of many statutory compilations governing the administration of trusts including the trusts and trustees act the trusts and dissolutions of marriage act the uniform powers of appointment act which was adopted by public act 100 1044 just last year the statute concerning perpetuities the perpetuities vesting act and the trust accumulation act additionally corresponding changes have been made to many other statutory compilations including the public use trust act the township code the corporate fiduciary act the community integrated living arrangements licensure and certification act the title insurance act the illinois funeral or burial funds act the mental health and developmental disabilities code the illinois marriage and dissolution of marriage act the probate act of 1975 the illinois power of attorney act the common trust fund act the religious corporation act and the illinois pre need cemetery sales act the adoption of the illinois trust code was welcome news to the vast majority of practitioners in illinois and represents the culmination of years of introducing similar legislation unsuccessfully because of the sweeping changes which will be enacted by the illinois trust code existing trusts should be reviewed to determine compliance with the new statutory compilation and if planning is desired evaluate any planning in light of the new statutory compilation as the illinois trust code provides opportunities to deal with trusts that existing law may have prohibited amendment to probate act of 1975 on august 2 2019 illinois house bill 347 was signed into law as public act 101 0182 this public act amends the probate act of 1975 to expand the list of actions perpetrated against an elderly person that would deem the perpetrator to have predeceased such elderly person i e the perpetrator would be deemed to have predeceased the decedent for estate planning purposes and therefore be unable to collect any property of the decedent effective january 1 2020 if an individual commits assault aggravated assault battery or aggravated battery in addition to enumerated actions existing prior to the adoption of public act 101 0182 against an elderly person then the perpetrator will be deemed to have predeceased the elderly person unless it can be proven by clear and convincing evidence that the victim of that offense knew of the conviction and subsequent to the conviction expressed or ratified his or her intent to transfer the property to the person convicted of the crime the crime need not directly or indirectly cause the death of the decedent and as a result special care should be taken in drafting estate plans where this may be relevant chicago police sergeant s association v john pallohusky 2019 ii app 1st 181194 march 29 2019 the pallohusky case arose as a result of the chicago police sergeant s association policemen s benevolent protective association unit 156a the association attempting to satisfy a judgment against john pallohusky obtained on july 31 2013 initially the court found that mr pallohusky was embezzling money from the association and ordered mr pallohusky to pay the association 619 215 17 in damages the association was able to locate real property held in trust for the benefit of mr pallohusky which was placed in trust upon mr pallohusky s wife s death in july 2010 and the association sought to use the real property to satisfy its judgment against mr pallohusky with respect to the trust in question mr pallohusky was named as the initial trustee and distributions of income and principal were authorized to mr pallohusky for any reason whatsoever in what appears to be an attempt to separate himself from the corpus of the trust mr pallohusky resigned as the trustee of the trust approximately five years after his wife s death and thereafter the real property was formally deeded by a different trustee to the trust for the benefit of mr pallohusky the association argued that the trust should not provide mr pallohusky any protection against its judgment and therefore the trust assets should be used to satisfy the association s judgment initially the trial court found that the trust was a sham because mr pallohusky s now deceased wife clearly intended to vest mr pallohusky with absolute control of the trust assets which was evidenced by mr pallohusky s wide discretion to distribute the trust assets to himself additionally because mr pallohusky had waited about five years to resign as the sole trustee the court determined that he waited unreasonably long to resign after the trial court s order the trustee of the john pallohusky trust appealed the order requiring it to turn over the real property owned by the trust to satisfy the association s judgment the appellate court agreed with the trial court in determining that the trust in question was a sham the court citing the golden rule of testamentary instruments to determine the intent of the decedent held that mr pallohusky s wife intended to grant him with absolute power over the trust assets and the ability to dispose of the trust assets without regard to any other person including the class of individuals that were to receive the property upon mr pallohusky s death and therefore the interests of mr pallohusky as trustee of the trust and the interests of mr pallohusky as the sole current beneficiary of the trust merged together to create outright ownership in mr pallohusky which could be used to satisfy mr pallohusky s judgment creditors practitioners in illinois have been somewhat vocal in their disagreement with the decision in pallohusky the court seems to disregard the remainder beneficiaries of the trust mr pallohusky s wife s heirs in determining that mr pallohusky was the sole beneficiary of the trust practitioners are concerned that this case represents an unwarranted expansion of the merger doctrine where the interests of the trustee and the beneficiary merge as the interests of the remainder beneficiaries were disregarded this case stands for the practical proposition that care must be taken when drafting trusts for individuals with certain creditor issues and that attempting to correct a problem after the fact may not be a viable option in certain circumstances additionally after pallohusky care should be taken in having the sole current beneficiary of a trust be the sole trustee as well as this may pose creditor protection issues in illinois in re estate of carol mattson 2019 ii app 1st 180805 april 30 2019 in mattson a non attorney daniel houlihan petitioned the court to open an estate for his mother and to appoint him as the administrator of his mother s estate mr houlihan s petition was denied because as a non attorney mr houlihan could not represent the legal interests of his mother s estate mr houlihan attempted on numerous occasions to petition the court pro se to be appointed administrator of his mother s estate and each time the court continued the case so that mr houlihan could arrange for an attorney to appear and petition on behalf of his mother s estate the trial court eventually denied mr houlihan s petition and mr houlihan appealed pro se the appellate court agreeing with the trial court reasoned that under illinois law a pro se litigant is entitled to represent his personal interests but a non attorney cannot represent the legal interest of an estate the appellate court adds that mr houlihan is not entitled to initiate the current appeal because he is not a party to the lawsuit i e the estate of carol mattson cannot be represented in the appellate action by mr houlihan because mr houlihan is not an attorney in a dissenting opinion justice hyman reasons that at such a preliminary stage mr houlihan is representing his own interests in serving as administrator of his mother s estate but is not yet representing his mother s estate because he has not yet been appointed as the administrator justice hyman does seem to note that upon mr houlihan s appointment as administrator of his mother s estate he would then need to engage an attorney to represent the interests of the estate nichols v fahrenkamp 2019 ii 123990 june 20 2019 in nichols the plaintiff alexis nichols obtained a settlement for injuries obtained in an automobile accident when she was a minor because she was a minor ms nichols mother was appointed as her guardian to administer the funds for the benefit of ms nichols and a guardian ad litem was appointed after attaining the age of majority ms nichols sued her mother claiming that funds from the settlement were used for ms nichols mother s personal benefit and not the benefit of ms nichols the trial court agreed but limited ms nichols recovery from her mother based on the fact that ms nichols had a guardian ad litem who approved the estimates and expenditures the issue in this case is what duty if any does the guardian ad litem owe to the minor ward under these circumstances the trial court determined that a guardian ad litem is entitled to quasi judicial immunity because the guardian ad litem acted according to the appointing court s decision and had the limited role of providing recommendations to the court regarding ms nichols best interest the appellate court reversed holding that in this case the guardian ad litem had a duty to advocate on behalf of ms nichols and thus immunizing the guardian ad litem from tort liability would be inconsistent with this duty the supreme court of illinois holds that in this case the guardian ad litem was acting as a branch of the judiciary and thus entitled to quasi judicial immunity notwithstanding that the guardian ad litem in nichols was appointed under the probate act of 1975 which states in relevant part that n any proceeding for the appointment of a standby guardian or a guardian the court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the minor in the proceeding the court holds that the duty of the guardian ad litem duty more closely aligned with a function of the court as opposed to a representative of ms nichols the supreme court of illinois does note that the order appointing the guardian ad litem will ultimately determine the duties of that guardian ad litem and signals to the lower courts that more specificity may be required to determine the guardian ad litem s duties with respect to the court and with respect to the ward nonetheless after nichols guardians ad litem who submit recommendations to the court on a child s bests interests are protected by quasi judicial immunity mccarthy v abraham lincoln reynolds iii 2006 declaration of living trust 2019 ii 123622 june 20 2019 the mccarthy case represents a matter of first impression in the state of illinois whether a court may impose sanctions in the form of attorney fees under illinois supreme court rule 137 a to compensate an attorney defending himself or herself against a frivolous cause of action historically illinois courts have disallowed attorneys from charging fees for professional services in prosecuting or defending a case where the attorney is representing himself or herself deviating from the historical norm the supreme court of illinois holds that a court is authorized to impose sanctions in the form of attorney fees under illinois supreme court rule 137 a against a plaintiff to compensate an attorney defending himself against a frivolous cause of action new york 2019 has been an active year for legislative reform in this area a brief summary of 2019 changes follows gender neutral language multiple provisions of the estates powers and trusts law and the surrogate s court procedure act have

the value of the us dollar against the euro is holding on around 1 10 per one euro but seems to want to go lower the us dollar index dxy has risen recently and seems to be moving toward its near term sept 30 2019 high of 99 38 earlier i had suggested that the price of the euro could fall somewhere around 1 08 i still feel that such a move is a possibility for one the economies of europe and the united states seem to be moving in opposite directions although the united states economy is not getting that much stronger it still is improving relative to elsewhere in the world the evidence given in the wall street journal article linked above data company ihs markit said friday that its composite purchasing managersâ index for the u s a measure of activity in businesses posted a four month high of 51 9 in november up from 50 9 in october ihs markitâ s composite pmi for the eurozone fell to 50 3 in november from 50 6 in october indicating the currency areaâ s economy was close to stagnation a similar survey of japanese businesses pointed to a decline in activity during november which was partly due to severe weather and an october increase in the sales tax the monetary policies in different areas of the world also continue to differ in the united states the federal reserve has signaled that after the latest increase in the fedâ s policy rate of interest there is no reason in the near future to drop its policy rate any further federal reserve governor lael brainard in a speech given tuesday suggests that the fed is in a pretty good position and will not have to move its policy rate any lower of course the data may change requiring a reassessment of the situation the opposite is the case in the europe the european central bank under its new president christine legarde is considering further drops in rates along with possibly more quantitative easing other parts of the world are also considering lower interest rates in addition it appears as if the yields of longer term bonds are also ready to rise in the united states the fact that trade talks are not progressing along are also cited as another reason why the us dollar may continue to get stronger in foreign exchange markets it is still my belief that a strong us dollar is what is needed and that this is what traders around the world also tend to want the us economy does not seem to be getting any stronger as consumer confidence declines for the fourth month in a row still economists still seem to believe that the economy will still record at least a 2 0 rate of growth for 2019 and will be around 2 0 or slightly more in 2020 europe china and the rest of the world are struggling to get their economies back into a growth mode germany is on the brink of a recession the european central bank and the international monetary fund both seem to believe that the rest of 2019 and all of 2020 will not going to be very good for the rest of the world as a consequence the companies of these countries as well as their policy makers are focusing upon getting the economy to grow faster the emphasis is on producing demand any kind of demand many policy makers including ecb president legarde are calling for governments to step up fiscal programs to strengthen these economies in the united states however companies can focus upon the growth that exists even more important they can focus upon an economy that is growing however slowly the one problem facing the united states is that the trade position of the trump administration and the federal government seem to be creating an environment in which corporations are holding back on capital spending even more so than in the previous six months the reality of the slump in real capital expenditures by corporation is starting to sink in as wsj reports many of the biggest u s companies are moderating their spending on equipment and other capital investment as an uncertain business environment prompts some to postpone or shelve otherwise promising projects that could pose a continuing drag on economic growth still the us economy continues to chug along and the us stock market keeps hitting new historical highs the supply side of the economy continues to produce the unemployment rate continues to remain at a 50 year low and the inflation rate continues to come in below the fedâ s target all these play in favor of the united states this is the situation we now find ourselves in going forward it is not the best of all worlds but the us is in a better position right now than almost anyone else is i believe that monetary policy will remain reasonable through 2020 that is i donâ t see any monetary disturbances coming in the near future fiscal policy will produce another trillion dollars worth of federal government debt continuing to bump up the aggregate total outstanding but there are no immediate signs that this will cause a problem next year given the cautious way the federal reserve is acting and i donâ t see any other major programs coming on the fiscal side congress will have to agree on a budget which i believe they will there are too many other things going on for congress to create another crisis here another government shutdown will not occur at this time furthermore the trump administration is running out of time before the next election and their attention is elsewhere so that there will be no attempts to push through any new programs investors look for a stronger us dollar this i believe will be a good sign for us

beyond the belt and road infrastructure projects thousands of entrepreneurs from china are also setting up on the continent thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe wilson wu has big plans for the free trade zone he manages in igbesa a scruffy town in ogun state some 60km from the frenzy of lagos nigeria s huge commercial capital casting his gaze over what is today a small cluster of industrial warehouses surrounded by mud roads and bush mr wu can see an altogether brighter future we will have a five star hotel a golf club a walmart he says in a well rehearsed pitch it will be like dubai an electrical engineer by profession mr wu s journey to west africa followed an assignment as a young man in myanmar where he worked for power construction corporation of china a state owned group upgrading the electricity grid in 2011 hungry for more adventure he packed his bags and headed for nigeria where still barely 30 years old he was tapped up to manage the ogun state free trade zone a private public project in which the local government provides the land and chinese enterprise the capital mr wu is one of hundreds of thousands of chinese citizens a common estimate is about 1m who have ventured to africa over the past two decades to seek their fortune like many who have ended up there he sees in africa s raw energy and ambition an echo of the forces that were unleashed by deng xiaoping s reforms of 1978 it is like the china of the 1970s and 1980s when you could open a business and maybe earn a fortune he enthuses those kind of fortunes are not possible in china today people like mr wu have been persuaded to test their ambition in far flung corners of the world by tougher business conditions in china where rising labour costs industrial overcapacity and more stringent environmental standards are taking their toll while many entrepreneurs have looked closer to home to countries such as cambodia others have struck out to africa it is china s massive infrastructure projects including dams railways ports and telecommunications networks that capture most attention between 2000 and 2014 the stock of chinese investment in africa went from 2 per cent of us levels to 55 per cent mckinsey estimates that at the current breakneck pace china will surpass us levels within a decade washington has belatedly woken up to china s growing presence which is transforming both the physical and diplomatic landscape of africa in december john bolton president donald trump s national security adviser accused china of using bribes opaque agreements and the strategic use of debt to hold states in africa captive to beijing s wishes and demands china in nigeria yet large companies such as huawei and big state affiliated companies such as china bridge and road are not the only chinese actors reshaping the continent what officials in washington may not fully understand is that thousands of hardscrabble entrepreneurs like mr wu involved in everything from retail and factories to farming are having just as big an impact irene yuan sun an associate partner at mckinsey and author of a book on chinese investment in africa says the influence is particularly strong in manufacturing chinese manufacturing investment is the best hope that africa has to industrialise in this generation she says chinese involvement in africa is not just about state driven efforts a just as large if not larger component is these private enterprises which are more job intensive which localise quicker and which have a much larger economic and social impact when mr wu first came to ogun there was virtually nothing in place the state s free trade zone he manages is majority owned by guangdong new south group a private chinese conglomerate with interests in everything from medicine to coal mining mr wu s team was given a 2 24 sq km patch of land and told to get on with it nigeria like countries across africa has a huge infrastructure deficit it lacks reliable power water and all weather roads new south group has had to build almost everything from scratch including natural gas powered generators and yet to be paved roads connecting the zone to lagos and beyond it is like managing a country mr wu says of the zone which is designed to be an enclave of efficiency and stability in nigeria s notoriously unpredictable business environment we have our own customs our own police our own operations the government of nigeria provided the land we used all our own money to build everything else after seven years in operation the free trade zone has 50 registered companies including two ceramic manufacturers producing tiles and plates a steel pipe plant and factories making everything from furniture to tomato sauce there is a printing business a plastic recycling company and another specialising in construction materials for mr wu the next 15 to 20 years will see a massive expansion to 10 000 companies 200 times the number today we will have eight different industrial sectors he says we will have different zones for electronics for tiles construction in the future we will have a university for research and development nigeria has the conditions to be a factory of the world says zhou pingjian china s ambassador to nigeria it should become the factory of the world if that is nigeria s putative future for now mr wu and thousands of chinese entrepreneurs in the country like him have to contend with the present manufacturing made up just 9 per cent of gross domestic product in 2017 according to the world bank and president muhammadu buhari who was re elected in february has complained that nigeria imports everything from toothpicks to tomato purée like other countries in africa nigeria s manufacturing ecosystem has withered since the 1980s partly thanks to a poorly executed industrial policy that saw the state lavish billions on white elephant projects an irony of chinese entrepreneurs setting up factories in the country and in other parts of africa such as ethiopia and rwanda is that the import of cheap chinese goods was another factor in destroying local production nigeria has also been hit by the oil exporter curse which pushed up the exchange rate making it cheaper to import finished goods than produce them the country s once thriving textile industry is today a pale shadow of itself because of a shortage of all but the most basic raw materials most chinese factories in nigeria are limited to final assembly they rely on imported parts and inputs which means they need to access scarce foreign currency and coax supplies past sometimes obstructive port officials the currency volatility is just too high says wing liao the founder of winghan a chinese furniture brand with a factory in ogun state when there is profit a fluctuation in currency exchange rates can wipe it all out to get hold of foreign exchange chinese entrepreneurs have had to get creative many say they buy nigerian raw materials such as timber and marble which they then export to buyers in china or europe in exchange for chinese renminbi rings of chinese money changers specialise in matching those needing foreign currency with willing chinese buyers of nigerian imports once the ship leaves port and has its papers signed by the port authorities you can collect your money says ban yushi manager of a beijing based mining company lack of inputs and scarcity of foreign exchange are just two of the obstacles faced by chinese entrepreneurs rightly or wrongly they complain about the skill levels of nigerian workers the product of a state education system that has deteriorated over recent decades the machines are often too difficult to operate for local employees says chen donghua a shoe factory manager at the lee group a manufacturer owned by hong kong entrepreneurs but because local labour is cheap they can still package them by hand mr chen s company provides training to employees who he says in practice have little above an elementary school education chinese businessmen also have to negotiate past nigeria s bureaucratic gatekeepers for permits and licences to visit a government official here you best have around 6 000 to 10 000 with you says mr ban the miner otherwise forget about getting an appointment there are cultural obstacles too across the continent africans accuse chinese workers of refusing to integrate many of them choose to work in unmarked offices and dormitories away from the prying eyes of authorities and potential competitors they are accused of bringing in their own labour though companies have quickly learnt they need to provide local employment if they want to stay in business from the perspective of chinese workers thousands of miles from home in an unfamiliar environment life can also be tough this place is very lonely says peng hong who manages a medicine manufacturing company in lagos and kano which employs around 350 nigerians and 45 chinese mr peng arrived in west africa in 2005 from landlocked hubei province in central china where he says life is too hard life has been hard in nigeria too we import most of our food and cook for our chinese employees he says on the weekends mr peng organises company outings for his mostly male employees to the supermarket or to lagos only chinese style karaoke bar like many arrivals mr peng has had to battle we had to clear all the trees drill our water wells rig our own electrical transmission lines he says when i first came here we had to light candles after 4pm because there was no stable electricity we could not sleep because of the heat so we would sleep outside in the courtyard chinese entrepreneurs complain too that the authorities talk big but often fail to deliver the expansion of ogun s free trade zone for example is being held up by the state s inability or unwillingness to buy up land from local chiefs chinese executives say chinese views about their host communities can be blunt nigeria has the most thieves in the world says thomas liu who runs the medicine company where mr peng works using the sort of uncompromising language that grates from accra to kinshasa you have to avoid being tricked yet despite their myriad complaints they say fortunes beckon if i could give advice to my former self it would be move faster says kent chan manager of grand shine construction materials he set up his first factory in nigeria in 2015 i actually wanted to come in 2014 but then ebola broke out if i had come that year i think business would have been even better the influx is by no means limited to nigeria mckinsey estimates there are more than 10 000 chinese businesses operating in africa 90 per cent of them privately owned drawing on the flying geese concept of japanese economist kaname akamatsu researchers at the china africa research initiative at johns hopkins school of advanced international studies argue that as costs in china rise manufacturing will gradually shift to regions like africa between 2000 and 2015 chinese companies registered more than 1 000 african manufacturing proposals with the commerce ministry in glass recycled steel ceramics gypsum board textiles dying tanneries and shoe factories to name but a few chinese companies including garment makers in tanzania and lesotho relocated not only because of cheaper labour costs they were also drawn by the prospect of tariff free exports to the us under the african growth and opportunity act and to the eu under the everything but arms agreement in ethiopia huajian from china and new wing from hong kong were attracted by the country s high grade leather the researchers at sais found once companies gain a foothold in one country many seek to expand new south group aims to open 10 industrial zones like the one in ogun across africa starting with a 700 acre facility near the kenyan city of eldoret that began business in february it plans to open in ghana and angola where as in nigeria reliance on oil exports has devastated local manufacturing in nigeria as in much of africa chinese investment provokes suspicion as well as praise but for the most part officials welcome the attention jonathan coker nigeria s former ambassador to beijing says western warnings about chinese investments are hypocritical diplomats say we will become slaves of china this is the propaganda of the west he says instead he adds nigeria has much to learn china is 10 times the size of nigeria s population but they have developed a system that can take care of their people these are the examples we want to adapt not all chinese entrepreneurs have a positive impact in madagascar they are blamed for illegal exports of rosewood and zebu a type of cattle chinese demand for african wildlife also fuels poaching from zambia to mozambique nor does ms sun see the arrival of chinese entrepreneurs as a magic bullet the author accepts that along with the promise of factories and jobs they may bring environmental degradation and friction with african communities but they are extremely entrepreneurial and they are doing profoundly important things she says not all good not all bad but we have to pay attention
as well as the us china skirmish the u k and eu have yet to seal a brexit deal the us is at odds with iran after a drone attack on saudi arabian oil fields and an iranian oil tanker caught fire after an explosion near the saudi arabian port of jeddah on friday that risks a jump in oil prices protests in iraq have turned violent turkey launched an offensive in syria and marches in hong kong might tip that economy into recession argentina is facing another fiscal crisis and looks likely to oust a market friendly government and ecuador peru and venezuela also have political problems an impeachment probe into trump as well as the 2020 election campaign could also prompt him to ramp up his anti globalization agenda

related matters or any other forward looking statement non ifrs measures this press release makes reference to certain non ifrs measures these measures are not recognized measures under ifrs do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies rather these measures are provided as additional information to complement those ifrs measures by providing further understanding of the company s results of operations from management s perspective accordingly they should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of the company s financial information reported under ifrs the company uses non ifrs measures including normalized ebitda normalized net income normalized income tax expense normalized effective tax rate normalized basic earnings per share and normalized diluted earnings per share normalized ebitda is provided to assist investors in determining the financial performance of the company s operating activities on a consistent basis by excluding certain non cash elements such as depreciation expense impairment charge and foreign exchange gain or loss on the company s long term debt denominated in u s dollars other elements such as restructuring costs and acquisition related costs may also be excluded from net income in the determination of normalized ebitda as they are considered not being reflective of the operational performance of the company normalized net income normalized income tax expense normalized effective tax rate normalized basic earnings per share and normalized diluted earnings per share in addition to the financial performance of operating activities take into account the impact of investing activities financing activities and income taxes on the company s financial results the company believes non ifrs measures are important supplemental measures of financial performance because they eliminate items that have less bearing on the company s financial performance and thus highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on ifrs measures the company also believes that securities analysts investors and other interested parties frequently use non ifrs measures in the evaluation of companies many of which present similar metrics when reporting their results management also uses non ifrs measures in order to facilitate financial performance comparisons from period to period prepare annual operating budgets assess the company s ability to meet its future debt service capital expenditure and working capital requirements and also as a component in the determination of the short term incentive compensation for the company s employees because other companies may calculate these non ifrs measures differently than the company does these metrics are not comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies normalized ebitda is defined as net income before financing costs financing income income tax expense recovery depreciation expense and normalized elements normalized net income is defined as net income before normalized elements adjusted to reflect the tax effect on these elements normalized income tax expense is defined as income tax expense adjusted to reflect the tax effect on normalized elements and to normalize specific tax elements normalized effective tax rate is based on normalized net income before normalized income tax expense normalized earnings per share basic and normalized earnings per share diluted are calculated respectively by dividing the normalized net income by the weighted average number of shares basic and the weighted average number of shares diluted the company refers the reader to the selected

by chile despertó piñera renuncia piñera ya fue que se vayan los milicos chile has woken up piñera resign piñera has gone let the milicos leave milicos is a derogatory word for police and military personnel these are some the powerful chants that have echoed throughout the streets of cities small and large in chile during mass protests that began in october 2019 poor working and oppressed people and students have united to demand dignity and human rights in one word an end to neo liberalism in chile this movement began following the october 6 announcement by the government of chile that there would be a 30 peso transit system fare hike this increase which amounts to about 0 04 usd was enough added pressure to an already tight household budget for many chileans to bring millions of people out into the streets it s not about the 30 pesos it s about 30 years for the first two weeks protests were organized by high school students who called on people to refuse to pay transit fares by october 18 the president of chile sebastián piñera had not responded to the students demands and instead declared a state of emergency and deployed the military and riot police to attack the students despite the extreme repression and curfew people in chile continued to demonstrate then on october 21 president piñera extended the state of emergency declaring we are at war against a powerful enemy who is willing to use violence without any limits with these words piñera displayed outright contempt for the people of chile and his true colours as an ally of the u s and staunch supporter of neo liberalism in chile at the same time by then protests which had largely been contained to the capital city of santiago spread to other cities at least 10 500 police and soldiers had been deployed by october 21 bbc protests against the government and neoliberalism have continued to grow and spread throughout the country and into the most oppressed sectors of society the indigenous mapuche people of chile who make up about 10 of the population have also organized and led protests demanding their self determination and land rights despite the severe repression on october 25 2019 1 2 million people marched in santiago representing diverse sectors of chilean society including social movements indigenous people women retired people unions students and more the protests have continued since then and the repression and cruelty of the piñera government and his military and police goons has reached a severity not seen in chile since the bloody pinochet dictatorship ended over 30 years ago as reported by the national institute of human rights instituto nacional de derechos humanos indh a nongovernmental organization in chile at least 177 people have faced severe eye injuries or lost their vision after being deliberately hit in the face by tear gas canisters and rubber bullets the same organization has also investigated possible torture sites and documented cases of un uniformed police or military throwing people into car trunks and vans as of october 30 2019 at least 19 people have been killed and over 1 200 people have been wounded indh has also filed 18 cases of sexual violence including rape and 92 cases of torture against police and soldiers why are people in chile protesting so how is it that in the face of so much violence people in chile have continued their mass protests what started with a transit fare increase has led to a revolt against chile s neoliberal government and institutions and even demands to change the constitution as alan vicencio a 25 year old call center worker told time magazine the whole constitution makes me angry the constitution allowed the privatization of every aspect of our lives and it s being doing it for more than 30 years often hailed as business friendly and the prime example of the success of a free market system chile is the most unequal of the 36 countries in the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd in 2017 the united nations released a report unequal origins changes and challenges in chile s social divide which explained how the richest 0 1 of the people in chile control 19 5 of the wealth privatization runs rampant in chile through all sectors of life including water roads energy healthcare and the pension system although some education is public there is a great divide between the public and private school systems the minimum wage in chile is not enough for a dignified life especially as everything is privatized making everyday life in chile very expensive for example if someone in chile made minimum wage the cost of transit to and from work would eat up 21 of their paycheque nacla org protestors in chile are fighting for their dignity they are fighting against inequality they are fighting against police and military brutality these are all symptoms of neoliberalism which is the economic policy expression of the agenda of imperialism around the world one only must look towards to the united states relationship with the government of chile to understand just how chile has become such a good ally to the u s with regard to the violence against protestors the white house stated that the united states stands with chile an important ally as it works to peacefully restore national order and president trump denounced foreign efforts to undermine chilean institutions democracy or society more broadly as president trump put it in a press conference a year ago there are so many issues that we have to discuss because chile and the united states are likeminded countries we share the most important things which are values democracy human rights freedom but chile is really something special if you look at what they ve done how far they ve come you look at how well run the country is this is what is sounds like when a government in latin america is following the orders of the u s government and their financial institutions clearly behind the repression in chile is the support of the united states but also the support of many of their imperialist allies including the government of canada in fact prime minister trudeau had a phone call with piñera in the midst of severe police and military repression and didn t say one word to him as reported by ctv news a summary from the prime minister s office of trudeau s phone call with pinera made no direct mention of the ongoing turmoil in chile a thriving country with which canada has negotiated a free trade agreement this is no surprise given that as reported by the government of canada 14 of canada s mining assets are in chile including copper gold and silver mines this includes barrick gold which had to shut down a 429 million gold mine earlier this year due to severe human rights and environmental violations both the governments of the u s and canada also want to hold up the repressive piñera government because having a neo liberal success story and a staunch ally in chile serves them well in their drive to re establish imperialist hegemony in latin america having a u s supported government in chile puts imperialists in a better position for their continued attacks against the sovereign and independent countries of cuba and venezuela chile target of imperialist aggression and exploitation the modern history of chile is a history of colonization imperialist domination and exploitation although chile won independence from spain in 1818 it wasn t until 150 years later that the people of chile had the opportunity to be truly independent from colonial and imperialist rule in 1970 the people of chile chose to reverse their history of colonization and exploitation and elected salvador allende who had a progressive and popular agenda to improve the life and oppose imperialist exploitation of chile however only three years after his election in 1973 the united states and their imperialist allies orchestrated a bloody coup d état murdering allende and installing a bloody military dictatorship in just the first 5 years of his brutal rule the u s backed dictatorship of general agosto pinochet imprisoned and tortured at least 30 000 people and disappeared 3 000 people a constitution written under the dictatorship which is the same one that enshrines privatization is still in place in chile today reviewing the modern history of chile also helps to explain the continued determination of the people of chile to continuing protesting in mass in the streets until their demands are met despite some concessions that piñera has been forced to give such as the increases to monthly pensions or the minimum wage a cabinet shuffle or agreeing not to raise the transit fare people are not leaving the streets as vilma alvarez a leader of the jumbo union jumbo is a chain of grocery stores in chile explained in an interview with the argentinian news agency pagina 12 the concessions that pinera has offered to the protesters are not enough they are another way to continue transferring money to the financial sectors and not giving any relief to the population and the demand is for piñera to resign and for a constituent assembly to be held the people of chile have had enough building solidarity with the people of chile why should working and oppressed people in canada support the struggle of people in chile for one the people of chile are facing a criminal and violent repression of their basic human rights they are being arrested tortured raped and killed because they have taken to the streets in the millions to oppose inequality and austerity and to struggle for their basic dignity as isabel sanchez stated to aljazeera news on october 26 we are of the generation that began our lives in the dictatorship and we had no youth we lost friends we saw people slaughtered we lived with fear but now the young people have blossomed they have lost that fear it is time also for us as poor working and oppressed people in canada and the united states to recognize the courage and struggle of the people of chile stand with them and echo their voices also as people living in the united states and canada we have the added responsibility to stand in solidarity with the people of chile because the governments of canada and the u s are supporting the brutality and repression of the piñera government chile diaspora supports the struggle in the u s and canada members of the chilean community and their allies have also taken to the streets to call for human rights for people in chile and denounce the indiscriminate violence waged against protestors by the piñera government there have been solidarity protests organized in major cities across the united states and in canada including in montreal toronto calgary edmonton winnipeg vancouver and victoria these solidarity actions have not only brought together people from a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences but also many generations of chileans from those that fled during the pinochet dictatorship to young people from chile who are in the canada and the u s to study in vancouver the chilean diaspora has come together with others living in canada in a new group named van4chile van4chile has organized protests and public demonstrations in solidarity with the people of chile including an energetic protest in front of the cbc in downtown vancouver on november 2 2019 at this action more than 200 people from all walks of life came together to demand that the cbc cover the protests in chile they also called out the government of canada s complicity in the repression of people s human and democratic rights in chile to get involved and follow the work of van4chile find them on facebook instagram and twitter van4chile don t boycott chile it is also important to say that within the movement in solidarity with the people of chile there has been calls for a boycott against chilean wine or other products produced in chile while this call for boycott may have been made with good intentions the most important action that we as peace loving people in canada and the u s can take for the courageous people of chile is not to boycott them but to support them perhaps we must think more critically about what boycotting chilean wine will do for people in chile today in chile the working class and oppressed people are under brutal attack economically politically and socially by the sebastian piñera government and imperialist exploitation so it is possible that a boycott that targets chile s economy has the potential to damage their movement and to reinforce the austerity which they are already living under any damage to the economy of chile will surely be passed on from chile s richest families and capitalist class they have billion dollars to survive to poor and working people in chile increasing the austerity pressure and inequality that they face and chile is not only a wine producer do we want also to boycott the mining metal mineral companies whose products amount to 60 or 40 billion of all of chile s exports making up 20 percent of chile s gdp the wine industry exports only 2 billion of the 70 77 billion of total exports from chile that being said do we really want the wine industry in chile go bankrupt who is benefiting from that working people of course not do we want workers and people who work in wine industry to lose their jobs or do we want to help the capitalist class to find excuses to lay off workers and impose downsizing and overtime aren t these the very policies of neoliberalism that chilean people and we are opposing isn t this shooting ourselves in the foot furthermore it is also important to consider the alternative if people around the world are asked to boycott chilean wine because the government of chile is reactionary is drinking wine from the u s canada france spain england australia italy or germany who are responsible for the slaughter of tens of millions of people around the world including chile s coup september 11 1973 really any better the difference is that chile is an oppressed country a third world country chile is not an imperialist country with vast finances and industrial resources chile as a country struggles within the world market which is overwhelmingly dominated by imperialist countries and their corporations including wine companies applying any given tactic to any struggle could be very damaging to the struggle itself if it is not well thought out in the history of the struggle for a better world a boycott movement has never been the most effective way to build solidarity the only effective boycott movement was one that was demanded by the people within the country being boycotted and this was the successful boycott movement against apartheid south africa if we can take all the energy that could go into a boycott and instead use it to raise sympathy and solidarity with chilean people in canada and the u s through street actions petitioning educational events and more our impact will be much greater as poor working and oppressed people in canada u s and around the world we must raise the question of human rights torture rape execution repression and yes neoliberalism and austerity measures in chile we need to expose the atrocities of piñera and the complicity of governments like the u s and canada in this brutality sebastian piñera must go originally published volume 13 issue 11 of fire this time newspaper www firethistime net
by graham peebles depending on who you listen to and how it is defined worldwide income and wealth inequality is either more acute than it has ever been or the gap between the rich and the rest is narrowing the numbers may be distorted by conflicting statistics but what is indisputable is the shadow of extreme poverty that billions are living under the economic induced anxiety millions more face every day and the fact that the rich continue to get richer of the 7 2 billion people in the world around half are living on less than usd 2 00 a day that s the official barrier to the land of poverty set by the world bank most of these people are to be found in the slums or villages of india china and the shantytowns and rural settlements of sub saharan africa where 48 per cent of the population live on less than usd 1 25 a day according to the world bank in the land of the free where anyone can supposedly become a zillionaire income and wealth inequality is the most acute of any industrialized nation and the highest it s been since 1928 inequality noam chomsky says has reached historic heights heights revealed by oxfam in a recent report using data from the credit suisse s 2013 global wealth report almost half of the world s wealth is now owned by just 1 per cent of the population the wealth of the 1 per cent richest people in the world amounts to usd 110 trillion that s 65 times the total wealth of the bottom half of the world s population the bottom half of the world s population owns the same as the richest 85 people in the world the washington post reports credit suisse s findings that the lower half of the global population possesses barely 1 per cent of global wealth while the richest 10 per cent of adults own 86 per cent of all wealth and the top 1 per cent account for 46 per cent of the total in the land of the free where anyone can supposedly become a zillionaire income and wealth inequality is the most acute of any industrialized nation and the highest it s been since 1928 the median wage for a working man in the us today according to nobel prize winning economist joseph steiglitz is below its level in 1989 but not to worry the top 1 per cent in america are doing just fine oxfam found that the wealthiest 1 per cent captured 95 per cent of post financial crisis growth while the bottom 90 per cent became poorer to be born poor in the us is to remain poor upward mobility remains virtually non existent and the american dream little more than a frothy hollywood fantasy the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd makes clear its view in a comprehensive report pointing to the stark differences existing in income within oecd countries it reaches 10 to 1 in italy japan korea and the united kingdom leaps to around 14 to 1 in israel turkey and the united states and 27 to 1 in mexico and chile it also lists the us as having the highest poverty rate of all oecd countries aside from turkey and slumbering near the bottom in terms of social justice income imbalance is only part of the divisive and socially unjust problem of inequality to be born poor in the us is to remain poor upward mobility remains virtually non existent and the american dream little more than a frothy hollywood fantasy wealth inequality is the other half of the puzzle and it s constantly growing as french economist thomas piketty makes clear in his new book capital and the 21st century in societies where the rate of return on capital outstrips economic growth wealth inequality ineluctably rises once constituted capital reproduces itself faster than economic output increases accelerating the social chasm that is wealth inequality making it more difficult month on month year on year to close the wealth gap and reduce the inequity in europe the wealthiest 10 per cent own 60 per cent of wealth in the us its 70 per cent piketty warns that if wealth inequality is allowed to grow the consequences are potentially terrifying discolouring democracy inequality has far reaching social effects and erodes democracy grossly unequal societies have greater levels of alcohol and drug addiction more crime lower mortality rates higher child pregnancies and lower literacy levels than less unequal countries political influence and control are added bonuses for the rich as for the rest well they get to vote but have little or no influence over government policy and overwhelmingly distrust politicians with dire poverty as experienced by the 3 5 billion living somehow goes lack of education vulnerability and exploitation all of which discolour democracy inequality is the plague of our times a divisive epidemic caused by the unjust economic system based on neo liberalism or market fundamentalism which saturates the world it is a system which noam chomsky says is so dysfunctional that it cannot put eager hands to needed work as would happen if the economy were designed to serve human need rather than create wealth beyond avarice for the privileged few this dysfunctional and socially unjust system has facilitated very high concentrations of wealth and with it political power which yields legislation which drives the cycle forward based as it is on competition this dysfunctional model breeds insecurity and stress encourages separation and division leading to social tension and a lack of trust a recent survey found that in america where inequality is off the scale only 15 per cent admitted trusting their neighbours whereas in more equitable societies the number is closer to 60 per cent it encourages short termism and promotes the idea that everyone and everything is a commodity to be bought and sold at a profit it has condemned billions to lives of stifling poverty concentrated extreme wealth and power and poisoned the planet perhaps irredeemably the driving doctrine of neo liberalism is selfishness well expressed chomsky relates by adam smith 1723 90 in what he called the vile maxim of the masters of the mankind all for ourselves and nothing for other people it is a maxim religiously adhered to by the corporate proponents of the system and their political allies according to a small army of leading economists many of whom forecast the 2008 crash it is a system on the brink of collapse again and this time they say it will be worse than in 2008 the neo liberal model is an unjust system that belongs in the past it serves not the majority of people the 99 9 per cent who have had enough of social injustice government duplicity and inequity peter schiff the best selling author and chief executive of euro pacific capital says the crisis is imminent we re broke we owe trillions look at our budget deficit look at the debt to gdp ratio the unfunded liabilities if we were in the eurozone they would kick us out schiff predicted the 2007 meltdown and believes that the 2008 stock market collapse wasn t the real crash the real crash is coming and it will be worse than the great recession it is a view shared by others including robert wiedemer best selling author of the aftershock investor who points out that the so called recovery is 100 per cent fake he explains that the gdp of america in 2013 grew 2 per cent or usd 350 billion but we borrowed over usd 700 billion that tells you right there that we are borrowing more than we are even growing he goes on to predict the big one is coming we re just pumping up the bubbles and all that s going to do is make them a lot worse when they pop marc faber financial adviser and fund manager expresses the same view saying we are in a gigantic financial asset bubble which could burst any day as does renowned pundit warren buffet who is pointing to an imminent and devastating crash given unprecedented levels of debt and youth unemployment together with growing inequality and a flock of financial bubbles from bonds to housing from britain where it is burgeoning and ready to burst to australia and the us via china and various points in between this includes some developing countries that have been persuaded to adopt the same model because according to the high priests of corporate capitalism there is no alternative well for the millions and billions living without we had better find one and soon the collapse of this violent and unjust monster seems inevitable whether it arrives in 2014 2015 or a few years later there is of course a body of less pessimistic views these come mainly from those in charge of western economies treasury men and national bankers wedded to the comforting model of the familiar their political careers uppermost in their ambitious and dishonest minds they cling to a dying paradigm and cannot see a more socially just unifying alternative notwithstanding their remonstrations the urgent need for a new economic system based on equality and fairness is clear the neo liberal model is an unjust system that belongs in the past it serves not the majority of people the 99 9 per cent who have had enough of social injustice government duplicity and inequity and have taken to the streets in huge numbers in cities across the world to make known their collective view sharing the common sense alternative we are living in times of great change as we move from one model of civilization built in a time when conflicting isms dominated man s thinking and religious political and social ideologies fought for dominance new ideas based on perennial principles of freedom social justice and unity are increasingly influencing our thinking qualities like cooperation tolerance and synthesis are at the heart of the new way such ideas run contrary to the existing socio economic ideologies with their focus on the individual competition and nationalism and are anathema to the reactionary mainly conservative large and small c neo liberal disciples who resist change as they seek to maintain the status quo that rewards them so very well our civilisation is so dominated by market fundamentalist madness that in a world of plenty we allow 20 000 children to die every day of starvation and poverty related illnesses and millions more to live unfulfilled stunted lives the forecast economic crash is not an isolated collapse it is a symptom of a broader movement of change and the dissolution of inadequate structures the old must give way in order to accommodate new truly democratic ways of organizing society as thomas piketty says if democracy is some day to regain control of capitalism it must start by recognizing that the concrete institutions in which democracy and capitalism are embodied need to be reinvented again and again our civilisation is so dominated by market fundamentalist madness that in a world of plenty we allow 20 000 children to die every day of starvation and poverty related illnesses and millions more to live unfulfilled stunted lives without access to education health care and basic sanitation and shelter this and a plethora of other poverty related issues must all come to an end forced labour debt bondage trafficking of persons primarily women and girls for prostitution and associated poisons the displacement of indigenous people the destruction of the environment and the denial of people s basic human rights piketty asserts that we need to rebuild the democratic institutions that can redistribute income and wealth redistribution or sharing of resources skills and knowledge is the common sense option to the destructive neo liberal model putting the principle of sharing at the heart of the economic system is a sane alternative that is increasingly gaining ground a plethora of sharing initiatives have been set up many of them local from sharing unwanted items through various recycling websites to car and bicycle sharing schemes systems of information sharing are growing whether smallholder farmers in india spreading their wisdom and sharing their experiences through a mobile phone app or the mighty

ges earnings call for the period ending november 2 2019 guess inc ges 1 90 q3 2019 earnings call 4 45 p m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator good day everyone and welcome to the guess third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings conference call on the call are carlos alberini chief executive officer and sandeep reddy chief financial officer during today s call the company will be making forward looking statements including comments regarding future plans business and financial opportunities strategic initiatives capital allocation and short and long term financial outlook the company s actual results may differ materially from current expectations based on risk factors included in today s press release and the company s quarterly and annual reports filed with the sec now i would like to turn the call over to carlos carlos e alberini chief executive officer and director thank you operator good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today we reported our third quarter results today and we are very pleased to deliver operating earnings and earnings per share above the high end of our guidance for the period adjusted operating earnings increased 4 versus last year driven by a 2 revenue increase and a gross margin increase of 90 basis points which was offset by an adjusted sg a rate increase of 90 basis points due to pressure from corporate investments during the quarter our performance reflected mixed results across our regional businesses europe had a terrific quarter with very strong performance across all channels while the americas showed strength in our wholesale business we experienced deceleration in our retail business with comp sales below our expectations asia was also weaker and our licensing business had a better performance than we expected in the quarter i believe that our business in north america was influenced by factors at a macro level primarily impacting customer traffic including weather and tourism and internal factors related to our fall winter product collection and the inventory position as we focused on operating our retail business with leaner inventories we believe our ownership and product for certain classifications would have benefited from more inventory depth and breadth to comp last year s volumes we are correcting this as we speak and are confident that we will be in a much stronger position in the new year regarding asia the issues we faced earlier in the year in our three major markets of greater china south korea and japan still persist today similarly to the americas retail business we believe that some of the factors impacting our business here are macro driven and not in our control these include specific regional issues such as the hong kong protests situation and the china trade war development but there is a lot about our product assortment and styling our inventory levels and our promotional cadence that are totally in our control and we can impact going forward to improve on our current trends all considered we continue to believe that the guess brand and our product offering are very relevant to the asian consumer and that the long term opportunity in this region is very compelling and remains intact in spite of the current challenges we are monitoring the situation very closely and have adjusted our investment plans for the region based on the current trends and our medium term expectations regarding our product in asia specifically we strongly believe that we have an opportunity to improve our offering by developing a more local assortment that caters to specific customer needs and taste regarding styling sizing and fit which are very different by market or sub region and also different from our existing lines we are mobilizing our teams to create product capabilities to address this in addition we should have had more newness on the floor and online that were impacted by the high levels of older season inventory that we came into the year with as we work through the inventory on hand we are ensuring that future buys incorporate the newness because the consumer would expect from our brand in terms of marketing we believe that we can do a better job partnering with local celebrities and influencers while leveraging social media platforms and live streaming capabilities to market to consumers more effectively lastly regarding our promotional cadence the chinese market is very competitive and we have an opportunity to adjust prices for certain products where local brands have been very aggressive with fast development and sharp pricing to capture share we ve also taken action on this in the fourth quarter our business in europe had a very strong quarter with revenues up 9 and operating earnings up a 153 for the period operating margin more than doubled in the quarter and we are very pleased with our performance across all channels and all markets in the region during the quarter we continued to manage our company s overall inventories effectively and we ended the period with a reduction in global inventory of 5 versus last year and we are on track to end the year with a decrease of inventory in the double digit range we continued to make good progress in reducing our dependency on china sourcing and mitigating potential tariff risks without compromising the quality of our products while improving cost performance our product development and sourcing teams are doing a phenomenal job with this and i believe that their work will have a significant long term impact in our infrastructure and in our product capabilities regarding quality speed and cost optimization we are also reaching productive costing negotiations with vendors that remain committed to china sourcing but are willing to offer very compelling prices in spite of potential tariff increases as a result our expected percentage of china sourced apparel product may increase from 12 to 23 for next year this increase will have no negative impact on our costs if the new tariffs get enacted let me now comment on our updated guidance for the year we have raised the low end of our eps guidance by 0 03 due to our q3 beat while maintaining high end of guidance the fact that we have been able to do this in light of revenue softness in americas retail and asia speaks to the strength of our diversified business model where the positive momentum this year in europe and americas wholesale coupled with effective expense management have helped offset the weakness that we are seeing in the two other regions i am very confident that we have several levers to pull as we continued to drive improved profitability in our business model i now have been back with the guess for almost 10 months and i feel great about the progress that we are making in multiple fronts i strongly believe that the last few months in particular have been critical for our team and our organization as we finalized our strategic business plan we look forward to sharing our plan with you during our investor day event that is planned for this coming tuesday december 3rd at the intercontinental hotel in new york for the event we ll have a few of our executives present and katie anderson our new cfo will also participate in the meeting katie joins us from california pizza kitchen where she is currently cfo and brings a strong background in finance and strategy i hope that you can come to our event and if you haven t been invited and have interest in attending we would love to hear from you so we can accommodate you this will be a webcast event and we will share our key strategic priorities for the next five years to take guess to the next level of growth and profitability i think you will like what you will hear as we worked on our long term strategy we continue to operate the business and developing our model following the key principles i articulated during my first call back with guess in march the first one of those principles relates to capital allocation as you know we made the decision to redeploy capital and return incremental value to our shareholders through significant share repurchases while reducing our dividend by 50 during the third quarter we completed the accelerated share repurchase program which amounted to 170 million with this we have now repurchased a total of 16 4 million shares representing slightly over 20 of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year the expected accretion for this year is forecasted at 0 13 per share and is included in our guidance regarding cash flows as a result of this transaction of the dividend reduction we continue to expect a positive impact to our cash flow generation of approximately 30 million this year and 40 million next year in addition we plan to spend not more than 68 million in capex this year versus a 108 million last year and we also expect a meaningful improvement in free cash flow generation over last year through improved operating results coupled with better working capital management and on the subject of working capital apart from inventory management we have targeted extending the payment terms to our suppliers to better align them with our cash conversion cycle the benefits of which we should see in our free cash flows starting next year also as part of our capital allocation review we have decided to transition the operation of our underwear business in south korea to our local licensee that has established strength in the category this will enable us to focus on our core lines while leveraging the expertise of this licensee partner and reduce our capital investments in the business our guidance for the fourth quarter for asia reflects this transition as we expected to be executed during the fourth quarter the second principle i have discussed on previous calls relates to product development and distribution optimization we have made good progress with denim development and expanded product presentation in both our stores and online all of which is contributing to improved results we are also pleased with our progress with the marciano brand both in north america and europe as we have strengthened our design teams and refocused our merchandising efforts we also expect continuing improvement in sales and profitability with this business regarding men s and accessories our efforts to develop products that are more specific to each customer segment are continuing and we expect the results of this efforts will benefit us in the next fiscal year as we continue to search for efficiencies in our global model we have identified an opportunity to develop and leverage a single factory outlet line to serve both north america and europe instead of the two separate lines that we have today it is clear that the assortments and styling between both lines are very consistent and offer a big opportunity for consolidation this will yield even more brand consistency across both regions improved product quality and significant cost savings as we leverage the scale of device and we reduced development costs additionally we plan for our e commerce offering to be our largest assortment and become the biggest representation of the brand so that our customers can find their choice of product on our side if they cannot find it in a store this will also equip our store teams with a broader assortment to service our customers this is an important initiative to support our omni channel vision the third principle i have alluded to in the past relates to the opportunity to pursue global strategies across key functional areas the main areas that we have focused on are inventory management logistics and distribution sourcing and product development it real estate and omni channel capabilities these functional capabilities are a critical part of what will drive our strategic business plan and we will tell you more about our vision for them during our investor day meeting the fourth principle i have mentioned in the past relates to our overall cost structure and opportunities for optimization regarding these we have plans to optimize the inventory allocation and replenishment processes and refine our store labor scheduling module to better align with traffic patterns in addition to this we see opportunities for rent reduction and rationalization of our cost structure by simplifying and streamlining processes the fifth principle i have mentioned in the past is customer centricity you will hear more about our approach during our investor day next week but our goal is to significantly improve our customer experience enhance data capture strengthened data analysis on customer segmentation and develop a strong personalized marketing model that s our roadmap we believe that we have a big opportunity here at a global level and this initiative should result in increased sales productivity and better conversion rates as part of this initiative we continue to work on our implementation plan for sales force as our main e commerce platform to service our business in both north america and europe this will be a critical enabler of the improved customer experience and a driver of future sales growth we continue to believe that the new model and capabilities should result in increased penetration of e commerce sales that are more in line with best in class performance in our industry in closing i want to say that i strongly believe our opportunities to continue to expand globally is very significant and unique due to the power of the guess brand and so is our opportunity to continue to attract customers with three distinct profiles heritage millennials and generation zs primarily due to our highly differentiated approach these customers are engaging with our brand at a deeper level and are very attractive to our company s future last but not least our company has a large sales base however our profitability is not a good representation of our business model and margin potential and this is despite our adjusted operating profit growing over 30 annually in the last two years and our guidance for adjusted operating profit projected to grow about 25 this year i believe there is a lot more operating margin expansion opportunities here and it is in our control we plan to discuss these topics in more depth next week and hope you will leave the event with a clear understanding of our opportunity and our plan to attack it i now want to pass the call to sandeep who is here in his last earnings call with us i want to thank sandeep for all his contributions to our company during his last nine years with guess sandeep leaves a very strong team in all his areas of responsibility and i know that we will not miss a beat during the transition i also want to wish you the very best in your future sandeep it has been great working together during the last few months thank you and please go ahead sandeep reddy chief financial and accounting officer thank you carlos that is much appreciated good afternoon everyone during this conference call our comments reference certain non gaap or adjusted measures please refer to today s earnings release for gaap reconciliations or descriptions of such measures third quarter revenues were 616 million up 2 in us dollars and 4 in constant currency versus the prior year i would like to highlight that this was our 13th consecutive quarter of revenue growth total company gross margin increased 90 basis points to 37 3 driven by higher imus this was on top of a 160 basis point improvement in gross margins in last year s third quarter adjusted sg a as a percentage of sales increased by 90 basis points primarily driven by pressure from corporate investments adjusted operating profit for the third quarter was 23 million an increase of 4 versus the adjusted operating profit last year adjusted operating margin finished at 3 7 flat with last year and better than the high end of our guidance the operating margin guidance included a negative impact in the third quarter of this year of 50 basis points due to a shift in timing of shipments that benefited the second quarter i would like to point out that on a net basis we reported minimal non operating expense in the quarter as net unrealized losses on non operating assets were offset by unrealized revaluation gains on foreign currency exposures this compared to non operating expense of 5 8 million in the third quarter last year our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 24 down from 32 last year primarily driven by the mix of statutory earnings adjusted diluted earnings per share finished at 0 22 above the high end of our guidance of 0 18 per share driven by better adjusted operating profit and the lower than expected tax rate this compared to last year s adjusted diluted earnings per share of 0 13 also included in adjusted eps this year was 0 02 in accretion from the convert transaction and share repurchases now for some more color by segment americas retail revenues for the quarter finished down 5 in us dollars and 4 in constant currency comp sales for the quarter including e commerce were down 3 in us dollars and in constant currency finishing below our expectations the negative comps in the quarter were driven by negative traffic and aurs as our comp trends for the quarter deteriorated starting with the labor day weekend e commerce had an immaterial impact on comps for the quarter americas retail operating margins in the quarter contracted 110 basis points breaking a sequence of eight consecutive quarters of operating margin expansion the contraction in margins was driven by markdowns and deleverage from lower sales partially offset by better imus moving to americas wholesale revenues grew 7 in us dollars and 8 in constant currency and were driven by a continuing strong performance in our us department store specialty and off price business the americas wholesale operating margins in the quarter expanded 20 basis points european revenues for the quarter grew versus last year by 9 in us dollars and 13 in constant currency and were driven by new store openings growth in wholesale revenue and positive comps comps including e commerce finished up 1 in us dollars and up 5 in constant currency e commerce improved the comps for the quarter by 3 percentage points the comp increase marked the 17th consecutive quarter of constant currency positive comps for the european region our european wholesale business also continues to be very strong we closed the order book for the spring summer 2020 season during the quarter and recorded our sixth consecutive season of double digit growth in the region european segment margin improved by 410 basis points due to higher imus lower distribution costs leverage and lower retail markdowns we now expect lower european logistics cost to contribute at least 150 basis points to margin expansion in europe for the year moving to asia third quarter revenues were down 8 in us dollars and down 5 in constant currency comps including e commerce were down 21 in us dollars and down 19 in constant currency e commerce decreased comps by 2 percentage points our performance in the region was significantly below our expectations as traffic trends in the stores deteriorated during the second half of the quarter the weakness was consistent across all our major markets in asia that is korea china and japan operating margin for the asia segment contracted 520 basis points in the quarter primarily due to higher markdowns and expense deleverage as a result of the negative comps moving onto the balance sheet accounts receivable was 300 million up 5 in us dollars and 6 in constant currency inventories were 520 million down 5 in us dollars and down 4 in constant currency versus last year this was another quarter of sequential improvement while we ve made a lot of progress on inventory this year we are still carrying some excess inventory from the end of last year and expect to continue to dispose this inventory through a combination of selling it in our own retail outlet stores as well as using stock liquidation channels so we can end the year at significantly healthier position than last year free cash flow for the first nine months of the year was negative 79 million an improvement of 43 million versus negative 122 million last year driven by 26 million lower capital expenditures and 17 million of improvement in working capital if we exclude the impact of the 46 million eu commission fine paid earlier this year our free cash flows improved by 89 million versus last year as carlos mentioned during the quarter we completed the 170 million asr that we entered into during the first quarter of this year a total of 5 4 million shares were delivered to us in september to close out the asr as a reminder 5 2 million additional shares were already delivered to us against the asr during the first quarter of this year including open market purchases and the 170 million asr we have repurchased a total of 16 4 million shares at a cost of 281 million this year resulting in an average price per share of 17 13 we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 110 million compared to last year s 139 million cash less debt at the end of the quarter was negative 207 million compared to 99 million last year moving onto the guidance i should point out that our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2020 does not assume any asset impairment charges also guidance for revenues and comp sales for the total company and by segment is included in a supplemental table attached to our earnings release for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we expect revenues for the quarter to be up 2 5 to 3 5 in constant currency at prevailing exchange rates we estimate that currency will be roughly a 1 5 percentage point headwind on consolidated revenue growth for the quarter our gross margin is expected to be up due to imu improvement from our supply chain initiatives as well as lower markdowns and obsolescence expense due to a cleaner inventory position than last year the sg a rate is expected to be down slightly to up slightly compared to last year we are planning an operating margin for the quarter between 11 5 and 12 with a 20 basis point unfavorable impact from currency the adjusted earnings per share is planned in the range of 1 07 per share and 1 12 per share including 0 05 of headwind due to currency the earnings per share guidance includes 0 21 in accretion due to the impact of the convert transaction and share repurchases our adjusted eps guidance includes an assumption of 1 7 million of cash interest expense and amortization of loan fees related to the convertible debt transaction our tax rate for the quarter is estimated to be 21 we expect consolidated revenues for the year to be up between 5 7 and 6 in constant currency at prevailing exchange rates we estimate currency to have a 3 negative impact on consolidated revenue growth for the year for the full year we expect gross margins to be up due to improved imus in both the americas and in europe as well as lower logistics and distribution costs in europe the adjusted sg a rate is expected to be up for the year due to an increase in performance based compensation our adjusted tax rate for the year is estimated to be 25 we are planning an adjusted operating margin between 5 4 and 5 6 with a 10 basis points negative currency impact on operating margin and our guidance assumes that foreign currencies will remain roughly at prevailing rates adjusted earnings per share is planned in the range of 1 31 and 1 36 with a 0 06 headwind from currency as a reminder our prior guidance for the year was 1 28 to 1 36 so we have raised the low end of our guidance by 0 03 and maintained the high end the guidance includes 0 13 in estimated accretion due to the share repurchases and convert transaction and includes an assumption of 5 3 million of cash interest and loan amortization expense the high end of our new guidance represents a 39 increase over last year s adjusted eps capex for the year is expected to range from 63 million to 68 million to support store openings key store remodels and investments in our technology infrastructure to support long term growth please note that this is down from 108 million in the prior year as i mentioned earlier on the call excluding the impact of the 46 million eu commission fine our free cash flows improved over last year to date by 89 million this was driven by improvements in inventory and working capital management in addition to lower capital expenditures we expect to see further improvement in free cash flow in the final quarter of the year and to finish with a 90 million improvement in free cash flow for the year which is 136 million excluding the impact of the eu commission fine due to continued benefits from working capital management and lower capital expenditures in the current quarter the board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend of 11 25 per share payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on december 11th 2019 before i close the prepared remarks i would like to take the opportunity to say that it s been a privilege to work at guess for the past nine years it has been an incredible journey for me both personally and professionally i would like to thank my finance team for their support over the years and i m so proud of them for the way they evolved the function finally i would like to thank carlos paul and maurice marciano the board and all the associates i ve worked with for their partnership and wish the company continued success in the future with that i will conclude the company s remarks and open the call up for your questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session our first question comes from susan anderson from b riley fbr your line is now open susan anderson b riley fbr analyst hi good evening nice job on the quarter i guess i would like to maybe get a little hi how it s going a little bit more color on the americas retail comp and kind of a step back that we re seeing taken and then into the fourth quarter as well as the operating margin what are your thoughts i guess around the store base given now the slower comp and then also that deleverage on the operating margin front and do you think you can get the comp back positive thanks carlos e alberini chief executive officer and director thank you susan this is carlos and good afternoon susan anderson b riley fbr analyst hi carlos carlos e alberini chief executive officer and director hi just what we saw during the third quarter was primarily driven by traffic and aur we traffic has been negative in for the early part of the year first quarter and second quarter however what we saw in the first and second quarter was we were able to more than offset the traffic declines with conversion and upt improvements so during the third quarter our conversion and upt was better than a year ago was not as positive as it was earlier in the year to be able to more than compensated the traffic declines and the aur declines as well we as we mentioned in the prepared remarks we are also lightening very specific key categories where we like breadth and depth i think that might have impacted conversion to certain extent and even when conversion was a tailwind as i indicated was not as strong as it had been we do expect this trend to continue into q4 even when we are making changes to our inventory position as fast as we can to really strengthen those categories that where we would lie with respect to the comps going forward while we see that pressure in the fourth quarter we were up against healthy comps in the third quarter and we are up against even healthier comps in the fourth quarter from last year so while we see that pressure impacting us we think that going into the new year things are going to be very different and of course we are correcting the inventory position that we go into next year with we definitely have time to be able to adjust i think that your question was also about the store base and the deleveraging i just we are pleased with the stores and the portfolio that we have obviously we continued to look at opportunities to improve on occupancy cost structure and as we have many stores that are coming to lease expiration we take every single opportunity to try to improve on that and if the numbers don t look compelling we do what we have always done which is we exit the location if we cannot achieve a reasonable deal every store has to stand on its own sandeep reddy chief financial and accounting officer and i think as you asked also what operating margin and the cadence going into q4 season so i think obviously with the comp guidance for q4 are down mid single digits to down low single digits which is a bit of a deceleration against q3 there is going to be pressure on operating margins into the fourth quarter as well but as carlos mentioned we are taking a lot of actions to actually remediate that as we go into the end of the year and into next year so i think we are fully expecting to start recovering as those initiatives take hold carlos e alberini chief executive officer and director one more thing i would say is during the quarter we saw tourist locations underperforming the non tourist locations obviously this is a global brand and we are impacted by how tourists react and how they are shopping also weather was not ideal because it was warmer it wasn t conducive to for cold weather products so and this is a key classification both inside the third quarter and also impacting fourth quarter we have i think terrific assortment of product that is conducive for cold weather and obviously the weather in the fourth quarter could be a major kind of an impact to really move both the level of business and also aur susan anderson b riley fbr analyst got it and then if i could just add a follow up on asia it looks a little bit worse than they are also i know that s been a tough geography for a lot of people given the macro issues are you seeing any stability at all with some of the initiatives you re working on in terms of fit and adjusting the product and marketing and maybe if you could talk about what else you re doing to kind of try and get that back on track carlos e alberini chief executive officer and director yes thank you well definitely the softness in asia has been now with us for a few quarters we saw a very sudden change in trends as you know at the beginning of the year and it was just after chinese new year we experienced softness in our three major markets i m talking about greater china japan and korea and those trends got even softer during the q3 as you indicated the changes when you look at what happened and how it happened this changes lead us to believe that there is something that is playing out at a macro level and we know that there is a lot that is impacting the region that is completely outside our control like the hong kong situation the china us trade war also korea and japan trade war unusual whether there were a lot of things that happened during this quarter i don t know if those are the reason why the softness accelerated but what we do know is that the retail environment is challenging and our customer traffic is down across all markets there is not that much that we can do on that but we see significant opportunities to improve internally and many of those things start with product and you referred to that we believe that the product requirements for the region are very specific in korea and japan we are developing specific product and we have been for several years but we do not do that in china at the moment so we do have an opportunity to better address the customer needs in terms of product styling sizing and fit and also we think that as we study the flow of our inventory we believe that we have been impacted by insufficient newness in our inventory position especially in greater china the composition of the product offering has been impacted by the high level of older season inventories that we came into with and as we work through the current inventory and all that excess we are ensuring that we are very careful with how we buy the future product and we do incorporate newness we think that there is also an opportunity on prices we have been analyzing our price points by products and compared to some other brands that are have become relevant in the market and we think that this brands have been aggressive with fast development and also very sharp pricing so we are adjusting to that and then with respect to specific product as you asked we think that that is going to take some time we are really trying to analyze whether our existing lines from korea and japan can serve that purpose to a great degree but we still think that there is a need for a very specific more localized market product strategy and that s what we are doing and we are building the team to be able to do that if this you didn t ask about marketing but we think that marketing is a big factor here too we think that there is an opportunity to enhance the how we collaborate with partnerships with music bands celebrities and influencers and we have now proven that working with the groups that have high local relevancy is very effective great example of this is generations that we used in japan about a year ago we did a big collaboration and it was super successful and when we go with groups that are not as relevant to the local markets we don t see the same level of success so for that reason we are redoing another collaboration with generations in japan this coming q1 and we are excited about that at the end of the day the key thing here is when we look at the region it s the long term potential for guess in asia and i am very convinced that this potential remains very compelling and represents a great example of what i call asymmetrical risk what does that mean it means that the business is relatively small compared to our overall business we have a relatively variable expense structure especially when you think about the stores and flexible rents that we have there or short leases and kick out clauses and the opportunity for growth is incredible especially with our brand the brand is well known it resonates with the asian consumer we have done it before and i think that we will do it again so we when i look at this obviously is somewhat disappointing to have to go through the current slowness but when you think about the size of the markets that we are talking about we re talking about roughly a 13 trillion economy in greater china that s huge that middle class is the biggest middle class in the world so we see a lot of opportunity and we think that we are protecting the downside and we have a business model that can really navigate through the challenging times and especially considering that the size of the business is not that big compared to the total company so we are going to talk more about this when we see you on tuesday but i think that the opportunity remains very very powerful and a great one for guess susan anderson b riley fbr analyst great that s very helpful good luck this holiday and sandeep i wish you all the best sandeep reddy chief financial and accounting officer thank you susan carlos e alberini chief executive officer and director thank you susan susan anderson b riley fbr analyst thanks operator our next question comes from janine stichter from jefferies company your line is now open janine stichter jefferies company analyst hi good afternoon want to switch gears a little bit and talk about europe you saw some nice margin improvement there and it seems like your beating your own internal forecast of what you can do to improve the european logistics costs on that side of the business so can you just can you talk a little bit about what s going on there how you re driving that improvement and then ultimately what the timeline looks like for recapturing some of that headwind that you saw last year from the dc transition carlos e alberini chief executive officer and director sure janine thank you we are obviously super excited about the business in europe we have seen strength across the board across countries across channels so we couldn t be more pleased when you think about i think sandeep mentioned how strong our wholesale businesses too we have seen several years now of significant improvement on growth in our wholesale business that s not easy to do and i think it speaks about the strength of the brand and how good the product is and how well perceived our business and our relationships are so very excited there with respect to the retail business there are some major differences to what we see in other parts of the world and it starts with traffic our traffic in the retail stores is positive and we also see similar type of momentum online so the momentum overall is very positive i think that that also enables us to really move very quickly through the inventory changes that we wanted to make as you may remember we ended last year with some excess inventory in europe and we had a plan to really dispose of that through both internal channels like our outlet stores and also using the off price channel and we have been able to move quicker as just as we navigated those inventory components which really also contributed to giving us more ability to invest in units and really have a very good inventory position already so overall i think that the business is doing very well with respect to the operating side obviously we are expecting and we are guiding to a major operating margin expansion in europe this year and we feel that is something that is definitely happening but it still leaves a lot of opportunity for continued growth of operating margin you mentioned logistics and distribution we re going to talk more about that next week but we do have a plan to continue to improve on that we think as we look at what s happening with other businesses that are similar to ours and the kind of logistics and distribution costs that those businesses consume we know that there is a big opportunity for us to do better and we have a plan to do so janine stichter jefferies company analyst great that s really helpful sandeep reddy chief financial and accounting officer and i just want to add something to that janine i think for the margin recapture that you talked about i think for the first nine months we re already over 400 basis points in margin improvement for europe we expect to see this continuing trend and if we actually get to that we get very close to double digit margins because last year we were 5 4 in operating margins and so i think the thing about this is it s extremely powerful in terms of the total company business model as well and as carlos spoke to it as a diversified business model the strength of the european business has been able to offset the weakness that we saw in the americas retail and asia business and this is really critical in actually the 120 basis point improvement that we re talking about for the current year despite this softness and there is much more that we can actually go for because operating efficiencies also have contributed in the current year but there is a lot more that we ll talk about next week in new york so i think it s really exciting to see that even with this softness we ve been able to drive so much of margin expansion janine stichter jefferies company analyst that s really helpful color just have quick one also on the americas wholesale business you saw a nice growth this quarter you have been seeing nice growth and it looks like you re guiding to a decline in the fourth quarter is anything there was timing are you seeing anything in terms of sell throughs changing with your wholesale partners carlos e alberini chief executive officer and director yes no it s actually i think a better way to look at this is more on an annualized basis i mean obviously we did have some timing issues that impacted both second quarter and third quarter and now fourth quarter we still consider that the business is very healthy and we shouldn t think about the negative number in the fourth quarter to represent anything other than a timing issue we think that our partners are really doing very well and we are we have a very strong relationship obviously we continued to see growth and that is a very unique considering what s happening in the markets out there so i think it speaks about the brand and the strength of the product janine stichter jefferies company analyst great thank you so much carlos e alberini chief executive officer and director thank you janine sandeep reddy chief financial and accounting officer thank you operator our next question comes from john kernan from cowen and company your line is now open john kernan cowen and company analyst hey good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions hey sandeep well we have you carlos e alberini chief executive officer and director hi john john kernan cowen and company analyst we have you on the call one last time just wanted to grow you a little bit on the fourth quarter guidance it seems like there is a fair amount of operating margin expansion embedded in the outlook are guiding to negative comps in north america and slower comps in europe i think they re guided up low singles on a constant currency so just wanted to drill down on the sg a leverage assumption that seems to be implied in the eps guidance can you talk about the dynamic between gross margin and sg a in the fourth quarter obviously europe being a very strong region right now there s a lot of margin expansion just trying to balance that against other areas sandeep reddy chief financial and accounting officer sure john i think when you look at what happened last year and our cadence in terms of gross margin performance we actually had gross margin expansion in all of the first three quarters and the only quarter last year where gross margins declined was the fourth quarter and the reason we declined in the fourth quarter last year is because we went into the fourth quarter in too heavy inventory position and had to take markdowns during the quarter and we had to take inventory reserves during the fourth quarter as well by the end of the fourth quarter this year in contrast we re entering the fourth quarter in a very good position relative to where we were last year and we expect to be even clearer by the end of the year and so the assumption that s embedded from a gross margin perspective is definitely to be significantly better and if you look at the guidance we think that sg a basically is roughly flat with last year so almost all of the growth of the operating margin improvement that we re talking about for the company is coming from gross margin and it s been very consistent in the first nine months of the year and it s driven by all the initiatives that we talked about the imu improvement the fact that especially in europe we ve been a lot less promotional on a pretty significant business all of those things are able to offset some of the weakness that we ve talked about in asia and americas and the logistics costs are very material because of the size of the european business and that s also contributing in a big way in the gross margin line so if you put all that together that s why we re pretty comfortable with the operating margin guidance that we provided but it really ties back to the gross margin cadence john kernan cowen and company analyst got it that makes sense thanks and then just maybe a follow up on europe you obviously have a lot of detail on at the investor day on this but can you and when you think about the white space in europe can you talk to us on how you feel about the dynamic between wholesale and retail both have worked well in turn together this year but i m just how are you viewing those channels as we head into the fourth quarter and beyond and any update on the backlog going into next year would be helpful too thank you carlos e alberini chief executive officer and director yeah thank you john well let me start with that during the last few years the company invested considerably to expand the store base and in europe i m talking about but also in other regions but i feel that we have a great platform right now and i think that we have an opportunity here to continue to build productivity in those stores many of those stores are very new obviously and we feel that there is an opportunity to continue to build the retail business through them and the same store sales growth with respect to the wholesale business i think that we have done the company has done a great job in looking at the different distribution that we had by country a lot of the countries are doing extremely well with expanding distribution and is not necessarily more accounts though we do have more accounts but also more productivity with a different accounts that we have been doing business with so and i think all this and expanding in different product categories has really fueled the kind of growth that we have experienced during so many years so i think that the balance is pretty significant and i think that is synergistic for the brand and the third big piece that we will talk more also during next week is about e comm we believe e comm has been growing at a very fast clip and we see that as we equipped the business with sales force and additional capabilities we can do even better and significantly faster so we are very excited about that initiative we will share more about how we are approaching it next week but if you put it altogether and you think about some of the white space that we had in europe when i was here nine 10 years ago our presence in europe was very limited and it was limited to the southern countries and now when you see how much the company has done to really expand north and to the east and it has done it so successfully i think it speaks very very strong about the more opportunities that we have to continue to grow in the region sandeep reddy chief financial and accounting officer and john you asked about the backlog i think we as we mentioned on the prepared remarks the spring summer 2020 backlog is up in the double digits and that s the sixth consecutive season which is about three years worth of double digit growth that we re seeing in the wholesale business and this is a reminder that spring summer 2020 product ships in the fourth quarter of this year and first quarter of next year we re in the process of collecting orders for the fall winter 2020 season which is coming next year and typically we update during the march call on that cadence and so we will have more on that at point john kernan cowen and company analyst excellent thank you looking forward to next week carlos e alberini chief executive officer and director thank you john we ll see you then operator our next question comes from dana telsey from telsey advisory group your line is now open dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst good afternoon everyone hi carlos as you speak about the wholesale carlos e alberini chief executive officer and director hi how are you dana dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst hi good how are you as you think about the wholesale business carlos e alberini chief executive officer and director i m good dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst excellent as you think about the wholesale business both in america and in europe what are you seeing there in terms of order patterns what are you seeing there in terms of pricing and promotion and how are you working with the wholesale distribution channel thank you carlos e alberini chief executive officer and director well so we our business in america and the business in europe at wholesale are very different in america we have a business that is concentrated on a few accounts and you have some within that other company like macy s which definitely represents a big big partner for us and then we have some distribution with other retail chains such as urban and pacific sunwear sorry that represents a very significant opportunity for us to deal with product that is somewhat different and caters to a consumer that is younger we have talked about the generation z opportunity here i think that when you look at europe europe is much more fragmented business we have in excess of 8 000 accounts throughout the region and i think that obviously there is a very just the diversified base of businesses depending on where these accounts are located and what kind of countries they are just participating in the flow order flow has been very in line with what we have seen in the past i think that s just the sandeep just talked about europe and how the different seasons are extended into each season is a six month season and what we see in the floor there is a sales campaign that is relatively rigorous in terms of times and the weeks that this takes and what we see is that those order patterns have been pretty much consistent with the past and exciting to see the growth that we have seen and the business in the americas i think that has also been traditional in terms of how the orders have been placed i think that we are very pleased with the distribution model that we have we are very pleased with our partners and we see opportunities to continue to grow together dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst thank you and the promotional environment as we go into the fourth quarter how do you think it will be different than last year carlos e alberini chief executive officer and director it s very hard to say you will probably know more about what is the inventory situation for most what the only thing that we know is what we see and what we hear obviously we have a big change here in calendar and obviously that is impacting how the business is behaving we saw some level of promotional activity even before thanksgiving which is was more unusual in the past but considering that the calendar is significantly more compressed just that kind of makes sense so we are happy with where we are in terms of inventory position and i think we are like we said we are targeting to end the year with inventories down about in double digits which is will be a significant accomplishment for us dana telsey telsey advisory group analyst thank you have a great holiday sandeep reddy chief financial and accounting officer thank you dana happy holidays operator and presenters at this time i show no further questions in queue and i would now like to turn the call over to carlos for closing remarks carlos e alberini chief executive officer and director well in closing i want to thank you all for your

look forward to reporting on our progress and we certainly hope to see you next week at our investor day event we re really looking forward to that sandeep good luck to you and your future and thanks

to complement those ifrs measures by providing further understanding of the company s results of operations from management s perspective accordingly they should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of the company s financial information reported under ifrs the company uses non ifrs measures including normalized ebitda normalized net income normalized income tax expense normalized effective tax rate normalized basic earnings per share and normalized diluted earnings per share normalized ebitda is provided to assist investors in determining the financial performance of the company s operating activities on a consistent basis by excluding certain non cash elements such as depreciation expense impairment charge and foreign exchange gain or loss on the company s long term debt denominated in u s dollars other elements such as restructuring costs and acquisition related costs may also be excluded from net income in the determination of normalized ebitda as they are considered not being reflective of the operational performance of the company normalized net income normalized income tax expense normalized effective tax rate normalized basic earnings per share and normalized diluted earnings per share in addition to the financial performance of operating activities take into account the impact of investing activities financing activities and income taxes on the company s financial results the company believes non ifrs measures are important supplemental measures of financial performance because they eliminate items that have less bearing on the company s financial performance and thus highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on ifrs measures the company also believes that securities analysts investors and other interested parties frequently use non ifrs measures in the evaluation of companies many of which present similar metrics when reporting their results management also uses non ifrs measures in order to facilitate financial performance comparisons from period to period prepare annual operating budgets assess the company s ability to meet its future debt service capital expenditure and working capital requirements and also as a component in the determination of the short term incentive compensation for the company s employees because other companies may calculate these non ifrs measures differently than the company does these metrics are not comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies normalized ebitda is defined as net income before financing costs financing income income tax expense recovery depreciation expense and normalized elements normalized net income is defined as net income before normalized elements adjusted to reflect the tax effect on these elements normalized income tax expense is defined as income tax expense adjusted to reflect the tax effect on normalized elements and to normalize specific tax elements normalized effective tax rate is based on normalized net income before normalized income tax expense normalized earnings per share basic and normalized earnings per share diluted are calculated respectively by dividing the normalized net income by the weighted average number of shares basic and the weighted average number of shares diluted the company refers the reader to the selected

image courtesy of cointelegraph brics and its problems brics is the largest geopolitical block of countries spanning three continents and wielding substantial economic power in global affairs as of 2018 the five nations of the brics block had a combined nominal gross domestic product of 40 trillion or about 23 2 of the gross world product however such economic power does not come without competitive penchants from other nations that are vying for the markets that brics nations cater to the greatest competition comes from the european union and the u s the political experience of recent years has shown that brics countries diplomacy has arguably failed in alleviating international sanctions especially in politically sensitive markets such as the arms and the energy carriers markets however advances in technology are here to help out where politics cannot as blockchain and digital assets have the potential to open entirely new horizons for finance the idea of a single cryptocurrency as a means of payments and value transmission is not a new one but it is one that is being actively purported not only in countries like venezuela with its petro but also among brics countries the advantages of a single cryptocurrency as a universal means of settlements among brics nations would solve many of the problems they face on the global economic market a means of circumventing u s sanctions the brics business council discussed creating a common cryptocurrency as a potential solution to these problems during the 11th brics summit that was held in brazil on nov 13 14 according to reports that cite kirill dmitriev a member of the council dmitriev who is the director general of the russian direct investment fund went on to say that an efficient brics payment system could be used to stimulate settlements between the countries while reducing the use of the u s dollar for these purposes it was also reported that the new system may become an alternative to the international payment mechanism swift to facilitate trade with countries under u s sanctions dmitriev also noted that in recent years the share of u s dollars payments made between the brics countries has significantly decreased in russia for example over the past five years the share of usd in foreign trade transactions fell from 92 to 50 while those made in the russian ruble rose from 3 to 14 at the same time the potential for reducing the u s dollar s dominance is still great according to macroeconomic analyst oleg dushin who told russian media outlet bfm that such could be the case if russia and india changed the currency they use to make payments between each other dushin also said that russia and china have already stopped using u s dollars in half of their mutual settlements and that there is currently a general trend of driving the dollar out of the international payments system this according to the expert will help brics countries weaken the influence of the dollar in the global monetary system and reduce the risk of payments being frozen by washington denis smirnov a blockchain consultant from russia noted to bfm the convenience and reduction of transaction costs as some of the advantages of creating a single cryptocurrency system for the brics countries calling it an alternative to bonds commenting on the possibility of brics countries using a single cryptocurrency vladimir rozhankovsky an expert at the international financial center told bfm if it is possible to reduce currency risks then it is better to carry out trading payments directly and not through the purchase of dollars this is obvious the vast majority of more or less large global economies are now working on this issue peg to gold not the u s dollar while it is still unknown what the brics cryptocurrency will look like exactly experts are discussing what it could potentially be tied to commenting on the possible options that the international cryptocurrency may be tied elina sidorenko the head of the russian state duma s working group on cryptocurrency issues said that there are several options on the table for example it could be tied to the value of another cryptocurrency she told russian media outlet dp but in this case it s impossible to avoid either the continuation of the u s dollar s monopoly or it can be pegged to the price of a raw material or a good but then the risk of market manipulation becomes a threat she concluded the third option is a link to gold and taking into account the latest basel accords such a decision seems very convincing and timely olinga taeed a council member and expert advisor at the china e commerce blockchain committee told cointelegraph that the chinese have been researching the possibility of issuing a gold backed token due to the country s access to natural mineral reserves in africa through china s belt and road initiative he went on to add more recently frictionless international trade has come to the fore with dlt looked upon as a possible solution for brexit for example replacing the usual 5 10 year gestation period so the thinking is well rehearsed but what is new here is the willingness to enact it and for evidence of this there is absolute clarity trump has made transparent the long established use of the financial instrument of the dollar to pressurise iran russia china etc for non financial gain russia seeks an alternative to swift russia has been the target of sanctions since 2014 as a result of multiple economic restrictions russian authorities have been considering the possibility of creating alternatives to swift one of them the system for transfer of financial messages or sfps is reportedly being used in 18 of money transfers in the country and foreign financial organizations began to join spfs in 2018 however in april russian finance minister anton siluanov noted that spfs is not a full fledged replacement for swift and that it is unlikely to become one in the near future now the russian government is considering another alternative a national cryptocurrency secured by gold elvira nabiullina head of the central bank of russia said that such a currency could be used to carry out settlements with other countries for trade transactions however nabiullina is also of the opinion that it is more important to develop international settlements facilitated by national currencies rather than crypto the sanctions had blocked at least 20 of russia s defense transactions in 2018 due their tether to the u s dollar though russian authorities are gradually moving toward settlements in national currencies with brics states the idea of a unified cryptocurrency is being openly discussed as an effective transparent untraceable and stable instrument for circumventing u s sanctions and decreasing dependence on the u s dollar brics states would be able to disregard any exchange rate differences in settlements in a single cryptocurrency and russia would gain solid support for its national currency the ruble which suffered a twofold drop in value china considering a national crypto to bypass u s sanctions china is the leading nation of the brics bloc in terms of gdp and the most open nation when it comes to discussions about blockchain implementation china is intent on accelerating the development of its own central bank backed digital currency and is working toward the integration of blockchain technologies into other important financial mainstays of the country such as alibaba tencent and various banking institutions related china s dive into blockchain digital id spurs rest of world to action such hasty development could in part be the result of a heated debates about facebook s libra coin chinese analysts fear that the development of a global digital currency by a company which is regarded to have strong affiliations with the u s would threaten the existence of national currencies and weaken their exchange rates such a stablecoin backed by the u s dollar may increase the power of its penetration into the global economy and thus solidify the political positions of washington chinese authorities are interested not only in the development of a unified cryptocurrency for settlements with brics countries but also in the launch of a national cryptocurrency that would serve as a shield against the economic adversary across the pacific brazil has a positive stance on using stablecoins brazil is demonstrating the highest rate of bitcoin btc trade in latin america such broad penetration of digital assets in brazil makes it both fertile ground for the development of a national cryptocurrency and firm ground to support for a unified brics cryptocurrency for settlements with member states given the country s positive stance toward blockchain brazilian authorities seem to be open to discussions with stablecoin issuers one recent example is that of the mile unity foundation whose representatives met with members of brazil s ministry of industry foreign trade and services to discuss the use of the xdr stablecoin for international transfers of funds given that brazil had an export import balance of 219 billion to 140 billion in 2017 alone the potential for using a single cryptocurrency with brics member states for increasing such figures is immense although brazil does not suffer from sanctions its main trade partners in technology such as russia are subject to them using the u s dollar for mutual settlements between countries leaves little room to maneuver india is fighting with poverty and corruption the indian authorities are reportedly discussing the introduction of a national digital currency there may be significant reasons for such a move not the least of which being the alleviation of the poverty that many of the country s 1 3 billion are languishing in the reserve bank of india is pushing for such a digital currency backed and regulated by the central bank as legal tender the rbi hopes that blockchain can alleviate the issue with corruption which is rampant in india and significantly reduce the dependence of millions of indians working abroad on financial intermediaries in cross border transfers the indian authorities are also proponents of a national digital currency for reducing the population s reliance on other digital currencies given india s stance within brics as a major buyer of russian arms and as one of the most important energy trade partners having mutual settlements in a unified digital currency would open up entirely new prospects for trading south africa is making money transfers accessible for citizens the possibility of issuing a national digital currency has even been discussed by the south african reserve bank which could allow for its citizens to freely transact without the need for banks given the staggering number of unbanked individuals estimated to be around 11 million people and those without any form of official ids in the country the availability of a national digital currency would help millions of citizens gain access to financial services and boost economic development south africa is just as bound to the u s dollar as all the other brics members in its settlements with china and russia meaning that is also feels the impact of the sanctions regime experts say according to experts the idea of creating a digital currency for brics may turn out to be highly viable given the transition of the world from a monopolar political model to a multipolar one and the backdrop of a shift in the economy from traditional financial institutions to trading platforms and the main beneficiary so far could be china which is interested in expanding its sales markets amid a trade war with the u s smirnov told bfm that he believes that over time such systems will become more widespread for example for the past two or more years a consortium of several european banks has been testing its own mutual settlement solution that works outside the swift system and allows for interbank settlements the individual national currencies of the brics countries have been dropping against the u s dollar over the past 10 20 years but it is unclear whether a unified brics payment system would reverse this trend however it is possible that the u s dollar could be weakened if the share of settlements in dollars significantly decreases around the world among other possible risks that may be associated with the idea of issuing a gold pegged international digital currency head of research at investment company nord capital vladimir rojankovsky noted the deregulation of the market and the possibility of manipulation he told russian media outlet regnum such an implementation of this project does not imply the involvement of any distinguished party which is a living oversight body speaking about the further development of the brics initiative teemo puutio an expert in compliance and an adjunct instructor at new york university school of professional services told cointelegraph

in recent weeks president donald trump has been talking about plans for as he put it a very substantial tax cut for middle income folks who work so hard but before congress embarks on a new tax measure people should consider one of the largely unexamined effects of the last tax bill which trump promised would help the middle class would you believe it has inflicted a trillion dollars of damage on homeowners many of them middle class throughout the country that massive number is the reduction in home values caused by the 2017 tax law that capped federal deductions for state and local real estate and income taxes at 10 000 a year and also eliminated some mortgage interest deductions the impact varies widely across different areas counties with high home prices and high real estate taxes and where homeowners have big mortgages are suffering the biggest hit as you d expect given the larger value of the lost tax deductions but as we ll see homeowners all over the country are feeling the effects i m basing my analysis on numbers from two well respected people mark zandi the chief economist of moody s analytics and hugh lamle the retired president of m d sass a wall street investment management company zandi s numbers are broad macro math as it were lamle pronounced lam lee is a master of micro math it was lamle who first got me thinking about home value losses by sending me an economic model that he created to show the damage inflicted on high end high bracket taxpayers in high tax areas who paid seven digits or more for their homes lamle starts with the premise that homebuyers have typically figured out how much house they can afford by calculating how much they can spend on a down payment and monthly mortgage payment adjusting the latter by the amount they d save via the tax deduction for mortgage interest and real estate taxes his model figures out how much prices would have to drop for the same monthly payment to cover a given house now that this notional buyer can t take advantage of the real estate tax deduction and might not be able to take full advantage of the mortgage interest deduction after i showed lamle s model to my propublica research partner doris burke she steered me to zandi s research which i realized could be used to calculate national value loss numbers ready here we go the broad picture first then the specific this gets a little complicated so please bear with me zandi says that because of the 2017 tax law u s house prices overall are about 4 lower than they d otherwise be the next question is how many dollars of lost home value that 4 translates into that isn t so hard to figure out if you get your hands on the right numbers let me show you the federal reserve board says that as of march 31 u s home values totaled about 26 1 trillion apply zandi s 4 number to that and you end up with a 1 04 trillion setback for the nation s home owners that s right a trillion with a t please note that zandi isn t saying that house prices have fallen by an average of 4 that hasn t happened what he s saying is that on average house prices are about 4 lower than they d otherwise be given that the fed statistics show that homeowners equity was 15 76 trillion as of march 31 zandi s numbers imply that homeowners equity is down about 6 6 from where it would otherwise be that s the 1 04 trillion value loss divided by the 15 76 trillion of equity this is a very big deal to families whose biggest financial asset is the equity they have in their homes and there are untold millions of families in that situation while zandi and i were having the first of several phone conversations he sent me a county by county list of the estimated home price damage done to about 3 000 counties throughout the country i was fascinated and appalled to see that the biggest estimated value loss in percentage terms 11 3 was in essex county new jersey the new york city suburb where i live in case you re interested or just snoopy the four other counties that make up the five biggest losers list are westchester county new york suburban new york city 11 1 union county new jersey which is adjacent to essex county 11 0 new york county the new york city borough of manhattan 10 4 and lake county illinois suburban chicago 9 9 flagler county 2 30 you can find zandi s county by county list in our data store eyeball the list and you ll see that counties throughout the country have home values lower than they would otherwise be here s how it works zandi took what financial techies call the present value of the property tax and mortgage interest deductions that homeowners will lose over seven years the average duration of a mortgage because of changes in the tax law and subtracted it from the value of the typical house that results in a 3 decline in national home values below what they would otherwise be the remaining one percentage point of value shrinkage zandi says comes from the higher interest rates that he says will result from the higher federal budget deficits caused by the tax bill he estimates that rates on 10 year treasury notes a key benchmark for mortgage rates will be 0 2 higher than they would otherwise be which in turn will make mortgage rates 0 2 higher even though interest rates on 10 year treasury notes are at or near record lows as i write this they would be even lower if the treasury were borrowing less than it s currently borrowing to cover the higher federal budget deficits caused by trump s tax bill if zandi s interest rate take is correct it s true by definition if you believe in the law of supply and demand even homeowners who aren t affected by the inability to deduct all their real estate taxes and mortgage interest costs are affected by the tax bill how so because higher interest rates for buyers translate into lower prices for sellers and therefore produce lower values for owners you can argue as some people do that real estate taxes should never have been deductible because allowing that deduction is bad economic policy that inflated home prices and favored higher income people over lower income people but even if you believe that there s no question that eliminating the deduction for millions of homeowners inflicted serious financial damage on homeowners who had no warning that a major tax deduction that they were used to getting would be wiped out as a result homebuyers who had taken the value of the real estate tax deduction into account when buying their homes had their home values and finances whacked without warning interest deductions on mortgage borrowings exceeding 750 000 were cut back compared with interest deductions on up to 1 million under the old law but that doesn t affect anywhere near as many people as the cap on real estate tax deductions does a brief aside among the modest winners here are first time buyers who purchased their homes after the tax law took effect and benefited by paying less than they would have paid under the old tax rules now to the micro math lamle s model isn t applicable to most people because it works only for taxpayers with a household income of at least 200 000 a year who paid at least 1 million for their homes but the principle underlying lamle s model applies to everyone who owns a home or is interested in owning one to wit you calculate the tax law caused loss of value by figuring out how much a house s price needs to fall for buyers or owners after tax costs to be the same now as they were before the tax law changed people buying large ticket items typically focus on after tax costs of ownership lamle told me the amount that many buyers can afford is affected by limits on their financial resources therefore as their tax costs increase substantially because of the loss of tax deductions they have less money available to pay for homes and to take on mortgage debt at the suggestion of one of my editors i asked lamle to use a modified version of his economic model to estimate the tax law s impact on the value of a theoretical house in the new york city suburb of west orange new jersey purchased for 800 000 in 2017 by a theoretical family with a 250 000 annual income those home value and income numbers are very high by national standards but middle class by the standards of large parts of suburban essex county real estate tax on that theoretical house would run about 28 900 a year according to statistics from the new jersey state treasurer s office that tax used to be fully deductible for federal tax purposes now it s not deductible at all if you assume that the house s owners are taking the standard deduction on their federal returns or that even if they re itemizing deductions they re paying at least 10 000 of state income taxes which means they don t get any benefit from deducting property taxes according to lamle s calculations this inability to deduct real estate tax has reduced the home s value by 138 720 assuming a 5 mortgage rate at a 4 rate the value loss is 173 400 for the math and assumptions underlying these numbers see his methodology below so if the family put up 200 000 25 of the purchase price to buy the house more than half of that investment has been wiped out obviously it s impossible to prove that zandi and lamle are right about the impact they say the tax law is having and will continue to have on home prices because there s no way to gauge the accuracy of their numbers but the logic is compelling the loss in home values is crucial because it turns out that lots more people have bigger financial stakes in their houses than in their stock portfolios which have thrived as the trump tax law turbocharged corporate earnings and stock prices in fact 73 5 of households that own homes stocks or both had bigger stakes in the home market than in the stock market according to david rosnick an economist at the center for economic and policy research who parsed federal reserve data at my request now let s put things in perspective set aside home value losses for a minute and talk about the cash that people are getting from trump s 2017 tax law it isn t all that much for most families households average federal income tax has fallen by 1 260 a year according to the tax policy center that average is skewed by big savings realized by people with big incomes the median family s tax cut is only about half as much as the average cut by the tax policy center s math this means that for taxpayers of higher income and more modest income the income tax savings are likely small beer compared with the hidden loss inflicted on many of them by lower house values back to the main event and some final but important numbers according to the tax policy center the treasury will get 620 billion of additional revenue over a 10 year period because people can t deduct their full state and local taxes that in turn covers most of the 10 year 680 billion cost of the income tax break that corporations are getting so you can make a case that my friends and neighbors and co workers in new york and new jersey and many of you all over the country are paying more federal income tax in order to help corporations pay less federal income tax that my friends is the bottom line alen sloan propublica this story was co published with fortune

u s economic growth picked up slightly in the third quarter rather than slowing as initially reported washington u s economic growth picked up slightly in the third quarter rather than slowing as initially reported and there are signs the downturn in business investment may be drawing to a close the modest firming in growth reported on wednesday by the government came alongside data showing the number of americans filing claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week after standing at a five month high for two straight weeks labor market strength should continue to support consumer spending which appears to be slowing collectively those reports and others are painting a more upbeat picture of an american economy now in a record 11th year of expansion that has had to overcome speed bumps from president donald trump s trade war with china and the ebbing tailwinds from last year s tax cuts economists boosted their estimates for growth in the current quarter as well the upswing in the data would appear to validate the optimistic tone struck earlier this week by federal reserve chair jerome powell who said at this point in the long expansion i see the glass as much more than half full the central bank last month cut interest rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in july when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008 the fed on wednesday described the economy as growing modestly from october through mid november fourth quarter growth is looking better said michael feroli an economist at jpmorgan in new york gross domestic product increased at a 2 1 percent annualized rate the commerce department said in its second estimate of third quarter gdp that was up from the 1 9 percent pace it estimated last month the economy grew at a 2 0 percent pace in the april june period economists polled by reuters had forecast third quarter gdp growth would be unrevised at 1 9 percent the upward revision to gdp reflected more inventory accumulation than initially thought inventories rose at a 79 8 billion pace instead of the 69 0 billion rate reported last month the inventory build which economists attributed to the waxing and waning trade tensions between the united states and china contributed to growth instead of being a drag even discounting the inventory lift the economy was healthy last quarter when measured from the income side the economy grew at a 2 4 percent rate in the last quarter gross domestic income gdi increased at a rate of 0 9 percent in the second quarter the income side of the growth ledger accelerated despite a drop in profits second quarter gdi growth was revised down by 0 9 percentage point with growth in wages and sales during that period slashed by 46 7 billion to 62 1 billion after tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment which corresponds to s p 500 profits decreased 11 3 billion or at a rate of 0 6 percent as they were held down by legal settlements with facebook and google profits increased at a 3 3 percent rate in the second quarter the average of gdp and gdi also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity increased at a 2 3 percent rate in the july september period quickening from a 1 4 percent growth pace in the second quarter the atlanta fed raised its fourth quarter gdp growth estimate to a 1 7 percent rate from only a 0 4 percent pace despite the upbeat growth data inflation remains muted which could trouble some fed officials the central bank s preferred inflation measure the core personal consumption expenditures pce price index excluding food and energy increased 1 6 percent in the 12 months through october the so called core pce price index rose 1 7 percent in september and has undershot its 2 percent target this year the dollar firmed against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices fell stocks on wall street stocks rose with the main indexes hitting record highs green shoots though growth has been relatively strong economists did not expect the economy to achieve the trump administration s 3 0 percent target this year the economy grew 2 6 percent in the first half there isn t a lot of oomph here to power the economy forward at anywhere near the trump economics team s prediction of 3 percent said chris rupkey chief economist mufg in new york there are some green shoots however that bode well for the economy in the months ahead in a second report on wednesday from the commerce department said orders for non defense capital goods excluding aircraft a closely watched proxy for business spending plans surged 1 2 percent last month the largest gain since january after falling 0 5 percent in september these so called core capital goods orders were boosted by increased demand for machinery computers and electronic products and fabricated metals shipments of core capital goods increased 0 8 percent last month core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the gdp measurement business investment dropped at a 2 7 percent rate in the third quarter rather than contracting at a 3 0 percent pace as previously reported this was because the decline in spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration shafts and wells was not as steep as previously estimated a third report from the labor department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 15 000 to a seasonally adjusted 213 000 for the week ended nov 23 raising concerns of some easing in the labor market with the labor market on solid footing consumer spending remains supported in a fourth report the commerce department said consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity increased 0 3 percent last month as households spent more on electricity and gas offsetting a drop in new motor vehicle purchases spending gained 0 2 percent in september when adjusted for inflation consumer spending nudged up 0 1 percent in october after gaining 0 2 percent in september that suggests some moderation in consumer spending after it grew at a 2 9 percent rate in the third quarter we are in store for a moderation in the pace of consumer spending not a collapse said tim quinlan an economist at wells fargo securities in charlotte north carolina by lucia

by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s economic growth picked up slightly in the third quarter rather than slowing as initially reported and there are signs the downturn in business investment may be drawing to a close the modest firming in growth reported on wednesday by the government came alongside data showing the number of americans filing claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week after standing at a five month high for two straight weeks labor market strength should continue to support consumer spending which appears to be slowing collectively those reports and others are painting a more upbeat picture of an american economy now in a record 11th year of expansion that has had to overcome speed bumps from president donald trump s trade war with china and the ebbing tailwinds from last year s republican tax cuts economists boosted their estimates for growth in the current quarter as well the upswing in the data would appear to validate the optimistic tone struck earlier this week by federal reserve chair jerome powell who said at this point in the long expansion i see the glass as much more than half full the u s central bank last month cut interest rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in july when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008 the fed on wednesday described the economy as growing modestly from october through mid november fourth quarter growth is looking better said michael feroli an economist at jpmorgan in new york gross domestic product increased at a 2 1 annualized rate the commerce department said in its second estimate of third quarter gdp that was up from the 1 9 pace it estimated last month the economy grew at a 2 0 pace in the april june period economists polled by reuters had forecast third quarter gdp growth would be unrevised at 1 9 the upward revision to gdp reflected more inventory accumulation than initially thought inventories rose at a 79 8 billion pace instead of the 69 0 billion rate reported last month the inventory build which economists attributed to the waxing and waning trade tensions between the united states and china contributed to growth instead of being a drag even discounting the inventory lift the economy was healthy last quarter when measured from the income side the economy grew at a 2 4 rate in the last quarter gross domestic income gdi increased at a rate of 0 9 in the second quarter the income side of the growth ledger accelerated despite a drop in profits second quarter gdi growth was revised down by 0 9 percentage point with growth in wages and sales during that period slashed by 46 7 billion to 62 1 billion after tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment which corresponds to s p 500 profits decreased 11 3 billion or at a rate of 0 6 as they were held down by legal settlements with facebook and google profits increased at a 3 3 rate in the second quarter the average of gdp and gdi also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity increased at a 2 3 rate in the july september period quickening from a 1 4 growth pace in the second quarter the atlanta fed raised its fourth quarter gdp growth estimate to a 1 7 rate from only a 0 4 pace despite the upbeat growth data inflation remains muted which could trouble some fed officials the central bank s preferred inflation measure the core personal consumption expenditures pce price index excluding food and energy increased 1 6 in the 12 months through october the so called core pce price index rose 1 7 in september and has undershot its 2 target this year the dollar firmed against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices fell stocks on wall street stocks rose with the main indexes hitting record highs green shoots though growth has been relatively strong economists did not expect the economy to achieve the trump administration s 3 0 target this year the economy grew 2 6 in the first half there isn t a lot of oomph here to power the economy forward at anywhere near the trump economics team s prediction of 3 percent said chris rupkey chief economist mufg in new york there are some green shoots however that bode well for the economy in the months ahead the white house s 16 month trade war with china and the fading stimulus from last year s 1 5 trillion tax cut package are restraining the economy but there was good news for business investment which has borne the brunt of the trade war in a second report on wednesday from the commerce department said orders for non defense capital goods excluding aircraft a closely watched proxy for business spending plans surged 1 2 last month the largest gain since january after falling 0 5 in september these so called core capital goods orders were boosted by increased demand for machinery computers and electronic products and fabricated metals shipments of core capital goods increased 0 8 last month core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the gdp measurement business investment dropped at a 2 7 rate in the third quarter rather than contracting at a 3 0 pace as previously reported this was because the decline in spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration shafts and wells was not as steep as previously estimated a third report from the labor department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 15 000 to a seasonally adjusted 213 000 for the week ended nov 23 raising concerns of some easing in the labor

you could be excused in the u s for overlooking the fact that the u k is going through a snap election campaign any such coverage of the u k s upcoming election is being drowned out by the u s media s hourly reporting of the varying prospects for the numerous democratic contenders and the daily tussles between lawmakers and the current incumbent in the white house all this before the 2020 presidential election year has even started british general elections rarely raise much interest outside the country although britain s first past the post election system means the country has only experienced one peacetime coalition 2010 2015 since the lloyd george ministry ended in 1922 keep up to date on everything going on in the world of trade and tariffs via metalminer s trade resource center yet even with the potential such a system holds for more extremist parties to take power the brits have rarely voted in parties radical enough to cause ripples outside their own borders dec 12 however may be a different matter boris johnson the newly elected at least by his party if not the country prime minster is taking the country to the polls to secure a mandate for his version of brexit called the withdrawal agreement or that is what he thought what has transpired in the weeks since the decision is that most of the country is heartily sick of brexit and good old fashioned domestic issues are coming to the fore as the deciding factors in the ever unreliable weekly polls who can throw the most money at the national health services the police education etc is getting 10 times more air time than the terms of boris johnson s withdrawal agreement which is strange because the u k s ability to pay for all these promises will depend a great deal on its economic health over the next 5 10 years in turn that will be significantly impacted by what kind of exit deal the u k gets as with the original leave referendum some 3 1 2 years ago the public s position is being formed on the basis of more unknowns than knowns and hence on the question of brexit remains a largely emotional decision according to analysts there are a number of possible outcomes to the upcoming election the conservative party currently the front runner could win a majority in this case assuming boris johnson gets his agreement through parliament with his new majority the u k will leave jan 31 2020 and spend the next 12 months negotiating the terms of a trade agreement notice it won t be a free trade agreement many believe this is unrealistically short and by pinning his colors to the mast for a firm deal by the end of 2020 johnson is potentially lining the u k up for another re run at a hard brexit that is one with no agreement and revision to wto rules still the markets prefer this option and the pound would be expected to perk up to 1 33 against the dollar and 1 19 against the euro if the conservatives were to win an outright majority the next possibility is a labour majority or a hung parliament with a significant enough stake for the socialists that they could call the shots depending on what of the many giveaways and proposed tax rises a labour government actually imposed should it get in power the cost to the u k economy could be in the region of 83 billion 108 billion annually within a few years as a result the currency markets are predicting 1 375 for the dollar and 1 22 for the euro on the basis interest rates would have to rise to secure that level of government borrowing some economists favor a labour win purely on the basis it promises to involve a high level of investment but it s the damage the tax rises and nationalization program would have that worries most remain voters and some leave those not in favor of a hard brexit could be attracted to labour s position regarding europe however the party is campaigning to renegotiate yes yet again a new agreement essentially keeping the u k in a form of free trade open borders and close cooperation with the e u it would be a high economic price to pay to remain in or close to the e u though the third party the liberal democrats are expected to pick up more seats particularly from those who would like to remain or want to have a second referendum on the topic the lib dems however are thought unlikely to be able to form a government if they had sufficient seats to be a significant member of a coalition they could derail the conservatives negotiated withdrawal agreement throwing the whole process back by months in many ways this is the market s least attractive outcome as they want certainty however disruptive to trade it could be the pound is expected to fall back to 1 22 against the dollar and 1 11 against the euro if that happens finally the nightmare scenario is a hung parliament with no chance of passing the withdrawal agreement a not impossible outcome in that case the pound could collapse to 1 12 against the dollar and 1 04 against the euro some economists suggest as the country would be plunged back into uncertainty and by default probably a hard brexit at the end of january looking for metal price forecasting and data analysis in one easy to use platform inquire about metalminer insights today the takeaway cover currency exposure the range of possibilities is painfully wide and the recent run up in the pound from 1 21 a month ago to 1 29 now on the possibility of a boris win has already caught many by surprise

this is a rush transcript copy may not be in its final form juan gonzález today we spend the hour looking back at the battle of seattle protester when labor and students and environmentalists and human rights activists stand together we can and did shut down the wto juan gonzález twenty years ago this week tens of thousands of activists gathered in seattle washington to shut down a ministerial meeting of the world trade organization grassroots organizers successfully blocked world leaders government trade ministers and corporate executives from meeting to sign a global trade deal that many called deeply undemocratic and harmful to workers rights the environment and indigenous people globally on november 30th 1999 those activists formed a human chain around the seattle convention center and shut down the city s downtown amy goodman police responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets into the mostly peaceful crowd and the protests went on for five days resulted in over 600 arrests and the eventual collapse of the talks as well as the resignation of seattle s police chief the protests were documented in the film this is what democracy looks like protester you ve got people here from all over you ve got labor you ve got environmentalists you ve got teachers you ve got children you ve got coalitions between people of color and you know mainstream white americans you ve got middle class you ve got working poor you ve got poor you ve got everybody out here because this hurts people this is bad for people it s bad for our jobs here it s bad for the people over there amy goodman in the documentary this is what democracy looks like organizers hop hopkins and rice baker yeboah talked about the brutality protesters face in the streets of seattle rice baker yeboah there was so much fear coming out of tuesday i mean we had been shot at we had been gassed people had been beaten and shot you know people didn t expect that going into tuesday and people had to recommit themselves and reaffirm their position hop hopkins that night we ended up meeting up on the corner of broadway and john and decided about what we were going to do the next day the next day we d meet up at 6 30 at denny park and then we d try to take back the city we started to weave our way through the roadblocks that they had set up and i looked around i could see people were afraid and at that point i said you know that s really not fear in your gut or in your throat that s really your first taste of freedom people were coming out of nowhere i mean it was like a scene from that michael jackson video thriller people were like coming out of manholes people were coming out of cars so we went from like 50 people to like a hundred people to like 150 people to like 300 people and then just the numbers just kept growing i don t know where all these people came from and i think the cops were totally surprised by that juan gonzález democracy now was in the streets of seattle 20 years ago doing two hours of daily broadcasting during one broadcast we spoke to two of the leading critics of the wto the indian physicist and activist vandana shiva and lori wallach of public citizen lori wallach the wto constrains every country government about literally the level of food safety it can provide its public or whether or not poor farmers can have access to seeds whether or not workers can be safe from asbestos vandana shiva actually the secrecy through which wto was born is apparent in the fact that most parliaments had no idea what was the content of this treaty til months after it had been ratified and signed in marrakech the wto wrote the rules it sits in judgment about implementation of those rules and it writes the inquisition amy goodman you are listening to pacifica radio s democracy now broadcasting live from seattle amy goodman that was vandana shiva and lori wallach on democracy now with juan gonzález and i on november 29th 1999 during our live broadcast from the basement of seattle s first united methodist church during the wto protests well they are joining us again today lori wallach is with us from washington d c and vandana shiva is joining us from rome italy welcome back both to democracy now lori let s begin with you you were in the streets of seattle 20 years ago can you explain why what was happening and then take us through to today lori wallach well the wto had announced pardon my voice the wto had announced it was having its ministerial in the u s and we knew it was critical for people around the world to see with protests against wto in africa latin america asia europe that in the u s also we didn t want this one size fits all corporate rule and so as soon as we heard it was seattle we started organizing we opened an office in seattle in march of 1999 and the goal was both to stop the planned wto expansion and also to signal to the whole world the u s was in this fight with everyone else we needed different rules for the global economy juan gonzález and vandana shiva few people in the world had even heard of the wto at that time even in the activist community tell us how you came to be in seattle in november of 1999 vandana shiva i was in seattle as part of the ifg the international forum on globalization which brought together all of us who were questioning gatt which was the precursor of the wto before the marrakech agreement was signed i was fighting gatt because it s the corporations who mentioned gatt first in a meeting in 1987 in geneva and in a resort outside geneva and they were talking about patenting seeds and life they were talking about an international treaty which would make it a requirement for all countries to patent seeds and would make it illegal for farmers to save seeds and that this free trade agreement is what they were going to work on and they talked about five corporations controlling food and health by the year 2000 that conversation of 87 started me on the path of saving seed working with my government to not allow patenting of seed working with our ambassadors to not allow trips to be designed like monsanto had designed it where they said we were the patient diagnostician and physician all in one but because i come from india to colonize the country east india company was created the first free trade agreement was not nafta or wto the first free trade agreement was imposed on india by the east india company 716 so we were very familiar with the use of so called free trade for corporate rule and having become free after famines had killed 60 million people we didn t want to be recolonized again and i m so happy that for that period our former prime minister our former gatt ambassador joined us as the peoples campaign against wto and we passed laws in that window that defended the sovereignty of the seed the sovereignty of farmers but as the corporate rule continued the monopoly on seeds continued we ve lost 400 000 farmers to suicide because of debt permanently a billion people are hungry and when you introduce the protests going on in chile and colombia and other parts of the world i actually see the process of today in every part of the world as a continuation of the fight against neoliberalism a fight against austerity a fight against the permanence of structural adjustment which is what free trade is about it has given us the control of four giants poison cartel over our seed and our food it s given us the billionaires bill gates is a child of wto he got rules written so he wouldn t have to pay taxes in transborder transfer which is why software was outsourced to india jeff bezos shipping goods around paying no taxes anywhere these trillionaires are children of the wto rules and even then we said our world is not for sale we said we are writing other rules movements have written other rules another world is possible we are making it but the brutality and limitless greed of the handful of corporations and billionaires is now really reaching ecocidal and genocidal limits so 20 years after seattle we need to make a commitment that in the next 10 years we ve really got to change those rules and get rid of the rule of billionaires amy goodman i want to go to michael moore the oscar winning filmmaker didn t win an oscar at the time speaking to a reporter in the middle of a crowd during the wto demonstrations michael moore the beautiful thing of this is this really wasn t organized by any leader it wasn t organized by any group all right it was organized by monsanto it was organized by exxon and general motors and microsoft and all the other greedy bastards who have spent the last two decades trying to make as much money as they can at the expense of everybody here so don t go blaming any violence or anything on anybody here the violence is taking place in these companies that have enacted their violence against these people amy goodman so that s michael moore back in the end of november 1999 and juan you and i were in the streets we were covering this for democracy now i make that point and this weekend holding a big forum at the people s forum called media in resistance 20 years after seattle that university of pennsylvania your university rutgers and democracy now helped to sponsor you talked about how here you were working for this major new york newspaper right the new york daily news but it was democracy now that brought you out there juan gonzález right because the paper didn t want to pay didn t want to pay my expenses to go out there and they didn t even really know what the wto was about and i assured them that it was going to be a big event and that even bill clinton was going so it was worthwhile covering but amy goodman he ended up having to come in the middle of the night because of the mass protests and madeleine albright couldn t get out of her hotel room the secretary of state juan gonzález right amy goodman because of the tear gas that was coming under her door but if you could read your column since the daily news didn t stop calling you once you got there juan gonzález yeah well once the protests paralyzed the whole city then they wanted to hear as much as i could write and this was the beginning of the column i wrote on december 1st a baptism by tear gas for america s students and i wrote a new generation of rebels came of age in america yesterday thousands of young people paralyzed this city s downtown and delayed the opening ceremony of the world trade organization meeting in a stunning protest that harkened back to the great civil rights marches of the 1960s and in another column on december 3rd i wrote quote it did not matter to these die hard kids that the city had been turned into an armed camp and was firmly under the control of an army of cops state troopers and national guard they had been stunningly successful in giving a black eye to an obscure international organization and had alerted millions of americans to the enormous power the wto wields in the world and turned it into a household name as as i said most people didn t even know about the wto before these protests occurred amy goodman vandana shiva if you can explain you came from india to be part in seattle of the protests but you didn t know really the level of protest you had already been laying a foundation with the ifg the international forum on globalization giving speeches about this and for people to understand the wto the idea that a transnational organization could be used to overturn the laws of democratically elected legislatures say some city council didn t want to have gmos wanted to have them labeled they could be called wto illegal now you have been continuing to speak out about this since but what difference did that seminal moment make when were you surprised the wto got shut down vandana shiva i was not surprised because actually it wasn t just the protests outside it was the third world governments inside who were totally celebrating the ending of the bullying power of the rich countries who were working on behalf of the monsantos to push the trips agreement the trade related intellectual property rights agreement the cargills whose vice president was deputed to negotiate the agriculture treaty on behalf of the u s government that s what the agriculture treaty was a cargill agreement and the so called sanitary and phytosanitary agreement was a basically pepsi coke nestlé junk food agreement forcing bad food on everyone around the world and criminalizing local regional national governments which worked according to their constitutions to protect their sovereignties and their rights as i mentioned i woke up to the use of a gatt and wto to establish seed monopolies in 87 in india we immediately started to mobilize and the first very big rally was a 500 000 farmers rally to say agriculture should not be part of free trade those protests are still carrying on seattle we planned with ifg the teach in and we had been doing teach ins in the lead up to seattle we thought about 30 000 people would turn up thousands turned up and the young people on the streets would come up to me and talk to me about how they were there because of biopiracy they were there to stop privatization of water each of them was there to defend our public goods they were there to defend our commons and everyone was speaking the chorus our world is not for sale our world is now on the verge of destruction and extinction and climate catastrophe because those who make money out of destroying the world want to continue so the difference really is that those who pushed and bullied us into the wto of the corporations now want to dismantle the wto as a multilateral body and they want to have bilateral borrowing agreements the end result is the same i think it s important for the workers of the united states to recognize that the unions were on the street in europe right now the corporations are pitting farmers again against the environmentalists as if banning pesticides which are killing the butterflies and birds are not the reason the farmers are in debt is not the reason their crops are failing not the reason that the soil is dying it is time to stop the divide and rule that has been created again and again by the money machine and the moneymakers and this divide and rule is right now taking very militaristic turns very fascist turns so our movement of 20 years ago is now a movement to defend democracy to defend earth democracy i wrote my book earth democracy because all these journalists would say oh the anti globalizers know what they re against they don t know what they re for we said we know what we are for that s why we re here to defend the earth our work our lives our democracy so i wrote earth democracy and i think that is even more urgently the agenda for today what we need to learn from 20 years ago is that when people wake up to the situation and when people are determined in all their diversity the turtles and the teamsters can walk together to defend the rights of the earth and our rights that s the moment we are in today we have to unite for a fight for the planet and a fight for the last person including the last displaced person who is today s refugee juan gonzález lori wallach i wanted to ask you the impact that the protests had and how things have changed i wanted to turn to the cover of foreign policy magazine in the spring of 2000 which featured you lori wallach with the headline why is this woman smiling because she just beat up the wto in seattle that s why_ of course you didn t beat up the wto all by yourself there were the thousands of people out there and as vandana shiva has said the third world delegates within the assembly that were also opposed to the bullying of the west i m wondering if you could talk about the impact did you think that was going to happen in november of 1999 and how has the world capitalist system adjusted to those kinds of protests since then lori wallach so what you wrote in your column was my personal experience which is i was awakened by the tear gas i sound like i did today like i did in day five of the protests i saw the power of direct action protests of brave people putting themselves in the way of corporate power and a whole generation even the people who worked to organize who spent a year traveling around the u s educating people about the wto doing seminars and union hall discussions people were really after the first day empowered awakened unified in a way to see what certainly was the aspiration to shut down that meeting to see that people power had effectively overcome the world s most powerful corporations and their goal of expanding the wto s rules even more broadly than they already were and the amazing outcome of that i think was that we had almost an enzymatic effect on what was going on in the negotiating suites because as vandana said people in developing countries had been fighting the wto had been hit by its effects right away who knew what it meant and their governments and their negotiators in geneva at the wto had been pushing back and they were fighting for no wto expansion but instead to fix the existing rules and so seeing all these people in the streets really had an effect on the negotiators in the suites the developing country negotiators were largely locked out of the decision making rooms so they were in the seattle convention center looking at the protests on tv and that combination of inside and outside maybe provided that last oomph for the negotiators from the caribbean and africa and latin america who had been fighting this agenda for years to in seattle block the wto expansion but the bottom line of that story is after almost 15 years more of protest mass protests at wto ministerials in cancun in hong kong in geneva as well as protests in many developing countries capitals as well as enormous bravery of developing country negotiators in the geneva negotiating center wto expansion was defeated the people won the agenda that was the most horrific extreme version of globalization did not come to fruition and we see the reverberations of that empowerment of that experience of winning of having an alternative of a better world and stopping that corporate power that experience is reflected in people s movements that have had incredible victories around the world so that even as we re living with the catastrophe of the existing wto rules people power stopped that expansion that would have made things even worse and now we basically have to fight as vandana said to change the existing rules and to some degree the wto now is in an amazing crisis it s never regained its legitimacy since seattle and on december 11th its ability to issue its outrageous rulings against countries gmo policies and environmental policies and health policies and development policies will be shut down because at that point the wto s dispute system will no longer have a quorum there s enough of a protest about the systems operations but is the wto paying attention to this existential threat to its own survival no its agenda is to again try and expand its rules this time to constrain governments from regulating the internet giants that are undermining our privacy and monopolizing the world so am i thinking the wto is going to reform no it s going to take a lot more people power butt whomping to actually get the rules we need amy goodman i want to thank you both for being with us lori wallach of public citizen s global trade watch in the streets 20 years ago in seattle and vandana shiva indian scholar environmental activist physicist food sovereignty and seed freedom advocate alternative globalization author you are in rome italy usually in india or i should say you re just a world citizen because you re always traveling the globe what award are you winning today vandana vandana shiva it s called the minerva award minerva is the goddess of knowledge and we have to return to the recognition that women have knowledge amy goodman well i thank you so much for being with us to these two women of knowledge who have joined us vandana shiva and lori wallach this is democracy now when we come back we look at the movement

in many ways 2019 has been a miserable year for the world economy with trade wars geopolitical instability and slowing growth yet global investors in fact have much to celebrate this year no matter where they invested their money if you tease apart the reasons for that apparent contradiction why this stock market surge looks different from others in the recent past you find some important evidence for where the united states and global economies are likely to be heading the stock market has been surging ever since a late summer recession scare and was up 25 percent for the year at tuesday s close the surge has coincided with falling long term interest rates and higher bond prices for example a popular fund that invests in all types of bonds the ishares core total usd bond market etf has returned 9 percent so far in 2019 the boom is a lot broader than that nearly every major asset class has offered returns over the course of the year that are at a minimum solid and in some cases extraordinary whether real estate investment trusts commodity funds or emerging market stocks widely held funds in those three categories had returned 27 percent 11 percent and 12 percent from the start of the year through tuesday s close

washington d c united states of america november 27 2019 apo group growth is expected to slow to about 3½ percent in 2019 due to weaknesses in the diamond market a severe drought and slower growth in neighboring countries in 2020 it is expected to rise to 4 2 percent as the diamond market normalizes and copper production comes into stream fiscal consolidation should start in fy2020 supported by both expenditure and revenue measures beyond those considered by the authorities the consolidation needs to be carefully calibrated to minimize the impact on growth competitiveness and the most vulnerable achieving botswana s objectives of moving to a knowledge based economy and to high income status by 2036 will require changing the growth model from a mining and government led model to private sector and export driven an international monetary fund imf team led by mr papa n diaye visited gaborone during november 13 27 to hold discussions for the 2019 article iv consultation with botswana the discussions focused on macroeconomic policies to increase the resilience of the economy in the face of persistently low mineral revenue and transfers from the southern african customs union sacu as well as the structural reforms needed to achieve the authorities objective to transition to a knowledge based economy and high income status by 2036 at the end of the visit mr n diaye issued the following statement after a relatively good performance in 2018 the economy is facing headwinds in 2019 related to weaknesses in the diamond market a severe drought and slower growth in neighboring countries growth is expected to slow to about 3½ percent in 2019 while inflation will remain low the current account is projected to move to negative territory contributing to a decline in reserves the fiscal deficit is expected to reach 5¾ percent of gdp due to lower than expected revenue higher than expected increase in public wages and other recurrent spending despite these challenges the banking sector remains well capitalized and liquidity has improved under staff s baseline scenario growth is expected to recover to 4 2 percent in 2020 as the diamond market normalizes and copper production comes into stream and hover around 4 percent thereafter a level too low to achieve botswana s development objectives and create enough jobs to absorb the new entrants into the labor market inflation will accelerate amid accommodative monetary policy but remain in the bottom half of the bank of botswana bob target band fiscal consolidation will gradually reduce the deficit and would contribute to a gradual rebuilding of buffers over the medium term the outlook is subject to significant downside risks including a global rise in protectionism a faster than anticipated slowdown in china and in the euro area and continued slow growth in south africa over the medium term the country remains vulnerable to volatile mineral revenue and sacu transfers and to climate shocks upside risks could stem from higher than expected mining production e g coal the mission supports the authorities objective to return to a fiscal surplus over the medium term in line with their track record of fiscal discipline while botswana still has some fiscal space that allows a gradual adjustment fiscal consolidation should start in fy2020 supported by both revenue and expenditure measures in advancing consolidation the composition of the adjustment needs to be carefully calibrated to minimize the impact on competitiveness growth and the most vulnerable the accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate and consistent with the objective of maintaining a stable real exchange rate against the currencies in the basket achieving botswana s objectives of moving to a knowledge based economy and to high income status by 2036 will require changing the growth model from a mining and government led model to a private sector and export driven this entails revamping the macroeconomic policy frameworks to increase the resilience of the economy and accelerating the implementation of supply side reforms recommended fiscal reforms include i modifying the fiscal rule to prevent further erosions in buffers and achieve botswana s intergenerational equity objectives ii greater revenue mobilization through broadening the tax base and advancing tax reform iii public financial management reforms to enhancing the efficiency of spending iv reforming parastatals and other extra budgetary entities including by enforcing compliance to best governance practices and strengthening their monitoring and accountability and v revamping the debt management framework regarding monetary and exchange rate policy the bob should use the flexibility afforded by its current exchange rate regime to help the economy adjust to the persistent decline in mineral and trade resources and structural transformation recent reforms to strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism and deepen the domestic financial market should continue including by further developing the secondary market for government securities leveraging fintech facilitating the attachment of collateral and improving credit information supply side policies should focus on further improving the business environment redesigning industrial policies with a view to fostering competition and competitiveness and reducing the government footprint in the economy furthermore transitioning to a knowledge based economy and a high income status will require prioritizing investment in human capital upgrading digital skills and deepening information and communications technology penetration as well as promoting integration in regional and global value chains strategic deficiencies in the anti money laundering combating the financing of terrorism framework should be addressed

scroll down to view the winners list life is getting a little harder for global investment banks in a market prepped for the end of the economic cycle spreads are thin and trading perilous to boost revenues dealers must innovate and carve out new markets this year s risk awards offer plentiful examples of firms doing just that goldman sachs our interest rate derivatives house of the year established itself as the go to dealer for swaps linked to the us dollar libor replacement the secured overnight financing rate or sofr the market is nascent and volumes are low but goldman has unlocked liquidity by co locating its swaps repo and short term macro trading desks this allows the firm to match off flows in these correlated but very different markets for example when us repo hit 10 on september 17 the desk generated liquidity by matching off risk between total return swaps and sofr futures at times it has even used repo and cross currency basis trades to offset sofr flows location of desks has been a theme for another of our winners but for a different reason bank of america which scooped our blue riband award for derivatives house of the year shifted a big chunk of its headcount to a new trading hub in paris the office opened early this year around 400 staff have already relocated there roughly half them in front office sales and trading roles across fixed income currencies and commodities ficc and equities it was a big investment one that spoke volumes about bofa s commitment to its mainland european clients our european strategy is clear we want to be here we want to be local says bernard mensah co head of global ficc trading and president of central and eastern europe middle east and africa at bofa that strategy is already paying dividends bofa has increased its market share in euro swaps launched new products including its first swedish krona callable bonds and grown its book of schuldschein loans and other structured notes in equity derivatives the bank made its mark via innovation notably it reinvented the short volatility trade with its synthetic uncorrelated volatility suv index the strategy which decorrelates from the equity market at times of stress is designed to weather episodes such as the vixplosion that wiped out similar products in february 2018 it secured more than 1 billion in client mandates in its first 10 months the suv product is the first short vol strategy with negative downside correlation on a macro level says fabrizio gallo bofa s global head of equities he adds that the instrument is a good example of the firm s product innovation capabilities which are driven by client needs innovation was behind the success of bnp paribas in the currency derivatives category the french bank has worked on visualising data from spot markets to help improve derivatives hedging its new tool proved valuable when the japanese yen crashed at the turn of the year traders at the bank noticed the currency was diving during a period of poor liquidity which caused them to delay hedging their options book until market depth returned avoiding a damaging knee jerk response enabled bnp paribas s g10 foreign exchange options desk to record one of its most profitable weeks of the year other banks have also added new skills or ventured outside their comfort zones in search of growth in credit derivatives barclays has long been a force in the flow business that hasn t changed they generally offer the best research and liquidity says one client in the us but the firm has also added many more strings to its bow we ve really been on a journey for the last four years to evolve and grow our product set says adeel khan the firm s global head of credit in the past 18 months alone the firm relaunched or re entered a range of products it exited after the financial crisis including credit linked notes total return swaps structured financing and derivatives linked to the cmbx index of commercial mortgage

on november 13 a special visitor showed up at bank of america s new paris office édouard philippe the prime minister of france philippe walked the trading floor and gave his verdict on one element of the firm s european strategy excellent choice he said of the decision to open a trading hub in the heart of paris close to the élysée palace and arc de triomphe on the other side of the atlantic tom montag isn t arguing bank of america s chief operating officer and president of global banking and markets says the difference of being on the ground in europe has been palpable as far as the intensity of client coverage it was a change born out of necessity but one that has turned into a real competitive advantage as one concrete example since announcing the move in 2017 bofa s share of client inquiries in euro swaps has trebled it now sees one in four trades on electronic platforms the firm s euro swaps market share has doubled from 4 to over 8 on tradeweb platforms among global banks the brexit referendum in 2016 was met with a mixture of disbelief and dismay it threatened longstanding operating models in which europe was served from subsidiaries or branches in london some banks prayed it wouldn t happen others talked of moving to the continent with all the enthusiasm of an agoraphobe for bofa it was a moment of clarity we saw brexit coming we prepared for brexit says bernard mensah co head of global fixed income currencies and commodities ficc trading at bank of america and we thought why don t we use this to really establish a broader eu base and get closer to clients bofa was clear eyed from the outset about what brexit meant for financial services the uk government had made leaving the single market a red line and financial services were never part of the negotiations for a withdrawal agreement as long as that was the case bofa would need a presence on the continent to serve eu clients while many dealers approached it as a repapering exercise amending swaps documents to face new or existing european legal entities bofa decided to open a fully staffed fully functioning trading hub in paris chosen over frankfurt for its size and deeper pool of qualified employees bofa s new paris office a converted postal office in the eighth arrondissement opened in the first quarter it already has around 400 employees roughly half them in front office sales and trading roles across ficc and equities this was an opportunity for us to make a statement about our commitment to the region it has helped us get closer to our clients and that s paying back in a good way bernard mensah bank of america we have a full trading floor in paris says mensah there s a real buzz about it several senior bankers formerly based in london have made the move including sanaz zaimi head of global ficc sales who was named chief executive of the bank s eu broker dealer entity bofa securities europe zaimi is leading the effort to expand the firm s eu footprint mensah is president of bofa s operations in the uk central and eastern europe middle east and africa among those joining her are vanessa holtz who was appointed head of eu ficc trading in addition to her existing roles in foreign exchange trading and othman kabbaj co head of europe the middle east and africa emea ficc sales the move served two main purposes this was an opportunity for us to make a statement about our commitment to the region it has helped us get closer to our clients and that s paying back in a good way says mensah our european strategy is clear we want to be here we want to be local sanaz zaimi it has also helped to strengthen what has generally been a weak link in the chain of global fixed income flows for the past several years cash has flowed from asia into european fixed income and from europe into the us market being closer to european clients has made it easier for bofa to satisfy the demands of asian investors and has already resulted in some important deals this year bofa issued its first swedish krona callable bonds a sovereign supranational and agency ssa deal followed by a self issue krona still gives you a steeper curve and a better local currency yield for investors in asia even after the cross currency hedge says snigdha singh head of emea flow derivatives trading at bofa it also ramped up its program of local law structured notes offerings such as schuldschein loans in nsv format notionals have more than tripled year on year being closer to our clients on the continent we have a better understanding of what their needs and requirements are says singh that s one of the reasons we were able to add this to our product suite selling the notes also gave the bank a healthy supply of rates euro volatility which it was able to use to increase its market share in the region s swaptions market clients tell risk net the firm has taken big strides and made a strong push in euro swaptions this year as global yields have declined the us market whether that s government securities corporate bonds or mortgages has become more attractive to foreign investors jim de mare bank of america bofa has also increased its share of cross currency flows from europe to the us the bank handles a large and growing share of us debt issuance investment banking revenues rose 27 in the third quarter a chunk of which is increasingly swapped into euros as global yields have declined the us market whether that s government securities corporate bonds or mortgages has become more attractive to foreign investors says jim de mare co head of global ficc trading at bank of america there have been big flows from europe over the past two years and the last year in particular increasing our presence with clients in the region has been very meaningful if the focus in rates was on building out the geographic and product footprint in equity derivatives the bank made its mark via innovation solving problems with two popular products notably demand remains strong for short volatility trades but investors have become more worried about a repeat of the vixplosion in february 2018 that wiped out some products james demare this tail risk has proven hard to hedge short volatility strategies have an implicit positive beta to the equity market which cannot be neutralised by delta hedging bofa tackled the problem by constructing the synthetic uncorrelated volatility suv index which is short volatility but decorrelates from the equity market at times of stress by design the strategy should outperform during steep market sell offs when volatility sellers typically incur the largest losses instead leaving them exposed to losses during aggressive market rallies it s a trade off investors seem happy to make the suv strategy raised more than 1 billion in its first 10 months suv has allowed investors to diversify the volatility risk premium sleeve of their risk premia portfolios to tilt their yield generation programmes more defensively and to boost the sharpe ratio of their overall portfolio says hichem souli global head of equity derivatives structuring at bofa the extended sell off in us stocks at the end of 2018 also left dealers reluctant to sell options on volatility controlled indexes which underpin the 70 billion us fixed index annuity fia market bofa found a way to smooth out the gap risk linked to the daily rebalancing of the underlying indexes using a technique called fast convergence allowing it to sell cliquets more cheaply to fia carriers the fast convergence technology dampens the two way transaction costs present in options on volatility controlled indexes giving the firm the confidence to issue larger volumes of options for annuities while staying within stringent risk limitations says souli flying a helicopter bofa hit a low point in 2011 after a raft of sub prime mortgage settlements and fines moody s downgraded its credit rating by two notches the cost of insuring its debt blew out to more than 400 basis points and its stock price fell 62 that year to below 5 that year montag was appointed co coo and head of bofa s corporate and institutional banking operation as the firm embarked on a rebuild montag saw a chance to make a push in the derivatives business where it had fallen behind rivals we had a gap that was an achievable gap says montag we made a lot of effort both in equities and fixed income to improve the quality of our systems the consistency of our market making our coverage of clients it s been a multi year effort the plan called for a laser focus on clients research and technology coupled with a judicious approach to risk taking and capital management tom montag it has contributed to a string of impressively consistent results for the bank s markets business every year since 2013 sales and trading revenues have been between 12 9 billion and 13 6 billion in 2018 net income was 4 billion up 21 on the prior year the judging period for the awards also encompasses the first half of 2019 when the business booked net income of 2 billion on revenues of 6 7 billion that consistency may have something to do with the bank s insistence that traders make the most of the capital they ve been allocated before the crisis you didn t ask a trading desk how much capital they were using that wasn t part of the conversation it was how much revenue you were generating we have made it abundantly clear that we want traders to be conscious of the capital associated with their activities says de mare given the plethora of capital metrics ratios and buffers now in play that is no easy task if you were running a markets business pre 2008 you simply had an accelerator and a brake pedal says mensah now it s like flying a helicopter there are many different capital measures liquidity measures and regulatory measures that you have to keep in mind the stability of the firm s sales and trading revenues speaks to the management team s piloting skills the standard deviation of the quarterly year over year change in the firm s sales and trading revenue stands at just 11 the lowest of any major global bank this compares with 13 for citi and 15 for jp morgan this partly reflects the nature of bofa s business montag argues one of our advantages is that we re a customer driven shop our earnings are among the most stable because we re a customer driven business those customers in turn praise the firm for its consistency and steadiness something montag values and that he attributes to its prudent approach to capital and risk management we want to be known as a firm that is consistently there for clients he says we are a firm you can trust somebody that is going to be around even when the markets are stressed the quality of our balance sheet and our risk management means we re going to be there through the cycle citizen dev bofa has also made a big push to electronify much of its market making especially in fixed income we have tried to bridge the gap between fixed income and equities on the electronic part by putting people in charge across the platform says montag that has benefitted the flow product in derivatives bofa is auto quoting and auto hedging the bulk of its flow in foreign exchange and rates we re sophisticated on that says mensah the bank s technologists are now working on increasing the streaming of prices not only in rates and forex but also in credit derivatives in some of the index trading there says mensah as well as for emerging market products we re currently putting considerable energy into doing that in a sophisticated way he says it s really important to have the technology to be able to differentiate client by client and be flexible in terms of the platforms that are out there as a rule any large dealer will share these goals but the firm is now looking to push the envelope on innovation last year it created a data and innovation group dig led by brice rosenzweig the former global co head of quantitative strategies to turbocharge those efforts it s really important to have the technology to be able to differentiate client by client and be flexible in terms of the platforms that are out there bernard mensah bank of america rather than centralise all development under its aegis the group is striving to democratise access to data and tools such as machine learning making them available to what we call a citizen dev in the businesses says rosenzweig those citizen devs are working with dig on a number of promising projects which include efforts to incorporate machine learning and data driven approaches in the less electronic less flow more illiquid parts of the business others are looking at using data and machine learning to improve the way derivatives are hedged and the way liquidity is measured resource allocation is also getting the dig treatment another team of developers is using similar techniques to try and predict the demand for collateral and balance sheet in different business lines the goal is to find patterns in how demand evolves over time and try to react to it faster says rosenzweig he declines to specify when these projects will go live although at least some are understood to be close to fruition libor reform it s complicated bofa s stance on libor reform has become a matter of some intrigue this year at least among other dealers and some big buy side firms on the one hand the firm has been heavily involved in the reform efforts especially in the uk mensah sits on the financial conduct authority s markets practitioners panel and was invited to join the working group on sterling risk free reference rates bofa is one of only six banks and three non uk banks represented on the 26 member working group but it has also emerged as a gadfly in those meetings sometimes asking awkward questions about the risks of using the new risk free rates for loans and credit lines that has prompted some to question whether the firm is dragging its feet or even fully behind the reform effort mensah says those charges are unfounded bofa is doing everything necessary to prepare for the transition to new risk free rates he says no ifs no buts in the uk where the migration is already well underway the firm has been involved in some of the biggest transition trades to date including a key co ordinating role in last year s move by abp to switch 500 million 633 million of interest rate and cross currency swap exposure from sterling libor to the secured overnight index average or sonia it has been a top counterparty to uk pension funds which singh estimates have moved the vast majority of their liability hedges to sonia if you have a reference rate that doesn t move when bank funding is moving you could introduce systemic risk into the banking sector bernard mensah bank of america bofa has probably seen around 25 of those migration flows across this year and last year she says in the us where movement has been slower bofa is an active market maker in swaps and futures linked to the us dollar libor replacement the secured overnight funding rate or sofr the firm expects sofr swap volumes to pick up after the so called big bang next october when cme and lch are set to adopt sofr as the discounting rate for cleared swaps bofa may be preparing for the switch to new risk free rates but mensah says the firm does have concerns about using them as the reference rate for loans and credit lines given the lack of a credit spread and forward looking term rate we ve really been thinking this thing through and what we re saying is there are some real issues around the new reference rates says mensah in the uk we now have this possibility of a term structure and we ve been asked to contribute to that effort globally the other thing that we ve been sensitive about is the lack of a credit spread in the new risk free rates the big worry is that unlike with libor assets linked to new risk free rates may not move in tandem with the liability side of a bank s balance sheet in times of stress and we think we should talk about that because if you have a reference rate that doesn t move when bank funding is moving you could introduce systemic risk into the banking sector says mensah bofa s only interest he adds is to get libor reform right it s a really important benchmark we want to land in the right place
by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s economic growth picked up slightly in the third quarter rather than slowing as initially reported and there are signs the downturn in business investment may be drawing to a close the modest firming in growth reported on wednesday by the government came alongside data showing the number of americans filing claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week after standing at a five month high for two straight weeks labor market strength should continue to support consumer spending which appears to be slowing collectively those reports and others are painting a more upbeat picture of an american economy now in a record 11th year of expansion that has had to overcome speed bumps from president donald trump s trade war with china and the ebbing tailwinds from last year s republican tax cuts economists boosted their estimates for growth in the current quarter as well the upswing in the data would appear to validate the optimistic tone struck earlier this week by federal reserve chair jerome powell who said at this point in the long expansion i see the glass as much more than half full the u s central bank last month cut interest rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in july when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008 fourth quarter growth is looking better said michael feroli an economist at jpmorgan nyse in new york gross domestic product increased at a 2 1 annualized rate the commerce department said in its second estimate of third quarter gdp that was up from the 1 9 pace it estimated last month the economy grew at a 2 0 pace in the april june period economists polled by reuters had forecast third quarter gdp growth would be unrevised at 1 9 the upward revision to gdp reflected more inventory accumulation than initially thought inventories rose at a 79 8 billion pace instead of the 69 0 billion rate reported last month the inventory build which economists attributed to the waxing and waning trade tensions between the united states and china contributed to growth instead of being a drag even discounting the inventory lift the economy was healthy last quarter when measured from the income side the economy grew at a 2 4 rate in the last quarter gross domestic income gdi increased at a rate of 0 9 in the second quarter the income side of the growth ledger accelerated despite a drop in profits second quarter gdi growth was revised down by 0 9 percentage point with growth in wages and sales during that period slashed by 46 7 billion to 62 1 billion after tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment which corresponds to profits decreased 11 3 billion or at a rate of 0 6 as they were held down by legal settlements with facebook nasdaq and google nasdaq profits increased at a 3 3 rate in the second quarter the average of gdp and gdi also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity increased at a 2 3 rate in the july september period quickening from a 1 4 growth pace in the second quarter the atlanta fed raised its fourth quarter gdp growth estimate to a 1 7 rate from only a 0 4 pace despite the upbeat growth data inflation remains muted which could trouble some fed officials the fed s preferred inflation measure the core personal consumption expenditures pce price index excluding food and energy increased 1 6 in the 12 months through october the so called core pce price index rose 1 7 in september and has undershot its 2 target this year the dollar firmed against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices fell stocks on wall street stocks rose with the main indexes touching record highs green shoots though growth has been relatively strong economists did not expect the economy to achieve the trump administration s 3 0 this year the economy grew 2 6 in the first half there isn t a lot of oomph here to power the economy forward at anywhere near the trump economics team s prediction of 3 percent said chris rupkey chief economist mufg in new york there are some green shoots however that bode well for the economy in the months ahead the white house s 16 month trade war with china and the fading stimulus from last year s 1 5 trillion tax cut package are restraining the economy but there was good news for business investment which has borne the brunt of the trade war in a second report on wednesday from the commerce department said orders for non defense capital goods excluding aircraft a closely watched proxy for business spending plans surged 1 2 last month the largest gain since january after falling 0 5 in september these so called core capital goods orders were boosted by increased demand for machinery computers and electronic products and fabricated metals shipments of core capital goods increased 0 8 last month core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the gdp measurement business investment dropped at a 2 7 rate in the third quarter rather than contracting at a 3 0 pace as previously reported this was because the decline in spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration shafts and wells was not as steep as previously estimated a third report from the labor department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 15 000 to a seasonally adjusted 213 000 for the week ended nov 23 raising concerns of some easing in the labor market with the labor market on solid footing consumer spending remains supported in a fourth report the commerce department said consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity increased 0 3 last month as households spent more on electricity and gas offsetting a drop in new motor vehicle purchases spending gained 0 2 in september when adjusted for inflation consumer spending nudged up 0 1 in october after gaining 0 2 in september that suggests some moderation in consumer spending after it grew at a 2 9 rate in the third quarter we are in store for a moderation in the pace of consumer spending not a collapse

employment contracts are by their nature asymmetrical although in principle contracts are made between two free and equal parties when an employee signs one they enter into an unequal relationship work can be a source of identity a prerequisite for social inclusion and a marker of status and independence historically the employment contract has been contrasted with slavery bondage and other forms of servitude but workers movements have long argued that waged labour in general implies a kind of wage slavery it dominates as well as exploits at the very least it sets up a hierarchical relationship having a job means being under the authority of an employer struggles for better working conditions for proper remuneration trade union representation protection against discrimination the right to time off for leisure parenting or sickness aim to mitigate the essential inequity of the employment contract and limit the power of the boss according to the sociologist colin crouch the gig economy provides a new way of concealing employers authority people who work for such online platforms as uber lyft and deliveroo are classed not as employees but as self employed they are supposedly flexible entrepreneurs free to choose when they work how they work and who they work for in practice this isn t the case unlike performers in the entertainment industry which gives the gig economy its name most gig workers don t work for an array of organisations but depend for their pay on just one or two huge companies the gig worker doesn t really have much in common with the ideal of the entrepreneur there is little room in their jobs for creativity change or innovation except that gig workers also take a lot of risks they have no benefits holiday or sick pay and they are vulnerable to the whims of their customers in many countries gig workers or independent contractors have none of the rights that make the asymmetry of the employment contract bearable no overtime no breaks no protection from sexual harassment or redundancy pay they don t have the right to belong to a union or to organise one and they aren t entitled to the minimum wage most aren t autonomous independent free agents or students part timers or retirees supplementing their income rather they are people who need to do gig work simply to get by what is new about the gig economy isn t that it gives workers flexibility and independence but that it gives employers something they have otherwise found difficult to attain workers who are not technically their employees but who are nonetheless subject to their discipline and subordinate to their authority the dystopian promise of the gig economy is that it will create an army of precarious workers for whose welfare employers take no responsibility its emergence has been welcomed by neoliberal thinkers policymakers and firms who see it as progress in their efforts to transform the way work is organised standard employment is the formal name given to a non temporary full time job secured by a contract today the share of non standard employment in the labour market is growing there are many kinds of non standard and informal work from self employment to the unstable unregulated and illegal work of the shadow economy it takes different forms in different countries in the uk on call contracts whereby workers are on standby and can be called in to work at any time even for short stints and zero hours contracts whereby employers aren t obliged to guarantee even a minimum number of working hours are popular an estimated 900 000 people worked under such arrangements in 2017 across europe too there has been an increase in marginal jobs and in the use of contracts that expire before workers acquire full rights like germany s minijobs and midijobs which provide short hours and low pay but are enough to disqualify workers from claiming unemployment benefits at the same time in advanced economies the rights of standard employees have been steadily eroded insecurity is the general condition of modern work historically speaking standard employment has been the norm only briefly and only in certain places until the industrious revolution of the 18th century work was piecemeal people worked where they lived on the farm or at home in the putting out system which still exists in cloth production in parts of the global south manufacturers delivered work to workers mostly women who had machinery at home and organised their work alongside their family life then work moved out of the home over the next two centuries the workforce was consolidated into factories then into offices waged work was standardised then became salaried when large numbers of people were brought together so that labour could be divided and supervised unions gained bargaining power new aspects of the employment relationship were subject to government scrutiny pay living standards the responsibility of employers to contribute directly to the support of their employees through a system that came to be known as social insurance as workers gained more rights standard employment was enriched with benefits at its postwar peak enriched employment was a model of social democracy providing generous benefits union recognition worker representation and consultation and in some countries such as belgium and france job protection after the second world war attlee s labour government embarked on a campaign to decasualise work through a social insurance system that would include all employees but the most generous benefits were always limited in scope unlike government funded social assistance which can be universal or means tested but goes to the population at large social insurance schemes provide benefits only to those who have made contributions usually through waged work in britain social insurance excluded non workers and those in casual employment since the point was to eliminate it the paradigmatic wage earner was taken to be a man with a family in the us key labour settlements excluded agricultural and domestic workers groups that included many african americans and immigrants and later limited the power of unions which accepted no strike clauses in return for a minimal safeguarding of job security since then standard employment has been eroded in the 1960s and 1970s unions gathered strength before being significantly weakened by commodity price inflation crises and the move towards the free market which threatened the aspiration to full employment the world of the steady job it turned out contained the seeds of its own decline today standard employment is no longer enriched to the same degree even when it is available union membership has declined particularly in anglophone countries labour markets have been deregulated the protections offered by collective bargaining agreements weakened and employers have fewer obligations to workers a quarter of all employment in the oecd countries for which data is available is precarious the figure would be higher if the shadow economy could be measured accurately novel forms of precarity are multiplying agriculture accounts for a smaller proportion of precarious labour than it once did though much agricultural work is performed by migrants who are often the most precarious workers of all but involuntary part time and temporary work is rising especially in countries affected by the eurozone crisis in italy 12 per cent of total employment is involuntarily part time and temporary the figure is more than 5 per cent in at least ten oecd states even if standard employment turns out to be the historical exception the erosion of workers security doesn t mark a return to the capitalism of the gilded age modern precarity takes a distinctive form which is a result of the major political and economic changes of the 1970s as crouch sees it three of these changes are especially significant first the shift from a manufacturing to a service economy characterised as deindustrialisation or as the transition from fordism to post fordism as manufacturing declined the enriched standard employment associated with it began to disappear second the rise of digital and data technologies which has made possible the intensification of workplace discipline and surveillance as well as new ways of working from home a modern putting out system the internet has enabled monopolies but it has also decentralised work as well as deindustrialised it third workers loss of power after the deregulation of finance under thatcher and reagan corporations were reorganised to benefit shareholders and finance was given the freedom to move to more advantageous regimes workers had no such freedom and neither did conventional firms whose buildings equipment and working populations were settled in a particular place all this changed the distribution of risk to the detriment of workers so workers rights have declined over the last decades but unevenly anti discrimination law has been strengthened making the workplace rights of women and minorities more robust the amount of paid parental leave has increased in many countries though it varies wildly slovakia offers the most generous paid maternity leave in the oecd at 164 weeks but doesn t provide for fathers japan and korea offer more than 50 weeks paid leave to both parents the us offers nothing to either in eu member states overall there have been improvements in minimum wage regulation and in the representation of employees on workers councils though changes of this sort are often made in exchange for a ceding of union power in austria and the nordic countries where collective bargaining is strong there is no minimum wage crouch argues that the rights that have been strengthened tend to be market enhancing rights those that encourage participation in the labour market increasing productivity they are often supported by neoliberal policymakers and businesses the rights that have consistently declined are those that reduce the asymmetry of the employment contract while women and minorities have more rights than they used to those in precarious work don t benefit from them and women are more likely than men to be involuntarily in part time and temporary work differences between categories of work are easily politicised neoliberal critics of labour rights see the enriched model of standard employment as the problem on their view the segregation between a largely white male secure workforce and a precarious workforce of women minorities immigrants and the young has come about because of the improvement in employment rights and trade union protections and so the way to end the segregation is to get rid of those rights and protections others see it as having come about through the efforts of social democratic parties to protect the privileges of their core constituency those white male workers so that modernisers wanting to transform their party s base and reputation have sought to repeal job protection laws the very existence of a precarious workforce makes it possible for steady jobs to be undercut work contracted out and workers set against one another crouch believes that the gig economy has a wider significance too he picks out two contradictory models of capitalism market fundamentalists believe that the aim of capitalism is to achieve perfect markets they reject oligopoly and propagate the the myth of the equal contract corporate capitalists by contrast are in favour of oligopoly and don t care so much about ideal markets they see the relation between employer and employee as closer to a master servant dynamic much modern labour law legally enshrines obedience to managerial authority what the gig does in crouch s view is to ease the tension between the two models it promises to fulfil the fantasy that we are all free in the marketplace even in the labour market when workers are no longer defined as employees their interests are pushed outside the corporation altogether they are also removed from union jurisdiction unions have as one would expect campaigned against the encroachments of the gig economy and the erosion of workers rights it entails but they have sometimes been reluctant to organise the precarious workforce even though precarious workers are among those most in need of union representation it s no surprise that as a consequence many precarious workers see ordinary workers however poorly paid as privileged in some countries italy for example they even support further labour market deregulation unions are starting to address this by looking for ways to organise workers outside workplaces by supporting new organisations led by precarious workers by bringing legal cases to win rights for those workers but progress is slow recently there have been challenges to uber first on grounds of customer safety the app was banned in india and then in cases brought by drivers unions and regulators in brussels paris london montreal and elsewhere on grounds of its denial of workers rights opponents of the gig economy have more generally made efforts to have independent contractors awarded the status of employees with all the associated benefits the new online platforms have resisted these changes by exploiting legal nuances in english law no employment relationship exists if a worker can substitute another person to perform the work by this definition gig workers are self employed and so forfeit the benefits of the employment rights act of 1996 which stipulated the right of workers to the minimum wage sick pay and parental leave and to be protected against discrimination and unlawful deductions from their pay of the legal challenges to definitions of this sort the most successful resulted in a ruling made by california s supreme court in september defining workers as employees of a company if that company exercised control over their work or if the workers were integral to its business this would mean that uber and lyft s independent contractors would be reclassified as employees economists lawyers and sociologists meanwhile are trying to establish the definition of employer as a controller of workplace behaviour or more capaciously as a work provider if online platforms as work providers can be classed as employers after all they control the work relationship provide work and pay and profit from workers labours then the privileges they currently enjoy would disappear such technical discussions of employment law join up with the politics of work to call an activity work still confers legitimacy on the person performing it no matter how far workers rights have been eroded as manufacturing continues to decline disputes over what counts as work care work sex work and who can be included as a member of the working class health and education workers tech workers the precariat the wageless will persist will the gig economy last crouch thinks the current situation in which unregulated firms exploit a rapidly increasing employment asymmetry may well be unsustainable most workers are reluctant to give up job security for the independence afforded by gig work unless they have to in a slack labour market for example where there is a surplus of labour when there is a labour shortage the balance of power shifts to workers firms start having to guarantee job security this may be happening already uber and lyft workers have recently shown a willingness to strike both companies are publicly listed and crouch believes that in order to address investors anxieties they may be forced to offer workers a better deal but things could just as easily move in the other direction in the scramble to maintain stock value platforms may try to exert downward pressure on wages even if the independent contractor is legislated out of existence firms will continue to try to find ways to use precarious labour not least by continuing to dismantle standard employment in a bleak moment crouch predicts that digitalisation will cause disturbances at least as severe as in the depression of the 1920s and 1930s old jobs will be destroyed by technology and new ones created and there will be prolonged surpluses of labour tilting the balance of power even further towards employers the greater the proportion of work and business conducted digitally the easier it will be for firms continually to move their operations wherever they will get tax breaks rent seeking cash hoarding tax evading employers will contribute as little as possible to pensions and social insurance and governments will have to pick up the slack increasing the state s vulnerability to fiscal crisis crouch thinks a major overhaul of policy will be required if we are to cope with these transformations he doesn t share the enthusiasm for a universal basic income or other form of citizens wage that has gained ground both on the left as a route to autonomy or a rejection of work and on the right as a way to shrink the state or to secure a modicum of stability for people in a world where work no longer pays as crouch sees it ubi hollows out the social democratic notion of citizenship as a system of rights responsibilities and duties he doesn t want to abandon the notion of enriched standard employment but to find ways of extending it to the precarious workforce his main proposal is a reform of social insurance to make it a tax on the use of labour currently only firms that choose to accept their responsibility as employers pay towards social insurance instead crouch proposes all organisations that use labour would have to pay firms would no longer be able to shrug off their obligations by changing their status as employers relocating or defining their precarious workers as self employed they would have to pay their fair share individual workers would pay their fair share too their contribution to social insurance would be calculated according to their income rather than their employment or citizenship status and they would receive benefits including pensions disability and sick pay leave for parenting and other care work as well as job retraining these benefits would be tied to contributions made to the insurance fund rather than being delivered as a form of social assistance drawn from general taxation in lieu of the patchwork of insurance and assistance that characterises the british welfare state today this version of social insurance would encourage the belief that you get back from society what you put in everyone would have an incentive to work since the benefits would be tied to payment of tax on work done unpaid care work and parenting would qualify if firms treated their workers well with secure contracts training union representation their tax bill would be reduced to make all this stick unions would have to work not just to secure higher wages for their members but to handle grievances create family friendly working environments and lead campaigns against challenges like the rise of workplace surveillance crouch s book is a love letter to the postwar welfare state it is not a critique of capitalism just of its neoliberal variant indeed he makes clear that he believes eliminating the gig economy is necessary if capitalism is to be saved the gig economy is a threat to social stability and if it were to prevail he writes capitalism s own need for social reproduction would be severely compromised capitalism will not sustain itself he argues unless it can sustain normal secure family life he wants to preserve the social democratic institutions of family home and property along with the separation between home and workplace work and leisure a traditional even nostalgic but also perhaps compelling offer at a time when many millennials find it inconceivable they might ever own a home he also values the work ethic the entrepreneurial imperative the capitalist emphasis on flexibility his ideal society is one in which everybody works and the refusal of work is off limits revealingly the only exception he makes is sex work there are surely other forms of work involving at least as much exploitation and drudgery by insisting that work can pay for the family rather than imagining a reduction of work for all crouch misses the chance to imagine a way of living beyond the one we know he rejects the idea that in the future we may need to break the connection between work and income let alone the connection between profit and income what he is striving for is a path to stability will this suffice the real question perhaps isn t whether stability is enough but whether the stabilisation of

in september mitchell matarause delivered her baby boy by candlelight at a clinic in harare zimbabwe s capital in september mitchell matarause delivered her baby boy by candlelight at a clinic in harare zimbabwe s capital by farai matiashe it was after sunset and the electricity supply had been cut midwives were using candles and torches for lighting said the 26 year old holding her second born i delivered in the evening there was no electricity there was a candle on the table i heard the midwives say that they could not see properly so they had to use torches as additional light sources as one midwife assisted me the others held the torches i was just praying i deliver well without complications i feared the worst and sighed with relief when it was over high quality maternal healthcare is difficult to access and provide in zimbabwe a country struggling with regular power outages sophisticated equipment relies on electricity women across the country have reported similar experiences to matarause relying on a small flame or a cellphone to provide enough light to give birth safely during power blackouts earlier this year the state owned zimbabwe electricity supply authority zesa introduced 18 hour load shedding after reducing electricity generation due to low water levels in lake kariba its main source of power while the power is not switched off at large referral hospitals in harare such as harare central hospital and parirenyatwa group of hospitals it is cut at most facilities in residential suburbs and rural areas a midwife at mufakose polyclinic where matarause welcomed her child said the team usually asks pregnant mothers to provide their own lighting we ask them to bring bulbs with batteries as it is difficult to see when using candle lights she told al jazeera most women in zimbabwe deliver at state run hospitals which charge a small fee about 200 that goes towards basic equipment the cost of giving birth at private hospitals is about 5 000 a sum that is out of reach for most civil servants earn just 500 on average each month zimbabwe turns to solar energy to reduce maternal mortality rate because of power outages some hospitals purchase fuel at cost price from service stations for generators power blackouts threaten to worsen maternal mortality rates which the zimbabwe demographic and health survey estimates at 651 deaths per 100 000 live births according to unicef two regions sub saharan africa and south asia account for 86 of maternal deaths worldwide the united nations population fund describes zimbabwe s rate as unacceptably high even as the last five to 10 years show a decline some hospitals and clinics including private facilities use fuel generators but this option is out of reach for many diesel and petrol are expensive with a 300 inflation rate as of august 2019 according to the international monetary fund the fuel price is determined by the zimbabwean dollar and us dollar interbank exchange rate at the time of writing petrol was trading at around 16 6 a litre while diesel was up at 17 43 at chiredzi hospital a government run facility almost 500km southeast of harare when authorities fail to purchase fuel for generators midwives do whatever it takes to save lives hospitals need to provide comprehensive obstetric and newborn care among other things such as responding to emergencies and doing surgery that s where the power issues come in with the current cost of diesel to run generators the situation is dire chiredzi district acting medical officer david tarumbwa said we buy fuel straight from service stations at cost price no subsidies it s not sustainable you can t run a generator for 12 hours daily the next thing is it breaks down when they do not have generators the doctors and nurses explore whatever options will be available emmanuel mahlangu president of the zimbabwe confederation of midwives explained it is important to differentiate between normal pregnancy and childbirth with complicated pregnancy and childbirth eighty seven percent of pregnancies and childbirths are normal a normal childbirth occurring during the day may actually go through without much use of electricity however if it were to occur in the night the priority is lighting a complicated delivery may require electricity for resuscitation of the baby warmth from radiant heaters lights and operative delivery against this backdrop new technology that does not rely on fuel is being tried out zimbabwe turns to solar energy to reduce maternal mortality rate solar panels have been installed at several health facilities across the country in an attempt to overcome the negative impact of power shortages we care solar a california based ngo and the united nations development programme undp are working with the government to install solar power systems in clinics and hospitals nationwide we care solar has struck a partnership with local ngo zimenergy eco foundation providing compact rugged solar electric systems called solar suitcases designed in 2010 these suitcases provide bright lights and foetal heart monitoring more than 4 000 health centres in africa and asia have been equipped with this technology since 2016 we care solar has supported 136 maternal health facilities with reliable lighting and electricity in zimbabwe in the provinces of matabeleland south mashonaland east and masvingo and aims to extend its project to other clinics across the country before year end we aim to officially launch the light every birth campaign in collaboration with the health ministry we care solar zimbabwe programme manager shamiso moyo said we aim to install the solar system at a total of 1 000 clinics undp also partnered with the health ministry on a solar for health project and installed solar systems at 405 institutions across the country to ensure uninterrupted power including at maternity wards they are now primarily running on solar and only using the mains electricity grid as backup the systems vary in capacity depending on the size of the medical facility smaller clinics are now running on 5kw or 7kw while larger clinics and district hospitals run on 10kw 15kw or even 40kw systems said undp zimbabwe resident representative georges van montfort he hoped that eventually no woman would ever have to deliver by candlelight again as the rest of the country waits however mahlangu said that while the use of candle and cellphone lights during delivery is not recommended midwives will continue to use whatever means they have to offer women support during their critical hours in labour midwives cannot leave a woman unattended because of lack of electricity he said and childbirth will not stop because there is no electricity al

the department of justice has joined with business groups to defend the program which pays investors more than 2 billion in tax breaks for hiring roughly 300 000 foreign graduates instead of their recent american counterparts the government lawyers replied to a lawsuit against the optional practical training program by saying it is a legal extension of laws that allow foreign students to enter u s universities but the american plaintiffs in the lawsuit say the opt program was not created by congress the program is merely a lobbyist created cheap labor program which discriminates against american graduates and also transfers at least 2 billion each year from social security and medicare to the wealthy investors in technology companies the opt program allows roughly 300 000 foreign graduates of u s colleges to get u s jobs usually at low wages for one or three years the program helps the foreigners compete for green cards it sidelines american graduates into unemployment and low prestige jobs and it also lowers salaries for a wide range of american professionals say critics the case is likely to be heard by judge reggie walton in may said john miano the lawyer for the american plaintiffs at the immigration reform law institute i think things are looking good he said the law is clear here at the end of the day the courts are not going to rule to that the scheme which congress has set up is meaningless and that can change the terms of the visa when the alien gets to the united states but he warned the thing you always worry about is that if the judges decide this is the outcome i want to get there are opinions out there where judges can stretch the law india s government strongly backs the opt program because it funnels roughly 50 000 of india s graduates into prestigious and well paid american jobs usually with the mutual aid of indian recruiters and managers the program also feeds many indian graduates into the h 1b program which keeps roughly 750 000 indian graduates in american jobs once in those jobs the indians outsource more jobs to india via the u s india outsourcing economy so denying those jobs to americans graduates overall a series of visa and work permit programs dubbed the opt l 1 h 1b tn j 1 and h4 ead keep a shifting population of roughly 1 5 million non immigrant foreign graduates in jobs needed by young debt burdened american graduates many of the foreign graduates get software jobs but many others are using their national caste and ethnic favor networks to get u s jobs in healthcare accounting management engineering and design congress is now trying to pass a bill dubbed s 386 that would encourage and reward indians who take white collar jobs from americans another set of programs provides blue collar work permits to more than 1 million people each year amid the worker inflow the career losses for ordinary americans become stock market gains for wealthy investors whose stocks rise by roughly 25 billion for every 1 billion which is cut from annual payroll costs the opt program conflicts with president donald trump s buy american hire american policy but it is strongly backed by the technology investors who govern most of the nation s information networks in the year running up to the 2020 election trump s attitude towards the various college graduate visa programs has zig zagged amid pressure from the investors and from middle class swing voting college graduates the result is that his deputies have nudged down the inflow of the h 1b program without making significant changes while trump has avoided creating any new programs or canceling any of the existing programs such as the 100 000 strong h4 ead program there is a lot of pressure in various sectors to utilize more immigrant labor for employment whether it is for high tech or low tech in the economy has also made clear that is is important to protect ordinary american workers and to not displace them ken cuccinelli who runs the u s citizenship and immigration services agency said in october is there some perfect target point in every industry maybe there is but we re never going to be able to know it so which side do you err on so we re just in a constant battle to balance those things the inflow of tech workers is causing intense pain to some americans i m a displaced us worker and my job was taken over by a h1b worker in the us says an october gofundme appeal from pamela pjura she continued all the employees in the department that i was working were replaced by h1b s the manager was a h1b worker who receive a green card and was trying to do the same for other h1b workers i m actively searching and applying for positions when i m applying i m speaking with recruiters who don t speak or understand english nor do they know anything about the job i never hear back from anyone even if i follow up but the opt program is being defended by a large group of investors including some of the wealthiest men in america fortune magazine reported intel currently has about 1 100 employees in opt status who did not win the h1 b lottery last year and they make a significant contribution to the work we do in our u s operations said malloy in the past judges dismissed case on standing or called it moot but this july he had a breakthrough when a federal district court allowed miano to go ahead with his challenge to the program the judge acknowledging that the trump administration may not be as eager to defend the program as past administrations have been also allowed groups representing businesses the u s chamber of commerce the information technology industry council and the national association of manufacturers to intervene in the case and present their own arguments in favor of the program congress did not create the opt program so the justice department claims the program rests on legal extrapolations and interpretations and congressional inaction under the ina the f 1 student provision allows dhs to provide f 1 nonimmigrant status to someone who is a bona fide student qualified to pursue a full course of study and who seeks to enter the united states temporarily and solely for the purpose of pursuing such a course of study at an established academic institution the statute is silent as to the meaning of the terms student and course of study and nothing else in the ina resolves the question whether an f 1 student s course of study can include a period of post graduation practical training in the student s field of study the statutory language naturally lends itself to the reading that a student could be permitted to work as part of his course of study the department of homeland security has the legal authority to redefine education the legal claim says faced with the statutory gap in the f 1 provision in the 2016 opt rule dhs adopted a reasonable and longstanding interpretation that the f 1 student provision allows for employment of students after graduation and during a period of practical training as noted above employment as a means of educating someone is not unusual even for graduate students and dhs enjoys significant authority to enforce the ina and a narrower directive to issue rules governing nonimmigrants congress has not moved to correct the opt program so it must be legal the claim said congress has ratified or at a minimum acquiesced to the longstanding agency practice of extending work authorization for f 1 nonimmigrants including those who have already graduated from an academic institution the agency s unbroken interpretation when combined with congressional awareness of the f 1 opt program and the lack of congressional action to change the agency s approach confirms that the 2016 opt rule reflects a reasonable interpretation of the agency s authority indeed the ina does not define the term student as it relates to a permitted course of study which may encompass both classroom education and practical training business groups led by the national association of manufacturers said the graduates should be treated as students because they are still getting educated while working in u s jobs to begin with it has long been understood that practical training can be an integral part of a student s education capping off classroom learning through in field experience as dhs con cluded in promulgating the 2016 rule the stem opt extension rule is grounded in the long standing recognition by dhs and its predecessor agency that experiential learning and practical training are valuable parts of any post secondary educational experience they leave out the part that says aliens are required to leave the country when they no longer conform to the status they have when they were admitted said miano they only show that in a footnote gop sen mike lee is again pushing his s386 bill to reward 300k indian graduates for taking college jobs from american graduates gop senators stay quiet dems say lee should reward more foreign grads estb media is silent truly bizarre neil munro neilmunrodc october 31 2019 besides the dhs has the legal authority to provide work permit to whomever it wishes the business group claims the immigration agencies across multiple administrations of both political parties have time and again relied on section 1324a as authority for allowing the employ ment of noncitizens not statutorily authorized to work as the united states has cataloged in previous briefs defending this authority immigration agencies have cited this provision at least twenty times when identifying classes of noncitizens authorized to work in the united states plaintiff s argument would render each of these substantial programs unlawful plaintiff is simply mistaken in its suggestion that the immigration agencies have been acting lawlessly for decades the status quo is suitable for investors the business claim says for example it says managers at intel corp more than 1 000 opt graduates each year the inclusion of these high skilled foreign students is critical to the success of american industry to take the example of just a single firm intel corporation a member of all three intervenors seek u s workers first when we need to fill u s positions but nevertheless finds itself hiring 1 400 to 1 700 master s and ph d level foreign national college hires a year substantially all of whom have work authorization because of opt or stem opt the legal brief by the technology sector intel and various west coast investors including mark zuckerberg and bill gates says the billion dollar tax breaks for hiring indian chinese and other opt workers are too small to notice even in the unlikely event that some recruiter happened to be aware of this obscure wrinkle in the tax code they would not be able to do anything with it that is because employers typically avoid asking about the details of a candidate s immigration status during the recruiting process and thus recruiters are unlikely to know at the time of hiring whether a candidate is a stem opt participant let alone whether the candidate qualifies for a fica tax exemption amici state here clearly that the possibility that a job candidate might have fica exempt status simply does not impact employers hiring decisions let alone lead them to prefer foreign workers over native ones in response the legal brief submitted by the center for immigration studies says the opt program is a regressive income transfer program which takes from congressionally mandated social security medicare and federal unemployment insurance trust funds for the elderly the ailing and the unemployed and gives it to corporations that discriminate against american citizen graduates approximately 300 000 opt beneficiaries hold jobs at any given time which means that the opt program amounts to the elimination of approximately 300 000 entry level positions available to citizen and permanent resident college graduates for every opt beneficiary who is directly favored by the subsidy program one u s worker is pushed aside in addition to the oneon one displacement of individual workers the opt program adds 300 000 new temporarily legal workers to the labor market this program therefore needlessly swells the labor force and creates a looser labor market which suppresses wages for everyone but particularly for new college graduates an employer hiring one or more opt workers is supposed to create a training program for these workers but the training involved is nominal at best merely a fig leaf to cover opt s true nature as a foreign worker program the opt program contains so many failures to protect american workers as well as the public treasury at least in part because it was not created through the appropriate statutory process it was created behind closed doors by the second bush administration as a means of obtaining more foreign workers when the public process was not amenable to doing so the decision to allow approximately 300 000 foreign workers is properly a matter for congress to decide and congress should certainly be the one deciding if a particular foreign worker program ought to be subsidized the federal government provides some data about the universities and companies which create and hire opt workers u s citizenship is an amazingly valuable prize of course people stage an amazing diversity of frauds to win the prize the latest example is a fake robbery at bob s burgers to get u visas neil munro neilmunrodc november 6 2019 immigration numbers each year roughly four million young americans join the workforce after graduating from high school or a university this total includes about 800 000 americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care engineering or science software or statistics but the federal government then imports about 1 1 million legal immigrants it also adds replacement workers to a resident population of more than 1 5 million white collar visa workers including approximately one million h 1b workers and about 500 000 blue collar h 2b h 2a and j 1 visa workers the government also prints more than one million work permits for new foreigners and it rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants this policy of inflating the labor supply boosts economic growth and stock values for investors the stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for american workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions the federal policy of flooding the market with cheap foreign white collar graduates and blue collar labor shifts wealth from young employees toward older investors it also widens wealth gaps reduces high tech investment increases state and local tax burdens reduces marriage rates and hurts children s schools and college educations the cheap labor economic strategy also pushes americans away from high tech careers and it sidelines millions of marginalized americans including many who are now struggling with drug addictions the labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the heartland to the coastal cities explodes rents and housing costs undermines suburbia shrivels real estate values in the midwest and rewards investors for creating low tech labor intensive workplaces but president donald trump s hire american policy is boosting wages by capping immigration within a growing economy the census bureau said september 10 that men who work full time and year round got an earnings boost of 3 4 percent in 2018 pushing their median salaries up to 55 291 women gained 3 3 percent in wages bringing their median salaries to 45 097 for full time year round work

by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s consumer confidence fell for a fourth straight month in november amid worries about current business conditions and employment prospects but remained at levels sufficient to support a steady pace of consumer spending another report on tuesday showed an unexpected drop in new home sales last month but data for september was revised higher to show purchases hitting their highest level in over 12 years the housing market the most sensitive sector to interest rates is catching up to the federal reserve s easy monetary policy stance which has pushed down mortgage rates from last year s multi year highs though housing accounts for a fraction of gross domestic product it has a bigger economic footprint the rise in housing activity early in the fourth quarter together with a narrowing in the trade deficit suggest some support for the economy as it slows amid cooling consumer spending and persistent weakness in business investment and manufacturing the trump administration s 16 month trade war with china has been largely blamed for the ebb in consumer confidence the trade fight has also hammered business confidence leading to a downturn in capital expenditure trade tensions between the two economic giants have eased in recent weeks with president donald trump saying on tuesday that washington was in the final throes of a deal with beijing the economy is growing but it would take a politician to say it is in good let alone great shape said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania the conference board said its consumer confidence index slipped to a reading of 125 5 this month from an upwardly revised 126 1 in october the index was previously reported at 125 9 in september economists polled by reuters had forecast the index would climb to 127 0 in november the survey s present situation measure based on consumers assessment of current business and labor market conditions fell to 166 9 this month from 173 5 in october but the expectations index drawn from consumers short term outlook for income business and labor market conditions rose to a reading of 97 9 from 94 5 last month consumer confidence has retreated from a recent peak of 137 9 in october 2018 still the index remains relatively high and is consistent with an economy growing at a moderate pace growth estimates for the fourth quarter are below a 2 0 annualized rate after a 1 9 pace in the third quarter the conference board survey s so called labor market differential derived from data on respondents views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get fell to 32 1 in november from 36 1 in october that measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the labor department s employment report this suggests on the margin some slowing in job gains going forward but overall the labor market remains strong said kathy bostjancic chief u s financial economist at oxford economics in new york the dollar was steady against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices rose stocks on wall street were trading higher with the three main indexes hitting all time highs on rising hopes of a u s china trade truce lower mortgage rates in a separate report on tuesday the commerce department said new home sales dropped 0 7 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733 000 units last month september s sales pace was revised higher to 738 000 units the highest since july 2007 from the previously reported 701 000 units economists had forecast new home sales which account for about 11 3 of housing market sales would increase 1 1 to a pace of 709 000 units in october new home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month to month basis sales surged 31 6 from a year ago concentrated in the 200 000 400 000 price range homes priced below 200 000 the most sought after accounted for only 9 of sales reports last week showed housing starts surging and building permits vaulting to more than a 12 year high in october and home resales advancing the renewed strength in housing activity has been accompanied by a pickup in home prices a third report on

by another report from the federal housing finance agency showing home prices advancing 5 1 in september from a year ago residential investment rebounded in the third quarter after contracting for six straight quarters the longest such stretch since the 2007 2009 recession we think that real residential investment will increase again during the quarter with the housing market continuing to benefit from the drop in mortgage rates relative to late last year said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york but the housing market momentum could slow as mortgage rates have backed up in the

u s economic growth picked up slightly in the third quarter rather than slowing as initially reported and there are signs the downturn in business investment could be drawing to a close the economy s prospects were further brightened by other data on wednesday showing the number of americans filing claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week after being stuck at a five month high for two straight weeks and that consumer spending rose steadily in october the reports were released in the wake of data showing an acceleration in housing market activity early in the fourth quarter and a sharp decline in the goods trade deficit as well as a solid pace of inventory accumulation by retailers the improvement in the economic data further diminished the risks of recession in the near term the federal reserve last month cut interest rates for the third time this year and signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in july when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008 gross domestic product increased at a 2 1 per cent annualized rate the commerce department said in its second estimate of third quarter gdp that was up from the 1 9 per cent pace estimated last month the economy grew at a 2 0 per cent pace in the april june period economists polled by reuters had forecast third quarter gdp growth would be unrevised at 1 9 per cent the upward revision to gdp reflected more inventory accumulation than initially thought as well as a less steep pace of contraction in business investment inventories increased at a 79 8 billion us pace instead of the 69 0 billion rate reported last month when measured from the income side the economy grew at a 2 4 per cent rate in the last quarter gross domestic income gdi increased at a rate of 0 9 per cent in the second quarter the income side of the growth ledger accelerated despite a drop in profits second quarter gdi growth was revised down by 0 9 percentage point with growth in wages and sales during that period slashed by 46 7 billion to 62 1 billion after tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment which corresponds to s p 500 profits decreased 11 3 billion or at a rate of 0 6 per cent as they were held down by legal settlements with facebook and google profits increased at a 3 3 per cent rate in the second quarter the average of gdp and gdi also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity increased at a 2 3 per cent rate in the july september period quickening from a 1 4 per cent growth pace in the second quarter wages and spending up savings down u s stock index futures briefly extended gains and u s 10 year treasury yields rose after the release of the data the dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies growth has slowed from the 3 1 per cent rate notched in the first three months of the year the slowdown is largely blamed on the trump administration s trade war with china which has eroded business confidence contributing to the second straight quarterly decline in business investment the fading stimulus from last year s 1 5 trillion tax cut package is also sapping momentum from the expansion now in its 11th year but there are some hopeful signs for business investment the commerce department said on wednesday consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity increased 0 3 per cent last month as households spent more on electricity and gas offsetting a drop in new motor vehicle purchases with consumer spending rising moderately inflation remained benign in october consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures pce price index rose 0 2 last month lifted by food energy goods and services prices the pce price index was unchanged in august and september wages increased 0 4 per cent in october after climbing 0 1 per cent in september wages were boosted by a 7 2 billion adjustment to account for general motors strike pay and payments associated with a new contract for members of the united automobile workers union with spending outpacing income growth savings fell to 1 29 trillion from 1 34 trillion in september orders for non defence capital goods excluding aircraft a closely watched proxy for business spending plans surged 1 2 per cent last month the largest gain since january after falling 0 5 per cent in september these so called core capital goods orders were boosted by increased demand for machinery computers and electronic products and fabricated metals economists had forecast core capital goods orders would drop 0 3 per cent in october shipments of core capital goods increased 0 8 per cent last month core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the gdp measurement core capital goods shipments fell 0 8 per cent in september business investment dropped at a 2 7 per cent rate in the third quarter rather than contracting at a 3 0 per cent pace as previously reported the declines in spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration shafts and wells were not as steep as previously estimated a report from the labor department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 15 000 to a seasonally adjusted 213 000 for the week ended nov 23 claims had been stuck at a five month high over the previous two weeks pointing to some easing in the labor market still the labour market remains on solid footing helping to underpin consumer spending growth in consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity was unrevised at a 2 9 per cent rate in the third quarter
interview with ambassador he yafei he yafei a leading scholar of american studies in china spoke with china us focus host james chau in hong kong on nov 15 the following transcript has been lightly edited for clarity james chau ambassador he thank you very much for sharing this time and sharing your insights at a very complex time in the world the world always changes but recently it seems to change more frequently and in nuanced ways how do you look at the world today what can you share from that he yafei thank you very much for inviting me to this interview the world as you were saying has changed a lot we are entering probably a new phase in human history that is more challenging than at any time before i often quote president xi jinping s remark that the world is currently going through a period of the most profound change it has seen in the last hundred years i think this is very true among the most profound changes as i see it first is the geopolitical shift in the balance of power meaning that there has been over the last three or four decades a convergence between developed and developing countries china is a prominent case moving from a relatively backward economy with an average gdp of 200 per capita to 9 900 last year becoming the number two economy in the world but china also feels this is very very complicated i often say this is the best time in history for china and also the worst time the best time in the sense that after 30 or 40 years of opening up and reform china has grown up it has become richer and more developed and people have greater aspirations they are hopeful about a better future for example the total eradication of poverty by the end of 2020 so this is the best period in the recent history of china and it s also the worst because china is facing more dangers and more risks in the world the first risk and danger comes from geopolitical conflict or possible geopolitical conflict with the united states if the bilateral relationship is not handled well in the next few years in the united states some people view china s progress so far as something that is threatening to the dominant position of the united states whether it s political economic or technological they see china as a competitor not a competitor from the same side and with the same ideology they see china as on the other side of course we should not listen to people like bannon who says china is a non capitalist country with which i agree and second that china does not believe in christianity and judaism which i suspect has some religious bias third he says china is not anglo saxon that is bordering on a racist remark he s an extreme example what i m trying to convey is that there are some dangerous signs of trying to paint china in a negative light as a negative figure vis a vis america that could create a situation where china and the u s could be on a collision course geopolitically speaking that would disrupt the normal pattern of cooperation especially economic cooperation hence you hear about the decoupling thing between the u s and china the decoupling of their economies the decoupling of their technological cooperation etc this is one danger i see second something is going on inside western societies that something is both erosive and divisive as we can see it s populism populism is rising nationalism is rising and protectionism is rising how come there is so much anger and frustration at the lower end of the working people not really people under the poverty line but lower end blue collar workers or even white collar workers because in western countries including the united states a balance between market efficiency and social justice cannot be found the governments and the elites who are running the government and civil society haven t done enough or haven t found a proper solution for maintaining that balance i read a book by the french economist piketty in 2015 the book capital in the twenty first century talks about the role of capital and return on capital and he uses lots of data from developed nations after the second world war from the last few decades and the conclusion he makes is very interesting that over the last few decades in all those developed economies the return on capital always surpassed average gdp growth we all know that income by labor whether skilled labor or unskilled labor blue or white if you can match average gdp growth you are lucky usually you will be 1 or 2 percent behind that growth so you see a wide gap between rich and poor and the wealth created by globalization is not distributed evenly or properly james chau let s look at a few quick issues first of all there seems to be at times a very aggressive tug of war between globalization and those who believe in a movement that runs counter to that how do you find your place within a very rapidly changing global landscape when you have these two different schools of thought and also very extreme camps within them he yafei china finds it worrisome that there is such intensity in this tug of war as you were saying between globalization or pro globalization and anti globalization which is driven by populism and i have to hop back on the issue i mentioned this widening gap between the rich and poor the inability of various governments or societies to narrow that gap to find a balance that on the one hand you keep your economy growing you keep accumulating wealth for your society but on the other hand you take care of those people who are not well treated by globalization they are not as fortunate as the people who own capital or who own new technology because now there is a tendency to combine technology with capital with those people who are getting richer and richer you see that the new high tech companies whether in china or the united states all those companies simply monopolize those profits they re huge companies in 10 years in 15 years or even in a few years time just think how fast they ve accumulated wealth i m not advocating an egalitarian society but the thing is the tech revolution is breaking new ground every day and how can we manage globalization how can we make society cohesive and harmonious you need to have a very serious sort of thinking about bridging that gap between the rich and the poor james chau china has copied the economic success of the developed countries and even innovated far beyond that how does china now not copy the gaps in income in social justice in access to basic services that we see in those countries there is already a gap emerging in china that s one of the so called symptoms of success how can it rein that back in and create a future that you say should be more balanced and more equal and happy he yafei i will not say that china has copied a system from western nations i think what china did with reform and opening up almost 40 years ago is to try taking a market economy as something china can use combined with what we are very good at that is a visible hand by the government so the two hands the invisible hand of the market and the visible hand of the government are well matched for china you can call it a chinese economic development model some people don t like it but as president xi has said what china has achieved with this model on its developmental road is something maybe for other developing countries not to copy but to use as an alternative because in the past the economic development model the economic growth model was well defined by neoliberalism by the washington consensus a set of ideas that was always fixed it doesn t matter what your domestic economic development level is or what the economic situation you have is those don t matter to them they ll give you the same formula the same recipe you have to follow that otherwise you won t get loans from those countries or even from the international monetary fund the facts have proved that the model really doesn t work at least not universally so china has tried its own model and achieved a stunning success that has amazed the whole world it shocked the world that such a populous socialist country under the leadership of the communist party of china that a strong government combined with a market mechanism could achieve so much within such a short period of time you mentioned also that china did not forget that social justice is equally important otherwise whatever you are going to do economically to drive your economic growth forward you will not get popular support you re going to have a divided society that builds up anger builds up frustration and eventually disrupts economic growth so china s efforts are at a different level of government nationally aiming to help poor people to have sustainable development to eradicate absolute poverty and have balanced domestic economic growth we all know in coastal areas shenzhen guangdong zhejiang shanghai these are the more developed areas in china but you have less developed areas or regions in china so internally there is also a balance you have to find fortunately we have a very strong central government that has enjoyed support by the people internally we can transfer resources for instance the tax paid by shanghai or the surplus shanghai has can be used by the central government to help those poorer areas to maintain what we call lucid water and lush mountains a healthy ecosystem these regions couldn t develop manufacturing from ground zero with contamination and everything as we did at the very beginning of the opening up and reform we cannot follow that we cannot copy that in these regions so you have to look at china s economy and economic growth from a national perspective james chau ambassador when i think of china i think of course about some of the great institutions especially around culture but also of an increasingly smart driven society for example household appliances cellular technology innovations in medicines global health and much more he yafei well this is a digitalized world a connected world you never could have imagined 10 or 20 years ago the devices we use so this is really an innovative new era we enjoy lots of benefits brought about by new technologies on almost a daily basis china is very much into the tech revolution it feels an acute distance between itself and developed countries in terms of technology or core technology we know we have lots of work to do it takes time it takes investment for years to come r d spending is now 2 percent of china s gdp and it s increasing but again when we put it in the u s china relationship in that context the u s recognizes certainly that china has a right to develop itself technologically but it tends to view china s tech progress as a threat james chau but why is that i mean if technology enhances and improves billions of lives from whatever country it was innovated in and often together with others why do you think people are worried should they be he yafei they should not worry about china s tech progress you re right technology s progress will benefit everyone also it needs both upstream and downstream and all countries in the full circle to make it work the united states worries because it sees china as a strategic competitor if china gains ground or catches up with it technologically the superiority the u s has enjoyed in that field which has supported its hegemonic position in industry can be or will be eroded if not replaced by china it feels i would say that s a pretty biased assessment of what china has done i think they have mistaken china s tech progress as ambition for geopolitical rivalry with the united states which is not true for china to develop itself from a manufacturing center to a more combined service and manufacturing economy its technology has to improve china will eventually move up in the global supply chain with new technologies but it takes time i believe the gap between the u s and china is pretty wide for the time being but china is trying to catch up the u s should not be worrying too much about that for instance there is a chipmaking company in the united states that sells 50 percent of its chips advanced ones to china for consumption to put in smartphones computers etc and then sell them in the world fifty percent is in china but if you include what is used by apple apple phones ipads etc that percentage would be 60 percent if that market goes away and some extreme conservative people in the united states are indeed advocating a tech decoupling of china and the united states then those chips will not come to china china will have to seek other sources of supply maybe from samsung in south korea but in that case if the chinese market is lost that chipmaking company in the united states would simply collapse james chau the u s china relationship has often been portrayed by the leadership of both countries over the last 40 years and more as not only one of politics and economics but a relationship that ultimately is underpinned by people there seem to be a lot of different understandings of what young chinese are like today how would you describe to an american what the modern young chinese living in the big cities are today he yafei the young people in china and the young people in the united states share much more than our old generations did recent survey data in the united states show that the younger generation there has a better view a more favorable view of china compared with the older generation 50 years of age or older the younger people are more internationalist they live in a digitalized world in a connected world i know they may have studied in the united states and u s students may have studied in china i am teaching a course at peking university i have students from all over the world many of them from the united states i believe this cultural exchange breaks down cultural barriers for people to have more exchanges and more contact is extremely important james chau what do they ask what do young chinese students ask you as their teacher today he yafei my students are mostly foreign students we have a few chinese what they say in general is that they want to understand china better they want to understand the u s better because after 40 years of the formal bilateral relationship from 1979 to this year we are in a new era china is not the china of 40 years ago the u s is not the united states of 40 years ago and the world has changed so we are facing a totally new world james chau does that excite you even though you ve laid out your concerns about a world that is rapidly changing and sometimes dangerous as well are you ultimately excited about the possibilities he yafei it both excites me and terrifies me i think the young people are in a better position to have a fresh look to reevaluate reassess what is china now how should we view china how should we view the united states how do we look at the world today what has happened what has changed should we change with the world i mean the bilateral relationship 40 years ago has some supporting basis or elements of strategic consideration that were unique to that time james chau what s unique to this time he yafei what s unique to this time is we all live in the same world well actually we are in the same boat we re really entangled intertwined our economies are intertwined our lives are intertwined our finances are so entangled with each other so if you get better i ll get better simply speaking james chau and where they have got better and pulled everyone else along was only a couple of years ago when they pushed the climate agreement well over the line in paris in december 2015 he yafei when they see that the world has changed or see other people progress economically and gain more influence especially china they see a world change that is not favorable to the u s anymore or not so highly favorable even as the u s garners many more benefits than others from the global governance system they believe this is not business as usual they need to work harder they need to have a different way of looking at people to look at things so that we can work together because in today s world in this interconnected world nobody no country can develop in isolation james chau there are attempts though to contain countries like china even though it will continue to develop you ve warned that no one can develop in isolation but what about when isolation happens he yafei i think attempts have been made already to try to decouple china from the united states technologically economically it s impossible i don t think it s going to work for the united states china has made very clear that we want to continue to grow along with united states we are very good partners we re partners we re reliant on each other and we will grow together not at the same speed but we will benefit much more if we work together if we work against each other not only will the two countries eventually suffer but it might lead us onto a path of confrontation which would be a disaster it would disrupt world economic growth james chau what happens when one of them opts out the united states has signaled clearly that it will withdraw from the paris climate agreement even though that process requires a number of years at the same time private sector ceos said they re going to step in city mayors as well is there a way for china to continue fulfilling this commitment and perhaps even more as climate change has really emerged as the underpinning issue to guarantee survival not only of the human race but the planet he yafei with 40 years of globalization under our belt we see that china has benefited from this process and become part and parcel of the global supply chain and we firmly believe the current system probably is the best though it might need some modification as for the governance system we should not overthrow it or throw the baby out with the bathwater for instance the wto is the one thing we need to make reform possible to adapt to the new world we have the purpose is the facilitation of free trade and free investment in trade disputes you should not go to a trade war to solve them as that s an impasse a dead end and you talk about global commons as with climate change we live on the same earth there is only one earth so when you adopt or consider domestic policies to protect the environment to do away with environmental degradation you have to think globally that s why china has made it very clear that whatever happens we will of course welcome the u s back to the paris accord china will continue to play a leadership role james chau ambassador you ve talked about how china is going to stay committed to a sustainable future whether it be through the climate agreement or a combination of mechanisms what about trade this relationship this trade and economic relationship has often been seen as the stabilizer for the united states and china in their actions and interactions over the past four decades what about now it seems the rock somehow doesn t seem as stable as before he yafei you re right what china has learned from the past four decades or so is that trade or global free trade is a driving force of economic growth without trade or if trade is limited the opportunity for economic growth is limited of course now trade is not only the trading of physical goods you have lots of trading done by digital means as well as services and now of course there is a combination with the internet which is easily available to everyone with computers so powerful that even people in remote corners of china and other places can be part of the trading system so china is very much determined to maintain a global free trade system james chau we tend to think although in terms of borders and regions as you just described we think in terms of china the united states or continents of europe and asia and north america and latin america and the exciting emerging markets in africa for example do we need to become more nuanced in the way we look at the world and will this approach help both parties find a way past or around the current stumbling blocks he yafei that s why china has proposed that trade should have no tax when you have no tax for trading you break down all the barriers to trade whether physical by boundary or some other invisible barrier but global trade now can be done intra country intra region and also globally it s more globalized you can now imagine placing an order for food from latin america and having it arrive two days later on your doorstep so it s really a globalized world we re living in that s why china benefits so greatly from trade china is not promoting exports only because it has benefited from an export oriented economy not anymore i ll give you two figures one is from 2008 when china s net exports accounted for about 9 percent of its gdp so it was very much an export reliant economy by 2018 it was 1 percent this year if you look at the shanghai international import expo china has overtaken the united states as the largest consumer market in the world james chau but should the world be worried about that as it is about chinese technology or should it see this as a boon for all he yafei it s a boon a good opportunity because this is the biggest market the united states and china are the two biggest markets people benefit by selling things to these countries then people will get richer in other less developed countries and in turn that will make the whole world well off and you expand the belt and road initiative has been thought out along these lines build up infrastructure help developing countries improve their sustainable development help industrialization expand the middle class ranks then you know they will import more dand export more with infrastructure so we re thinking not of two silk roads only if you expand it it s a global market james chau ambassador he when i look at the u s china difficulties in their trade and economic relationship i m not so much worried about two governments and two national economies i think about small producers small farmers small suppliers owners of small businesses and not only in these two countries but around the world what do you say to them can they look to a sustainable future with these two economies given the way they interact and the realities of what they re facing now he yafei i m still cautiously optimistic about trade whatever name they gave to this china u s trade dispute or trade war it s going to end somehow because a severance of trade between the two biggest trading nations would be a disaster not only to the two countries but to small producers in other places of the world if we cooperate we can settle trade disputes one way or another but you cannot and should not try to change the economic structure or economic system of the other side you should not politicize trade issues to make a geopolitical issue because you are going to hit a wall my humble advice is that the two countries need to think very seriously about how we can better facilitate trade to help both nations not to put up new barriers that hinder further progress on trade james chau finally we live in a world and on a planet that is not limited to trade and economy one that has the beauty of the environment but also the challenges of climate change challenges of history and poverty and a future that needs to be sustainable underpinned for example by the sustainable development goals what s going to make a livable future for all of us he yafei i think the un initiative on the 2030 sustainable development goals or sdgs are a good starting point because we cannot have everybody become a manufacturing center some places are best reserved for pleasure you know beautiful scenery as i say with lucid water and lush mountains places people would like to go to relax and enjoy themselves but in the grand scheme of things the countries that maintain a beautiful environment need to be compensated and one thing we have been working on and i think it has been going into practice is a carbon emissions market those places should be compensated for not emitting carbon they should also have a decent reward system if this country is manufacturing much more than others you pay to buy those carbons carbon emission quotas as a start so that we can maintain a balance not encourage competition whatever your basic economic structure or your geographical location you need to take into consideration the domestic conditions you have and start working from that but you also need to have an international system an international mechanism to offer rewards and punishments to go with it james chau ambassador he i think all of us look forward to achieving a sustainable future thank you very much he yafei thanks a lot
it s difficult to believe that barely a year has passed since the green new deal dropped with a bang into us political conversations what started as a bare bones policy sketch from the newly elected representative alexandria ocasio cortez has now become the very center of american environmental activism journalists activists and academics have responded with a raft of books that seek to explain the promise and potential pitfalls of the green new deal idea here are four new books that illustrate why many us activists have come to see the green new deal as one of the best ways to address the climate crisis on fire the burning case for a green new deal by naomi klein simon schuster 2019 do you know anyone who could use a box set of author activist naomi klein s columns essays and speeches maybe your mom an erstwhile armchair liberal galvanized by donald trump s election who is now spending her nights working with indivisible or perhaps a teenage nephew who joined the historic september 20 climate strikes and is looking for new ways to get involved in the climate justice movement or say a roommate who is only now realizing the scale of the environmental crisis and is peppering you with constant updates about fires in the amazon rising sea levels and the disappearance of birds and insects if so then get yourself to your favorite independent bookstore and buy your friend or loved one a copy of klein s latest book on fire the burning case for a green new deal klein who is a partisan of the climate justice movement and a chronicler of it has been a leading voice in progressive politics for 20 years and on fire provides an essential dose of historical context such perspective is a bracing antidote to the amnesia that characterizes so much of the mainstream media for all of their pretense of sophistication many reporters seem unable to remember much beyond what has happened since the last 30 second commercial break klein performs an important public service then in delivering the long view we are part of a long and complex collective story she writes toward the end of the book by looking decades backward and forward simultaneously we are no longer alone as we confront our weighty historical moment because there is nothing more disorienting than finding yourself floating through time unmoored from both future and past exhibit a and the axis on which on fire spins is the proposed green new deal when newly elected representative alexandria ocasio cortez floated the idea of the green new deal last december many members of the national media treated the proposal as if it had sprung straight out of aoc s forehead like a kind of policy laden athena as klein carefully details in a 53 page introduction the principles values and political strategies that form the green new deal have in fact been bubbling among the green left for years the green new deal s roots up approach to the climate crisis is not itself new klein reminds us this kind of climate justice framework as opposed to the more generic climate action has been attempted locally for years what made the aoc proposal seem new klein argues was its timing the idea for an equity based economy wide environmental transition exploded into the public consciousness because a critical mass of people had finally come to recognize the emergency of the climate crisis there is a different quality to that urgency now because it just so happens that we are all alive at the last possible moment when changing course can mean saving lives on a truly unimaginable scale klein famously has been among those who have laid the intellectual foundations for the green new deal on fire allows readers to see how exactly that foundation was constructed brick by brick while readers who have closely followed klein s writing may find some of this compendium redundant it succeeds by offering a glimpse into the mental machinations of a thinker working out ideas in real time take for instance klein s acceptance speech for the sydney peace prize prepared and delivered just days after trump s presidential victory that hot take on a hot planet has some lines you d expect from klein there is no climate change breakthrough without justice along with some flashes of real prescience we can and must take the profits from the dying days of fossil fuels and spend them on climate justice a line that seems especially oracular as the tort lawsuits against the carbon barons pile up on fire is meant to be a kind of organizers backgrounder briefing for the green new deal the book ends with an 11 page capsule case for the proposal and in that it succeeds but klein is most fiery when she aims her prodigious critical powers at the political opponents of the green new deal her diagnostic of the specter of eco fascism is especially trenchant an important warning about how the stresses of an overheated planet could if things go badly lead to what she calls climate barbarism in the rough and rocky future that has already begun what kind of people are we going to be klein asks will we share what s left and try to look after one another or are we instead going to attempt to hoard what s left look after our own and lock everyone else out one quibble at times klein s exhortatory prose slips into the passive voice there are many more connections to be drawn there are plenty more connections to be made there is a grand story to be told here about the duty to repair but who is going to make the connections and tell the story perhaps the imprecision is just a function of a writer working on an impossibly tight deadline but maybe it s calculated klein s strategic way of avoiding a royal we when the responsibilities for rising temperatures depend on one s national citizenship class and age or it could be and this is just a guess that the passive voice and the absence of a subject is a deliberate if subtle way of suggesting that the author herself doesn t know who will do this work or how exactly it will be done the future thankfully remains unfinished who knows maybe the person who will play the role of subject to tell the stories and make the connections will be some reader who with on fire is discovering the ideal of climate justice for the first time jason mark the case for the green new deal by ann pettifor verso 2019 several months before alexandria ocasio cortez became the youngest woman ever elected to congress a member of her campaign team approached a london economist named ann pettifor to ask for advice over a decade earlier as the global economy was collapsing pettifor and a group of other environmentalists and economists had developed what they thought was a quite sensible plan to restore the global economy and fix climate change all in one fell swoop they released it in july 2008 under the name a green new deal two months later the economy tanked even more the global investment firm lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy leading to a 700 billion government bailout which left no money for any new deal green or otherwise this only proved the points that pettifor and her collaborators had made in their report and in her new book the case for the green new deal pettifor makes it again you can t fight climate change without fixing our current global economic system as she puts it in her introduction financial deregulation had in our view facilitated the creation of almost limitless credit with this credit boom have come irresponsible and often fraudulent patterns of lending creating inflated bubbles in assets such as property and powering environmentally unsustainable consumption we were also clear that the high real rates of interest had driven the need for excessive rates of return on investment necessary to repay costly debts hence the compulsion to strip the forests empty the seas and exploit labor in order to generate the returns needed to repay debts if you look at that quote and think wow this is going to be a wonkish book you are absolutely correct it s been a long time since i read this much about john maynard keynes nixon s dismantling of bretton woods or franklin delano roosevelt and the end of the gold standard but the case for the green new deal is also a quick read about as long as a generously sized pamphlet and written in a clear amiable style a month after she was first sworn into office alexandria ocasio cortez and senator ed markey d ma released a resolution that outlined what their own version of the green new deal would actually look like pettifor who also helped ocasio cortez frame the how to pay for it section of her version post victory seems delighted to see these ideas catching on again across the pond where franklin delano roosevelt once worked to pass legislation that would not only stabilize the economy but landscapes like the dust bowl that had been devastated by unrestrained financial speculation the civilian conservation corps founded as part of the green new deal was responsible for over half the reforestation done in the history of the united states what still distinguishes pettifor s thinking about the green new deal is the way that it tackles not only the climate crisis but also the financial system that helped create it you can t deal with one without dealing with the other pettifor said recently in an interview you can t have a capitalist carbon belching economy or delusions of exponential growth and believe you can achieve ecological targets within that we argued that finance economy and the environment are integrated and that you need a joined up policy that deals with all three when i studied the history of roosevelt s new deal i saw how he did the same thing he met the challenges of unemployment and economic collapse fixed the dust bowl and had to subordinate the financial system to the interests of the democratic state roosevelt studied history and economics in graduate school but he later said of that time everything i was taught was wrong pettifor makes a persuasive case for taking a similarly contrarian look at the economic theories that might look good in a textbook but haven t done well by the biosphere that we literally depend on to survive heather smith the green new deal by jeremy rifkin st martin s press 2019 can the levers of industrial capitalism be pulled in response to a climate crisis that capitalist industry and its most zealous ambassadors precipitated in the first place in what way will the radical transformation of industrial economies to draw emissions down to zero play out across demographics of class and privilege can these transformations benefit all in a just transition so no one is left behind these are just some of the complex and essential questions that a national dialogue around a green new deal has the potential to catalyze and ultimately answer unfortunately jeremy rivkin s spirited but flawed the green new deal why the fossil fuel civilization will collapse by 2028 and the bold economic plan to save life on earth does more to flatten those questions out while leaving others altogether unanswered to be sure the book is full of concepts for what a green new deal could be all of which are delivered with unflappable optimism we can use all the ideas and optimism we can get these days but rivkin s prescriptions are at times based on premises and assumptions that get deployed as fact while eliding their inherent puzzles and problems that s where rivkin s project admirable as it is starts to get into a bit of trouble according to rivkin there have been not one but three industrial revolutions since the 19th century the first was driven by steam powered printing the telegraph and the abundance of coal and the second driven by centralized electricity the television and cheap oil among other industrial developments we are now in a third industrial revolution rivkin argues one that is driven by a digitized communication internet and a renewable energy internet that is transforming societies and economies around the world in this third industrial revolution he finds a prescription for a green new deal that not only can decarbonize economies in time to avert global climate catastrophe but is doing so already internet companies are decoupling data centers from fossil fuels he asserts the national electric grid is moving away from a fossil fuel based centralized system in the new system every business neighborhood and homeowner becomes a potential producer of electricity sharing their surplus with others on a smart energy internet that is beginning to stretch across national and continental masses he writes this third industrial revolution he predicts will force the collapse of fossil fuel capitalism and its hegemonic climate polluting infrastructure by 2028 the date feels arbitrary with little in the way of explanation for why this date and not any other he argues that a combination of a tax on the super rich reductions in military spending ending fossil fuel subsidies and the mass mobilization of pension funds around the world can in part finance this revolution rivkin s ideas for how to finance the green new deal are a start but they aren t new and lack specificity which is a surprise given the granular detail in other sections of the book such as on smart infrastructure his explanation of how global pension funds can be mobilized to fight the climate crisis also leaves more questions than answers meanwhile who exactly are the homeowners and businesses that rivkin is talking about as becoming producers of electricity we don t get a clear sense of whether everyone can participate in and benefit from the ideas laid out here including frontline communities and poor and working class communities where things get more problematic is the way in which rivkin a longtime adviser to the european union and the people s republic of china regularly cites economic and infrastructure advances in those territories as models for a green new deal in the united states we are not totally in the dark and without possibilities he writes there is a way forward a path has been laid across the european union and the people s republic of china in a book that has plenty to offer in the way of well deserved criticism for slow progress in the united states and canada to decarbonize their economies there is no critique to be found here of china the world s number one emitter of greenhouse gas emissions instead in conspicuous flourishes that toe the line of boosterism he regularly cites statistics showing for example that china leads the world in the manufacture and installation of solar and wind technology with the country accounting for more than 45 percent of global investment in renewable energy china is following a similar path with a short term push in natural gas production to accompany the phase out of coal and a simultaneous increase in solar and wind energy production with the goal of eliminating virtually all fossil fuels from the energy mix over the next several decades he writes such encomiums punctuate the book throughout is it possible that the energy companies and power and electric utility companies and for that matter countries around the world are oblivious to the great disruption that has unfolded in the eu and the people s republic of china doubtful the reality is far more complicated a newly released report by global energy monitor directly contradicts rivkin s rosy analysis finding that china far from being a renewable energy leader is driving the continued growth of the global coal fleet while much of the world is moving away from coal china continues to grow its coal fleet the report states the year 2018 marked a milestone for the first time since china s coal building boom began in the 1980s the coal fleet outside of china shrank from january 2018 to june 2019 countries outside of china decreased their total coal power capacity by 8 1 gigawatts gw due to steady retirements and an ongoing decline in the commissioning of new coal plants yet over the same period china increased its coal fleet by 42 9 gw and as a result the global coal fleet overall grew by 34 9 gw as more countries turn away from coal and retire their plants china s continued pursuit of coal is increasingly out of step with the rest of the world and is now effectively driving the ongoing expansion of the global coal fleet a new united nations report backs up that analysis affirming that china expanded not reduced its carbon foorprint last year furthermore a separately released production gap report by leading research and academic institutions has found that the biggest fossil fuel producing nations around the world including china the united states russia india australia indonesia and canada are planning to produce 50 percent more fossil fuels by 2030 than would be consistent with limiting warming to 2 c and 120 percent more than would be consistent with limiting warming to 1 5 c it s unclear why given this bleak data we should accept rivkin s proposition that the fossil fuel civilization is posed to unravel by 2028 or why we should accept the thesis that a path for a green new deal to help bring about that unraveling has been laid across the people s republic of china equally troubling is how rivkin tends to lionize capitalist growth as a solution to the climate crisis he advocates for a kind of utopian capitalism that will unite the world in what he calls an army of little capitalists the pursuit of limitless growth in human industry and the ministry thereof is precisely why we are in the midst of a climate crisis that poses an existential threat to the planet while some kind of blueprint for a green economic and infrastructure revolution will be mandatory for global climate action and the green new deal is one of the most exciting proposals yet for achieving one rivkin maps onto that blueprint formulas of capital prosperity and growth in a way that fails to recognize a fundamental tension between capitalism and the climate crisis is it a tension that more capitalism as opposed to less is able to resolve rivkin dodges the question rivkin does provide a useful chronology of green new deal movements outside the united states dating back to 2007 an important history demonstrating that the idea of a green new deal and the green infrastructure revolution it prescribes was forged long before alexandria ocasio cortez and her allies proposed such a plan for the united states in 2008 for example a green new deal group in the uk published a 48 page declaration titled a green new deal joined up policies to solve the triple crunch of the credit crisis climate change and high oil prices one year later a foundation affiliated with the german green party published a manifesto along the same lines titled toward a transatlantic green new deal tackling the climate and economic crisis those histories demonstrate that movements are already underway to craft green new deal blueprints for the climate crisis we should study and learn from them as rivkin enjoins us to do but real transformational change will have to be equity based and driven by environmental justice not just from studying economic models the green new deal infrastructure is as much about a change in consciousness as it is about a change in infrastructure rivkin writes on that point he surely gets it right jonathan hahn a planet to win why we need a green new deal kate aronoff alyssa battistoni daniel aldana cohen and thea riofrancos verso books 2019 beyond the few pages of principles laid out by representative alexandria ocasio cortez and senator ed markey what would a green new deal actually look like in a planet to win why we need a green new deal journalists and academics kate aronoff alyssa battistoni daniel aldana cohen and thea riofrancos suggest two possibilities we might have a green new deal that seeks to change everything about our fossil fuel powered world without actually changing much at all or we might have a green new deal that s truly green and truly new such a radical green new deal would be unapologetically anti capitalist as the book s title suggests it would also be unapologetically ambitious the book s third chapter is called rebuilding the world and no the authors aren t going to tell you how they plan to pay for it one simple argument structures this book its authors write an effective green new deal is also a radical green new deal they charge that a faux green new deal with a narrow focus on energy policy and elite friendly solutions would suffer the same fate as the doomed 2009 cap and trade legislation watered down until it no longer attracted enough of anyone s enthusiasm to pass who will march for green austerity the authors ask in contrast a radical green new deal rests on viscerally beneficial policies that make themselves felt in ordinary people s lives like building and retrofitting millions of units of public housing making decarbonization compatible with the good life would mobilize political energies to break the status quo of intransigence toward climate action aronoff and company argue even if a faux green new deal got through congress the authors doubt it could achieve the scale and scope of the emissions cuts required at this point in time such legislation wouldn t directly attack fossil fuel companies and other architects of destruction but use market nudges like taxing carbon to steer companies to better behavior on this point the authors paraphrase the journalist david roberts the united states didn t defeat the nazis by taxing factories that didn t produce planes and tanks for the war effort a radical green new deal wouldn t nudge but would embrace industrial planning and public democratic ownership of major sectors of the economy it would euthanize the fossil fuel industry as soon as possible and guarantee jobs to former industry workers at comparable pay it would transform a production and consumption economy centered on cheap carbon rich crap and replace it with communal luxury the authors argue that the outcome of a faux green new deal is likely to be at least 3 degrees celsius of warming while a radical green new deal wouldn t accept more than 2 degrees of warming that s an enormous difference especially for people in the global south a faux green new deal saves the world today but leaves justice and equity for tomorrow a radical green new deal seeks them at once among other methods it could do so by remaking international trade law to safeguard communities where the materials for clean energy are mined breaking the system of intellectual property protections lest rich countries hoard decarbonization technologies and rewriting labor law in workers favor a radical green new deal would institute a four day workweek and job guarantee it would string elegant necklaces of wind turbines across democratically selected hillsides no matter how ambitious you feel when it comes to climate policy a planet to win will probably leave you at some point wondering is this all realistic isn t this just another green dream or whatever as house speaker nancy pelosi put it last february with a future this uncertain no one can say the authors of a planet to win place their faith in the power of collective action to create change just as collective action has won so many other once inconceivable changes from universal suffrage to civil rights to the eight hour workday in the past two years we ve seen how quickly grassroots action can shift what s possible on climate policy in 2016 bernie sanders pushed for a carbon tax now he has a 16 trillion plan to decarbonize the us economy it s not just lefties like bernie according to julian brave noisecat vice president of policy and strategy for the think tank data for progress all of the democratic presidential candidates have moved in a green new deal direction over the past year this kind of collective power the authors write is built strike by strike election by election meeting by meeting potluck by potluck what s most powerful about a planet to win is that it offers visions of change that will keep people passionate about the long difficult struggle for a future on a habitable planet the book casts ordinary people as the primary engines of climate action it celebrates our appetite for change and refuses to paint humanity as too selfish or shortsighted to care about our planet s future just the opposite the authors do not hesitate to identify the people the fossil fuel executives and their accomplices in government and private utilities who are responsible for this mess by 2030 the book reminds us a few hundred rich men are expected to be responsible for nearly 6 million climate and pollution related deaths per year those rich men are our enemies the writers argue we should treat them as such rather than hope they one day come to the bargaining table for serious climate action perhaps most importantly a planet to win helps us imagine life under the umbrella of a radical green new deal we would work less and the work we did would be oriented toward one another and the earth there would be milk white turbine blades rotating slowly on the horizon of vermont s green mountains and more time for eco friendly hedonism like long dinners with friends fueled by organic wine and legal weed there would be ferocious storms but we would be prepared to withstand them and we could prevent worse ones from coming that seems like a life worth fighting for strike after strike election after election meeting after meeting potluck after potluck rebecca stoner

the federal reserve risks turning chinese at worst possible moment in recent years a singular worry has kept washington s economic policymakers awake at night turning japanese few outcomes spook them more than falling into a cycle of stagnation and falling prices that conventional tools can t reverse photo reuters joshua roberts file photo jerome powell could it be that the real threat is turning chinese it s hard not to wonder given the personalities u s president donald trump is tapping for the federal reserve most recently they include judy shelton a conservative scholar making the case against the independence that s made the fed so potent and largely successful these last 106 years the fed remember was designed to be the opposite of an atm for the party in power unlike its chinese counterpart shelton follows trump pick stephen moore a television commentator who lobbied for the job reading more from the people s bank of china playbook than adam smith s thankfully moore s nomination for the fed board went down in flames after past comments including retrograde ones on gender came to light yet he s just one of a number of trump fed picks chosen more for obsequiousness than pertinent qualifications of course trump s fiscal side appointees bear a striking resemblance to the communist party apparatchiks rubber stamping beijing s worst impulses trump s yes man of a treasury secretary stephen mnuchin has shrouded one of the globe s most trusted and transparent institutions in a mao like fog lawrence kudlow spent decades championing free markets now he advises a white house making china seem like a protector of capitalism as america courts developing nationhood yet it s trump assault of the fed that s likely to do the most lasting economic damage trump s fiscal policies wreckage that they are could be addressed by the next president assuming a new one is elected in november 2020 while reducing the 23 trillion national debt achieved on trump s watch or 1 trillion in annual deficits won t be easy it s doable restoring trust in the fed the linchpin of global finance not so much what makes shelton s comments so concerning is that they re not a bug but a feature the way trump has gone after chairman jerome powell is to borrow a word the president has used to characterize his own hand picked fed leader crazy and doesn t asia know it this region holds more u s treasury securities than any other japan and china alone own a combined 2 3 trillion of the iou s powell s team is supposed to be safeguarding trump summoned powell to a nov 18 meeting later tweeting that they discussed negative interest easing and dollar strength all code for the fed needs to cut rates back to zero and beyond of course u s rates are already negative by some measures inflation for example rose at a 1 8 pace in october at a moment when 10 year treasury yields are 1 7 sure powell s team could cut its benchmark rate from the current range of 1 5 to 1 75 but in a world of zero rates from tokyo to frankfurt all that might do is boost stocks at the risk of undermining trust in the dollar that s fine with trump so long as he wins reelection and it s no coincidence that his team is actively seeking voices like shelton s who see the fed s role more as rubber stamp for the white house than credible monetary authority i don t see any reference to independence in the legislation that has defined the role of the federal reserve for the united states shelton was recently quoted as saying by bloomberg she goes on to say that it s not considered inappropriate at the time for everyone to be working together to achieve mutually agreed goals that would benefit the american people this will sound quintessentially japanese to monetary historians since 1999 after all the bank of japan has held rates near or sharply below zero under governor haruhiko kuroda on the job since 2013 the boj went further than ever it cornered the bond market with trillions of dollars of purchases and dominated the stock market via massive stakes in exchange traded funds those moves helped weaken the yen by 30 yet prime minister shinzo abe would love for kuroda s team to go much much further even so abe and his finance minister taro aso have been rather hands off toward the boj in public comments it s allowed the boj to perverse at least some veneer of autonomy and institutional dignity trump s approach has a decidedly total allegiance vibe since picking powell in 2017 trump routinely attacked him as a bonehead and an enemy of the country trump has reportedly even broached the idea of firing powell earlier this month trump tweeted the fed puts us at a competitive disadvantage china is not our problem the federal reserve is adding that u s rates should be below those of japan germany and all others of course trump really is talking about china here even inside his maga bubble trump can see that his trade war is backfiring president xi jinping hasn t been the easy mark trump assumed and farmers and manufacturers in u s states trump needs to win for re election are getting slammed by his china tariffs the fed trump hopes can save the day in the nick of time powell s fed has already eased three times this year and seems unlikely to bow to trump s broadsides for one thing he and predecessor janet yellen worked hard since 2015 to normalize u s borrowing costs cutting rates to zero after the 2008 global crisis was the monetary equivalent of cpr it was never meant to remain in place in 20 years later that s japan s mistake of course by failing to normalize the relationship between money and risk japan continues to stagger along requiring ever more stimulus to keep growth positive it s an error that chinese officials are trying to avoid it remains an open question that they can there s great irony though in trump s china ization gamble by demanding absolute authority over the fed and trying to load it with rubber stamping

president elect of argentina alberto fernandez is supposed to be a centrist with some economic chops he s spent his first few weeks touting left wing political narratives taking place outside of his country instead of focusing on the crisis at home photo by ricardo ceppi getty images getty images argentina s new government takes over in less than two weeks no one knows who is going to lead this country s economy through what amounts to another bankruptcy reorganization but everyone knows what new president alberto fernandez thinks about matters of foreign intrigue in latin america there has been no formal transition team and no formal collaboration with the outgoing government of mr imf mauricio macri to whit there has been no talk of an economic plan foreign relations are more glamorous then the burden of resolving the economic crisis says siobhan morden head of latin america fixed income for amherst pierpont securities in new york the initial plans will have to focus on budgetary stress with re profiling domestic debt and raising export taxes to shore up funds needed to keep the government afloat if fernandez and his ex president veep cristina kirchner introduce populist subsidies then this will complicate negotiations with creditors who are basically keeping the lights on down there it s still early says morden there s no team and no plan and bond prices are still vulnerable to high volatility of the reactive approach from fernandez difficult choices ahead fernandez has his work cut out for him but some emerging market bond fund managers think the imf will protect argentina from another default photo by mario de fina nurphoto via getty images nurphoto via getty images recent headlines suggest fernandez will pick his economic team on december 6 slightly ahead of inauguration day december 10 this should set the seating arrangements for who will be negotiating payments on the roughly 20 billion owed to the imf in two years there has been a lot of speculation about the potential proposals to come from the fernandez team the initial investor meetings with economist and former country imf negotiator in the default of 2003 guillermo nielsen could be moot if fernandez validates a reuters story from october hinting he will bring ex cristina central bank bureaucrats matias kulfas and cecilia todesca both advisors to his campaign on board instead of nielsen wall street bond lords would see this as too much cristina not enough alberto vultures are circling meanwhile the imf said their new mission chief would be venezuelan economist luis cubeddu a man billed as an expert on alternative solutions to emerging market economic crises i really think argentina is going to end up being the best performing bond market over the next 12 months says jan dehn head of research for the ashmore group in london ashmore has around 95 billion in assets under management the market is pricing in a 60 haircut or a default if fair value on argentina s bonds are 70 and they re trading at 40 you can nearly double your money if the imf deals she s baaa aaack argentina s new vice president cristina kirchner she has been put in charge of foreign policy so far foreign policy has been all that s come out of buenos aires since she and fernandez beat mauricio macri in the first round photo by amilcar orfali getty images getty images before leaving office macri became more like kirchner than himself he capped prices installed currency controls that gave rebirth to cristina s wildly popular mercado azul a parallel peso market and spooked investors in other words he became like every other argentine president since the turn of the century and probably farther back macri is now a non existent political force it s the fernandez kirchner show now and so far the stars of the show have been chilean leftwing activists breaking public transportation turnstiles evo morales whom they believe was the victim of a coup and former brazilian jailbird president luiz inacio lula da silva they ve been getting the praise and the attention fernandez s first trip abroad was to mexico apparently to convince president andres manuel obrador lopez amlo to join the emerging puebla group an alliance of former left wing leaders gunning for conservative governments claiming the woes of inequalities can only be remedied by their leadership and calling election losses examples of their party s political persecution amlo wisely declined his invitation as it would be viewed as anti trump mexico s most important and relevant partner some former mexican presidents are members grupo de puebla no thanks president of mexico andres manuel lopez obrador reportedly told argentina s new president during a recent visit photo by hector vivas getty images getty images the last government job fernandez had was as chief of staff from 2003 to 2008 the guy in charge of getting things done for two presidents one of them being cristina he was her subordinate now his rhetoric sounds more like hers with argentina investors willing to believe that fernandez is just going along for the ride and will get going on the economy next month hopefully when the staff announcements come and the plans become clear it will have been worth the wait and there will have been some evident design behind why it took so long says kevin ivers vice president of the dci group in washington d c problem is we measure everything fernandez has been saying against everything he has not the doubts become harder to suppress wall street investors holding argentina know that the imf does not give haircuts on loans but will extend maturities likely taking them out to 2025 and possibly beyond if so bondholders buying now in the secondary market will be better off than the ones that bought argentina s bonds in the first few years of the macri government the imf is all that matters right now a modest haircut on bonds and an extension of the imf loan is the base case that will at least keep them in the capital markets says james barrineau a bond manager for schroders in new york

buyers tax is no excuse to back out of a home purchase that s the ruling from the ontario court of appeal after one buyer withdrew her purchase after the toronto area housing market cooled in 2017 when the foreign buyers tax was announced the buyer had argued that the tax created a drastic unexpected change in circumstances therefore relieving her of her contractual obligation but the court disagreed and ordered her to pay more than 600 000 the difference between the price she agreed to pay and the much lower price the seller ultimately received from someone else real estate buyers take

cheaper to implement than other emissions reducing regulations and also lead to the greatest economic gain ecofiscal s findings follow a united nations report that said greenhouse gas emissions hit

gaining sales momentum in our maryland and pennsylvania markets during the third quarter and we also began seeing the benefits of capacity upgrades in our recently acquired arizona business said

performance improvement in the coming quarters especially given the positive demand trends and patient enrollment growth we re experiencing across most of our operating footprint dr kingsley continued we believe that our two recently opened green goods retail dispensaries in pennsylvania will serve as an immediate catalyst for growth during the fourth quarter and increasing sales of our branded
