when gloria álvarez gets paid in mexican pesos she converts whatever she can into guatemalan quetzales coauthor of the populist deceit she knows her latin american history and she observes it repeating in mexico under president andrés manuel lópez obrador amlo within a nation mired in corruption and crime the bank of mexico has in recent years been relatively responsible and stable at least by regional standards mexico suffered severe currency crises in the 1980s and 1990s however the government s consumer price index indicates inflation below 10 percent for the entire 21st century that will change since amlo has promised the moon for his socialist electoral coalition the central bank will come under enormous pressure to finance his broad and destructive agenda which is already taking a toll wheels in motion for train wreck even before taking office on december 1 2018 amlo cancelled a 13 billion airport project for the capital city that was one third built he signaled regime uncertainty and triggered investors to flee and vote with their feet as reported by bloomberg he has attempted to crack down on fuel theft by you guessed it turning off pipelines throughout the country without giving much thought to the exercise this generated shortages and time consuming lines the lack of readily available gasoline has also stalled airports rather than apologize and backtrack amlo blamed drivers for filling up their tanks too much something any rational person would do when supplies are lacking with shades of venezuela s hugo chávez his attitude is that he can say and do whatever he wants and simply deflect responsibility the pipeline fiasco was just a warmup for his economic illiteracy and authoritarian instincts if he follows through on his campaign promise and freezes gasoline prices for three years you can expect chaos in mexico álvarez is hardly the only one to notice the ominous danger to free enterprise that is amlo the central bank has lowered growth forecasts for the next two years and cited concerns over sovereign debt ratings on monday the state owned oil firm pemex suffered a standard and poor s credit downgrade to bb from b which means it is a single level out of 17 above major future uncertainties that came in the wake of a fitch double downgrade to bbb and national outlook change to negative from stable pemex lost 7 6 billion in 2018 bringing its debt to 106 billion and suggesting a bailout may be necessary meanwhile amlo claims the ratings agencies are punishing mexico for the neoliberal policies of his predecessor this hollow pejorative is a rallying cry of socialists in latin america and you can expect amlo to use it more and more his administration is threatening tariffs on the united states and prioritizing union labor rights over finalizing the usmca trade deal central bank will take the heat there are generally three ways to fund government as explained by cato institute economist george selgin taxation debt and monetary expansion when there is not enough political will to tax people directly government officials can try to make up the rest by issuing bonds if too few lenders are willing the central bank can pick up the slack by buying the bonds and expanding the money supply the latter course predictably leads to inflation a higher nominal cost of living and currency devaluation cash holders and fixed income earners suffer a decline in their real purchasing and pay what amounts to a stealth tax there is a familiar pattern here one which has led to argentina s present currency crisis the peso has lost more than half of its value in the past year relative to the u s dollar specific ingredients contribute to the resort to monetary expansion they include 1 an expanded state necessitating greater spending 2 a weaker economy and lower tax revenues and 3 declining international confidence the second and third compound each other in a downward spiral and push governments to rely ever more on the inflation tax external shocks such as decreased demand for exports can also amplify an already vulnerable situation a northern irish finance student and blogger louise burke notes that spiked oil prices triggered mexico s default in 1982 just as other latin american nations went into recession however the mexicans suffered worse than others because of unsustainable spending and trade manipulation known as import substitution avoiding a repeat of history steve hanke of johns hopkins university believes the temptation to print deficits is often too great for latin america s central banks in most cases he favors doing away with their currencies and adopting a relatively sound one out of their reach as ecuador and panama have done with the u s dollar the next best alternative is a currency board which subjugates central bank activities to price stability via a peg to a foreign currency guatemala also took the wise move of prohibiting all loans from the central bank to the state you can imagine how popular these strategies are for politicos with pet projects amlo for example wants an 8 billion mayan train to archeological sites revealing his capacity for fantasies he has promised neither more debts nor more taxes mexico s national debt grew 400 percent between 2007 and 2017 and it continues its upward trajectory towards 1 trillion so how he plans to turn that around remains to be seen raising the minimum wage and handing out 2 6 million university scholarships for unemployed young people push in the opposite direction the mexican economy and the peso hang in the balance over whether amlo carries out his platform early signs suggest he will and mexicans are already feeling the destruction fergus hodgson is the

washington the latest report from the international monetary fund s article iv mission to liberia has painted a rather bleak outlook for liberia s economic future liberia s economic situation is challenging and strong policy actions will be required to maintain as favorable an outlook as anticipated at this time last year the team noted in its report released friday the imf team led by mika saito visited monrovia from february 25 march 8 to conduct discussions for the 2019 article iv consultation with liberia and held discussions with president george weah speaker of the house of representatives bhofal chambers minister of finance and development planning samuel tweah governor of the central bank of liberia nathaniel patray minister of commerce and industry professor wilson tarpeh other senior government officials private sector representatives and development partners the team thanks the authorities for their collaboration and fruitful discussions in its report the team reported that macroeconomic stability has proved elusive despite improved revenue collection in the first half of fy2019 while the fiscal stance has loosened significantly without central bank borrowing financing a sufficient level of public service provision will require policies to prioritize and improve the composition of expenditure enhance its efficiency and expand the resource envelope article iv team international monetary fund said the report with accommodative monetary policy meeting fiscal needs the exchange rate depreciated by 26 percent over the year and inflation accelerated to 28 percent at end december this is detrimental to the living standards of the most vulnerable liberians who earn and spend primarily in liberian dollars and threatens the success of the pro poor agenda growth for 2018 is now estimated at 1 2 percent while the forecast for 2019 on current policies has been revised down to 0 4 percent from 4 7 percent the team reported that discussion with the authorities centered on the policies required to address the current situation and promote strong noninflationary growth over the medium term and noted that the commencement of sales of central bank bills supplemented by the introduction of the standing deposit and credit facilities in the interbank market represent major milestones in modernizing the monetary policy framework with the appropriate preconditions firmly in place a timely reduction of the rate of inflation to single digits appears possible of the necessary preconditions the most critical is that the government refrain from borrowing from the central bank the team noted the imf mission recommended that the budget for fiscal year 2020 be based on realistic estimates of the resource envelope giving ministries and agencies a reliable estimate of the actual resources that will be available to them is critical to improving the quality of public services even if this represents less than the amount budgeted in the past without central bank borrowing financing a sufficient level of public service provision will require policies to prioritize and improve the composition of expenditure enhance its efficiency and expand the resource envelope the mission recommended that the authorities pursue the envisaged reforms including excise tax tax exemptions and compliance increased uncertainty and volatility in the external environment argues for further measures to safeguarding the foreign exchange reserves of the central bank article iv team international monetary fund the mission noted that productive spending is being crowded out by a wage bill including discretionary allowances that totals about two thirds of government funded expenditure this is not a new issue it has been a characteristic of the liberian economy for a number of years however as grants and other external assistance decline this is no longer a tenable situation freeing up resources in an equitable manner for pro poor development will likely require effective actions to reduce the share of government resources devoted to this budget item the mission said improving the efficiency of government spending will be key and stressed that policies should aim at improving the monitoring accountability and transparency of spending intensifying actions to improve governance and fight corruption including through rigorous adherence to existing procurement rules would also be effective regarding the investigative reports by the presidential investigative team and by kroll associates the mission stressed that the findings point point to a need for substantial improvements in operational policies guidelines and compliance according to the imf team revenue reforms have considerable potential to directly expand the resource envelope and facilitate a needed increase in social spending the mission notes the recent finalization of the domestic revenue mobilization strategy the mission noted that productive spending is being crowded out by a wage bill including discretionary allowances that totals about two thirds of government funded expenditure the mission recommended that the authorities pursue the envisaged reforms including excise tax tax exemptions and compliance increased uncertainty and volatility in the external environment argues for further measures to safeguarding the foreign exchange reserves of the central bank the mission noted that creation of a well functioning monetary policy framework would reduce the need for foreign exchange intervention acceptance of greater exchange rate flexibility would help preserve reserve stocks and help absorb external shocks in addition reducing the central bank s operational deficit would be vital regarding the investigative reports by the presidential investigative team and by kroll associates the mission stressed that the findings point point to a need for substantial improvements in operational policies guidelines and compliance we encourage the liberian authorities to take advantage of available support from the international community to make much needed remedial actions in these areas the mission notes the need for significant action to improve the business climate and provide the enabling environment required for private sector led growth removing administrative constraints on imports and prices to boost the level of competition while ensuring quality and safety standards should be prioritized liberia should step up efforts to strengthen governance and anti corruption efforts as envisaged in the government s pro poor agenda as it would create an environment conducive to private sector led inclusive growth

reuters following are five big themes likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the reuters stories related to them 1 time for some voodoo so after three years of pumping 2 6 trillion euros worth of stimulus and cutting interest rates to minus 0 4 percent the ecb has admitted its growth inflation targets remain elusive and those emergency era monetary settings will have to persist for a lot longer the ecb is not alone doubts abound around the world about whether developed economies have enjoyed lasting benefit or been fully repaired by trillions of dollars of bond buying quantitative easing from central banks over the past decade japan has been in this funk for decades the federal reserve is finding normalization of its policy settings difficult of late slowing economic momentum has seen australia canada and sweden turning tail on policy tightening plans all this speaks loud and clear to the current economic policy zeitgeist a raging debate around mmt or modern monetary theory effectively a reworking of monetary theory by the left of the u s democratic party ahead of next year s elections mmt advocates posit that policymakers in countries fortunate enough to manage the world s main reserve currencies should as long as inflation remains as subdued as it is right now just keep interest rates at zero and print money to invest in environment and infrastructure projects with interest rates near zero and inflation structurally depressed they argue that government deficits and debt levels far higher than the sometimes arbitrary limits set by current orthodox policy can be both sustainable and productive in seeding higher and better quality economic growth in the longer term the idea is akin to british opposition labour leader jeremy corbyn s proposal of people s qe a few years back some politicians across europe too especially among italy s populist coalition government have railed against fiscal orthodoxy as strangling growth many have called on the ecb to support debt funded government reinvestment programmes mainstream economists such as larry summers dismiss mmt as voodoo and as mmt balks at the idea that bond and currency markets should continue to be allowed to dictate government spending levels and priorities many financial market economists also oppose the notion story continues but as europe shows no one can argue that tried and tested orthodoxy has really worked expect to hear more about a rethink of economic policy theories like this as may s european parliament election approaches and campaigning gets going for 2020 u s presidential elections 2 breaking point three votes in three days the brexit saga returns with a vengeance on march 12 when prime minister theresa may risks another crushing defeat of the deal she s negotiated with the eu another defeat for may who as of friday had no new concessions from brussels to present to parliament could just reignite fears about an eventual no deal brexit outcome it will also deal a blow to the pound that s rallied in recent weeks as this risk was priced out if may loses the vote lawmakers will get to vote on march 13 and 14 to rule out a no deal brexit and on delaying britain s departure depending on whom you ask agreement to delay will either settle nerves or prolong the unknown a reuters poll of economists predicted brexit to be delayed by a few months with a free trade deal eventually agreed but uncertainty is showing up in currency derivatives markets with one month implied volatility capturing the march 29 brexit date at its highest since mid january the pound too has come off recent highs a buyers strike was december s dismal retail sales report in the united states a one off pause in consumer spending caused by the stock market meltdown or was it the start of a trend that question could be answered on monday when january data is released roughly three weeks later than normal after the partial government shutdown in december and january disrupted the data release schedule the figures will be a key signal about how well the u s consumer and economy are standing up to a worldwide slowdown overall sales are seen edging up 0 1 percent in january after dropping 1 2 percent in december the biggest fall since 2009 several subsets of the series saw an even more alarming decline for instance the so called core measure of retail sales slid 1 7 percent for its largest decline since 2001 even against that bleak backdrop the december falloff in online sales was especially weak in the hitherto booming sector the 3 9 percent decline was the largest since the financial crisis and marked the worst december ever for the nonstore category that stands as a proxy for online sales another month of weakness will confirm the storm clouds are gathering and the stimulus impact is well and truly over slow and slower the message that rang loud and clear from china s annual parliament meeting was stability is paramount which is why the authorities kept growth targets within a broad 6 0 6 5 percent range cut taxes but kept fiscal easing well short of 2015 levels and they emphasized yuan stability as a priority yet reading between the lines one might conclude that to keep growth above 6 percent china needs to be flexible about credit growth and deficit targets but after february s 20 percent plus exports contraction and the sharp imports slowdown it seems a matter of when not if benchmark interest rates will be cut upcoming data on industrial output retail sales housing and credit will also come against the backdrop of speculation about what deal u s president donald trump and his chinese counterpart xi jinping will eventually reach on those all important trade tariffs 5 re run in em the argentine peso in recent days has led emerging currencies in a race to the bottom plumbing record lows others such as the turkish lira and south african rand have followed closely one culprit is the strong dollar which has surged to its highest level since june 2017 but domestic factors are also to blame aside from problematic politics and high inflation turkey argentina and south africa rely heavily on external financing slowing world growth will weigh on such markets prospects turkey and argentina were also clobbered with economic forecast downgrades by the oecd while south africa s economy too has slowed there are signs investment into emerging equities and bonds is starting to slow it all stirs memories from 2018 when a buoyant first quarter dissolved into selling with turkey and argentina getting walloped by currency crises both countries have since taken steps to recover investors will be wondering whether those are sufficient to stop history repeating reporting

nigeria s presidential elections are over on feb 23 the incumbent muhammadu buhari narrowly beat his chief rival business leader and former vice president atiku abubakar buhari s reelection will have big implications for nigeria s energy sector the beating heart of the country s economy thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe and that heart is not entirely healthy nigeria s state dominated oil industry is declining afflicted by systemic corruption starved for international investment and hit hard by weak oil prices oil remains the country s chief source of income accounting for approximately 56 of state revenue and a whopping 85 of export revenue the opec member produces 2 5 million barrels of crude per day but could pump much more under the right regulations and international investment nigeria s decreasing state revenues have closely tracked the fall in global crude pricesft bloomberg the recent elections represented two competing agendas for growth buhari s platform of retaining a nationalized oil industry under the nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc and rival atiku abubakar s vision of selling off aging refineries to private buyers in an effort to liberalize the economy buhari has historically opposed market liberalization publicly and somewhat ironically the president cites corruption risk as the rationale behind this position he also argues that through state control oil profits can be more easily distributed to nascent sectors of the economy behind closed doors however privatization is seen as a threat to the nation s well connected and rich oil elites and their power in buhari s defense corruption is a real problem notably royal dutch shell nyse rds a and spain s eni nyse e have been embroiled in a legal battle since 2011 over an alleged 1 1 billion paid in bribes to nigerian government officials to acquire new off shore drilling rights just last week the dutch public prosecutor s office announced that they are nearing the conclusion of their investigation a parallel case in milan is also about to go to trial this one filed by the nigerian government on the basis that shell and eni are partly responsible for the behavior of corrupt nigerian officials you read that right but with nigeria s economy at a breaking point buhari may be forced to adopt unprecedented liberal reforms to spur economic development africa s most populous nation boasts the world s worst performing stock market and the greatest number of people living in what the world bank calls extreme poverty 87 million nigerians live on less than 1 90 per day since buhari took office unemployment has ballooned from 8 to 23 and inflation has grown now at a painful 14 poor energy infrastructure also means that the continent s largest oil producer must rely on imports to meet its refined petroleum demand and has paid out 5 8 billion since 2017 former vice president abubakar s platform leaned in the opposite direction urging low taxes market deregulation and energy sector privatization as a means to attract foreign direct investment while abubakar has been criticized for graft and corruption during his vice presidential tenure it s hard to argue against his desire to revitalize nigeria s dilapidated oil and gas sector today nigeria is only capable of pumping some 2 5 million barrels of crude oil per day despite sitting on more than 40 billion barrels of proven reserves and its mid stream and downstream infrastructure are arguably in worse shape than upstream production the country s refineries most concentrated in the oil rich niger delta region currently operate at under half of their intended 500 000 barrel per day consolidated capacity in october of 2018 refining capacity dipped below 11 billionaire aliko dangote sees this as a business opportunity his company dangote group hopes to complete construction of a 15 billion refinery outside of lagos to process 650 000 barrels of crude daily this would of course give the billionaire a near monopoly on nigeria s refining sector not necessarily a step in the right direction for market liberalization once completed the dangote refinery will have a capacity of 650 000 barrels per day making it the largest such refinery in africadangote oil refinery company the guardian but at the very least the massive dangote project shows that there is private interest to develop the country s energy infrastructure indeed a growing group of local nigerian oil and gas entrepreneurs now control 19 of oil production and 18 of gas output still private investment is just scratching the surface provided the right backing and incentives nigeria could also be a top global natural gas exporter the country has the 11th largest gas reserves in the world measuring 187 trillion standard cubic feet tcf according to royal dutch shell however only about 25 of those reserves are utilized today like the oil sector poor legal and regulatory frameworks inadequate financing and mismanagement by the dominant national energy companies are to blame it doesn t have to be this way nigeria can still become a model of african energy development if president buhari decides to be a force for good in the country s economy but for that to happen he must loosen his grip on the continent s largest energy sector doing repeatedly what was done in the past and expecting a different

quantitative easing the program of asset buying initiated by the us federal reserve bank in 2008 represents the most profound monetary experiment in the history of the world between fall of 2008 and fall of 2014 three successive rounds of qe quadrupled the monetary base of the world s most used and dominant currency from from less than 1 trillion to more than 4 trillion the fed literally created new money bought treasury debt and mortgage backed debt of dubious character from commercial banks and credited them with new reserves it was a great trick if qe can be done without adverse effects or with few adverse effects it represents nothing short of monetary alchemy h t nomi prins everything we thought we knew about the fed as backstop lender of last resort to commercial banks as hallway

winners and losers what politician or central banker could resist the great deformation stockman david buy new 14 99 as of 01 10 utc details recall how defenders of qe not only argued it was necessary but beneficial paul krugman was among the worst offenders insisting that low interest rates would mitigate any harms from such rapid monetary expansion these defenders dismissed and continue to dismiss what is now obvious since 2008 the us economy has experienced significant asset inflation in equity markets and certain housing markets plus a creeping but steady rise in many consumer prices this is no surprise did it never occur to qe cheerleaders that 1 money market yields might chase money into the stock market or that 2 interest rates might not encourage us businesses households and individuals to get solvent but monetary stimulus like fiscal stimulus is a heady drug for politicians and their central bank enablers once you accept consumption rather than production as the basis for healthy economy creating new money starts to sound like a good idea and if creating money is a good idea why not create a lot of it especially in the midst of an economic crisis in 2008 ben bernanke was at least honest about the radical nature of what the fed had embarked upon he used the term extraordinary monetary policy for the unprecedented expansionary qe program a program he insisted was made necessary by a potentially catastrophic global financial crisis but there were dissenters david stockman for one strongly disputes whether main street needed to save wall street chapter 26 of the great deformation lays out stockman s case against more debt and credit in an already overleveraged corporate landscape not to mention the moral hazard of bailing out investment banks by creating money and of course virtually all austrian economists plus plenty of non austrians loudly opposed qe from the start new bank reserves don t magically create new goods and services in the economy low interest rates discourage capital formation and encourage malinvestment more debt is not the answer for too much debt and why should banks flush with qe reserves lend at all in a shaky economy when since 2008 the fed pays them interest on those excess reserves so here s a modest proposal for the federal reserve officials and a challenge to economists who reject austrian views on qe and business cycles in general return the fed s balance sheet to its pre 2008 level by selling assets and or letting assets mature do this over an identical six year period that mirrors the timeline

president james bullard nearly promised as much back in those quaint days of 2010 the fomc has often stated its intention to return the fed balance sheet to normal pre crisis levels over time once that occurs the treasury will be left with just as much debt held by the public as before the fed took any of these actions so how about it mr powell a real economy operates without ultra low interest

in this wednesday aug 22 2018 photo ships are docked at the port of long beach in long beach calif ap photo marcio jose sanchez for years president trump has been obsessed with trade deficits incorrectly viewing them as a good measure of which countries are winning and which are losing the united states has run a trade deficit for decades thereby designating us a perennial loser in trump s worldview he promised to turn things around by picking a few easy to win trade wars instead by trump s own measure we re bigger losers than ever before the trade deficit just jumped to its largest size in a decade even worse our deficit in goods which trump for some reason emphasizes most just hit its largest level ever there are a few takeaways from this news including that trade was probably a bigger drag on growth last year than previously forecast but the bigger question is this why exactly is the trade deficit expanding when trump promised it would shrink the answer largely though not exclusively has to do with trump s own economic policies to be clear trade deficits whether bilateral or otherwise are not necessarily bad nor are they a sign that we re being somehow cheated by other countries they reflect broader trends in the economy including savings and investment rates small or shrinking trade deficits are also not necessarily a measure of a healthy economy in fact as bloomberg news shawn donnan points out the year the u s trade deficit shrank the most was 2009 which was not exactly a blockbuster year for the economy we were at the tail end of the great recession then and because the economy was bad americans bought less stuff from abroad today the u s economy is healthy with economic growth relatively robust this is partly because of the fiscal stimulus trump has been pumping into the economy through both his tax cuts and federal spending hikes consumers have more money to spend which means they demand more stuff and companies have ramped up their imports to satisfy that demand simultaneously other countries including china and members of the european union have not been doing so hot with the u s economy doing well while other economies are faltering and the federal reserve raising rates the dollar has strengthened making foreign products look cheaper and making our exports more expensive i e less competitive in other countries that too leads to higher trade deficits and it s one of many reasons team trump might want to cool it with the schadenfreude about other countries economic woes advertisement so in some ways then trump s preferred metric of winning is a victim of his own fiscally driven economic success but it s also a victim of his trade policy failures he has picked trade wars the world over with friends and foes alike he has also threatened even more tariffs including an additional hike in tariffs on chinese goods a new national security driven duty on auto imports etc these actions and threats have led to some predictable consequences one is that u s companies have stocked up on some imported goods to beat the tariffs which increases imports in the short run higher imports equal bigger trade deficit another is that other countries have levied their own retaliatory tariffs on our own products most famously red state goods such as soybeans and bourbon so there has been less demand for u s exports lower exports also equal bigger trade deficit trump has pledged that once his brilliantly negotiated deals go through the new north american free trade agreement gets ratified by congress china fully capitulates to all his wildest demands the european union and japan suddenly decide to buy more of our cars etc our balance of trade will turn around there s reason to be skeptical however and not only because some of these objectives seem like fantasies even the ones that look more plausible such as the implementation of the new nafta seem unlikely to move the needle after all the new nafta looks an awful lot like the old nafta plus some language cribbed from the pacific trade pact trump pulled us out of in fact the most significant change in the new nafta deal involves new content rules for autos which are intended to lead to more manufacturing and manufacturing jobs in the united states but as trade experts have pointed out these new rules may be so costly to comply with that they could have the opposite of their intended effect leading manufacturers to source less rather than more content from north america which could mean a boost to auto and auto parts imports which would contribute to you guessed it a wider trade deficit the views expressed here are the writer s and are not necessarily endorsed by the anchorage daily news which welcomes a broad range of viewpoints to submit a piece for consideration email commentary at adn com send submissions shorter than 200 words to letters adn com or click here to submit via any web browser read our full guidelines for letters and commentaries here

changing scenario why change economic investment environment has been rapidly changing in recent past and investors are looking around for better investment opportunity larger consumer market for unfettered flow of products and services and reasonable rate of return on investments investment laws must take these key elements into consideration by creating a conducive climate of foreign direct investment stable economic and political environment and clarity in foreign policy direction are fundamental to attracting external investments currently global market trend is appearing somewhat shrinking with rising protectionism entrepreneurs find operating environment challenging and are confronted with cut throat market economy there are still opportunities if nepal focuses attention to the right source destination markets there is however no automatic flow of foreign money into nepal without pragmatic approaches to dealing with foreign direct investment challenges changes in the proposed investment bill of nepal should take this scenario into full consideration there are competing economies in asia and asean leading the way forward due to continuing trade dispute between usa and china the new trend in foreign investment is shifting towards the south east asia opportunities exist for export market in growing economies and emerging markets but investors exporters need to be smarter cost effective and quality competitive investors are looking for favorable and robust legal regime and more positive business operating environment poor physical infrastructure and connectivity unreliable energy and water supply negative perceptions on foreign direct investments in small and medium size enterprises lack of efficient transportation system and inadequate measures for cross border trading access including export to overseas market are distinguishing characteristics of nepal s industrial environment these factors heavily weigh in foreign investor s decision making this is where nepal falters and has been unable to attract foreign investment under the current foreign investment laws international entrepreneurs are seen moving into new destinations in vietnam cambodia and laos than others in asia and in countries in africa particularly rwanda ethiopia and kenya investors will move to places where they find investments safer and competitive advantages wider market opportunities and stable supply chain setting nepal is an insignificant market in the current liberalized global environment with low purchasing of power of urban middle class nepal is not a highly favorable destination for large industrial establishments government of nepal s policy thus should encourage all investors both non nepali as well as nepalis without prejudice to invest freely in small and medium enterprises smes this can help improve domestic employment balance of payments situation and give sense of economic security nepal government needs to do away with the large list of the areas prohibited for foreign investment from the foreign investment act for attracting external investments in subsistence agriculture and tourism sectors as well what needs to change a large share of nepal s import from india is consumer goods including basic food items this has created a serious vulnerability leading to food and economic insecurity and increased dependency on imports of staple items nepal is vulnerable to volatilizes of all sorts be that in market opportunity or size consumer base accessibility labour political misgivings corruption and faltering governance being the major elements the current investment policy of nepal restricts foreign direct investment on variety of areas contributing to imbalance between consumer demand and supply of agricultural produce protectionist approach to foreign direct investment in small and medium enterprise is one of the major factors contributing to rise in imports of staple food items from india and other household items from china economically active age group also find attractive to migrating elsewhere for employment for livelihood and better wage than available in rural nepal this phenomenon may have contributed to low level of capital mobilization for investment and employment in small and medium size enterprises smes smes are the back bone for stable national economy and government of nepal has not shown required flexibility for foreign direct investment in this area the industrial and business investment environment and managing nation s economy must thus reform with sense of pragmatism and realism with open mind is necessary investment laws relating to foreign investment and technology transfer act and industrial enterprises act both enacted during 2049 1992 are restrictive in investment amounts and contains a long list of areas prohibited for foreign investment list these laws have not spurred high investment contributing to long term sustainable economic growth high capital requirements requirement of rupees 5 billion us 500 million or equivalent is reserved to nepali national may appear to be the limiting factor in foreign direct investments in small and medium size enterprises parallel industrial investment performance of the past decades indicates that if the current trend continue in future industrial development will face even bigger challenges it is necessary to revisit the existing laws now and introduce reforms needs on simplifying regulating measures while getting rid of restrictive measures and then allow foreign direct investors participation in all economic areas nepal is facing a severe problem of rising trade deficit with india for imports are rising disproportionately rapidly while exports have plummeted in recent years imports of food items and petroleum products have increased much more than before this is leading to a situation of economic crisis in view of this excluding defense and national security the draft proposal for foreign investment bill recommends that foreign investment areas should be open to all economic sectors pragmatic reforms could increase foreign direct investment landscape and decrease the trade deficit as well as increase the production of some essential items like food making the country less reliant on the imports of basic items nepal policy institute an independent nepali think tank has made a pragmatic recommendation to the government for encouraging private investors to invest in small and medium size business enterprises smes that will significantly increase the supply of basic consumable items including food expand livelihood and employment opportunities for nepalis enhance economic value of farm products promote the welfare of nepali consumers expand labour intensive activities and efficient utilization of materials and natural resources decrease imports and thus trade deficit increase quality and volume of exports and their access to domestic and foreign markets transfer relevant technologies in agriculture industry and support services increase construction of infrastructure facilities and industrial production establishments change strategy the national planning commission was established during the time of central planning under command economy it was fashionable during the cold war era when world economies were divided into two major political blocks of capitalism and communism both systems have serious shortcomings it is now generally believed neither philosophies can offer equitable solutions to addressing growing economic divides resolving poverty issues and sustaining quality of life throughout all economies this is mainly due to disruptions caused by rapidly advancing and expanding technologies and inability of economies to adapt concomitant changes occurring from speed of development in information technology the government also needs to restructure the national planning commission npc which suffers from several shortcomings it should be revamped with expanded mandate of pro active lead role china has prudently demonstrated pragmatic approach to way forward without surrendering its values and national economic security india is following the suit despite hiccups and sticking to change nepal s economic policy and practice of doing business need pragmatic adjustment to new realism otherwise population of this poverty stricken nation will pay irrecoverable economic price given this and against changing world economic environment political climate and global investment and market trends impacted by innovation rapidly advancing technology and upsurge in automation nepal must show its firm resolve to reforming economic landscape setting new conducive investment and work environment while augmenting institutional capability adapting flexible policy strategy and pro active monitoring and implementation mechanism npc has not met these goals for various reasons the new national authority national economic policy monitoring authority must rise above the call of the day and perform beyond producing planning in papers nepal policy institute recommends 1 re organization of the national planning commission npc with new mandate and a new name national economic policy monitoring authority or nepma this agency should be organized with new spirit of action oriented dynamism and engage into delivery of achievable outputs nepma should be responsible for developing economic policy and monitoring and implementation of investment programs and economic enterprises the national economic policy monitoring authority or nepma should however continue to prepare and guide mega projects of high export potentials in addition to regular policy framework and performance review of implementing and collaborating partners and government and non governmental agencies 1 nepma should assume central role in developing economic policy advising government and implementing pragmatic strategies 2 all foreign investments should be approved and registered by investment board of nepal under one window and approved within seven working days 3 repeal the present investment and technology transfer act and other laws replace itwith a new one reflecting the new realism and programmatic approaches to attract foreign investment while making laws better and more competitive than countries in asia introduce following changes in new foreign direct investment laws as proposed by the nepal policy institute 1 investors should be allowed to invest and own 100 in enterprises including smes except for some areas prohibited for foreign investment such as national and defense security related products and services nepal needs to follow global economic trends taking into the ground realities nepal should therefore have a more liberal investment policy as compared to its two big neighbors as well as asean countries 2 nepal currently ranks at very low level in doing business global business environment index this rank can be improved by addressing restrictive issues related to reforming foreign investment laws 3 in view of the potential for cross border trade with china context belt and road nepal could benefit as a transit country for export utilizing dry port facility export of produces from export processing zone and possible transit supply chain warehousing for third country export 4 approval mechanisms should also be considered for investment in small and medium size enterprise at the provincial level in view of the federal structure of the governance 5 millions of nepali live and work outside of nepal including others of nepali origin people should be allowed to invest in all productive areas of economy 6 current foreign investment and technology transfer act is narrowly focused on foreign currency inflow it is not linked to employment generation foreign direct investment in small and medium size business enterprises should be where feasible tied up with job creation and technology transfer 7 the new national economic policy monitoring authority or nepma should be empowered to review and update annually economic sectors areas for foreign investment develop policy guidelines on investment and regularly monitor implementation of programs and projects 8 banking regulations should be relaxed promoting larger involvement of commercial banks in handling foreign investment and clients this is to separate functioning of banking and market from executive and political interference healthy banking and monetary practices are integral part of creating climate of business confidence and growth in investment market 10 non nepali national nepali diaspora and people of nepali origin should be treated equally in the matter of investment investors need to be allowed for making investments with 100 ownership of enterprises 12 investments should be approved and coordinated by the investment board of nepal under one window within seven 7 working days this will cut bureaucratic hassles from different ministries departments one after another for processing registration and approval of foreign investment 13 enterprise with paid in equity capital less than us 150 000 could be reserved to nepali nationals however if the business enterprise involves transfer of technology and provides direct employment of twenty 20 nepali then a non nepali can invest and own with paid in capital of us 100 000 to generate local employment 14 former nepali citizens and nepal origin individual must have the same investment rights as that of a nepali citizen 15 nepal born former nepali national can own 5 000 square meters of urban land and four 4 hectares of rural land for business enterprise purposes 16 all investments must comply with environmental standards 17 no government agency should be allowed to nullify the provisions granted under terms of foreign investment agreement 18 no investment should be expropriated or confiscated by administrative measures in the operation of foreign owned enterprises 19 investors should be allowed to repatriate foreign currency investment profit from investment principal of any loan obtained during business operations through commercial banks for all banks operate under the rules and regulations of nepal rastra bank 20 dispute settlement should be allowed to conduct outside nepal like singapore switzerlandor u k 21 transfer of foreign technology should be considered as integral part of capital contribution to enterprise 22 imports of machinery equipment plant and advanced technology required to establish and smooth running of enterprise industry should be exempted from import taxes and customs duties 23 enterprises with foreign owned capital and parties to business co operation contract should have the right to autonomy in conducting business enterprise in accordance with the objectives stipulated in the investment license permit 24 investor with foreign owned capital can purchase foreign currency for business purposes from commercial banks 25 non nepali investor and his her family should be issued a minimum period of one year investor visa with multiple entry exit and will not be required to be registered with police as foreigner living in the country section 21 and rule xix the global knowledge convention organized by non resident nepali association nrna held in kathmandu in october 2018 made a wide range of recommendations to the government for reform in areas covering banking finance bankruptcy and insolvency dispute settlement brokerage and wealth management income tax double taxation industrial policy etc should also be considered by the government
by robert gore via straight line logic zerohedge com sat 03 09 2019 the experiment how much longer will the middle class politely tolerate its own destruction a middle class that outnumbers the combined poor and aristocracy is a relatively new phenomenon dating back to around 1900 the rise of the middle class was the result of industrial revolution capitalism it has been one of the most significant and epochal developments in history yet the intellectual reaction for the most part has been to either ignore it or treat it with disdain now the project to destroy the middle class is well under way with unpredictable and uncontrollable consequences that promise to be just as epochal as its creation intellectual condescension towards the middle class is so common it s a cliché what s rare are attempts to go back in history and see things through the perspectives of that despised group and its progenitors the poor in 1800 virtually everyone was poor living under conditions of deprivation and grinding poverty even being wealthy was no picnic present day poverty line americans live better life expectancy was an estimated twenty nine years farming the occupation of most was dangerous backbreaking labor from dawn to dusk most of those so engaged eked out a tenuous subsistence there was no electricity no running water primitive sanitation and health care and none of the machinery gadgets and appliances we take for granted only a few wealthy poets who didn t have to wrest a living from nature waxed euphoric about its joys as the nineteenth century progressed primitive factories mostly in cities began producing goods of better quality in more quantity and at lower cost than had been possible by artisans handcrafting their wares no doubt conditions in those factories were abysmal long hours pittance pay child labor dangerous and filthy conditions and horrible accidents and injuries all that has been well chronicled and dramatized but an important point gets overlooked bad as they were the factories were a better option for those who worked in them than the farms from whence many of them came or they would have stayed there capitalism requires capital and early industrialization provided profits to capitalize more factories further innovation new inventions and industries and eventually the astonishing burst of dynamic energy that became the industrial revolution each new generation of mines factories ships trains farms and other productive assets became less labor intensive produced higher average real wages had lower percentages of child labor and were less dangerous than their predecessors again by present day standards most working conditions were still abysmal but less so than what had preceded them that was the relevant consideration for the millions of people who worked in dickensian conditions it was their best option and better than anything they had previously known the nineteenth century produced more technological and scientific innovation that all the centuries before it combined societies don t go from poor to rich overnight however real world conditions opportunity income wealth health and overall quality of life steadily improved by 1900 life expectancy in the us was 46 years for males and 48 years for females an unprecedented one century increase those who throw rocks at the industrial revolution the period when america approached laissez faire capitalism have to minimize or ignore one simple fact millions of people braved the dangers of travel the uncertainties of life in a new land the difficulties of learning a new language the prejudice and hostility they knew they would encounter the daunting challenges of starting at the bottom and the absence of government giveaways and freely chose to immigrate to the united states sometimes the payoff was huge andrew carnegie really did get off the boat with eleven cents in his pocket cyrus mccormack john d rockefeller thomas edison henry ford and other success stories came from impoverished or modest backgrounds and made multimillion dollar fortunes the self made businessman became the american archetype fueling countless aspirations the emergent middle class was a cohesive force for political stability the immigrants passed their memories of what they had escaped to their children and grandchildren they embraced the reality and the promise of america based on their own fruitful experience life was good and would get even better why rock the boat few noticed the thunderhead on the horizon that thunderhead was hate directed not at america s flaws and weaknesses but at its virtues and strengths the sacrifice hard work thrift and ingenuity that had lifted millions from poverty was condemned as selfishness blind ambition and greed the middle class that didn t exist a century ago was materialistic anti intellectual and spiritually impoverished the unprecedented wealth america was producing was wrong because it was unequally distributed or the most philanthropic and charitable people in history weren t giving enough away you can guess where the hostility came from the intellectuals who found what they peddled commanded little attention or respect and would be rulers in a nation with little desire to be ruled the desire for autonomy to be left alone to be free to make one s own decisions and live one s own life are the benchmarks of well adjusted normalcy the desires to tell or force other people what to do are the opposite wellsprings of hate which are depending on their intensity and quality neurotic sociopathic or psychopathic that the middle class is now fighting for its life reflects two intellectual failures in the late 1800s and early 1900s the intellectuals political class and many of the tycoons were pressing for expanded government the income tax central banking and american interventionism and imperialism the truisms that any expansion of the government s power and resources would only reduce the people s liberty and be funded with money stolen from them was overwhelmed by what s become the standard propaganda coercion is necessary to address some risk danger or unacceptable condition there were no prominent voices connecting the prevalent peace prosperity and optimism with the era s unprecedented personal freedom nor arguing their essential inseparability the other failure most average americans simply couldn t comprehend or even conceive of the hatred directed against them statism whatever its variations is never about doing something for people it s about doing something to them even now with virulent vitriol and hatred on full display much of it is minimized or rationalized by people who should know better the corruption of the middle grounders may run deeper than the statists and the collectivists who at least no longer try to hide their agenda and acknowledge that freedom cannot coexist with the unlimited governmental power they covet when somebody claims that your life is their property they re telling you that they have the right to do with it what they will which includes killing you all manner of statist belladonna reached full florescence in the twentieth century socialism communism nazism fascism welfare statism cronyism kleptocracy kakistocracy and the murder genocide and war have been orders of magnitude greater than anything that preceded it you shall know them by their works the thing that statism does best to people is kill them the record is clear and unmistakable anyone now promoting more of the same is simply evil only unmitigated hatred accounts for the particular antipathy directed towards the middle class their values their prosperity and their predominate race white and religion christianity the middle class being a relatively new phenomenon nobody can say what the consequences of the all out war against it will be it is the bedrock of modern economies and its destruction will take out most of the developed world s productive capacity and consumer markets that doesn t seem to bother the statists how they plan to free themselves from the economies that sustain them is a question they ignore it calls to mind ayn rand s atlas shrugged observation the deaths they desire the most are their own that has to be the true definition of insanity truer even than einstein s repeatedly doing the same thing and expecting a different result to this day nobody can explain the logic behind the bailouts during the last financial crisis and what ensued the world s central banks monetizing massive government debt and pushing interest rates below zero the high and mighty pretend this is all normal but for normal people buying a bond with a guaranteed loss is insane microscopic rates force them against their better judgment into a stock market that s crashed twice since the turn of the century decimating their savings and now sits at historically sky high valuations here is the investment landscape you re supposed to embrace lose money or put it on the pass line and hope the wall street roll of the dice doesn t once again come up craps keep spending money you don t have and inevitably you ll go broke keep making promises you can t fulfill and inevitably you ll break them there are hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of claims on the future out there that have no chance of ever being redeemed yet the pile continues to grow the mathematical outcome is as straightforward and devastating as playing russian roulette with all the chambers loaded obamacare is the latest insane gift from the government that keeps on giving it s an obvious failure but it s a foaming at the mouth murderous pit bull that from some deranged concept of mercy or an appalling lack of fortitude nobody will put out of its misery medical care stands in a long line of industries that malevolence masked as good intentions has destroyed as the middle class watches the america it once knew and cherished collapse and comes to understand why it realizes its head is on the chopping block a bright middle schooler can see that the green new deal will bring the economy to a shuddering stop and plunge many who have managed to escape so far into poverty yet the democrats leading lights rush to praise the imaginary raiment of would be empress ocasio cortez the middle class has always aspired to better things the american dream talk of 70 percent or higher tax rates and wealth taxes capitalizes on hatred of the rich it s open season why work and sacrifice to get rich if the government gets it all take away middle class dreams and you may well be taking away the last thing that keeps them paying their taxes observing the law supporting the troops and police in short everything that from the vantage point of the ruling class keeps them in line what began as a gentle squeeze a century ago has become python like constriction government has drained economic vitality and shuttered opportunity as the once politically stable prosperous and optimistic middle class dwindles a few still reach the upper echelon but most are consigned to creeping poverty blunting the economic consequences with credit and the personal consequences with cannabis alcohol opioids pornography and promiscuity it s only going to get worse as debt grows massive unfunded medical and pension liabilities come due taxes rise economies shrink and promises are broken the ruling class has backed the middle class into a corner shoving them into poverty and vanquishing their dreams amounts to an unprecedented and dangerous experiment aristocratic arrogance condescension exclusivity and isolation add to the combustibility yet they remain steadfastly oblivious to the rising anger

by david haggith let s review this past devilishly whacky week to see if we can divine the way the world is turning and why the markets are churning it was 2019 s worst week in stocks and well just about everything economic all across this crazily spinning planet volatility lifted its head back out of the water like loch ness s monster while the citizenry took flight to treasury safe havens bringing treasury yields down again to the five year s lowest point of the year north korea s rocketman returned to his rocketry and the chinese threw up their hands and ran as far from mar a lago as they could or maybe they just threw up from too much chocolate cake the china syndrome is back most notably all over the world bad news finally moved back to just being bad news even as it arrived in cloudburst after cloudburst gold popped as money dropped and china flopped chinese exports fell 20 outstripping the worst prediction four fold the central bank of the billions of people of china mainlined major yuan jolts into the xi dynasty s tiring economy and yet the sino stock market fell off the mountain taking a full panda bear plunge in one week apparently the nouveau riche chinese ghost city dwellers are wising up to all this easing and just realized talk of more of the same as far as the eye can see simply means the economy is finished more than it means refreshed hope waits on some distant horizon trump talked and china walked the best boast trump could biggly bluster from his tweet blaster was that the stock market would rise again if china would only deal china chose instead to cancel chairman xi s second coming at mar a lago most market makers are saying the chinese trade wars now have more downside than upside markets have priced in trump s repeated wafting of wistful hopes that a deal will be struck any day his twittering about had the lightness of ether this week if it happens that china does sign a grand bargain the market money is already riding on that deal so it won t bring a lot more lift if it doesn t happen on the other hand the table cloth gets pulled out from under the mar a lago gold settings and one can only hope all the crystal doesn t shatter as xi xings away without his chocolate cake central banksters on parade the european central bank joined all other major central banks in twirling away from the tightening it had just promised and rushing back to renewed rounds of easing via mega loans to banks because it got schooled in a hurry to the awakening that it cannot everunwind its balance sheet it made this stunning pivot when reality forced it to admit the european economy is stalling the ecb forecast prerecessionary growth of just 1 1 for 2019 to finish the dance reports came in after chairman draghi s announcement that some ecb thinksters didn t think their central bank downgraded the economy far enough and so the bank that once promised it would do anything to save the franco german empire will return to doing what hasn t worked so far as happened in china this new round of promised profligacy was not greeted with the now customary market ecstasy exasperated european investors dwelled instead on what the ecb s flash reversal revealed about europe s economy and so the old regime returned in which bad news is just bad news it was almost as if exhausted investors felt central bankster draghi s sudden ankle twist indicated central bankers are clueless since only a couple of weeks ago draghi was boldly certain his central bank needed to torque up financial tightness suddenly he and his bankster troop were break dancing on their bonnets in the streets of belgium how appropriate that this carnival took place in the same week as mardi gras in the us speaking of which the fed goose stepped to the same tune singing from sea to shining sea its reiterated message that tightening is over now boston fed head eric rosengren indicated the fed is dead in its tracks saying it could take many meetings before the fed recaptures a sense of where this spinning economy is now going in order to figure out what to do with interest rates it may be several meetings of the federal open market committee before fed policymakers have a clearer read on whether the risks are becoming reality and by how much the economy will slow compared to last year said rosengren in his speech he added that patiently watching is the best policy for now seeking alpha notice the shift to figuring out how much the economy will slow rather than worrying it may start to run too hot which required full blast quantitative tightening up until december these guys know what they re doing the st louis fed head piped in that he was in favor of holding interest rates at the present level with the same focus on how things are falling apart vice chair richard clarida stressed cross currents and head winds are strengthening the dallas fed head harmonized with everyone else substantial growth in bbb and lower rated bonds is indicative of a weakening in corporate credit quality in the u s which sort of reinforces for me why i feel we should be taking no action for some period of time fed governor lael brainard and bank of canada s deputy governor lynn patterson also joined the chorus of cbers singing refrains of a new season of easing patterson said the canadian economy looks like it will be weaker through the first half of the year than it appeared it would be in january and the bank of canada toned down its convictions over future rates hikes so the central choristers sang as the high stepping fed heads joined draghi to spin in the streets of their financial capitals but the citizens watched in stony silence at their odd and globally united parade all this market hopium gave no high anywhere stocks did nothing but fall fall fall which would seem to confirm jerome powell s candidly stated concern last month that people are losing faith in big institutions by which he seemed to mean central banks is there anyone who would ever have thought more rounds of quantitative easing would be less effective this time around because the law of diminishing returns still rules oh yeah me right here all along numbers fell from the sky like rain to cap this capricious week of chaos and carnival one of those once a year flukey jobs reports cruised in under the radar at a mere 20 000 new jobs smashing far below the lowest expectations of the gloomiest doomiest prognostications of 150 000 as if that were not enough rain on the parade all hail broke loose that same day when the us budget deficit took a rocket ride to the moon that is to say it was reported that day that the us deficit vaulted into the heavens in a whopping 77 ascension in the first four months of this fiscal year another trump triumph he ordered the tax cuts and he ordered the spending increases so he gets to own it with the greatest revenue boosters now receding in the rear view mirror and gdp fading smaller and smaller each of the last two quarters it doesn t look like those tax cuts will ever be paying for themselves the fed made that definitive by forecasting an even bigger gdp plunge this quarter to a 0 3 0 8 lowland that makes europe look great again so we can reverse the trump tax cuts to restore fiscal responsibility too or just spend ourselves into oblivion because the interest alone is now pushing half a trillion dollars half a trillion here and half a trillion there and pretty soon you re talking real money don t worry the debt drifters will say it s only money we can always print more the new money theory of the nuevo socialista democrats that i ll be attacking into in new articles soon with socialists rising all over the nation to preach infinite money creation sanders aoc warren and the fed which socialized all the losses of the capitalists with nuevo money and with democrats voting to give illegal russian aliens the right to vote in us local elections if the locals so choose even as they decry russian interference in us elections and with an habitually anti semitic congress woman in hijab now being excused by ranking and just plain rank democrats for her relentless rants about benjamin seeking jews i think the world is doing a whirling dervish on its axis right now my country has become as crazy like an asylum on parade but hey the end of next week brings us into the ides of march when all debts were settled the roman pantheon was worshipped and caesars were killed ending the crisis of the roman republic and triggering the civil war so let s raise a glass of italian whine to the fact that even when things are this crazy they can get worse carmageddon and the retail apocalypse soldiered on general motors mothballed one of its ohio factories this week and dollar tree announced it will be closing several hundred stores even as clothier charlotte russe announced closure all of its stores with immediate liquidation of all inventory the gap said during its earnings report it will be shuttering 230 stores victoria s secret said it will be stripping off 53 of its north american boutiques two top execs of america s largest mall landlord simon property group said this trend is acclerating using phrases like i don t want to scare you and we have many more that are in the pipeline we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us and yet there are idiots out there who keep crowing that the good times are really on a roll now after all we just had a fantastic bear market rally now ended how could it be better let them dance over the cliff with their bankster band leaders stocks couldn t stop stumbling if you re looking for the reason stocks fell relentlessly this week how about all the above the quants can have their numbers the chartsters can charter away but reality carries the day the s p 500 slipped back under its 200 day moving average the nasdaq nodded the same the s p buyback index which tracks all the stocks that are rising in the s p due to buybacks actually fell harder than the overall index the nasdaq faangs fandangled below their 200 day running average too intriguingly perhaps ominously the s p continued its relentless retracing of its 1939 crash pattern i wouldn t make any prediction based on an eery chart coincidence any more than i d claim ivanka trump s husband is the antichrist just because his business address is 666 fifth avenue but it s still fascinating especially in a world gone weird twain said history rhymes today we might say it is comprised of fractals of peculiar coincidence the wide reality gap however appears to be closing best case scenario the two lines converge in the middle at 2350 where the s p last found its bottom the dow transportation stocks matched an ancient record of badness this past week their eleven day fall paired up to their worst losing streak since watergate if you re a gen x er you may never even have heard of that there was this guy with a shoe shaped nose named nixon well never mind it was a bad time far in the rearview mirror that looked well increasingly like the present time the fall of a president shook the nation to the core of its being important to note the dow transports are not stocks that merely show us how the rest of the stock market is falling this 135 year old index is the canary in the coal mine the trannies as they are lovingly referred to by gender neutral marketeers reflect the entire condition of the industrial world in america they trannies go down when the closing of thousands of stores reduces shipping and when trump tariffs drag imports and exports down to stall speed and when housing construction slows which slows the movement of all kinds of materials and when global economies start lurching like an auto out of fuel they go down when the economy stops moving because they are the movers of all things real and not virtual and boy have they gone down hitting their worst path in half a century 2019 also turned out to be inspire of all its market madness the year of capital flight from the us stocks well i guess that is the mark of its madness yes you heard that right even though stocks were bid toward their former heights throughout the first two months of the year more money flowed out of the us market than flowed in throughout that same time apparently nobody with big money believes in this rising market it s a great paradox but as the market punched skyward day after day knocking holes through the clouds nearly wiping out their major 2018 losses investors were lightening their ships by sending their treasures on lifeboats to nearby islands where i don t know but here is a map of the journey money kept leaving at the same pace even though the market returned to rising when the market finally reached the s p s triple tested 2800 ceiling for a fourth attempt and skidded along the bottom of the ceiling to finally lose lift and drop back away the fleeing investors proved right exactly how the market rose so much with so much money fleeing i never found a good explanation for prices going up almost equal and opposite to the money going out but like i said it s a weird and whacky world the big bear rally now appears to be headed back to examine its nether regions each of the last three bear rallies rose to this same height and each one dropped lower than the one that preceded it if this one should find its rest along that trajectory of falling bottoms it has an exponential distance to descend that would take us back to 2014 while the bears prey let the bulls pray that the s p 500 s last 2400 bottom holds because the next sturdy stop for chart dwellers is between 2200 and 2100 taking out the entire trump rally and after that it s no man s land no that s not a prediction but it is where this thing could fall for the simple reason that rallies based on hopium and the euphoric high it delivers when mainlined to the moon have very little support stops along the way back down either simple chart support or real fundamentals especially real fundamentals and those are my basis for saying this market has no support a wild and wacky whirled when the entire world is margined into the stratosphere on corporate debt individual credit card debt mortgages including millions still hunkered in from the 2008 crash stock margin debt delinquent student debt sovereign debts all in a world of rising interest falling earnings and falling stock buybacks you can find as much downdraft as the sinking titanic or everything could go right just like the donald says it will all hail the chief well it could maybe this was just a week of blips not of freudian slips that are showing the true nature of the debt addled economy through all the holes in the lacy veil that covers its stinking corpse maybe all is as golden as the donald s showers and china will give us a deal that makes the trump tariffs salutary and the ecb will finally save the euromess with reinforced rounds of easing and brexit will exit as smoothly and gracefully as the most refined englishman can hope for and the us stock market s last bottom will hold like a rock foundation as steady hands in the market hoist again the flag of hope maybe housing will find a second wind and the retail apocalypse will hit a brick and mortar wall that stops it from mauling all of americas malls and automakers will retool to produce fleets of electric dreams turning the auto market around in just a year to a bright new future maybe everything will go like your most golden dream and maybe the beatles will regroup for a reunion from the land of the gratefully dead in a great yellow submarine piloted by a young elton john to float across strawberry fields forever maybe maybe the world will turn a new page this long tiresome trip to nowhere will end and the troubles we never dealt with will just dissolve away in an opiated haze maybe it s a wonderful whacky world so anything can happen good luck with that

the evaluation of its operations and believes that this measure is a useful indicator of the company s ability to fund its business this non gaap financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than u s gaap net income loss as an indicator of the company s operating performance moreover adjusted ebitda as presented by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies net sales in local currency removes from net sales in u s dollars the impact of changes in exchange rates between the u s dollar and the functional currencies of the company s foreign subsidiaries this is accomplished by translating the current period net sales into u s dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate the net sales for the previous comparable period in addition the company believes presenting the impact of foreign currency fluctuations is useful to investors because it allows a more meaningful comparison of net sales of its foreign operations from period to period net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net sales in u s dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with u s gaap other companies may use

beijing ap china announced a robust annual economic growth target and a 7 5 percent rise in military spending tuesday as it convened an annual legislative session overshadowed by a tariff war with washington seeking to defuse u s and european complaints the chinese system is rigged against foreign companies premier li keqiang promised in a speech to the national people s congress that they will be treated as equals with their chinese competitors li the country s top economic official set this year s growth target at 6 to 6 5 percent reflecting determination to shore up a cooling state dominated economy and prevent politically dangerous job losses such a growth rate if achieved would be among the world s strongest yet it would be slightly below last year s 6 6 percent growth in china and would mark a new three decade low the slowdown in china the world s second largest economy after the united states is likely to hold back international growth china is still a very large locomotive pulling the global economy said sung won sohn chief economist at ss economics in los angeles as the chinese economy slows this will have an impact around the world we are already seeing that impact still eswar prasad an economist at cornell university suggested that a more manageable pace of growth in china could benefit the global economy in the long run journalists film chinese premier li keqiang delivering the work reports at the opening session of the china s national people s congress at the great hall of the people in beijing tuesday march 5 2019 ap photo andy wong slower but more balanced growth in china especially if it was driven by domestic consumption demand and involved fewer financial system risks could be a net positive for the world economy prasad said at the legislative session in beijing li promised to promote china u s trade negotiations but gave no details of talks aimed at ending the fight with president donald trump over beijing s technology ambitions and complaints it steals or pressures companies to hand over technology li no 2 in the ruling communist party behind president xi jinping pledged higher spending on development of technologies including artificial intelligence electric cars biotechnology and new materials that china s leaders see as a path to prosperity and global influence he also promised more money for education social programs and public works construction china s emergence as a competitor in smartphones telecom equipment solar power and other technologies has increased the range of products available to consumers and helped to drive down prices but it rattles washington and other governments that worry chinese competition is a threat to their industries and employment li warned that the second largest economy faces a graver and more complicated environment and risks that are greater in number and size the two week gathering of the congress s 3 000 plus delegates in the cavernous great hall of the people is china s biggest event of the year it does little lawmaking but serves as a platform to highlight the government s plans for the year xi s government is expected to use this year s session to announce tax cuts and more support for entrepreneurs who generate much of china s new jobs and wealth legislators also are due to endorse a law that aims to ease tensions with washington and europe by discouraging officials from pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology higher government spending will push the budget deficit from 2 6 percent of total economic output to 2 8 percent li said the plans reflect emphatic pro growth efforts to offset external headwinds vishnu varathan of mizuho bank said in a report proposed tax cuts of up to 2 trillion yuan 300 billion would put significant spending power in the hands of consumers and companies helping to buoy sagging demand for autos household appliances and other goods varathan said spending on the communist party s military wing the people s liberation army will rise to 1 2 trillion yuan 178 billion according to a separate report issued by the finance ministry china s total military outlay the second largest behind the united states is estimated by independent experts to exceed 220 billion a year when off budget expenses are added in the spending will pay to expand china s navy and acquire advanced aircraft and other weapons to help beijing enforce its territorial claims in the south china sea the slower rise in military spending down from double digit increases in previous years reflects changing priorities said yue gang a military expert and retired chinese army colonel it is more urgent for china to prepare for a trade war with the u s instead of a physical war yue said military reforms are nearly complete and china needs the money to be used for more urgent matters he said the tariff fight with trump over beijing s technology ambitions has rattled chinese consumers and investors prompting some to put off spending which could add to downward pressure on economic growth news reports say washington and beijing might be close to an agreement to end the battle but the chief u s envoy trade representative robert lighthizer said earlier the two sides still had much work to do no agreements have been announced on the core of the dispute u s pressure on beijing to roll back its plans for state led creation of global competitors in robotics and other technology washington europe and other trading partners say those violate china s market opening obligations some american officials worry they might erode u s industrial leadership it s unclear if trump would be mollified by the technology measure part of a law on foreign investment that state media say the congress is due to endorse it would bar officials from using administrative measures to pressure companies to hand over technology foreign business groups welcomed the proposal but said they need to see enforcement rules to know whether it will improve conditions li tried to reassure investors by promising foreign companies will be treated as equals with chinese enterprises in a fair and impartial market environment foreign business groups and governments complain beijing routinely violates its commitments under the world trade organization to ensure such equality or national treatment they say rules on investment technology licensing and other facets of business discriminate against foreign companies or shield chinese enterprises from competition xi and other chinese leaders have announced changes over the past year including tariff cuts on imported consumer goods and plans to allow full foreign ownership in auto manufacturing but business groups say those have little impact on operating conditions beijing faces a wto challenge filed in july by the european union against technology licensing rules the 28 nation trade bloc said improperly hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their technology li promised competitive neutrality or equal treatment of state owned and private companies by regulators but he gave no details of how far that might extend for foreign competitors enterprises under all forms of ownership will be treated on an equal footing the premier said ___ ap writers yanan wang and christopher bodeen and

11 18p et friday march 8 2019 dear friend of gata and gold financial analysis published two weeks ago by a major italian newspaper il sole 24 ore the sun 24 hours asserted frankly that central banks have been using gold futures and derivatives to suppress the monetary metal s price so they can obtain more of the metal less expensively in advance of its remonetization under new rules promulgated by the bank for international settlements to take effect march 29 of course the new bis rules the basel 3 standards declaring gold in the vault to be a superior asset equivalent to cash and government bonds are not news what s news here is that a mainstream financial news organization has nailed the deception and intrigue of central banks and accused them of rigging the international gold market

here il sole 24 ore may be the first mainstream financial news organization to suggest that central banks are rigging the market so they might obtain more gold in anticipation of remonetizing it and pushing its price up but the newspaper isn t the first to reach this conclusion the u s economists and fund managers paul brodsky and lee quaintance hypothesized as much in a study published in 2012 and called to your attention by gata will the gold world really change when the basel 3 standards take effect on march 29 gata always sees possibilities but makes no such prediction given the cowardice and obliviousness of most mainstream financial journalism your secretary treasurer is more inclined to the vision of the future expressed in george orwell s 1984 a boot stamping on a human face forever but the report by il sole 24 ore may give reason for advocates of limited and accountable government free and transparent markets and fair dealing among the nations some reason to stick around for another three weeks a not entirely ham handed english translation of the il sole 24 ore analysis drawn from google translator and your secretary treasurer s guesses about italian idiom is appended chris powell secretary treasurer gold anti trust action committee inc cpowell gata org banks and the return of the gold standard gold in financial statements becomes money by alessandro plateroti il sole 24 ore milan italy monday february 25 2019 what is happening with world gold reserves in the gold market there is a cold war climate for the first time in 50 years central banks bought over 640 tons of gold bars last year almost twice as much as in 2017 and the highest level raised since 1971 when u s president richard nixon closed the era of the gold standard the interesting fact is that the european central banks together with the asian ones have been the most aggressive in their purchases is this fear of the euro crisis and currency wars in reality and this is especially true in europe behind the great maneuvers with gold reserves there is not only the traditional protective shield against major risks there is also the call of opportunity a reminder of which few still seem to know though the appointment is now a matter of a few weeks march 29 2019 the day of judgment for the brexit will also be the advent for the gold market it is not clear whether by choice or by chance the bank of international settlements in basel switzerland called the central bank of central banks for its key role in the world financial system has set an appointment with the story for march 29 resurrection of the gold standard in the banking world for almost 60 years the gold standard has regulated the convertibility between gold and dollar engaging the market value in 1971 it was the american president richard nixon frightened by the bearish pressures that were likely to sink the dollar in the cold war to cut the cord with gold decreeing the end of the gold standard now something starts moving in the opposite direction gold as cash the sun 24 hours has discovered that among the complex but well known reforms of the standards for credit and finance from the basel 3 plan there is an accounting alchemy that can turn gold into money on the balance sheets of the large banking groups from march 29 by decision of the bis the gold in the portfolio of commercial and business banks becomes cash equivalent an asset equivalent to cash and therefore risk free in fact it is the first reassuring of gold since the time of the bretton woods agreement technicians call it gold remonetization a process that is the reverse of the demonetization of gold decided by nixon same status as sovereign bonds the operation of the bis as reconstructed by the sun 24 hours carries the signature of the federal reserve the european central bank the bundesbank the bank of england and the bank of france the g 5 of the great global monetary powers in 2016 when the new rules of the banking system included in the basel 3 package were defined the central bankers committee inserted an epoch making norm that no one however has ever openly discussed in public in practice gold in physical bullion hence not under the synthetic form of certificates will return to be considered by regulators as the equivalent of the dollar and the euro in asset security thus eliminating the obligation to weigh the risk for the purpose of capital absorption as with any other financial asset excluding for now eurozone government bonds the turning point is not insignificant for the gold market and for the very role of national gold reserves the result is significant with the new rules of basel 3 gold is given the same status that is now recognized for sovereign bonds on bank balance sheets a question therefore arises is the promotion of gold the premise for applying a weighting of risk to the government securities held by banks from the debt crisis the regulators objective was in fact two fold to require the banking system to hold an adequate equity to cover the risks in the crosshairs there are mainly the government securities that according to current rules can be held by banks without any impact on their assets the issue mainly concerns low rated countries such as italy spain portugal and greece which were seen to be special after the debt crisis in 2011 the banks of these countries both to increase profitability carry trade and to facilitate the issue of public debt in auctions have the highest amount of government securities in the euro area and this phenomenon is particularly felt in italy where the banking system has 400 billion btp on the 2 4 trillion of public debt what would happen then if it were applied to risk weighting on italian government bonds as the basel committee wants the consequences depend on the level of risk weighting applied to the italian government bonds if it were high some banks could be forced to replace the securities with other financial assets including gold or to proceed with capital increases at a time when the market is reluctant to buy bank shares the risk of repercussions on the stability of the banking system could be high just look at the credit default swaps default risk insurance on italian banks according to bloomberg data the five year credit default swaps of some of the major italian banks have surged since the spring of 2018 even tripling the value in some cases it is in this context that the date of march 29 is approaching rapidly countries that have repatriated gold from abroad regaining control and management are already protected from the risk of being short of physical gold after march 29 to make available to their banks in case they want to replace sovereign bonds with it in the arsenal of the system there is a golden mountain of 33 000 metric tons of gold worth 1 400 billion at the current exchange rate and that represents 20 percent of all the gold extracted in the world in almost 3 000 years as usual the most forward looking and prudent countries or perhaps the best informed about the turnaround coming at the end of march were germany holland austria france switzerland and belgium but poland romania and hungary also regained control of gold reserves increasing their consistency china russia india and turkey have been the nations that have bought gold in the last two years more than anyone else with moscow having even liquidated its entire portfolio in u s government bonds to replace them with precious metal but the problem is not this it is the price of gold in 2018 as many as 641 tons of gold bars were bought by the monetary authorities of every continent but above all in europe it is the highest level since 1971 the maneuver is unprecedented and should be seen in the phenomenon of repatriation of ingots of state custody seven thousand tons of gold reserves were withdrawn by central banks from the coffers of the federal reserve bank of new york while 400 tons were secretly released by the bank of england in recent years but especially in 2018 a jump in the price of gold would have been the normal order of things on the contrary gold closed last year with a 7 percent downturn and a negative financial return how do you explain this while the central banks raided real gold bars behind the scenes they pushed and coordinated the offer of hundreds of tons of synthetic gold on the london and new york exchanges where 90 percent of the trading of metals takes place the excess supply of gold derivatives obviously served to knock down the price of gold forcing investors to liquidate positions to limit large losses accumulated on futures thus the more gold futures prices fell the more investors sold synthetic gold triggering bearish spirals exploited by central banks to buy physical gold at ever lower prices with this system those looking at gold as a safe haven like china india russia and turkey have practically doubled their gold reserves in the last five years moscow to buy gold has even sold the last 20 percent of the u s government bonds it held in currency reserves how compatible is such a situation with the duties of correctness and transparency of a central bank certainly the system created by the anglo american goldfinger seems to be made for abuses who knows what will happen after march 29 join gata here mining

are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of march 1 2019 so with that said let s turn to our second quarter fiscal 2019 results we are pleased with our overall results for the quarter with strong growth in visitation and spending compared to the prior year in the pre holiday period destination guest visitation in our u s resorts was less than expected which we attribute to guest concerns after two prior years of poor pre holiday conditions our destination guest visitation was largely in line with expectations during the key holiday weeks and through the remainder of january throughout the quarter with the favorable conditions at our u s resorts we saw strong visitation growth among our local guests who are primarily pass purchasers our colorado and utah resorts experienced strong visitation during the holidays and through the remainder of the quarter that aligned with our expectations whistler blackcomb and tahoe resorts saw periods of strong visitation in the holiday and post holiday periods that have also been impacted by numerous weather events that have negatively impacted their results in addition international visitation at whistler blackcomb was below the prior year throughout the quarter our northeast resorts are off to a great start to the season as we continue to benefit from good conditions and the first season with okemo and mount sunapee as part of the network conditions across the network are setup well for the remainder of the season including results from triple peaks and stevens pass in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 total lift revenue increased 17 2 driven by a 27 growth in skier visitation total effective ticket price decreased 7 8 in the second quarter compared to the prior year primarily due to higher skier visitation by season pass holders and the impact of the new military epic pass partially offset by price increases in both our lift ticket and season pass products excluding season pass holders effective ticket price increased 8 3 compared to the prior year the strong rebound in visitation and spending compared to the prior year along with the addition of triple peaks and stevens pass drove a 15 1 increase in the ski school revenue and a 21 3 increase in dining revenue and an 11 3 increase in retail and rental revenue compared to the prior year now i would like to turn the call over to michael to further discuss our financial results our season to date metrics and our updated outlook michael barkin chief financial officer thanks rob and good morning everyone as rob mentioned we are pleased with our second quarter performance with strong growth in visitation and spending compared to the prior year resort net revenue was 849 3 million an increase of 15 6 compared to the prior year resort reported ebitda was 358 million an increase of 15 9 compared to the prior year mountain revenue was 776 1 million up 15 7 from the prior year while mountain reported ebitda was 352 2 million for the second quarter 15 4 from the prior year our lodging results for the second fiscal quarter were positive with revenue excluding payroll costs reimbursements increasing 16 1 compared to the prior year primarily due to the incremental operations of triple peaks the average daily rate decrease compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the inclusion of the triple peaks resorts as well as incremental managed tahoe lodging properties that we did not manage in the prior year all of which generate a lower average daily rate as compared to our broader lodging segment net income attributable to vail resorts was 206 3 million or 5 02 per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to net income of 235 7 million or 5 67 per diluted share for the same period in the prior year fiscal 2018 second quarter net income included a onetime provisional net tax benefit of approximately 64 6 million or 1 55 per diluted share related to u s tax reform legislation additionally fiscal 2019 second quarter net income included the after tax effect of acquisition and integration related expenses of 2 2 million and approximately 1 million of headwind from currency translation primarily related to operations at whistler blackcomb which the company calculated by applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior period results our balance sheet remains very strong we ended the second quarter with 158 6 million of cash on hand and our net debt was 1 9 times trailing 12 months total reported ebitda turning now to our season to date metrics for the period from the beginning of the ski season through sunday march 3 2019 and for the prior year period through sunday march 4 2018 the reported ski season metrics are for our north american mountain resorts and the metrics exclude results from perisher and our urban ski areas in both periods the reported ski season metrics include growth for season pass revenue based on estimated fiscal 2019 north american season pass sales compared to fiscal 2018 north american season pass sales and the metrics are adjusted as if stevens pass and triple peaks llc were owned in both periods and adjusted to eliminate the impact of foreign currency by applying current period exchange rates to the prior period for whistler blackcomb s results this is interim period data and is subject to fiscal quarter end review and adjustments as expected our season to date growth rates came down from our reported metrics in january given that last year conditions improved in the post holiday period for our colorado resorts total lift revenue at the company s north american mountain resorts including an allocated portion of season pass revenue for each applicable period was up 9 6 compared to the prior year season to date period our ski school revenue increased 7 4 dining revenue increased 7 9 and resort retail and rental revenue increased 7 3 all compared to the prior year season to date period total skier visits were up 7 9 compared to the prior year season to date period as noted in our january press release we are lowering our guidance for fiscal 2019 primarily due to the disappointing results from destination visitation in the pre holiday period and also due to shortfalls from expectations at whistler blackcomb and our tahoe resorts our tahoe resorts were the most impacted from numerous intense weather events which impacted travel to the resorts and prevented the mountains from being fully open or open at all on certain days whistler blackcomb was also adversely impacted by weather events in addition to a decline in international visitation which resulted in lower growth after three years of significant revenue increases at whistler blackcomb we now expect resort reported ebitda to offer fiscal 2019 to be between 690 million and 710 million which remains generally consistent with our expectations in january our guidance is predicated on current canadian and australian foreign exchange rates of 0 75 and 0 71 respectively for each currency to the u s dollar for the remainder of the fiscal year which represents an estimated 4 million reduction in resort reported ebitda from the currency rates included in the guidance we issued in september 2018 of which nearly half has been realized year to date the updated guidance incorporates 12 million of acquisition and integration expenses including 2 million for the recently announced falls creek and hotham resorts transaction the guidance does not incorporate any expected operating results or stamp duty payments for falls creek and hotham which we plan to update following the closing of the transactions our guidance assumes normal conditions at our resorts and a stable economic environment for the remainder of the fiscal year we were very pleased to announce in february that we were that we entered into an agreement to acquire the ski resorts at falls creek alpine resort and hotham alpine resort in victoria australia from living in leisure australia group a subsidiary of merlin entertainments for a purchase price of approximately aud 174 million subject to certain adjustments and closing including an increase or a reduction in the price for operating losses or gains incurred for the period from december 29 2018 through closing the company also expects to pay a stamp duty which we estimate will be approximately aud 4 million associated with the closing of the transaction falls creek and hotham are expected to generate combined incremental resort reported ebitda of approximately aud 18 million or approximately usd 13 million during their first 12 months of operations following the acquisition excluding any integration expense after the closing of the transaction anual ongoing capital expenditures are expected to increase by approximately aud 4 million to aud 5 million or approximately usd 3 million to usd 4 million to support the addition of these two resorts specific to this transaction we anticipate fiscal 2019 acquisition related expenses of approximately usd 2 million the transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and we anticipate that the closing will occur prior to the commencement of the australian ski season in june 2019 i ll now turn the call back over to rob rob katz chief executive officer thanks michael we remain confident in the strong cash flow generation and stability of our business model and we ll continue to be disciplined stewards of our capital remaining committed to strategic high return capital projects

facilities and improvements to the peak 8 base area at breckenridge where we are planning to make a one time investment to transform the guest experience at the base of peak 8 with new ski school and child care facilities as well as an improved ticket and retail and rental experience we remain highly focused on investments that will substantially improve the guest experience across our resorts

turning now to our season pass sales earlier this week we launched pass sales for the 2019 2020 season eleven years ago the epic pass transformed the ski industry by offering guests unlimited skiing at the best resorts in the world for a previously unheard of low price making skiing and riding more accessible and affordable the 2019 2020 season pass lineup takes another transformational leap by offering season pass level discounts to all guests with the introduction of epic for everyone as part of this introduction the company is now offering the new epic day pass a customizable pass for skiers and riders who may not need the unlimited skiing offered by traditional season passes guests can create their own path by selecting the number of days they plan to ski or ride from one day to seven days and whether or not to add holiday access the epic day pass with a starting price of just 106 allows guests to receive a discount of nearly 50 off lift ticket window prices by purchasing in advance of the ski season providing all of our guests with the value flexibility and convenience that come with being a passholder the season pass program has grown to comprise 47 of fiscal 2018 lift revenue however despite our success in converting guests to a pass there is still a meaningful portion of our guest base that currently purchases daily lift tickets with an average frequency estimated at 2 3 annual skier visits purchaser epic for everyone provides all of our guests with the opportunity to participate in season pass discounts and provides first time and occasional skiers greater access to our resorts giving us the opportunity to expand the sport and grow the entire industry this past year we launched the new military epic pass which delivered nearly 100 000 new passholders to our program representing an incredible opportunity for our company to make our resorts more accessible to those who have served their countries in the armed forces as well as their families for the 2019 2020 season we will continue offering the military epic pass at a compelling price of 129 the company is also introducing a new season pass the keystone plus pass providing unlimited access to keystone with holiday restrictions unlimited skiing at breckenridge after april 1st and five days at crested butte with holiday restrictions at a starting price of 369 for adults and 259 for kids with keystone s plan to be the first resort open in the u s and breckenridge planning to stay open until memorial day the two summit county resorts will offer one of the longest ski seasons in the country also new for the 2019 2020 season is that guests who purchase a season pass before our spring selling deadline will receive 10 discounted buddy tickets up from six the year before we are also pleased to begin our new pass partnerships with sun valley and snow basin as well as in hokkaido japan in closing i want to take a moment to thank all of our vail resorts employees for their passion and tireless dedication to deliver an experience of a lifetime to our guests at this time michael and i would be happy to answer your questions operator we are now ready for questions questions and answers operator thank you sir we ll take our first question from felicia hendrix with barclays felicia hendrix barclays analyst hi good morning rob katz chief executive officer good morning felicia hendrix barclays analyst rob hi rob my goal is this is for either one of you i was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more going back to the weather challenges you saw in tahoe and the tough comps that you regarding international visitation at at whistler i m just wondering a few things with each of those items the first how much did each of these items affect your ebitda guidance and what impact did they have on your season to date data that you reported i m also wondering if you could give us some data just on how many days you lost in tahoe and then at whistler wondering if the drop in international visitation was mostly coming from latin america you ve seen strength there over the past several years for a variety of different reasons or are you seeing also weak demand from europe rob katz chief executive officer yes what i would say is i think i m not sure we can provide more detail on the closure days though obviously i think the weather and the the open close status of our resorts is out there i do think it is one of the things that comes along with having great snow which obviously all of our resorts do is that the timing of those storms and when they hit can significantly impact business if it happens on a weekend or a peak period and it s it s challenging to make up those days it s not like two days later you necessarily make it up because those guests often have have left and we do see a pretty big impact from that so i d say that was a headwind countering the tailwind from the obviously great snow and great conditions and we have factored obviously that into our guidance in terms of what we ve already experienced and factored some of that into the rest of the season though i think that certainly our hope is is that as we go through the rest of the season we see a little bit of a moderation of that and and i think that can really benefit the spring i think on international it was i would say most of the challenge we saw in the international business that was blackcomb is a little bit on the lower price a business that the resort had a certain historically done i think both our own pricing strategies and even more important than that just the cost of lodging in the whistler blackcomb market has come up quite a bit over the last couple of years and in part i think seeing a little bit of that slowdown maybe happened a little bit quicker than we might have expected but was certainly something that we thought over the long haul made sense given that the resort had grown so significantly over the prior three years we think it s critical to protect the experience at whistler blackcomb for the long term and also continue to make room i think for what s going to be a growing business out of china and southeast asia so i see whistler a little bit in a in a transition moment and i think actually very well positioned for the future but certainly i think a little bit of again a headwind on the international side this year i d say fairly broad based but less i d say latin america than the other countries felicia hendrix barclays analyst ok and again just in terms of the ebitda guidance that you provided today you won t quantify kind of how much tahoe and whistler combined were headwinds rob katz chief executive officer well yes i mean i guess what i s say is that the change in guidance from the beginning of the year i think certainly the biggest part of that was still going to be the early season as we i think we have disclosed before but no we re not providing specific guidance at this time as to exactly how much the weather impacted it s also it is obviously that if you looked at our results what i think for any of our resorts if there s a resort like heavenly you d see some pretty high variation up and down in terms of our expectation but the downs during those snowfall periods have been pretty significant so and we ll take that out and think about maybe there is a better way for us to kind of share or talk about this potentially at the investor conference next week felicia hendrix barclays analyst ok thanks and then just to clarify so on that epic day pass we ve just gotten a bunch of questions on that and there s kind of two parts to this so some of the questions we got about the trade off you re making in terms of revenues by transitioning people onto the day pass versus buying a more expensive ticket at the window so i think we all know that you rather have those folks in your database building stability and loyalty but just walking if you could just walk us through any noise that that might create in your numbers next year if the demand for the product is what you expect it to be and then we ve also gotten questions about just the driver behind the decision would you view it as more of an offensive move just in terms of continuation of your strategy that you ve had now for 11 years or defensive because of the past competition you faced rob katz chief executive officer yeah i think i ll take the second one first i would say we view it very much as a continuation of our own strategy that has been in place for years and certainly having nothing to do with icon and and i think the fact that we have continued to grow this season pass program and i think one of the things that that is out there is there are a lot of people who are of many many destination local guests who are out there for those folks who are kind of that four plus day skier obviously we ve had products that make sense for them but there is a huge other part of the market that s quite important to the resort business that they re just lower frequency and i think our strategy has been to start with the highest volume skier get that to convert and then slowly but surely move folks into our products that have a potentially lower frequency so we introduced a number of years back the epic seven day that was one step toward that then we introduced the epic four day and now we feel like we re at a point in our maturity the complexity of going after a lower frequency guest for a season pass we think our program and our tools are in place to actually do that in a more successful way and in our minds if you look at the discounts that we re offering they are kind of in line with the discounts that we had offered before on the epic four day and the epic seven day with obviously slightly higher discounts for more days we did this year decide to introduce the off peak discount because we think that s a great flow through opportunity for us to potentially incent people to come in those off peak times and we do see a lot of our lot of the epic four day a lot of the epic seven day historically have been used in more peak times so this was an opportunity to kind of broad in that and in terms of the impact on our financials i would say it s consistent with what you ve seen which is that there it is in our minds as we transition people to in a kind of day of product to an advanced product we obviously take a step back on price but then obviously we then build from there and have a pretty consistent price increase strategy so that initial conversion has some potentially immediate dilution but in our minds when we look over a multi year period we see that trade off as quite positive so the stability that you get the return rate that s higher for season pass the guest satisfaction that s higher all of that right is kind of we think in our minds we think about as lifetime value of guest which goes up significantly and it s definitely worth that trade off felicia hendrix barclays analyst thank you that was very helpful operator and we ll take our next question from brett andress with keybanc dan charrow keybanc capital markets analyst hey guys this is dan charrow on for brett congrats on the quarter just touching on the outlook for the rest of the season would breckenridge now post continue operations through memorial day can you talk about maybe any potential extension to the ski season that you re contemplating in the guide and what would we have to see over the next month or so in colorado or more broadly for you to get more constructive about a lengthier season than we ve seen in the past couple of years rob katz chief executive officer i would say i think we have definitely factored in the current season into our guidance and i think to the extent that there were no other extensions i don t think that would have a material impact on our results for this year i think certainly we re going to continue to breckenridge obviously we ve already made our commitment on there obviously conditions permitting to go all the way through memorial day we think that s an important long term strategy for us in colorado i think in tahoe obviously we ll continue to monitor conditions we just announced a little while ago that we were extending each of the three resorts and i think we ll continue to monitor it to the extent that it seems like the conditions are still strong demand is still there yes we will consider that again i think that s more about the experience we re providing and the season long opportunity that we see that is there less about necessarily that having a material impact on our results for the year dan charrow keybanc capital markets analyst got it thanks helpful and wondering if you can provide any color around the falls creek and hotham resorts it seems like those are a nice way to expand the australian footprint a bit closer to some of the larger cities and from a total attendance perspective should we think about those as maybe a third of the size of perisher and any early indications around how the inclusion in the network may impact the overseas epic cohort rob katz chief executive officer yes i mean i think we re very excited about the falls creek and hotham deals i think on it on a couple of basis one we clearly have the experience now from perisher serving the city in new south wales market and have had a lot of success with perisher and the epic australia pass there but because perisher largely does serve that region we ve not had the same opportunity with the melbourne and victoria markets and so using the the opportunity to use the same model in melbourne and victoria more broadly is quite compelling and we do feel very good about both falls creek which really offers a really great kind of family oriented experience paired with hotham which has a lot more advanced skiing the two of those together really present a compelling opportunity for really the full skier population in that area so we feel like the opportunity to roll out the epic australia pass is great and then from there right clearly the strategy which we ve already executed against is to build that connection to north america primarily and particularly relative to when we did perisher in 2015 we now have whistler blackcomb which is one of the right primary destinations for australian skiers and so to be able to offer that to this new guest base to collect data and market directly through those guests as well as to our two partnerships in japan yes offers a very compelling opportunity for us in that market so we feel like yes really well strategically positioned certainly important as we look at asia in the longer term and in terms of size i think probably the best comparison is to the kind of year one ebitda that we put out relative to perisher the two together are are in the same ballpark dan charrow keybanc capital markets analyst got it great thanks very helpful operator and our next question comes from shaun kelley with bank of america shaun kelly bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning everyone i just want to go back to felicia s question to start rob i think you mentioned sort of pretty clearly the move with all the new announced products and sort of what do you think that might do for pricing but could you talk a little bit about what it also might mean for sort of yields and some of the ancillary spending you re seeing out there just as you continue to make the transition to the advanced products and kind of what your experience was a military this year relative to expectation rob katz chief executive officer well i think yes two definitely different pieces there i think certainly when we see somebody move from a paid lift ticket to a season pass we tend to see higher frequency and that obviously helps ancillary as well often it isn t that the yield per day may go down if somebody is adding days to their season but the total right that we re getting from somebody over a season goes up and in our mind again when we re thinking about that multi year frequency right how often we will see somebody over a three to four year period we see that the total revenue opportunity is being much better to the extent that they re on a pass versus on a lift ticket on almost every metric on military has performed great in terms of obviously the number of people who went into the program we ve seen good frequency from a military pass holders i think less spend per visit than we would see from other destination guests that s not totally surprising to us just because obviously the lower price made it accessible to a lot of folks who may not have had necessarily the budget to that a lot of our other destination guests have but in total highly incremental for this season shaun kelly bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you and then on the other question just as we think about the sort of overall blend between destination and the local visitation is just what do you think it would take to see an upside surprise from sort of destination spending at this point in the cycle it seems like some of the benefits that we saw are really from the upside on visitation given the strong condition it seems like in peak periods you re pretty optimized but is there a move to shoulder and i think you mentioned that a little bit in maybe of the target offerings or anything that you could do to really optimize what you re seeing in destination spending outside of those peaks rob katz chief executive officer well i would say yes i think two things one is i think we need to get people into the resort right in the off peak periods and that s one of the strategies i think with our epic day pass product launch i think one of the things that we see by the way even is just that a lot of our epic four day holders will tend to use that product in christmas or early part of january and it goes down as you go through the season and so actually the whole entirety of spring break is actually not a peak period in terms of the restrictions on the pass so the epic day pass which is about 15 lower than the restricted version is about 15 lower than the unrestricted version and actually gets you access to spring break so we re really hoping to actually move a lot of these folks who are that spring break traveler to potentially consider a pass even though obviously they re there then buying even further in advance but for us obviously that s a big win i think on the ancillary spend i think where we see the biggest opportunity is that we have not yet taken the same marketing and data driven sophistication that we have around pass and that we re starting right to really use for lift tickets we ve not really taken that to ski school or rental or even fnb in some respects and so we actually see an opportunity and we ve talked about that i think in prior years on this progression we re trying to kind of take the biggest and best opportunity first and then keep moving through each piece of our revenue stream and so we do think that there is an opportunity to really be i d say go up a whole another level in how we engage our guests to take these products and obviously each of these products deliver pretty strong flow through especially ski school and a relatively small percentage of our total visitors actually use ski school so in our minds that s definitely on our roadmap over the next couple of years shaun kelly bank of america merrill lynch analyst great last question for me would just be sort of run rate g a expense i mean it s a little difficult with all the m a activity obviously in some of your centralized investment but when you look at sort of a same resort or same mountain basis can you help give us a little bit of a guidepost of what type of labor inflation you re seeing out there right now obviously operate in some markets where that s significant i think you may still have some of the investments you made in your workforce following tax reform could you give us a sense of what your kind of current market condition you re seeing on a same resort or same mountain basis rob katz chief executive officer yes i don t think i can give you as a stat but i guess right off the top here maybe that s something we can address down the road but i would say that we are seeing wage pressure and i think we identified that for going into this year one of the headwinds was 15 million in wage investments over and above kind of the normal inflation that we ve seen previously i think that s helped and that s certainly made progress but i would expect that the same pressures that we re seeing you that everyone is seeing across the country are pressures that we will continue to feel and i think again like that like we re seeing in the rest of the lodging industry so in our minds i think this is going to continue to be i think this year may have been more significant kind of one time in terms of the headwind but as we go forward i think that s a topic that s going to be a challenge until there s some shift in the employment market shaun kelly bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you very much rob katz chief executive officer thanks operator and our next question comes from ryan sundby with william blair ryan sundby william blair analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions rob katz chief executive officer sure ryan sundby william blair analyst just going to try and follow up on felixia and shaun s question on the incrementality of the epic day pass is there can you provide i guess any color on the breakdown and size between the big kind of the base epic local and foreign seven day passes and then as we go through the pass filing season next year or the summer do you plan to provide kind of a similar baseline view like we did with epic this year versus military or all these kind of get combined going forward rob katz chief executive officer so what i say is i think we re not i don t think we re providing additional color on the breakdown among our passes i think on incrementality we do think there s significant opportunity with the epic day pass on with these lower frequency guests obviously that will be at a lower price point so from a revenue perspective certainly there would be some dilution on epp but in our minds we are focused on that incrementality i think the incrementality that we see yes is through more consistent more stable return rates over a multi year period and the stability that we re looking for plus obviously the ability to then communicate with that guest in a more targeted and more personalized way so we that s one benefit the other benefit we see is for some of our pass holders that churn out of the program one of the top reasons that they give for why they churn out is that they re not they don t think they re going to ski enough next year to justify a pass and so in our minds this is now addressing one of the most important concerns people have which is their own ski frequency in terms of how how or why they buy a pass in terms of reporting yes we will take a look at how to best portray right the results i don t think i don t think this will be a similar situation to military where with epic day pass that we can somehow pull out more discretely the entirety of the program because obviously we have a lot of people already in an epic seven and in epic four but we absolutely when we get to june and do our first report we will definitely look at how can we provide some insight that we think is helpful to investors in terms of understanding the impact of the overall program and our results today ryan sundby william blair analyst great that would be very helpful and then rob i guess with the the better early season snow this year and investments that are coming in snowmaking capabilities do you see the weakness this year around destination guests in the pre holiday period is more of a one time event or should we kind of expect some kind of behavior change that kind of continues i guess into the future rob katz chief executive officer i don t know i think obviously we felt that we looked at the snow coverage and the conditions this year and the early season and we looked back a few years ago to when we had a very good early season and expected to see kind of a repeat of that and we didn t and so i don t know whether that could be that that it s two years of tough snow and people are not willing to have the confidence to book again if next year is good i don t know whether people will know whether things will change in this year was kind of a one time event it ll change next year or this is a longer piece on the chain side it may be that yes that as we move more and more people to pass that pass skier obviously is more likely to be a local skier so we may not see that lift ticket buyer as much show up but when you look back historically i think you do see whether it s been in tahoe or in colorado you do see these lags in terms of when people get comfortable again to show back up and have confidence in the weather and i think that s something that i would imagine might happen again but that s certainly not something that we can predict at this point ryan sundby william blair analyst great thanks for that rob katz chief executive officer thanks operator and our next question comes from tyler batory with janney capital markets tyler batory janney capital markets analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my question just want to follow up on some of the other questions here and rob i know you ve discussed this before but now that we re basically through the entire ski season any updated thoughts on how you icon past may or may not have influenced your results rob katz chief executive officer well one i would say is we still have a lot of season to go so we re not done just yet and obviously the march and april time periods are just to put that out there is still significant obviously and obviously q3 in total is significant i think that as we talked about before it s a little hard for us to say i think that we know again having seen the growth in our season pass program last year even if it was a little less than maybe what we had hoped for was still pretty strong growth and obviously we ve seen strong growth this year versus last year our obviously our colorado and utah resorts have really been on expectations for that once we got into holidays and beyond so to me i guess what i would say is it is a it s hard for us to know whether that has any impact from icon i think it s an important point though broadly is that our resorts have been competing with the resorts that are in the icon pass truly for 50 years in many cases and they ve always been great competitors and they re great resorts and so the fact that there is a new pass isn t that s not new and obviously even the icon pass was replacing many other passes that were out there that we were competing with before and so i there s no doubt that i think the icon is a great product and i think they ve done a very nice job with that and to me i i m sure it has some impact but i don t think it has had a structural change to the primary drivers of our business again because most of these dynamics existed even two years ago tyler batory janney capital markets analyst ok got it that s helpful and then i wanted to ask on the partnerships that you guys have in japan do you think those relationships have been an incremental driver of your pass sales are you seeing folks using their privileges to go visit those properties and then any updates as far as how you re thinking about partnerships or outright acquisitions in that market rob katz chief executive officer i think we we ll be sharing more information about pass sales in australia when we get to our june earnings call i would say that we do feel like it s definitely been a positive and we certainly i mean just from guest enthusiasm alone i think when we added results to having a resort in hokkaido i think is a very meaningful addition to that market and i think we having the two choices now of and going forward i think will absolutely give us a boost i also think that adding the melbourne market in terms of hotham and falls creek again just from guest enthusiasm in terms of what we see and hear and read and what s coming through communication channels yes again i think people are quite excited about the opportunity actual the impact to actual results will be a little bit hard to tell but we ll be able to at least share more data on that in june tyler batory janney capital markets analyst ok great and then just last one for me a housekeeping item the real estate ebitda guide the midpoint were flat i think you re down 5 what s driving that is there any way to think about how the real estate could flow in the third quarter or the fourth quarter rob katz chief executive officer yes as we ve talked about before the real estate is a little bit lumpy just in that it largely tracks with kind of primarily land sales at this point and so as as the timing of various deals comes together or moves that can impact guidance within any one year and so we obviously make our make our best estimates of that at the start of the year and then update that as it goes tyler batory janney capital markets analyst ok that s all for me see you next week rob katz chief executive officer thanks michael barkin chief financial officer thanks operator our next question is from brad boyer with stifel brad boyer stifel financial corp analyst yes guys thanks for taking the questions first question is just around what you re seeing today in the m a environment particularly in north america and taking that a step further just curious if you guys are getting a little bit more receptive and comfortable with pursuing partnership arrangements as opposed to owning resorts outright just thinking about the sun valley and announcements thanks rob katz chief executive officer i think i don t think we can comment on the environment per se but i think we re certainly still aggressive about adding resorts that we think will make our network more powerful we re going to be patient and disciplined for the right opportunity in some cases when we think we have a good opportunity the owners of that resort are not interested in selling and that discussion can sometimes morph into a partnership discussion and i think we re going to be selective about those partnerships much like we are with acquisitions so i don t think our goal is really not to dilute the experience the selection of resorts the power of the network it s really for those resorts that we think can be highly incremental so we ll still be open to it but i think just like on acquisitions we re going to be incredibly disciplined about it brad boyer stifel financial corp analyst helpful and then just a second one i mean probably splitting hairs here a little bit but it looks like you guys are accelerating some of the year one investment in the acquired resorts could you just talk a little bit about the drivers behind that rob katz chief executive officer yes i think that was just us ultimately i think when we put out some of that original guidance it was only a month and a half i think after we ve closed the deal and so i think we had made an initial pass of what we thought we could get done in the first year and then i think with the benefit of a little more time we re able to then identify ok how much of this could we get done in this first year i would say our goal was to get anything to get done this year would be a positive so that s why we saw some additional pportunities and yes just assessed the full plan for this year in greater detail and i think that was a good thing brad boyer stifel financial corp analyst thanks a lot that s all for me operator and our next question comes from chris woronka with deutsche bank chris woronka deutsche bank analyst hey good morning guys i wanted to ask you on the new build your own or daily epic pass for next year does that move you closer to maybe the lower price point being able to do more of a monthly or subscription model the second part of that is is this do you view it internally as more of like an experiment or more something you re pretty sure is going to be permanent going forward rob katz chief executive officer so on the monthly piece we have taken an approach toward how people pay for their pass by only charging 49 down in the spring and then the full amount of the payment in september and what we ve seen is that that has been pretty compelling for people who are buying their pass in the spring or earlier than that and it s a good competitive differentiation for us and something that we ve been pretty successful with for a lot of years i don t see us going into a plan where people could pay for it over the term the season because i think that would create risk on the commitment that we d be getting so we re always going to essentially say that folks have to pay for their pass before the season begins so that ll be i don t see us moving off of that yes we don t see this as an experiment we very much see this as a logical extension of what we ve already done i think it s true that there are unknowns we don t know how how fast guests will migrate to this product i think if you look back historically it does take a number of years even when the discount is great even when the benefits are great it still takes guests who have not focused on buying a pass a number of years to to really move the needle and we ve seen that in almost every initiative we ve had and i ve no doubt we ll see that here with epic day pass so we don t know that and sure we don t know exactly the return rates of that and the frequency piece but in the end i think we ve seen enough of the benefit on the stability side for from our existing products that we re quite confident that this will be able to deliver those same kind of opportunities for the company chris woronka deutsche bank analyst ok very good that s all for me thanks rob rob katz chief executive officer thanks operator and our next question comes to us from brennan matthews with berenberg brennan matthews berenberg capital analyst hi thank you for taking my question just one here and that s on the recent decision by i think to end the partnership with you do you expect this will have any impact on pass sales for next season again hard to say at this point i think we feel like the product that we re offering certainly so we had a couple of different things one was on the epic pass and the epic local pass and i think on those we certainly feel like we have a terrific collection of resorts and certainly within colorado obviously we ve added and then added telluride to the average pass so i think we ve provided a lot of value i think by having keystone open being planning to be one of the first opened in the country in terms of resorts and then breckenridge opened through memorial day we feel like we re giving our guests a lot of the benefit that did offer and obviously it s great resort and then we replaced the keystone pass with the keystone plus pass which also we think offers a pretty compelling opportunity for folks that said it s a big transition been in our portfolio for a long time and so yes idon t think we have perfect information on necessarily what the impact is but we certainly think we re offering a pretty compelling product even without them ok that s all for me thank you very much rob katz chief executive officer ok operator and there are no further questions in the queue at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any concluding remarks rob katz chief executive officer thank you operator this concludes our fiscal second quarter 2019 earnings call thanks to everyone who joined us on the conference call today please feel free to contact me or michael directly

u s employment growth almost stalled in february with the economy creating only 20 000 jobs adding to signs of a sharp slowdown in economic activity in the first quarter the meager payroll gains reported by the labor department on friday were the weakest since september 2017 with a big drop in the weather sensitive construction industry they also reflected a decline in hiring by retailers and utility companies as well as the transportation and warehousing sector which is experiencing a shortage of drivers the sharp step down in payrolls was another blow to president donald trump who has suffered a series of setbacks in recent weeks including failed nuclear talks with north korea a record goods trade deficit despite his administration s america first policies and the economy missing the white house s 3 percent annual growth target in 2018 but the stumble in job growth which followed two straight months of hefty gains likely understates the health of the labor market as other details of the closely watched employment report were strong the unemployment rate fell back to below 4 percent and a wider measure of underemployment fell by the most ever in addition annual wage growth was the best since 2009 and the economy created 12 000 more jobs in december and january than previously reported bringing the total for the two months to 538 000 we had warned that recent employment gains had overstated the underlying strength of the u s labor market said harm bandholz chief u s economist at unicredit research in new york and the correction now came in february with a bang rather than spread out over various months still the mixed report was another indication the economy which in july will mark a record 10 years of expansion is slowing and supports the federal reserve s patient approach toward further interest rate increases this year watch this zee business video here the economy is losing speed as the stimulus from a 1 5 trillion tax cut and increased government spending ebbs the record goods trade deficit is also hurting activity as well as slowing global economies growth estimates for the first quarter are around a 1 percent annualized rate economists polled by reuters had forecast nonfarm payrolls rose by 180 000 jobs last month in addition to the weather and rising worker shortages a stock market selloff and jump in u s treasury yields in late 2018 which tightened financial market conditions also likely curbed hiring the length of the average workweek fell to 34 4 hours last month from 34 5 hours in january all this report did was remind people that the economy is decelerating and a moderating economy doesn t create a massive number of new positions said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania u s stocks fell as the employment report added to concerns of softening global growth sparked by weak china export data and a prolonged slowdown in eurozone the dollar dropped against a basket of currencies u s treasury prices were mixed solid wage gains job gains over the last two months averaged 186 000 per month well above the roughly 100 000 needed to keep up with the working age population the unemployment rate fell two tenths of a percentage point to 3 8 percent in february also as federal government workers who were temporarily unemployed during a 35 day partial shutdown returned to work the longest shutdown in u s history ended on jan 25 a broader measure of unemployment which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment dropped to 7 3 percent the lowest since march 2001 from 8 1 percent in january the decline in the so called u6 rate was the largest since the bls launched the series in 1994 average hourly earnings rose 11 cents or 0 4 percent in february after gaining 0 1 percent in january that raised the annual increase in wages to 3 4 percent the biggest gain since april 2009 from 3 1 percent in january overall wage inflation remains moderate a report on thursday showed labor costs rising only 1 4 percent in 2018 the smallest gain since 2016 after increasing 2 2 percent in 2017 economists say employers have kept hiring at a strong pace despite low unemployment as more people returned to the labor force including students women and people who had dropped out to collect disability benefits they however say that source of labor supply is dwindling the labor force participation rate or the proportion of working age americans who have a job or are looking for one was unchanged last month at more than a five year high of 63 2 percent economists expect job growth to average about 150 000 this year last month employment at construction sites fell by 31 000 jobs the biggest drop since december 2013 after increasing by 53 000 in january the leisure and hospitality sector added no jobs after payrolls increased by 89 000 in january the manufacturing sector created 4 000 jobs the fewest since july 2017 after hiring 21 000 workers in january the diffusion index of manufacturing employment which measures the proportion of industries that showed job gains during the month fell to 51 3 in february weakness in capex and exports much of it tied to knock on effects from the tariffs and trade war confusion generally are likely behind the slowdown in hiring by the manufacturing sector said steve blitz chief u s economist at ts lombard in new york retail payrolls fell by 6 100 jobs there were also job losses in the utilities as well as transportation and warehousing industries government payrolls dropped by 5 000 jobs last month pulled down by declines both local and state government education professional and business services employment increased by 42 000 jobs in february the education and health care sector added only 4 000 jobs
we didn t know it at the time but 10 years ago this week things started looking up on march 9 2009 the s p 500 closed at 676 53 the lowest point it hit over the course of the great recession today the index stands at around 2750 although the implosion of the subprime real estate market is most frequently cited as the catalyst for the recession that historic downturn actually was the result of a perfect storm of economic occurrences said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america you had a bust in an asset bubble an inverted yield curve and an oil price spike he told nbc news on top of that a sudden unavailability of liquidity froze banking activities and precipitated a global financial crisis the federal reserve responded with the extraordinary steps of dropping the benchmark interest rate to 0 percent and embarking on quantitative easing programs that would eventually grow its balance sheet to 4 5 trillion both steps were radical ones calculated to pour money into the economy and jump start lending in addition to monetary policy congress passed a number of stimulus programs aimed at helping people dealing with foreclosures and job losses the first step in all this was arresting the decline with government programs that tried to take the position of the lender of last resort and basically trying to step in when private capital was too fearful said sameer samana senior global market strategist for the wells fargo investment institute there s kind of an inherent tendency for economies to recover said bruce mccain chief investment strategist for key private bank but the economy of late 2008 needed an extra push to get that momentum going at the early stage the monetary backstopping the federal reserve provided during the crisis was crucial it s less clear that the stimulus they ve provided since then has been effective for the economy as opposed to the market mccain said although the recession was officially over in june 2009 just three months after the stock market hit its trough many ordinary americans remained in dire financial straits consumers have been the key to growth said mark zandi chief economist of moody s analytics and until that spending rebounded the rest of the recovery remained muted too the missing ingredient jobs i think the tricky part is that main street is largely dependent on employment prospects samana said when businesses are uncertain about the future they re very reluctant to add additional workers he said it took an unprecedented six years before the record 9 million jobs that vanished in the recession reemerged north said we went through the slowest recovery since world war ii he said a lot of that may have been that people just stayed on the sidelines aided by expanded unemployment insurance and frustrated by employers who would only commit to filling jobs on a part time or temporary basis now a decade after the market trough unemployment is at a historic low and wage growth is managing to keep abreast of inflation albeit barely financial industry reforms and improved confidence among business leaders as well as consumers have lent stability to the nation s economic growth we re in a better place than we were 10 years ago zandi said the changes post crisis will make it less likely that we ll have the booms and the busts the banking system for example holds a lot more capital that makes it safer the system has much more liquidity than it did pre crisis we ve certainly come a long way with respect to the overall outlook of businesses and investors mccain said economic expansion for much of the recovery was muted but mccain suggests that this pace might have ultimately been critical for the longevity of our current growth cycle it s been a difficult time getting to here but when you have slower growth you can have growth for a longer period of time he said there s nothing inherently that says this cycle for the u s in particular has to end any time soon
workers are receiving the fattest wage increases since the great recession as employers struggle to find enough people to fill their ranks and employees have more leverage to demand higher pay and jump to better jobs wages grew 3 4 percent in the past year the government reported friday the fastest pace in nearly a decade and well above inflation suggesting employers are hustling to lure and retain workers many are slashing requirements for jobs and hiring workers quickly to prevent them from being scooped up by a competitor a far cry from the days when job seekers felt lucky to even get a callback the unemployment rate fell to 3 8 percent in february marking a year of sitting at or below 4 percent a level many economists regard as full employment when there are few people left who want jobs and can t get them hiring also cooled in february falling to a paltry 20 000 jobs gains economists have long predicted that the job growth would slow as the nation approached full employment and the pool of available workers shrunk dramatically giving current employees even more ability to ask for more money flexibility and promotions it s proven difficult to know if full employment is finally here as we re hiring signs abound people who weren t actively looking for jobs have started jumping back into the labor force suggesting there could be more untapped potential young women and hispanics have driven much of the labor force growth recently last month s disappointing job gains could also be a statistical blip from the weather or the lingering effects of the partial government shutdown many experts said but whether or not the nation is at the magical full employment mark there are clearer signs that the balance of power in labor market is shifting more toward employees we ve seen a spike in job postings that so no experience necessary or no prior experience required said julia pollak an economist at ziprecruiter a popular job site she said she has seen companies increasingly delete requirements like a college or high degree from job descriptions ron nelsen who runs a garage door business in las vegas called pioneer overhead door said a man in his late 20s showed up at the office door at 7 30 a m recently in work pants and white t shirt saying i need a job i m ready to go to work nelsen liked him immediately since he had experience installing garage doors and told him to come back for a longer interview at 2 p m but as the man turned to go nelsen changed his mind and hired him on the spot he was too afraid he d lose him to another construction company down the road before the afternoon as an employer 3 8 percent unemployment is not a good thing said nelsen who starts technicians at 15 an hour but said he s been bumping most of workers up to about 20 within months in order not to have them stolen away employers really do seem hungry for workers and prepared to do more than they did in the past to develop talent when they can t find talent pollak said it s not clear how long the good news will continue for workers many forecasters anticipate a u s recession in the next two years and the rest of the world is already slowing sharply and while things have picked up lately millions of americans are still shaking off years of stagnant wages and volatile personal finances we are seeing real fundamental improvements since 2015 but it s against a very low threshold for many workers said diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton only the top 10 percent have recovered the wealth they lost in the downturn according to research from the federal reserve that s adjusted for inflation for now employers are getting so desperate for people to hire that many are taking a chance on potential workers in ways they rarely did in the past ibm will often hire top mba students and recent phds in science or math fields even if there is no immediate job for them the company s chief economist martin fleming said because executives know they are competing for talent against google facebook and other tech giants tech companies have struggled to find highly skilled employees for a while but competition has picked up for lower skilled workers lately too the unemployment rate for workers who don t have a high school degree fell to 5 3 percent in february a record low since the labor department began tracking that statistic in 1992 wages for workers who aren t in management positions are actually growing faster 3 5 percent than the overall trend another indication of increased competition for people at the lower part of the income scale costco announced this week that it will raise pay for its entry level workers to 15 an hour up a dollar from its past increase 10 months ago nineteen states also raised their minimum wages in january helping boost pay for many workers in retail and hospitality sectors people are coming from the sidelines straight into employment said marianne wanamaker associate professor of economics at the university of tennessee and a member of president trump s american workforce policy advisory board wanamaker points out that 71 2 percent of new hires came from outside the labor force meaning an unusually high share weren t even hunting much for a job in the past month when employers lured them in the united states has had more job openings than unemployed people since june forcing employers to get more creative in their searches trump has been under pressure from business owners and some republicans in congress to expand programs for temporary workers from abroad despite his hardline immigration position trump has spoken on occasion about recognizing the need for foreign labor in a tight job market in a speech over the weekend to the conservative political action conference trump boasted about the low unemployment rate and said i got all these companies moving in they need workers we have to bring people into our country to work these great plants that are opening up all over the place but so far trump has shown little action on that front in addition to cracking down on illegal immigration the trump administration has tightened restrictions on legal immigration channels including the h 1b visa program that allows temporary employment to high skilled workers the president celebrated the latest jobs news friday telling reporters big news was that wages went up inflation has been a modest 1 6 percent in the past year according to the commerce department meaning wages for most workers are growing well above the cost of living federal reserve leaders have indicated they believe that even with the unemployment rate so low there may still be room for more hiring the central bank is holding off on raising interest rates any higher in the hope that even more people can get back to work if several more months of hiring is as weak as february that would signal a more serious slowdown the u s economy has been relatively healthy compared to the rest of the world though fears have recently spiked about the toll from trump s trade conflict the reality is the economy is slowing the question now is whether it s slowing for reasons associated with the trade war or because the rest of the world is slowing said torsten slok chief international economist at deutsche bank but many economists said the dip in hiring is more likely the result of brutal weather in february that saw a deep freeze in much of the midwest a lot of the weakness in hiring looks like it was due to seasonal factors like very cold weather said beth ann bovino chief u s economist at s p if the party was over we wouldn t see those wages coming in so strong there were also some quirks in the hiring data so far this year as the labor department has tried to appropriately take into account workers who were furloughed during the shutdown january saw a particularly strong 311 000 jobs added so the anticipation was for a weaker february

a few years ago when the inter american development bank idb was launching our hemisphere s largest microfinance conference for small and medium enterprises in jamaica we had a special item designed to infuse local culture in the proceedings talented musicians did a cover of jimmy cliff s iconic anthem you can get it if you really want it was a stirring and powerful reminder of the importance of determination in the quest to achieve anything worthwhile this month for the first time in about 20 years jamaica s debt is expected to fall to 96 per cent of its gross domestic product gdp moving from historic highs of as much as 147 per cent it is timely and convincing evidence that you can indeed get it if you really want the reality is that similar to jamaica s ability to amaze in the world of sport and entertainment its macroeconomic transformation is just as inspiring it s an example of how fiscal discipline and citizens support for tough measures can work to restore stability in a relatively short time and under different political administrations it is also a strong example of the power of partnership in realising a vision to improve lives headlines delivered to your inbox sign up for the gleaner s morning and evening newsletters for the idb our partnership with jamaica has been invaluable it proves that both countries and their multilateral partners can adapt and that the most effective support needs to be dynamic and responsive to evolving needs and circumstances the idb along with the international monetary fund imf and the world bank has been a key pillar of multilateral support for jamaica in its efforts to stabilise and transform its economy since 2010 since that time the idb has contributed to the design and implementation of a number of crucial reforms including the introduction of jamaica s fiscal responsibility framework and significant public sector restructuring which have and will continue to serve as the cornerstones of sound and sustainable economic and fiscal policies for years to come these and other related efforts have supported jamaica s tremendous progress with debt reduction while also helping to usher in an unprecedented moderation of inflation and interest rates that has benefited all of jamaica s more than 2 9 million citizens in this context jamaicans deserve tremendous credit for weathering the economic implications of a tremendous front loaded fiscal adjustment one of the most significant ever undertaken in this effort jamaica benefited from an unwavering commitment from all domestic stakeholders that is the government civil society the financial community as well as the private sector and unions the key difference between this successful episode of reform and failed attempts that preceded it was the public s commitment to change it was this steadfast commitment that allowed two different elected governments from opposing parties to sustain the effort over such a long period not the size of the emergency lending programme or its technical nuances it is within this context that the idb focused its support and partnership with the objective of providing the government with advice and technical expertise and financial support directed to jamaica s most vulnerable communities idb s efforts were crucial in its dual role as jamaica s most significant multilateral lender and committed technical partner the idb s efforts were crucial for developing and sustaining public support over time and across two administrations we at the idb realised that business as usual was not enough we adapted our support and engagement to best serve the people of jamaica in a difficult time through coordination with other multilateral and bilateral partners we were able to provide technical assistance and sequenced support to help sustain public backing for painful reforms as the success of the programme became more evident and the commitment to reforms became more deeply engrained we increased and adapted our support to the changing circumstances in this context we are proud to be a part of jamaica s inspiring story of determination and transformation at present our main focus is supporting the government in completing key reforms that are under way including modernisation of the public sector and ensuring that the financial system is more inclusive and able to serve the needs of jamaicans looking forward we remain a committed partner of jamaica as it undertakes the next generation of programmes and reforms that step beyond economic stabilisation and focus on structural transformation with the aim of more rapidly raising living standards while also ensuring that faster development does not compromise social and environmental sustainability we also aim to help make jamaica a more competitive economy which involves supporting the prime minister s goal of becoming the region s first digital society jamaica must also become more resilient to external shocks and natural disasters and that is why we are providing contingent financial and other support to help weather future storms it would have been hard to imagine how strong resilient and full of promise jamaica s economic future is today a mere decade ago we at the idb are proud to have supported jamaica in this miraculous transformation and would like to recognise the tremendous efforts undertaken by jamaica s partners authorities and most of all its people jamaicans above all others deserve credit for this success ultimately it will be up to the people of jamaica to help sustain this progress into the future we at the inter american development bank stand ready to continue supporting jamaicans in working towards a more sustainable productive and prosperous future for their nation ultimately the idb s mandate continues to be to improve lives by creating a vibrant sustainable climate smart economy where people are safe productive and happy where you can get it if you

fool so with that said let s turn to our second quarter fiscal 2019 results we are pleased with our overall results for the quarter with strong growth in visitation and spending compared to the prior year in the pre holiday period destination guest visitation in our u s resorts was less than expected which we attribute to guest concerns after two prior years of poor pre holiday conditions our destination guest visitation was largely in line with expectations during the key holiday weeks and through the remainder of january throughout the quarter with the favorable conditions at our u s resorts we saw strong visitation growth among our local guests who are primarily pass purchasers our colorado and utah resorts experienced strong visitation during the holidays and through the remainder of the quarter that aligned with our expectations advertisement advertisement whistler blackcomb and tahoe resorts saw periods of strong visitation in the holiday and post holiday periods that have also been impacted by numerous weather events that have negatively impacted their results in addition international visitation at whistler blackcomb was below the prior year throughout the quarter our northeast resorts are off to a great start to the season as we continue to benefit from good conditions and the first season with okemo and mount sunapee as part of the network conditions across the network are setup well for the remainder of the season including results from triple peaks and stevens pass in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 total lift revenue increased 17 2 driven by a 27 growth in skier visitation total effective ticket price decreased 7 8 in the second quarter compared to the prior year primarily due to higher skier visitation by season pass holders and the impact of the new military epic pass partially offset by price increases in both our lift ticket and season pass products excluding season pass holders effective ticket price increased 8 3 compared to the prior year the strong rebound in visitation and spending compared to the prior year along with the addition of triple peaks and stevens pass drove a 15 1 increase in the ski school revenue and a 21 3 increase in dining revenue and an 11 3 increase in retail and rental revenue compared to the prior year now i would like to turn the call over to michael to further discuss our financial results our season to date metrics and our updated outlook michael barkin chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thanks rob and good morning everyone as rob mentioned we are pleased with our second quarter performance with strong growth in visitation and spending compared to the prior year resort net revenue was 849 3 million an increase of 15 6 compared to the prior year resort reported ebitda was 358 million an increase of 15 9 compared to the prior year mountain revenue was 776 1 million up 15 7 from the prior year while mountain reported ebitda was 352 2 million for the second quarter 15 4 from the prior year our lodging results for the second fiscal quarter were positive with revenue excluding payroll costs reimbursements increasing 16 1 compared to the prior year primarily due to the incremental operations of triple peaks the average daily rate decrease compared to the prior year primarily as a result of the inclusion of the triple peaks resorts as well as incremental managed tahoe lodging properties that we did not manage in the prior year all of which generate a lower average daily rate as compared to our broader lodging segment net income attributable to vail resorts was 206 3 million or 5 02 per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to net income of 235 7 million or 5 67 per diluted share for the same period in the prior year fiscal 2018 second quarter net income included a onetime provisional net tax benefit of approximately 64 6 million or 1 55 per diluted share related to u s tax reform legislation additionally fiscal 2019 second quarter net income included the after tax effect of acquisition and integration related expenses of 2 2 million and approximately 1 million of headwind from currency translation primarily related to operations at whistler blackcomb which the company calculated by applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior period results our balance sheet remains very strong we ended the second quarter with 158 6 million of cash on hand and our net debt was 1 9 times trailing 12 months total reported ebitda turning now to our season to date metrics for the period from the beginning of the ski season through sunday march 3 2019 and for the prior year period through sunday march 4 2018 the reported ski season metrics are for our north american mountain resorts and the metrics exclude results from perisher and our urban ski areas in both periods advertisement advertisement the reported ski season metrics include growth for season pass revenue based on estimated fiscal 2019 north american season pass sales compared to fiscal 2018 north american season pass sales and the metrics are adjusted as if stevens pass and triple peaks llc were owned in both periods and adjusted to eliminate the impact of foreign currency by applying current period exchange rates to the prior period for whistler blackcomb s results this is interim period data and is subject to fiscal quarter end review and adjustments as expected our season to date growth rates came down from our reported metrics in january given that last year conditions improved in the post holiday period for our colorado resorts total lift revenue at the company s north american mountain resorts including an allocated portion of season pass revenue for each applicable period was up 9 6 compared to the prior year season to date period our ski school revenue increased 7 4 dining revenue increased 7 9 and resort retail and rental revenue increased 7 3 all compared to the prior year season to date period total skier visits were up 7 9 compared to the prior year season to date period as noted in our january press release we are lowering our guidance for fiscal 2019 primarily due to the disappointing results from destination visitation in the pre holiday period and also due to shortfalls from expectations at whistler blackcomb and our tahoe resorts our tahoe resorts were the most impacted from numerous intense weather events which impacted travel to the resorts and prevented the mountains from being fully open or open at all on certain days whistler blackcomb was also adversely impacted by weather events in addition to a decline in international visitation which resulted in lower growth after three years of significant revenue increases at whistler blackcomb we now expect resort reported ebitda to offer fiscal 2019 to be between 690 million and 710 million which remains generally consistent with our expectations in january our guidance is predicated on current canadian and australian foreign exchange rates of 0 75 and 0 71 respectively for each currency to the u s dollar for the remainder of the fiscal year which represents an estimated 4 million reduction in resort reported ebitda from the currency rates included in the guidance we issued in september 2018 of which nearly half has been realized year to date the updated guidance incorporates 12 million of acquisition and integration expenses including 2 million for the recently announced falls creek and hotham resorts transaction the guidance does not incorporate any expected operating results or stamp duty payments for falls creek and hotham which we plan to update following the closing of the transactions our guidance assumes normal conditions at our resorts and a stable economic environment for the remainder of the fiscal year advertisement advertisement we were very pleased to announce in february that we were that we entered into an agreement to acquire the ski resorts at falls creek alpine resort and hotham alpine resort in victoria australia from living in leisure australia group a subsidiary of merlin entertainments for a purchase price of approximately aud 174 million subject to certain adjustments and closing including an increase or a reduction in the price for operating losses or gains incurred for the period from december 29 2018 through closing the company also expects to pay a stamp duty which we estimate will be approximately aud 4 million associated with the closing of the transaction falls creek and hotham are expected to generate combined incremental resort reported ebitda of approximately aud 18 million or approximately usd 13 million during their first 12 months of operations following the acquisition excluding any integration expense after the closing of the transaction anual ongoing capital expenditures are expected to increase by approximately aud 4 million to aud 5 million or approximately usd 3 million to usd 4 million to support the addition of these two resorts specific to this transaction we anticipate fiscal 2019 acquisition related expenses of approximately usd 2 million the transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and we anticipate that the closing will occur prior to the commencement of the australian ski season in june 2019 i ll now turn the call back over to rob rob katz chief executive officer

flexibility and convenience that come with being a passholder the season pass program has grown to comprise 47 of fiscal 2018 lift revenue however despite our success in converting guests to a pass there is still a meaningful portion of our guest base that currently purchases daily lift tickets with an average frequency estimated at 2 3 annual skier visits purchaser epic for everyone provides all of our guests with the opportunity to participate in season pass discounts and provides first time and occasional skiers greater access to our resorts giving us the opportunity to expand the sport and grow the entire industry this past year we launched the new military epic pass which delivered nearly 100 000 new passholders to our program representing an incredible opportunity for our company

purchase a season pass before our spring selling deadline will receive 10 discounted buddy tickets up from six the year before we are also pleased to begin our new pass partnerships with sun valley and snow basin as well as in hokkaido japan in closing i want to take a moment to thank all of our vail resorts employees for their passion and tireless dedication to deliver an experience of a lifetime to our guests at this time michael and i would be happy to answer your questions operator we are now ready for questions questions and answers operator thank you sir we ll take our first question from felicia hendrix with barclays advertisement advertisement felicia hendrix barclays analyst hi good morning rob katz chief executive officer good morning felicia hendrix barclays analyst rob hi rob my goal is this is for either one of you i was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more going back to the weather challenges you saw in tahoe and the tough comps that you regarding international visitation at at whistler i m just wondering a few things with each of those items the first how much did each of these items affect your ebitda guidance and what impact did they have on your season to date data that you reported i m also wondering if you could give us some data just on how many days you lost in tahoe and then at whistler wondering if the drop in international visitation was mostly coming from latin america you ve seen strength there over the past several years for a variety of different reasons or are you seeing also weak demand from europe rob katz chief executive officer yes what i would say is i think i m not sure we can provide more detail on the closure days though obviously i think the weather and the the open close status of our resorts is out there i do think it is one of the things that comes along with having great snow which obviously all of our resorts do is that the timing of those storms and when they hit can significantly impact business if it happens on a weekend or a peak period and it s it s challenging to make up those days it s not like two days later you necessarily make it up because those guests often have have left and we do see a pretty big impact from that so i d say that was a headwind countering the tailwind from the obviously great snow and great conditions and we have factored obviously that into our guidance in terms of what we ve already experienced and factored some of that into the rest of the season though i think that certainly our hope is is that as we go through the rest of the season we see a little bit of a moderation of that and and i think that can really benefit the spring i think on international it was i would say most of the challenge we saw in the international business that was blackcomb is a little bit on the lower price a business that the resort had a certain historically done i think both our own pricing strategies and even more important than that just the cost of lodging in the whistler blackcomb market has come up quite a bit over the last couple of years and in part i think seeing a little bit of that slowdown maybe happened a little bit quicker than we might have expected but was certainly something that we thought over the long haul made sense given that the resort had grown so significantly over the prior three years we think it s critical to protect the experience at whistler blackcomb for the long term and also continue to make room i think for what s going to be a growing business out of china and southeast asia so i see whistler a little bit in a in a transition moment and i think actually very well positioned for the future but certainly i think a little bit of again a headwind on the international side this year i d say fairly broad based but less i d say latin america than the other countries felicia hendrix barclays analyst ok and again just in terms of the ebitda guidance that you provided today you won t quantify kind of how much tahoe and whistler combined were headwinds rob katz chief executive officer well yes i mean i guess what i s say is that the change in guidance from the beginning of the year i think certainly the biggest part of that was still going to be the early season as we i think we have disclosed before but no we re not providing specific guidance at this time as to exactly how much the weather impacted it s also it is obviously that if you looked at our results what i think for any of our resorts if there s a resort like heavenly you d see some pretty high variation up and down in terms of our expectation but the downs during those snowfall periods have been pretty significant so and we ll take that out and think about maybe there is a better way for us to kind of share or talk about this potentially at the investor conference next week felicia hendrix barclays analyst ok thanks and then just to clarify so on that epic day pass we ve just gotten a bunch of questions on that and there s kind of two parts to this so some of the questions we got about the trade off you re making in terms of revenues by transitioning people onto the day pass versus buying a more expensive ticket at the window so i think we all know that you rather have those folks in your database building stability and loyalty but just walking if you could just walk us through any noise that that might create in your numbers next year if the demand for the product is what you expect it to be and then we ve also gotten questions about just the driver behind the decision would you view it as more of an offensive move just in terms of continuation of your strategy that you ve had now for 11 years or defensive because of the past competition you faced rob katz chief executive officer yeah i think i ll take the second one first i would say we view it very much as a continuation of our own strategy that has been in place for years and certainly having nothing to do with icon and and i think the fact that we have continued to grow this season pass program and i think one of the things that that is out there is there are a lot of people who are of many many destination local guests who are out there for those folks who are kind of that four plus day skier obviously we ve had products that make sense for them but there is a huge other part of the market that s quite important to the resort business that they re just lower frequency and i think our strategy has been to start with the highest volume skier get that to convert and then slowly but surely move folks into our products that have a potentially lower frequency so we introduced a number of years back the epic seven day that was one step toward that then we introduced the epic four day and now we feel like we re at a point in our maturity the complexity of going after a lower frequency guest for a season pass we think our program and our tools are in place to actually do that in a more successful way and in our minds if you look at the discounts that we re offering they are kind of in line with the discounts that we had offered before on the epic four day and the epic seven day with obviously slightly higher discounts for more days we did this year decide to introduce the off peak discount because we think that s a great flow through opportunity for us to potentially incent people to come in those off peak times and we do see a lot of our lot of the epic four day a lot of the epic seven day historically have been used in more peak times so this was an opportunity to kind of broad in that and in terms of the impact on our financials i would say it s consistent with what you ve seen which is that there it is in our minds as we transition people to in a kind of day of product to an advanced product we obviously take a step back on price but then obviously we then build from there and have a pretty consistent price increase strategy so that initial conversion has some potentially immediate dilution but in our minds when we look over a multi year period we see that trade off as quite positive so the stability that you get the return rate that s higher for season pass the guest satisfaction that s higher all of that right is kind of we think in our minds we think about as lifetime value of guest which goes up significantly and it s definitely worth that trade off felicia hendrix barclays analyst thank you that was very helpful operator and we ll take our next question from brett andress with keybanc dan charrow keybanc capital markets analyst hey guys this is dan charrow on for brett congrats on the quarter just touching on the outlook for the rest of the season would breckenridge now post continue operations through memorial day can you talk about maybe any potential extension to the ski season that you re contemplating in the guide and what would we have to see over the next month or so in colorado or more broadly for you to get more constructive about a lengthier season than we ve seen in the past couple of years rob katz chief executive officer i would say i think we have definitely factored in the current season into our guidance and i think to the extent that there were no other extensions i don t think that would have a material impact on our results for this year i think certainly we re going to continue to breckenridge obviously we ve already made our commitment on there obviously conditions permitting to go all the way through memorial day we think that s an important long term strategy for us in colorado i think in tahoe obviously we ll continue to monitor conditions we just announced a little while ago that we were extending each of the three resorts and i think we ll continue to monitor it to the extent that it seems like the conditions are still strong demand is still there yes we will consider that again i think that s more about the experience we re providing and the season long opportunity that we see that is there less about necessarily that having a material impact on our results for the year dan charrow keybanc capital markets analyst got it thanks helpful and wondering if you can provide any color around the falls creek and hotham resorts it seems like those are a nice way to expand the australian footprint a bit closer to some of the larger cities and from a total attendance perspective should we think about those as maybe a third of the size of perisher and any early indications around how the inclusion in the network may impact the overseas epic cohort rob katz chief executive officer yes i mean i think we re very excited about the falls creek and hotham deals i think on it on a couple of basis one we clearly have the experience now from perisher serving the city in new south wales market and have had a lot of success with perisher and the epic australia pass there but because perisher largely does serve that region we ve not had the same opportunity with the melbourne and victoria markets and so using the the opportunity to use the same model in melbourne and victoria more broadly is quite compelling and we do feel very good about both falls creek which really offers a really great kind of family oriented experience paired with hotham which has a lot more advanced skiing the two of those together really present a compelling opportunity for really the full skier population in that area so we feel like the opportunity to roll out the epic australia pass is great and then from there right clearly the strategy which we ve already executed against is to build that connection to north america primarily and particularly relative to when we did perisher in 2015 we now have whistler blackcomb which is one of the right primary destinations for australian skiers and so to be able to offer that to this new guest base to collect data and market directly through those guests as well as to our two partnerships in japan yes offers a very compelling opportunity for us in that market so we feel like yes really well strategically positioned certainly important as we look at asia in the longer term and in terms of size i think probably the best comparison is to the kind of year one ebitda that we put out relative to perisher the two together are are in the same ballpark dan charrow keybanc capital markets analyst got it great thanks very helpful operator and our next question comes from shaun kelley with bank of america shaun kelly bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning everyone i just want to go back to felicia s question to start rob i think you mentioned sort of pretty clearly the move with all the new announced products and sort of what do you think that might do for pricing but could you talk a little bit about what it also might mean for sort of yields and some of the ancillary spending you re seeing out there just as you continue to make the transition to the advanced products and kind of what your experience was a military this year relative to expectation rob katz chief executive officer well i think yes two definitely different pieces there i think certainly when we see somebody move from a paid lift ticket to a season pass we tend to see higher frequency and that obviously helps ancillary as well often it isn t that the yield per day may go down if somebody is adding days to their season but the total right that we re getting from somebody over a season goes up and in our mind again when we re thinking about that multi year frequency right how often we will see somebody over a three to four year period we see that the total revenue opportunity is being much better to the extent that they re on a pass versus on a lift ticket on almost every metric on military has performed great in terms of obviously the number of people who went into the program we ve seen good frequency from a military pass holders i think less spend per visit than we would see from other destination guests that s not totally surprising to us just because obviously the lower price made it accessible to a lot of folks who may not have had necessarily the budget to that a lot of our other destination guests have but in total highly incremental for this season shaun kelly bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you and then on the other question just as we think about the sort of overall blend between destination and the local visitation is just what do you think it would take to see an upside surprise from sort of destination spending at this point in the cycle it seems like some of the benefits that we saw are really from the upside on visitation given the strong condition it seems like in peak periods you re pretty optimized but is there a move to shoulder and i think you mentioned that a little bit in maybe of the target offerings or anything that you could do to really optimize what you re seeing in destination spending outside of those peaks rob katz chief executive officer well i would say yes i think two things one is i think we need to get people into the resort right in the off peak periods and that s one of the strategies i think with our epic day pass product launch i think one of the things that we see by the way even is just that a lot of our epic four day holders will tend to use that product in christmas or early part of january and it goes down as you go through the season and so actually the whole entirety of spring break is actually not a peak period in terms of the restrictions on the pass so the epic day pass which is about 15 lower than the restricted version is about 15 lower than the unrestricted version and actually gets you access to spring break so we re really hoping to actually move a lot of these folks who are that spring break traveler to potentially consider a pass even though obviously they re there then buying even further in advance but for us obviously that s a big win i think on the ancillary spend i think where we see the biggest opportunity is that we have not yet taken the same marketing and data driven sophistication that we have around pass and that we re starting right to really use for lift tickets we ve not really taken that to ski school or rental or even fnb in some respects and so we actually see an opportunity and we ve talked about that i think in prior years on this progression we re trying to kind of take the biggest and best opportunity first and then keep moving through each piece of our revenue stream and so we do think that there is an opportunity to really be i d say go up a whole another level in how we engage our guests to take these products and obviously each of these products deliver pretty strong flow through especially ski school and a relatively small percentage of our total visitors actually use ski school so in our minds that s definitely on our roadmap over the next couple of years shaun kelly bank of america merrill lynch analyst great last question for me would just be sort of run rate g a expense i mean it s a little difficult with all the m a activity obviously in some of your centralized investment but when you look at sort of a same resort or same mountain basis can you help give us a little bit of a guidepost of what type of labor inflation you re seeing out there right now obviously operate in some markets where that s significant i think you may still have some of the investments you made in your workforce following tax reform could you give us a sense of what your kind of current market condition you re seeing on a same resort or same mountain basis rob katz chief executive officer yes i don t think i can give you as a stat but i guess right off the top here maybe that s something we can address down the road but i would say that we are seeing wage pressure and i think we identified that for going into this year one of the headwinds was 15 million in wage investments over and above kind of the normal inflation that we ve seen previously i think that s helped and that s certainly made progress but i would expect that the same pressures that we re seeing you that everyone is seeing across the country are pressures that we will continue to feel and i think again like that like we re seeing in the rest of the lodging industry so in our minds i think this is going to continue to be i think this year may have been more significant kind of one time in terms of the headwind but as we go forward i think that s a topic that s going to be a challenge until there s some shift in the employment market shaun kelly bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you very much rob katz chief executive officer thanks operator and our next question comes from ryan sundby with william blair ryan sundby william blair analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions rob katz chief executive officer sure ryan sundby william blair analyst just going to try and follow up on felixia and shaun s question on the incrementality of the epic day pass is there can you provide i guess any color on the breakdown and size between the big kind of the base epic local and foreign seven day passes and then as we go through the pass filing season next year or the summer do you plan to provide kind of a similar baseline view like we did with epic this year versus military or all these kind of get combined going forward rob katz chief executive officer so what i say is i think we re not i don t think we re providing additional color on the breakdown among our passes i think on incrementality we do think there s significant opportunity with the epic day pass on with these lower frequency guests obviously that will be at a lower price point so from a revenue perspective certainly there would be some dilution on epp but in our minds we are focused on that incrementality i think the incrementality that we see yes is through more consistent more stable return rates over a multi year period and the stability that we re looking for plus obviously the ability to then communicate with that guest in a more targeted and more personalized way so we that s one benefit the other benefit we see is for some of our pass holders that churn out of the program one of the top reasons that they give for why they churn out is that they re not they don t think they re going to ski enough next year to justify a pass and so in our minds this is now addressing one of the most important concerns people have which is their own ski frequency in terms of how how or why they buy a pass in terms of reporting yes we will take a look at how to best portray right the results i don t think i don t think this will be a similar situation to military where with epic day pass that we can somehow pull out more discretely the entirety of the program because obviously we have a lot of people already in an epic seven and in epic four but we absolutely when we get to june and do our first report we will definitely look at how can we provide some insight that we think is helpful to investors in terms of understanding the impact of the overall program and our results today ryan sundby william blair analyst great that would be very helpful and then rob i guess with the the better early season snow this year and investments that are coming in snowmaking capabilities do you see the weakness this year around destination guests in the pre holiday period is more of a one time event or should we kind of expect some kind of behavior change that kind of continues i guess into the future rob katz chief executive officer i don t know i think obviously we felt that we looked at the snow coverage and the conditions this year and the early season and we looked back a few years ago to when we had a very good early season and expected to see kind of a repeat of that and we didn t and so i don t know whether that could be that that it s two years of tough snow and people are not willing to have the confidence to book again if next year is good i don t know whether people will know whether things will change in this year was kind of a one time event it ll change next year or this is a longer piece on the chain side it may be that yes that as we move more and more people to pass that pass skier obviously is more likely to be a local skier so we may not see that lift ticket buyer as much show up but when you look back historically i think you do see whether it s been in tahoe or in colorado you do see these lags in terms of when people get comfortable again to show back up and have confidence in the weather and i think that s something that i would imagine might happen again but that s certainly not something that we can predict at this point ryan sundby william blair analyst great thanks for that rob katz chief executive officer thanks operator and our next question comes from tyler batory with janney capital markets tyler batory janney capital markets analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my question just want to follow up on some of the other questions here and rob i know you ve discussed this before but now that we re basically through the entire ski season any updated thoughts on how you icon past may or may not have influenced your results rob katz chief executive officer well one i would say is we still have a lot of season to go so we re not done just yet and obviously the march and april time periods are just to put that out there is still significant obviously and obviously q3 in total is significant i think that as we talked about before it s a little hard for us to say i think that we know again having seen the growth in our season pass program last year even if it was a little less than maybe what we had hoped for was still pretty strong growth and obviously we ve seen strong growth this year versus last year our obviously our colorado and utah resorts have really been on expectations for that once we got into holidays and beyond so to me i guess what i would say is it is a it s hard for us to know whether that has any impact from icon i think it s an important point though broadly is that our resorts have been competing with the resorts that are in the icon pass truly for 50 years in many cases and they ve always been great competitors and they re great resorts and so the fact that there is a new pass isn t that s not new and obviously even the icon pass was replacing many other passes that were out there that we were competing with before and so i there s no doubt that i think the icon is a great product and i think they ve done a very nice job with that and to me i i m sure it has some impact but i don t think it has had a structural change to the primary drivers of our business again because most of these dynamics existed even two years ago tyler batory janney capital markets analyst ok got it that s helpful and then i wanted to ask on the partnerships that you guys have in japan do you think those relationships have been an incremental driver of your pass sales are you seeing folks using their privileges to go visit those properties and then any updates as far as how you re thinking about partnerships or outright acquisitions in that market rob katz chief executive officer i think we we ll be sharing more information about pass sales in australia when we get to our june earnings call i would say that we do feel like it s definitely been a positive and we certainly i mean just from guest enthusiasm alone i think when we added results to having a resort in hokkaido i think is a very meaningful addition to that market and i think we having the two choices now of and going forward i think will absolutely give us a boost i also think that adding the melbourne market in terms of hotham and falls creek again just from guest enthusiasm in terms of what we see and hear and read and what s coming through communication channels yes again i think people are quite excited about the opportunity actual the impact to actual results will be a little bit hard to tell but we ll be able to at least share more data on that in june tyler batory janney capital markets analyst ok great and then just last one for me a housekeeping item the real estate ebitda guide the midpoint were flat i think you re down 5 what s driving that is there any way to think about how the real estate could flow in the third quarter or the fourth quarter rob katz chief executive officer yes as we ve talked about before the real estate is a little bit lumpy just in that it largely tracks with kind of primarily land sales at this point and so as as the timing of various deals comes together or moves that can impact guidance within any one year and so we obviously make our make our best estimates of that at the start of the year and then update that as it goes tyler batory janney capital markets analyst ok that s all for me see you next week rob katz chief executive officer thanks michael barkin chief financial officer thanks operator our next question is from brad boyer with stifel brad boyer stifel financial corp analyst yes guys thanks for taking the questions first question is just around what you re seeing today in the m a environment particularly in north america and taking that a step further just curious if you guys are getting a little bit more receptive and comfortable with pursuing partnership arrangements as opposed to owning resorts outright just thinking about the sun valley and announcements thanks rob katz chief executive officer i think i don t think we can comment on the environment per se but i think we re certainly still aggressive about adding resorts that we think will make our network more powerful we re going to be patient and disciplined for the right opportunity in some cases when we think we have a good opportunity the owners of that resort are not interested in selling and that discussion can sometimes morph into a partnership discussion and i think we re going to be selective about those partnerships much like we are with acquisitions so i don t think our goal is really not to dilute the experience the selection of resorts the power of the network it s really for those resorts that we think can be highly incremental so we ll still be open to it but i think just like on acquisitions we re going to be incredibly disciplined about it brad boyer stifel financial corp analyst helpful and then just a second one i mean probably splitting hairs here a little bit but it looks like you guys are accelerating some of the year one investment in the acquired resorts could you just talk a little bit about the drivers behind that rob katz chief executive officer yes i think that was just us ultimately i think when we put out some of that original guidance it was only a month and a half i think after we ve closed the deal and so i think we had made an initial pass of what we thought we could get done in the first year and then i think with the benefit of a little more time we re able to then identify ok how much of this could we get done in this first year i would say our goal was to get anything to get done this year would be a positive so that s why we saw some additional pportunities and yes just assessed the full plan for this year in greater detail and i think that was a good thing brad boyer stifel financial corp analyst thanks a lot that s all for me operator and our next question comes from chris woronka with deutsche bank chris woronka deutsche bank analyst hey good morning guys i wanted to ask you on the new build your own or daily epic pass for next year does that move you closer to maybe the lower price point being able to do more of a monthly or subscription model the second part of that is is this do you view it internally as more of like an experiment or more something you re pretty sure is going to be permanent going forward rob katz chief executive officer so on the monthly piece we have taken an approach toward how people pay for their pass by only charging 49 down in the spring and then the full amount of the payment in september and what we ve seen is that that has been pretty compelling for people who are buying their pass in the spring or earlier than that and it s a good competitive differentiation for us and something that we ve been pretty successful with for a lot of years i don t see us going into a plan where people could pay for it over the term the season because i think that would create risk on the commitment that we d be getting so we re always going to essentially say that folks have to pay for their pass before the season begins so that ll be i don t see us moving off of that yes we don t see this as an experiment we very much see this as a logical extension of what we ve already done i think it s true that there are unknowns we don t know how how fast guests will migrate to this product i think if you look back historically it does take a number of years even when the discount is great even when the benefits are great it still takes guests who have not focused on buying a pass a number of years to to really move the needle and we ve seen that in almost every initiative we ve had and i ve no doubt we ll see that here with epic day pass so we don t know that and sure we don t know exactly the return rates of that and the frequency piece but in the end i think we ve seen enough of the benefit on the stability side for from our existing products that we re quite confident that this will be able to deliver those same kind of opportunities for the company chris woronka deutsche bank analyst ok very good that s all for me thanks rob rob katz chief executive officer thanks operator and our next question comes to us from brennan matthews with berenberg brennan matthews berenberg capital analyst hi thank you for taking my question just one here and that s on the recent decision by i think to end the partnership with you do you expect this will have any impact on pass sales for next season again hard to say at this point i think we feel like the product that we re offering certainly so we had a couple of different things one was on the epic pass and the epic local pass and i think on those we certainly feel like we have a terrific collection of resorts and certainly within colorado obviously we ve added and then added telluride to the average pass so i think we ve provided a lot of value i think by having keystone open being planning to be one of the first opened in the country in terms of resorts and then breckenridge opened through memorial day we feel like we re giving our guests a lot of the benefit that did offer and obviously it s great resort and then we replaced the keystone pass with the keystone plus pass which also we think offers a pretty compelling opportunity for folks that said it s a big transition been in our portfolio for a long time and so yes idon t think we have perfect information on necessarily what the impact is but we certainly think we re offering a pretty compelling product even without them ok that s all for me thank you very much rob katz chief executive officer ok operator and there are no further questions in the queue at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any concluding remarks rob katz chief executive officer thank you operator this concludes our fiscal second quarter 2019 earnings call thanks to everyone who joined us on the conference call today please feel free to contact me or michael directly

workers are receiving the fattest wage increases since the great recession as employers struggle to find enough people to fill their ranks and employees have more leverage to demand higher pay and jump to better jobs wages grew 3 4 percent in the past year the government reported friday the fastest pace in nearly a decade and well above inflation suggesting that employers are hustling to lure and retain workers many are slashing requirements for jobs and are hiring workers quickly to prevent them from being scooped up by competitors a far cry from the days when job seekers felt lucky to even get a callback the unemployment rate fell to 3 8 percent in february marking one year of sitting at or below 4 percent a level many economists regard as full employment when there are few people left who want jobs and cannot get them advertisement job creation also cooled in february falling to a paltry 20 000 jobs gained economists have long predicted that the job growth would slow as the nation approached full employment and the pool of available workers shrank dramatically giving current employees even more ability to ask for more money flexibility and promotions knowing whether full employment is finally here is difficult as we re hiring signs abound people who were not actively looking for jobs have started jumping back into the labor force suggesting that there could be more untapped potential young women and hispanics have driven much of the labor force growth recently last month s disappointing jobs gains could also be a statistical blip because of weather or the lingering effects of the partial government shutdown many experts said advertisement but regardless of whether the nation is at the magical full employment mark there are clearer signs that the balance of power in the labor market is shifting toward employees we ve seen a spike in job postings that say no experience necessary or no prior experience required said julia pollak an economist at ziprecruiter a popular job site the site has seen companies increasingly delete requirements such as a college degree or high school diploma from job descriptions ron nelsen who runs a garage door business in las vegas called pioneer overhead door said a man in his late 20s showed up at the office at 7 30 a m recently in work pants and white t shirt saying i need a job i m ready to go to work nelsen liked him immediately since he had experience installing garage doors and told him to come back for a longer interview at 2 p m but as the man turned to go nelsen changed his mind and hired him on the spot he was afraid he would lose him to another construction company down the road before the afternoon advertisement as an employer 3 8 percent unemployment is not a good thing said nelsen who starts technicians at 15 an hour but said he has been bumping most of workers up to about 20 within months to prevent their being hired away employers really do seem hungry for workers and prepared to do more than they did in the past to develop talent when they can t find talent pollak said how long the good news will continue for workers is unclear many forecasters anticipate a u s recession in the next two years and the rest of the world economy is already slowing and while things have picked up lately in the united states millions of americans are still shaking off years of stagnant wages and volatile personal finances we are seeing real fundamental improvements since 2015 but it s against a very low threshold for many workers said diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton advertisement only the top 10 percent have fully recovered the wealth they lost in the downturn according to research from the federal reserve that takes inflation into account parts of the country are also still experiencing rough times and growing numbers of employers are making it more difficult for workers to take jobs elsewhere by making them sign noncompete contracts but many employers are becoming so desperate for people to hire that many are taking a chance on potential workers in ways they rarely did in the past ibm will often hire top mba students and recent phds in science or math fields even if there are no immediate specific jobs for them company chief economist martin fleming said because executives know they are competing for talent with google facebook and other technology giants tech companies have struggled for a while to find highly skilled employees but competition has picked up for lower skilled workers lately too advertisement the unemployment rate for workers without high school diplomas fell to 5 3 percent in february a record low since the labor department began tracking that statistic in 1992 wages for workers who are not in management positions are growing faster at a rate of 3 5 percent than the overall trend another indication of increased competition for workers at the lower part of the income scale costco announced this week that it is raising pay for its entry level workers to 15 an hour up a dollar from an increase nine months ago nineteen states also raised their minimum wages in january helping to boost pay for many workers in retail and hospitality sectors people are coming from the sidelines straight into employment said marianne wanamaker an associate professor of economics at the university of tennessee and a member of president trump s american workforce policy advisory board advertisement wanamaker points out that 72 percent of new hires came from outside the labor force meaning an unusually high share were not even hunting much for jobs in the past month when employers lured them in the united states has had more job openings than unemployed people since june forcing employers to be more creative in their searches trump has been under pressure from business owners and some republicans in congress to expand programs for temporary workers from abroad despite his hard line immigration position trump has spoken on occasion about recognizing the need for foreign labor in a tight job market in a speech over the weekend to the conservative political action conference trump boasted about the low unemployment rate and said i got all these companies moving in they need workers we have to bring people into our country to work these great plants that are opening up all over the place advertisement but trump has shown little action on that front in addition to cracking down on illegal immigration the trump administration has tightened restrictions on legal channels for entry to the country including the h 1b visa program that allows temporary employment of highly skilled foreign workers the president celebrated the latest jobs news friday telling reporters big news was that wages went up inflation has been a modest 1 6 percent in the past year according to the commerce department meaning wages for most workers are growing well above the increase in the cost of living federal reserve leaders have indicated they believe that even with the unemployment rate so low there may still be room for more hiring the central bank is holding off on raising interest rates any higher in the hope that even more people can get back to work advertisement if job creation is as weak for several more months as it was in february that would signal a more serious slowdown the u s economy has been relatively healthy compared with the rest of the world though fears have recently risen about the toll from trump s trade conflict the reality is the economy is slowing the question now is whether it s slowing for reasons associated with the trade war or because the rest of the world is slowing said torsten slok chief international economist at deutsche bank but many economists said the dip in hiring is more likely the result of brutal weather in february that caused a deep freeze in much of the midwest a lot of the weakness in hiring looks like it was due to seasonal factors like very cold weather said beth ann bovino chief u s economist at standard poor s if the party was over we wouldn t see those wages coming in so strong there have also been quirks in the hiring data this year as the labor department has tried to appropriately take into account workers who were furloughed during the partial government shutdown january saw a particularly strong 311 000 jobs added so a weaker february was expected
this is the way the trade war ends not with a bang but with empty bombast according to multiple news organizations the u s and china are close to a deal that would effectively end trade hostilities under the reported deal america would remove most of the tariffs it imposed last year china for its part would end its retaliatory tariffs make some changes to its investment and competition policies and direct state enterprises to buy specified amounts of u s agricultural and energy products the trump administration will of course trumpet the deal as a triumph in reality however it s much ado about nothing much as described the deal would do little to address real complaints about chinese policy which mainly involve china s systematic expropriation of intellectual property nor would it do much to address president donald trump s pet although misguided peeve the imbalance in u s china trade basically trump will have backed down if this is the story it will repeat what we saw on the north american free trade agreement which trump denounced as the worst trade deal ever made in the end what trump negotiated the u s mexico canada agreement or usmca was very similar to the previous status quo trade experts i know when not referring to it as the village people agreement call it nafta 0 8 fundamentally the same as nafta but a bit worse why is the president who famously declared that trade wars are good and easy to win effectively waving the white flag mainly because winning turns out not to be easy at all trump s beloved stock market hates talk of trade war there is no broad constituency for protectionism in fact public opinion has become much more pro free trade under trump and chinese retaliation has hit hard at voting blocs trump depends on especially in farm states now agreement with china isn t a done deal trump may also yet open another front in the trade war against european automobiles and the village people agreement awaits congressional approval and it s not clear what trump will do if that isn t forthcoming still it looks possible even likely that within a few months most though not all of the trade war will have been unwound so will it all look in retrospect like a passing storm with few long term consequences no it won t even if most of the tariffs go away trump s trade belligerence has done lasting damage to america s reputation and hence to a global economy that depends on american leadership the whole world now knows two things about us first we re not reliable an agreement with the u s is really just a suggestion because you never know when the president will invent some excuse for breaking it second we re easily rolled the president may talk tough on trade but in classic bully fashion he runs away if confronted on u s unreliability consider the way the current administration has treated canada probably the friendliest neighbor and firmest ally any nation has ever had despite generations of good relations and a free trade agreement trump imposed large tariffs on canadian aluminum and steel invoking national security as a justification this was obviously specious in fact trump himself basically conceded this point justifying the tariffs instead as retaliation for canadian dairy policy which was also specious the lesson for the world is that america can t be trusted why bother making deals with a country that s willing to slap sanctions on the best of allies and clearly lie about the reasons whenever it feels like it meanwhile the sudden retreat in the confrontation with china shows that we talk loud but carry a small stick it would be one thing if the u s had changed course on the merits but backing down so easily after all the posturing tells the world that the way to deal with america is not to bargain in good faith but simply to threaten the president s political base and maybe offer some payoffs political and otherwise i m still wondering about those floors china s largest bank rents at trump tower and when it comes to payoffs autocracies have an advantage over nations that observe the rule of law china appears to be getting most trump tariffs removed canada still faces those steel tariffs finally by undermining the international system america is making the world worse for itself as well as for everyone else in fact payback is coming right away the world trade organization just gave america a big win in a dispute over chinese agricultural subsidies but its verdict is probably moot because the trump administration has spent the past two years denigrating the organization and has crippled the appellate body that is supposed to enforce wto rulings blocking the appointments that would have given this trade court the quorum it needs to act let s be clear not having a trade war is better than the alternative but the path the trump administration has taken to its trade deals has made us less trusted less respected and weaker than we were before so much winning paul

venezuela in venezuela the u s dollar becomes king amid crushing crisis ángel molina a 33 year old venezuelan graduate in philosophy and linguistics lived his worst year in 2016 his entire family leaned on him financially soon after his stepfather had to quit his job when he was diagnosed with lung cancer he took multiple jobs as an editor of legal documents tutoring and revising company manuals but his monthly income in bolívares the venezuelan currency was still insufficient to buy food and medicine for both of his parents and himself he lost several pounds of weight in just months my pants size was reduced twice molina said it all changed in a snap when he took an online job as reviewer of style manuals for a private university based in costa rica which paid a monthly wage of 200 his new payment felt like a fortune it was 30 times more than the current minimum monthly wage in venezuela 18 000 bolívares or about 6 from day to night molina was able to afford the basics for his family he even began to treat himself and his girlfriend through hobbies and purchases which venezuelans refer to as luxuries since the rough economic times began take hold about four years ago he started to travel eat out or kick back with a few beers at a bar i bought medicines for my mom to treat facial cellulitis he said with a smile i got to buy a new computer new clothes i m actually a little overweight now a third of the 30 million venezuelans molina among them are earning and handling u s dollars on a daily basis estimates ecoanalítica a caracas based consulting firm hundreds of thousands of venezuelans have pinned their hopes on the american currency trying to make profits on greenbacks or receiving remittances from relatives living abroad jorge corbero originally from caracas venezuela sits on his bed as he uses the venezuela bolívar which has such little value to make purses and other items to sell on the street joe raedle getty images pulverized bolívar the economic meltdown in venezuela has shattered the u s dollar strength in inner markets though inflation rates became so fierce that it is almost impossible to live comfortably with just a couple of hundred bucks cendas a research center on the needs of the venezuelan working class concluded last february that a family of five members needed about 1 4 million bolívares approximately 400 dollars to fulfill their basic needs that was 200 percent more than the previous month money even in dollars does not pay that much anymore in venezuela molina admits i used to pay for dinner for my girlfriend and friends with only 8 now i need at least twice that if not more he said once a wealthy country venezuela is suffering the collapse of its economy amid corruption failed socialist policies hyperinflation and maladministration then there is the ongoing standoff between nicolás maduro who remained in power following an election criticized as fatally flawed and the internationally recognized interim president juan guaidó who leads the national assembly the political duel has spilled into the international arena with the united states and more than 50 other countries backing guaidó while russia china and cuba firmly support maduro it has also included massive street demonstrations violent clashes with police and military forces and dozens of detentions of guaidó supporters as well as journalists amid threats of arrest guaidó recently went back to venezuela to continue his campaign for a transition government and fair elections after a short tour in neighboring countries following a failed effort to bring tons of humanitarian aid to venezuela from colombia brazil and curacao but while venezuelans wait for a political outcome prices are increasing at a daily rate of 3 5 percent the bolívar has become so worthless that the u s dollar sets the guidelines for the economy venezuela has experienced hyperinflation for 14 months in a row explains jesús casique economist and head of capital market a financial consulting firm that s why thousands of people seek hard currency to protect their incomes and assets he said the bolívar was pulverized by hyperinflation the venezuelan government has set in motion several foreign exchange control mechanisms since 2003 they all resulted in economic instability and contraction of the gross domestic product and did little to benefit private companies since prices are increasing rapidly more dollars are needed to satisfy goods and services of those venezuelans casique said we the economists have a saying salaries use the stairs and the hyperinflation uses the elevator no more luxuries venezuelans are divided in two economic classes nowadays there are those with access to dollars mainly in middle and upper class sectors and there are others with none at all the nation s poorest it s like witnessing those with umbrellas and raincoats under a heavy rainstorm while others have no protection at all martha a graphic designer from aragua state who requested that her last name not be revealed for fear of reprisals receives 1 000 a month for her two online jobs for companies from panama and venezuela she exchanges just a few dozen dollars into bolívares every week not more than the exact amount that she ll be spending on food medicine bills and the construction of her mom s new house with my first payment in 2017 i bought food for the whole week and i took my kid out to have ice cream with just 10 and there was still money left martha said as the months went by though i ve been selling 50 or more to do exactly the same thing the u s dollar determines the cost in the venezuelan economy products and services fees are set according to the fluctuation of the american greenback in currency black markets its rate in bolívares may change as often as five times a day the same pair of shoes for example can cost 20 one minute and increase to 30 the next customers can use bolívares and dollars to pay for most products regular citizens can pay in dollars for valet parking at a mall for example and many venezuelans use credit cards from u s banks to make purchases it suits them better since the official rate of u s currency set by the government became a little higher than the one in the black markets the political instability is likely to drive up prices even further said casique the economist yvette morante de durán a 43 year old economics graduate says she is used to quickly calculating prices in dollars when she sees the cost of items displayed in bolívares at supermarkets one day she saw a one pound powdered milk pack that cost 2 or 5 000 bolívares in a supermarket near her house when she decided to make the purchase at the same store three days later the price tag was 5 the bolívar is practically dead yes but not even the fact that we have salaries in dollars is guaranteeing our power to buy groceries said morante who makes a living selling foreign insurance policies her husband tito durán a former english teacher at a private university quit his job to work at a call center for an american health company based in california some might think that we the venezuelans can pay for luxuries if we re earning u s dollars in venezuela durán said that s not our case no one in our household is eating cream cheese or going to the movies more often

c hina s rubber stamp parliament can seem unchanging from one year to the next shortly past 9am on march 5th the same date and time as always li keqiang the prime minister rose in beijing s great hall of the people to deliver his annual work report after delegates had sung the national anthem accompanied by a military band pictured his speech took as ever nearly two hours he reviewed the government s targets last year for growth investment employment and more all of which it had reached he also announced another series of targets that as sure as stiff backed soldiers hoist up the country s flag in tiananmen square every morning china will achieve again mr li closed with a customary rousing pledge to bring about the chinese dream of national rejuvenation delegates having made a good show of listening raptly throughout dutifully applauded see chaguan listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element yet despite all the familiar pomp and well worn phrases there were enough new policies and numbers in mr li s speech to highlight the economic uncertainty now facing many in china including the government itself the report which marked the start of the legislature s annual ten day session was laced with caution mr li said china would aim for gdp growth of between 6 and 6 5 this year down from 6 6 in 2018 though still strong for an economy of china s size it would be the slowest rate in nearly 30 years many economists think the official figures exaggerate the pace see article some details were even more revealing mr li declared that economic policy would have an employment first focus the government would strive to keep the unemployment rate below 5 5 and provide training for those out of work the official jobless rate has remained steady at about 5 but manufacturing and tech firms have recently started laying off employees lest the public think that officials are living high off the hog while others face straitened times mr li ordered bureaucrats to cut spending on travel cars and entertainment by 3 he also acknowledged the suffering of private firms over the past year there has been growing disquiet among entrepreneurs fearful that the government is turning against them mr li s speech was in part aimed at countering that perception local governments he said were part of the problem too many owed money to contractors and were dragging out repayment he promised to help private companies obtain loans the difficulty of doing so has been a long standing grievance he accepted that trade tensions with america had hurt some companies a frank admission for a chinese leader the big economic question is what the government s concerns mean for its fiscal and monetary policies whenever growth has slowed in the past decade china has reliably responded with hefty spending on infrastructure and a strong nudge to banks to lend more money the signals are less clear this time around before this parliamentary session some observers had thought that the central government was reverting to type since late last year its planning agency has been fast tracking approvals for new infrastructure projects banks issued 3 2trn yuan 477bn of new loans in january the most ever in a single month stockmarket investors have been turning bullish the csi 300 an index of shares in big chinese firms has soared by nearly 30 this year but the leadership is in fact much warier of stimulus than it once was it worries that debt levels are already too high after the loan explosion in january mr li warned that it could create new potential risks in the economy the central bank countered that the surge occurred for seasonal reasons for months mr li has sworn off what he calls flood style stimulus ie deluging the economy with cash as if irrigating a rice paddy he repeated that phrase in his speech he also mentioned risks 24 times more than in any such report for at least a decade dangers he said could emanate from financial frailties from wasteful local governments and from abroad ie the trade war with america his message to chinese officials was to prepare for the worst his message to investors was that they should not bank on another big rise in government spending but the communist party is still looking for ways to pep up the economy conveniently there is one policy tool that does not involve building yet more bridges and that has the added benefit of being popular reducing tax mr li unveiled cuts mostly for firms that should total nearly 2trn yuan this year or more than 2 of forecast gdp economists at hsbc a bank called it china s most sweeping corporate tax cut in a decade including provincial bonds the fiscal deficit is set to rise to about 5 of gdp this year up from 4 1 in 2018 this is however a far cry from stimulus packages of yore the government is still refraining from steps to boost the property market which it has always done in the past when revving up growth a big reason for china s hesitation is the trade war with america many now assume that an agreement is only a matter of time the two countries are reportedly working on the final touches during this session the legislature is set to approve a foreign investment law that will respond to some of america s main complaints for example by barring officials from requiring foreign investors to transfer technology to chinese firms even if there is scepticism about how china will implement the law it is an attempt to reduce trade tensions america s president donald trump and his chinese counterpart xi jinping could meet this month to shake hands on a formal deal but chinese officials are well aware that mr trump is wont to change his mind so they are trying to leave wriggle room as they devise economic policy if the trade war is resolved they can conserve their fiscal firepower but if it worsens they have scope to increase their spending china s plans depend partly on the caprices of america s president

joining ncs multistage s fourth quarter 2018 conference call our call today will be led by robert nipper our chief executive officer and i will also provide comments before we begin the call today we would like to caution listeners that some of the statements that will be made on this call could be forward looking statements and to the extent that our remarks today contain information other than historical information please note that we are relying on the safe harbor protections ph afforded by federal law such forward looking statements may include comments regarding future financial results and are subject to several known and unknown risks i d like to refer you to our press release issued last night along with other public filings made from time to time with the securities and exchange commission that outline those risks i also need to point out that in our earnings release and in today s conference call we have discussed and will refer to adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted net income adjusted net earnings per diluted share and free cash flow which are non gaap measures of operating performance we use these measures of operating performance because they allow us to compare performance consistently over various periods without regard to costs associated with our current capital structure and in a manner that we believe better reflects our ongoing operating performance our press release from yesterday and the updated investor presentation posted yesterday both of which are available on our website ncsmultistage com provide reconciliations of these non gaap financial measures to the nearest gaap financial measure in addition during today s discussion we were referred to several slides in the presentation that we posted last night with that said i ll turn the call over to our chief executive officer robert nipper robert nipper chief executive officer and director thank you ryan and welcome to our investors analysts and employees joining our fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call today i ll review high level fourth quarter and full year results and we ll discuss what we re seeing in our canadian us and international operations and i ll discuss how our business has evolved over the last two years after which i ll turn it over to ryan to discuss the quarterly results in a bit more detail i ll also provide some closing remarks highlighting some of our recent accomplishments total revenue in the fourth quarter was 50 2 million consistent with the year ago period and a 20 decline sequentially full year revenue for 2018 of 227 million represented a 13 increase compared to 2017 adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter of 7 8 million reflected a 15 adjusted ebitda margin full year adjusted ebitda in 2018 was 49 7 million reflecting a 21 9 margin and compares to 49 5 million in 2017 starting with our canadian operations our revenue of 19 3 million for the fourth quarter was lower by 34 compared to the year ago period and our revenue for the year of a 109 5 million was 14 lower than in 2017 the announced e p customer budgets for 2019 are materially lower than what was spent in 2018 and the effects can already be seen in the canadian land rig count through the first nine weeks of 2019 the average rig count is approximately 33 lower than at the same time last year and is only 4 higher than the first nine weeks of the fourth quarter of 2018 based on our conversations with our customers we believe that capital budgets for 2019 will be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year than in prior years due to high commodity price differentials when the initial budgets were set and the mandatory production curtailments in alberta last quarter we discussed pricing actions that we hadn t initiated in the canadian market and certain initiatives that we have in place to try to gain market share and increase the penetration of our full suite of products and services in the canadian market i m pleased to be able to say that while it s still early these initiatives are showing tangible signs of success our canadian sales and operations teams are highly motivated and are excited about the wins we re seeing in the field within fracturing systems our strong track record and operational excellence have enabled us to win back business from customers that have trialled competing technologies within well construction our new dedicated sales effort is resulting in higher sales of our airlock casing buoyancy system and liner hangers in the canadian market our tracer diagnostics business continues to leverage the investment we made in the calgary lab to win additional work and we just secured the largest multi well pad tracing job in our history and we introduced our purple seal frac plugs with a large operator in the canadian market the plugs performed very well during the trial and the customers were placed has placed repeat orders in addition to these initiatives we have secured several field trials for our new lower cost sleeve design for high pressure markets we re on track to have the sleeves and isolation assemblies for this family of products ready for commercialization in q3 when we emerge from spring break up we currently expect our canadian revenue for the first quarter to be approximately 20 to 30 higher than in the fourth quarter of 2018 reflecting outperformance relative to the rig count environment as a result of our initiatives the wide range is due to the uncertainty of timing related to the beginning of spring breakup turning now to the us our revenue for the fourth quarter of 27 5 million was 36 higher than in the year ago period and 4 higher sequentially full year us revenue in 2018 of a 103 4 million was 62 higher than in 2017 for the fifth straight quarter we delivered sequential growth in product revenues with 7 growth in the fourth quarter us services revenues declined 2 sequentially primarily reflecting the continued reduction in completions activity in the us during the second half of 2018 impacting our tracer diagnostics business from a customer count standpoint the number of us customers utilizing our pinpoint fracturing systems over the last 12 months has remained stable at between 25 and 30 with the majority of our customer base and revenue coming from repeat customers in the us we continue to pursue market share growth across each of our product and service lines executing our targeted sales initiatives within fracturing systems leveraging the success of the airlock casing buoyancy system within well construction offering solutions within tracer diagnostics to help our customers evaluate and implement strategies to optimize well spacing and avoid frac heads and bringing performance and inaudible benefits to customers utilizing our proprietary purple seal express which integrates a composite plug with a disposable setting tool we plan to continue to capitalize on these opportunities and expect that our us revenue in the first quarter will increase modestly from fourth quarter levels driven primarily by another quarterly increase in product sales our international revenue for the fourth quarter of 3 5 million was inline with our guidance for the quarter we currently expect the first quarter of 2019 international revenue to be between approximately 2 5 million and 3 million reflecting a seasonal slowdown in certain geographies in the northern hemisphere partially offset by robust activity in argentina i d like to spend a few minutes reviewing ncs business portfolio and market positions and how we are positioned to continue to leverage our portfolio of products and services to help our customers reduce their costs improve well productivity and their return on capital by supporting our customers in these objectives we will continue to be positioned to drive profitable growth generate free cash flow and improve our return on capital in this discussion i ll be referencing slides 4 11 and 15 in the investor presentation that we uploaded last night starting with slide 4 i want to remind everyone on the call that we are leaders in each of the product and service lines that we participate in within fracturing systems we are the worldwide leader in pinpoint completions having surpassed 10 000 wells completed during 2018 we re the second largest provider of chemical and radioactive tracer diagnostic services in north america and are successfully introducing that platform to enter international markets our well construction offering is anchored by our airlock casing buoyancy system we have over 6 500 successful airlock installations and are leveraging our success with the airlock to access additional revenue opportunities for our liner hanger system toe sleeves and other well construction products repeat precision is growing rapidly as we demonstrate the performance capabilities of our composite plug and as customers experience the operational and safety benefits of the purple seal express system as you can see on slide 11 we have grown and transformed the company over the last two years we ve grown our fracturing systems and well construction business invested in repeat precision and acquired spectrum tracer services through these organic and inorganic actions we have expanded our addressable market more than doubled our customer base and reduced our exposure to any single product or service in addition as slide 15 demonstrates we have balanced our geographic exposure as well with over 50 of our revenue in 2018 coming from the us and markets outside of north america this broader exposure and more balanced geographic mix will let us better weather the industry driven downturn that we expect in canada this year positioning us for continued growth in the us and international markets while preserving the upside from an eventual recovery in the canadian activity i m very encouraged by the recent focus industry investors have placed on free cash flow and return on capital ncs has always dropped to balance the investments required to innovate and drive above market top line growth with a capital light business model that can produce significant free cash flow while ryan will spend a bit more time on this in a few minutes i d like to reiterate how the investments that we ve made over the past several years organically and through our joint venture repeat precision and the spectrum tracer services acquisition provide us with multiple long term opportunities for capital efficient growth in each of the markets in which we operate through disciplined growth and free cash flow generation we strive to continue to improve our return on invested capital and create value for our shareholders earning returns that exceed our cost of capital now i ll turn it call over to ryan to discuss our financial results in more detail ryan hummer chief financial officer all right thank you robert as reflected in yesterday s earnings release our fourth quarter revenues were 50 2 million unchanged compared to 50 2 million in the prior year s fourth quarter we saw a significant increase in our us revenue of 36 and our international revenue of over 400 as compared to last year s fourth quarter these were fully offset by a decrease in our canadian revenue on a sequential basis revenue in the fourth quarter was 20 lower than revenue in the third quarter with a sequential increase in the us revenue of 4 more than offset by sequential declines in canada and international markets gross profit defined as total revenue less total cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization expense was 24 2 million in the fourth quarter or 48 of revenue compared to 25 6 million or 51 of revenue in the prior year s fourth quarter with higher margins from product sales offset by lower margins on services revenue this gross margin percentage was in line with the midpoint of the guidance we provided for the quarter and reflected the pricing actions that we initiated in the canadian market during the quarter for a sequential comparison gross profit was 33 9 million or 54 of revenue in the third quarter of 2018 as we move into the first quarter of 2019 we continue to expect our gross margin to be between 46 and 50 before we see the benefit from the full commercialization of our lower cost family of sleeves in the second half of the year selling general and administrative costs increased to 20 3 million in the fourth quarter from 18 1 million in the prior year s fourth quarter and increased from the third quarter s level of 19 4 million as a reminder our reported sg a includes share based compensation as well as certain non recurring expenses the year over year increase was primarily driven by headcount additions as well as increases to share based compensation the increase relative to the third quarter was primarily driven by a smaller reduction to our bonus accrual in the fourth quarter as compared to the reduction that we made in the third quarter for the first quarter of 2019 we expect our reported sg a inclusive of share based compensation and non recurring items to be between 22 million and 23 million the increase compared to the fourth quarter will primarily be driven for the positive accrual of bonuses under our 2019 plan as compared to the reversal in each of the third and fourth quarter of 2018 which we made as market conditions deteriorated we also expect to incur higher costs related to ongoing litigation matters higher share based compensation expense and support costs related to our recent erp system implementation ncs management is committed to ensuring that our costs are aligned with our current operating environment and is managing sg a to ensure that we are getting the appropriate return from the investments we are making in our sales infrastructure and research and development efforts our fourth quarter 2018 depreciation and amortization expense totaled 4 5 million we expect our first quarter depreciation and amortization expense to be between 2 5 million and 3 million with higher depreciation expense offset by reduced amortization related to the impairment charges to intangible assets which i ll discuss in more detail in a second adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter was 7 8 million as compared to 10 4 million in the prior year s fourth quarter adjusted ebitda as a percentage of total revenue was 15 in the fourth quarter of 2018 a couple of other items to note with respect to our income statement in the fourth quarter first as indicated in our pre release we recorded a non cash impairment charge totaling 227 5 million during december this included over 70 million in impairments to intangible assets as a result of the impairments our annual amortization expense will be reduced by nearly 9 million to an estimated 4 5 million for the full year 2019 we also recorded impairments to goodwill totaling over 150 million which will not impact the income statement going forward second we recorded non cash expense of 0 1 million in the quarter which reflected an increase to the liability that we have on our balance sheet related to the contingent earn out provision associated with repeat precision at the end of the year we determined that repeat precision earned the full earn out amount of 10 million with ncs making a 10 million contribution to the joint venture which was subsequently distributed to our partner in january of 2019 third our book effective tax rate for the quarter was a benefit of 11 5 the calculation of our book tax rate included adjustments related to our impairments as well as us tax reform fourth we had net income attributable to non controlling interest of 1 5 million in the quarter reflecting positive net income at repeat precision we expect to continue to have positive contributions from repeat in 2019 and into the future when considering our net income and earnings per share in future periods it s important to account for these contributions for calibration the net income attributable to non controlling interest has been approximately 5 5 of our us revenue in the last two quarters and we expected to maintain at that level or perhaps increase slightly with the continued success of the purple seal product line and the purple seal express offering finally the remaining outstanding exchangeable shares were converted into common shares in february of 2019 this will increase our basic share count going forward we expect our basic share count to average just under 46 million shares of common stock for the first quarter these shares were included in diluted share count and periods of earnings so it should not have an impact on our diluted share count our adjusted loss per diluted share for the fourth quarter was 0 06 which compared to an adjusted earnings per diluted share of 0 01 in the prior year s fourth quarter for the full year our 2018 adjusted earnings per share was 0 20 which was unchanged from 0 20 in 2017 turning now to cash flow items and the balance sheet cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was 6 4 million and it was 14 million for the year our net capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were 5 8 million and were 15 4 million for the year our free cash flow for the year was negative 1 4 million which was impacted by both specific working capital items and large tax payments during 2018 we currently expect our capital expenditures for 2019 to be between 9 million and 13 million a reduction of approximately 30 versus 2018 at the mid point capital expenditures for 2019 include investments in manufacturing capacity at repeat precision to support the purple seal express product line investments in our tracer diagnostics business to improve field processes and the customer experience and limited investments in other parts of the business as with g a expense we will continue to review opportunities to reduce our capital spending including leveraging supply chain partners in lieu of increasing internal capacity when possible at december 31st 2018 we had 25 1 million in cash and total debt of 25 7 million which included 20 million drawn under our us revolving credit facility we also have up to 55 million in total availability under our revolving credit facilities bringing our total potential liquidity at december 31st to approximately 80 1 million we expect our net interest expense to be between 0 5 million and 0 6 million in the first quarter and we expect our book effective tax rate for 2019 to be in the 10 to 15 range as i mentioned briefly earlier we implemented a new erp system at the beginning of january as part of the conversion process we significantly reduced our payables during the fourth quarter to support our vendors and facilitate the transition in addition part of the erp implementation process included keeping our books open a bit longer than usual to ensure we captured all invoices in the system as a result our actual g a came in slightly higher than the unaudited range that was included in our pre announcement from a few weeks ago in 2019 we are incurring expenses that had previously been capitalized to support prior to going live on the new system we have capitalized expense we re now incurring expenses to support the new system that we expect those costs to moderate over time as we support the system internally while any system transition includes a multitude of challenges i m very proud of the broad base team at ncs that has worked diligently over the past year to prepare for the implementation and to support the businesses as we have made the transition in time we believe that the new erp system will provide managers across the organization with better and more timely visibility into financial and operational metrics which will support decision making we also expect that we will be able to better improve our working capital management and that the system will better facilitate future changes to our business i d like to take the next few minutes to talk about ncs ability to generate free cash flow in 2019 and i refer you to slide 17 of the investor presentation we posted last night as we have not provided any full year ebitda or adjusted ebitda guidance we ll simply bridge from an illustrative ebitda to walk through sources and uses of cash to arrive at free cash flow several of these bridge items have a range and any summary figures will utilize the mid points of the ranges provided starting from ebitda we add 12 million to 14 million in share based compensation which we currently expect for the year from there we deduct approximately 5 million in cash interest cash taxes and other items which includes the litigation matters which we would categorize as non recurring in nature in our earnings release from last night we note that the cash flows in the cash flow statement that we paid 22 4 million in cash taxes in 2018 this included the payment of taxes in both the us and canada which were deferred from 2017 into 2018 as well as the tax payments made during the year in 2018 for 2019 we find ourselves in a position where we are in an overpaid situation and therefore expect cash taxes to be minimal in 2019 year end working capital for ncs typically runs at approximately 30 of full year revenue this may increase slightly by the end of 2019 if market conditions are more favorable in the second half of the year than they were at the end of 2018 especially in canada as a result we ve shown a slight increase in net working capital here which we may be able to offset through normalization of accounts payable relative to the low levels at the end of 2018 i ll know that this part of the bridge does not include the 10 million contingent consideration amount which i ll discuss in a minute which is included as a current liability at december 31st 2018 the next bar represents net capex which we discussed earlier the sum of all of these items would result in a free cash flow before the repeat earn out payment of ebitda less approximately 4 million incorporating the earn out payment that we made in january results in free cash flow which would be calculated as ebitda less approximately 14 million at the mid point i ll also note that over the last four months of 2018 repeat precision made cash distributions of 4 6 million of which 2 3 million went to our jv partner and are reflected in cash flow from financing activities following the earn out payment the joint venture will direct its cash flow to funding near term capital expenditures and also reducing some modest debt balances at repeat precision prior to resuming distributions we do expect that repeat precision will be able to resume distributions later in 2019 i ll hand it over to robert now for closing remarks robert nipper chief executive officer and director thank you ryan before we open the call up for q a i d like to highlight a couple of our accomplishments during 2018 and early 2019 first in canada we have field trials under way for our new lower cost sleeves we continue to benefit from the opening of our calgary tracer diagnostics lab we originally moved our engineering team into a new tech center where we have extensive testing capabilities we increased airlock sales in 2018 by over 80 as compared to 2017 we made the first sale of purple seal composite plugs to a canadian customer in january and we recently completed two wells which set records for ncs for our longest lateral length completed to date at over 2 miles each with each well completed in a single tool run in the us total revenue increased by 62 as compared to 2017 we just completed our fifth straight quarter of sequential increase in product revenue and we posted record sales of composite plugs and airlocks with airlock sales up by more than 40 as compared to 2017 internationally we experienced year over year revenue growth of 43 we worked in the north sea for the first time and have established a local entity to support our work in the region we introduced our tracer diagnostic services into argentina and expect to expand into other countries in 2019 and we are working with a dedicated sales representative in the middle east and expect our first work in the region in 2019 across multiple product and service lines from a corporate perspective we recently implemented our new erp system which we believe will deliver operational and financial benefits over time and we ve taken steps to ensure that we have a focused and nimble sales organization that is incentivized to maximize the market penetration of all of our products and services leveraging our competitive strengths in each geography now i ll close with just a couple of brief comments we are committed to the strategies that we ve had in place for the past several years and we believe that our prospects are as strong as ever we have leadership positions in the product lines and services now in which we compete we ve expanded our product and service offering over time and have invested in our sales force and international infrastructure to allow us to capitalize on our revenue opportunities across the globe as a technology driven company we continue to innovate to bring new products and services to market that are highly valued by our customers improving efficiency reducing cost enhancing recoveries and improving their financial returns as a result we believe that we re well positioned to deliver capital efficient long term organic growth through increased adoption of our innovative completions and equipment services our capital light business model provides us with the ability to generate free cash flow while maintaining a very strong balance sheet this provides us with the optionality to allocate capital to high return investments and evaluate options for the return of capital to shareholders over time and with that we d be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question or comment comes from the line of george o leary from tph co your line is open george o leary tudor pickering holt co analyst good morning guys robert nipper chief executive officer and director good morning george george o leary tudor pickering holt co analyst the international growth story was really strong last year and i realized that a small piece of the portfolio today it is a place where you guys are continuing to allocate capital just curious if you think about the 2019 as a whole kind of frame the revenue opportunity in that international market and maybe last year there was some lumpiness so also maybe any help on the trajectory of that revenue outlook in the international markets and what new markets you may be targeting there or if it s more kind of growth in legacy markets robert nipper chief executive officer and director so we re in a number of markets now as you know we ve generated revenue in russia china argentina the uk and so our strategy going forward is really expanding in those markets that we re in we ve recently introduced tracers into argentina we re in the process of introducing tracers into other countries as well as some of the other products and services that we re pushing out i would say that international revenue will probably continue to be lumpy as contracts come in and large orders are placed typically we see large orders at a time in the international markets than we do in the north american markets so i think it will continue to be lumpy but it will continue to grow george o leary tudor pickering holt co analyst right in canada just trying to think through how this all i realized we were off to a softer start than usual typically thought about for you guys just based on the historical financials q2 being about 40 of q1 from a revenue standpoint but given all the moving pieces i realize it may be early but even if just directionally do you expect a drop off quarter over quarter in canada to be more pronounced than usual less pronounced because you re starting off lower based in q1 any framing there would be super helpful robert nipper chief executive officer and director well as we said earlier as i said earlier we expect the second quarter to be up and but what we do believe is that the second half of the year is that s when the majority of the activity is going to be coming in for us it s there s still uncertainty in the market but the customer budgets are pretty much established now and they definitely are skewed toward the back half of the year george o leary tudor pickering holt co analyst okay great and then i ll sneak in one more if i can you guys spend a lot of time on the r d front in helping customers solve various problems the airlock business had very nice growth year over year last year of some of the newer products that you guys have rolled out and commercialized in the last six to 12 months of purple seal working on their disposable setting toward et cetera what are you most excited about growing outside of the core kind of multistage frac sleeve product robert nipper chief executive officer and director i think the thing i m most excited about is the opportunity that we have right now to take advantage of the channel that we ve created into the market ncs has great brand recognition we have been primarily focused from a sales standpoint on pinpoint stimulation up until last year and now we ve been able to take some of the other products and services that we ve developed over time and acquired over time and we push them through the same sales channels and while this is fairly fresh for us i think we ve fully implemented canada with four product lines with the full breadth of the product lines just as in the last quarter what we re seeing is an enthusiasm that i haven t seen in quite some time and the sales force not just in canada but in the us as well as a result or has more opportunities to touch more customers and what this has done is it s also doubled the number of customers that we have over the last couple of years so this taking advantage of the sales channel that we have for all these products i mean the purple seal express has more than exceeded our expectations the purple seal plug itself has as well our tracer diagnostics business we re very enthused about what we ve seen being able to push that out internationally and then our well construction products and services as we continue to expand that get more products in the offering there as well as push in that outdoor our sales channels we re seeing uptake on that that s exceeding our expectations so we re pretty excited george o leary tudor pickering holt co analyst great really appreciate the color robert robert nipper chief executive officer and director thank you george operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of sean meakim from j p morgan your line is open sean meakim j p morgan analyst thank you hi good morning robert nipper chief executive officer and director good morning sean sean meakim j p morgan analyst so robert when will you start off with some strong product volumes in the fourth quarter just curious if you could give us a little more detail of the incremental mix to what extent was that driven more by sleeves versus plugs versus the airlocks and i m trying to figure out how we can translate that into higher experiencing that mix in the first quarter both in the canada both in canada and the us robert nipper chief executive officer and director yeah so in canada as i ve mentioned earlier we re still really early days we ve just recently pushed out composite plugs into that market so the financial impact was negligible basically in canada the airlocks we did have a significant growth year over year in canada but we ve also just recently introduced liner hangers in the canada so we haven t really seen the full impact from those new products yet in canada in the us the growth came basically across the board from all of our salable products we had we were down a bit in services attributable to activity declines and completions which affected our tracer diagnostics business but as far as our salable products go we saw gains in virtually across the board there sean meakim j p morgan analyst okay that makes sense i appreciate that and so then on services overall spending is going to be down about the us and canada backed products or services that grow faster or the business overall in 19 and given the increased focus on solving parent child issues in the us can you maybe give us a little more granularity on how that s impacting tracer opportunities robert nipper chief executive officer and director sure in fact that impacts more than just tracer opportunities for us a number of the customers that are using our fracturing services for pinpoint now are using them specifically to address that issue so we see that as a potential tailwind for fracturing services this whole issue around the parent child relationships and the frac hits but it also we ve seen that it has the potential to increase the job size for our customers when we re doing diagnostic tracer services so what we see is full patch studies coming online that are significantly more than just a standard average for a ticket on the diagnostic price for services so that s a pretty big tailwind for us as well so what we believe is that with that issue highlighted the way it is today that even with down activity that we can continue to grow through market share gains and just market penetration in the tracer product lines as well as our pinpoint sean meakim j p morgan analyst got it and so just to come back do you have a sense of which area you d expect to grow faster in 19 products versus services just on a growth basis percentage basis robert nipper chief executive officer and director yeah i think that products probably will grow faster just because we have more new products coming in than services coming in so i would expect that would grow faster sean meakim j p morgan analyst right okay great thank you robert nipper chief executive officer and director thanks operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of ian macpherson from simmons your line is open ian macpherson simmons energy analyst thanks good morning robert and ryan robert nipper chief executive officer and director hi ian ryan hummer chief financial officer good morning ian ian macpherson simmons energy analyst still making lemonade out there in this market you spoke specifically to the back half weighting of canadian spending and obviously in the us you re much more tethered to a smaller customer group that doesn t necessarily always reflect the bigger market a few dozen important customers but based on your most meaningful customers how would you shape the outlook for spending and activity levels in the permian and i guess us more broadly but i think specifically for you guys and really just i m trying to feel out what the upside could be for later quarters throughout the year because there s we ve definitely got mixed narratives from some of your service peers with regard to their expectations for how the subsequent quarters unfold after the softer q1 robert nipper chief executive officer and director right well we experienced growth in q1 we expect to experience growth in q1 we think would be probably about in the first quarter somewhere around where we saw q4 maybe slightly up a bit but we expect that again it ll be a little bit year in weighted so coming into the second quarter and beyond we think that at least from our customer base we see increasing activity going through later in the year ian macpherson simmons energy analyst okay that s pretty non committal but i well with regard to your low cost sleeves that you re rolling out in canada i assume that is basically your marking that on kind of a margin neutral basis given the needs to deliver lower cost solutions to the customers in this environment is that the right way to think about it or on a unit basis would these actually be accretive to your margin that you re showing in canada today robert nipper chief executive officer and director yeah so the way to think about that is that in the fourth quarter of last year we made pricing adjustments to reflect what the pricing will be on the lower cost sleeve so we took a hit on gross margins there so when we get the sleeve rolled out and basically after a breakup in the third quarter we expect that to be slightly accretive to gross margins ian macpherson simmons energy analyst okay good last one if i can please ryan my initial take was to take your slide 17 your illustrative bar chart on cash flows more literally with regard to deriving what the starting ebitda number was and i know that wasn t your intent of the slide but can you just maybe speak to the scaling of those bars and how literal or non literal we should interpret with them for in terms of starting ebitda ryan hummer chief financial officer sure ian i think as we can tell on this call we re really speaking as far as outlook and guidance goes really just the first quarter and not putting anything out there as far as any sort of company endorsed full year ebitda i think if you several of the analysts have have done kind of the load test and come to the conclusion that it looks like the scaling is relatively similar to where the street would have been prior to this call and i think that s a fair way to look at it the intent though is really to understand where to where to bridge from a starting ebitda standpoint based on factors that are under our control and as we look a year from now when we look back at this slide we ll be perfect no probably not but there are certain things that we can manage within this if the business develops in a more positive manner and we get some ebitda growth and some revenue growth above and beyond maybe where the street consensus is there might be more of an investment in working capital but you d have a higher even starting point there from the bridge if market conditions deteriorate what do we have in our control part of that would be better working capital performance and part of it would be to adjust our capex and minimize that so that we can still deliver cash flow so some of the items are fairly fixed there are items that are in our control and we expect to be able to deliver relatively strong free cash flow throughout 2019 and deliver that whether we re a little bit above where the street is or whether we re a little bit below where the street is ian macpherson simmons energy analyst that s a good helpful answer thank you both i ll turn it over robert nipper chief executive officer and director okay thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question or comment comes from the line of kurt hallead from rbc capital markets your line is open kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst good morning hello robert nipper chief executive officer and director good morning kurt ryan hummer chief financial officer yeah good morning kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst i want to make sure i don t a lifeline here okay thanks appreciate the color provided so far robert maybe wanted to see if can try some additional inputs or color around the market penetration i know you gave your customer base you know been using the pinpoint stimulation and majority of revenue coming from repeat customers actually looks like a pretty good performance given the decline in overall frac activity that occurred going into the year end what s the buzz in the field with the pinpoint stimulation and can you talk about give us an update on the value proposition that you ve been providing to the customer base robert nipper chief executive officer and director yeah so the value proposition hasn t changed it s still you know customers are users for a number of different reasons there are some customers that are users because they see better results in terms of production other customers as i mentioned earlier frac hits are a big issue right now with our customers and as an industry we re still trying to figure out why frac hits affect wells differently in different areas and one of the things that customers are using is pinpoint because they can better predict the performance of the actual fracture itself using pinpoint and so we have customers that they re using that just to be able to control the frac kit situations in multiple basins and there s cost savings in a number of areas that the customers are taking advantage of using pinpoint so it s the same as it s been for the last year there s a number of reasons that customers are using this we can continue to push out into new basins different areas and find other ways that customers can save money or get better work performance using pinpoint kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst okay and then in the context of selling a value proposition you know can you speak to whether there s been any kind of a pricing pressures given the fact that you know pricing on frac has come down vis a vis the service you re trying to sell robert nipper chief executive officer and director sure there s certainly market conditions that have prompted pricing pressure we ve been able to hold our pricing fairly stable we talked last quarter about adjustments that we had to make specifically in the canadian market just because of the conditions were such that our customers were really pushing hard on price and that was part of the reason that we accelerated the development of our pressure sleeve the lower cost our pressure sleeve so to try to be able to reclaim some of the margin that we had lost due to the pricing pressures but so far in the us we ve been able to hold fairly tight on pricing but it s a more competitive market that s for sure kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst okay appreciate that and then maybe ryan on your end i think you gave the amortization guidance for the full year at about 4 5 million when you think about the depreciation dynamic is it safe to effectively take your first quarter run rate on depreciation and then kind of hold that constant through the year ryan hummer chief financial officer hold it maybe increase a little bit from there but it d be modest as we as we bring some of the capital that we re bringing in for repeat for the purple seal express manufacturing in the first quarter so if some of the equipment from the 2019 capital plan goes in service you ll see a little bit of an uptick on dna as we move through the year really the depreciation side sorry kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst okay and with respect to the sg a in your slide deck and commentary you guys suggested there s a slight increase on sg a however you know if you annualize the first quarter sg a it s going to get a pretty substantial increase so i guess you re assuming that sg a will come down from the first quarter levels as you get through second third and fourth quarter robert nipper chief executive officer and director well really kurt the way that we re we re looking at that is within the g a line in both the third and fourth quarter of 2018 as i ve mentioned briefly on the call we had the reversal of bonus accruals that we had been making earlier in the year so kind of an apples to apples comparison unfortunately kind of have to go back to second quarter of 2018 when we re about 22 million in g a and the mid point of our guide is 22 5 million so we ve been holding the line on g a as much as possible there have just been some things that have come in and out of the number over the course of the year kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst yeah on a full year basis though you are going to be able to keep sg a under 90 million for the full year i guess is what i m trying to kind of get at robert nipper chief executive officer and director yeah we re certainly managing you have you have the q1 levels and we re certainly managing g a based upon what we see in the business kurt hallead rbc capital markets analyst okay all right thank you robert nipper chief executive officer and director thanks kurt operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of marshall adkins from raymond james your line is open marshall adkins raymond james analyst good morning gentlemen robert nipper chief executive officer and director good morning marshall adkins raymond james analyst first of all i want to thank you for the q1 guidance that s certainly helpful and ryan the bridge on cash flow is also helpful i did have my ruler protractor compass inaudible and that surely helped me so as you probably know i m not really that good at math but i was just triangulating some of the guidance here that you had and i was thinking in canada you added up 20 to 30 on revenue higher in q1 when i and the rig count of course is down 33 year over year so far the guidance suggests more like a 50 year over year reduction from where you were in q1 of last year so i m just trying to bridge the difference there between say the 24 million midpoint of your guidance versus the rig count only being down 33 is there are we seeing year over year price in duration share mix or did i just have crappy math robert nipper chief executive officer and director no if you re you re looking at it in a relatively fair way so certainly the activity being down 33 so far this quarter on a year over year basis we did initiate the pricing initiatives in the fourth quarter of last year so that would not have been in first quarter 2018 numbers so that impact is showing up in the first quarter of 2019 and the other component there is fx yeah so the average fx rate was closer to 0 79 i believe maybe 0 8 in the first quarter of 2018 and it s closer to 0 75 this year so those are the components there that you can kind of get to that 50 year over year from a us dollar reported basis we re encouraged by those if you look at the rig count in the first quarter being up only about 4 versus what it was in the fourth quarter when we had already initiated the price initiatives we re guiding to plus 20 30 revenue on a rig count that s only modestly up for the fourth quarter so that speaks to a bit about what robert was saying about how enthusiastic we are about the recent performance in the canadian business and success in pulling through additional product and service lines to our established customer base in that market marshall adkins raymond james analyst right well that s all i was trying to get to because of your commentary seemed pretty positive and the math that you say you explained that s that makes sense you have a lot of confidence in the back half i guess a lot of it is the share gains you re seeing in those new products but i m thinking more just broader the canadian market what gives you confidence in that back half a lot of us don t tend to look at that as closely as obviously you do so i m just give us your thoughts there if you could robert nipper chief executive officer and director yeah it s really it s around what our customers are saying that they re going to be doing in terms of activity you know we ve seen what feels like a bottom in the canadian market i mean the macro outlook there is not good but it seems that we re pretty close to the bottom now and our customers are stabilized a bit they re starting to understand the curtailments a bit more and it s really just driven by what the customers tell us that they re going to be doing and we actually believe it marshall adkins raymond james analyst perfect one more from me you know there s a lot more talk about dissolvables and using those in the plugging in perfect process are you sensing or seeing any impact on your composite plug from the push toward more dissolvables or how should we think about the competitive landscape between those different products robert nipper chief executive officer and director right so there s a lot of buzz around dissolvables right now in the market it hasn t affected our composite business i mean we continue to on a quarter to quarter basis significantly grow that product line i think one of the ways to think about it marshall is our customers tell us that drilling out our composite plug takes four to seven minutes most of the dissolvables that are being run today there s some sort of clean out drip that s occurring anyway so it s not incrementally that much more expensive but we do believe that going forward that dissolvables will have a place in this market i m not as enthusiastic about the timeline as some other folks are but i do think that there will be a there will be once we develop the technology to a place where it s more predictable around this solution and we have the ability to work in these lower temp environments i think that s where dissolvables will play a role so that s why we ve invested in developing our dissolvables products not just composite plugs but our dissolvables plugs but other dissolvable products and we expect to have that commercialized this year so it s not the metallic type plugs it s a poly metric type formulation it s something that we ve seen the early results are just astounding to us i mean one of the challenges that we have is trying to slow down the dissolution right because they dissolve so well so it s something that we re really excited about you know we re hedging into that market so that if we are able to develop that type of technology that is reliable and that becomes the new norm and i think it could you know over you know five plus years we could see a significant market share with dissolvable plugs so we fully intend to participate in that marshall adkins raymond james analyst it sounds like you re attacking from both end so you re covered there right robert nipper chief executive officer and director i think so yeah marshall adkins raymond james analyst thank you all for the comments thanks robert nipper chief executive officer and director thank you marshall operator thank you operator instructions i m showing no additional audio questions in the queue at this time i d like to turn the conference back over to mr nipper for any closing remarks robert nipper chief executive officer and director thank

appreciated by the sudanese people and history and will transform the deep polarization into national unity and international isolation into international cooperation the statement said the call comes after a week of successive measures aimed at combating an unprecedented wave of protests threatening bashir s three decade rule including declaring a nationwide state of emergency and sacking the governors of sudan s 18 states and replacing them with military and security officials the statement also called on bashir to end the state of emergency end torture and release all political prisoners protests in sudan initially over high bread prices have taken place nearly every day since dec 19 and developed into the most sustained challenge that bashir has faced march 1 eu calls for truce in sudan crisis the european union has reacted to developments in sudan calling for the regime to do all it takes to arrest excesses that are likely to spiral from the recently declared state of emergency in a statement issued on february 28 the eu s high representative said they were monitoring the situation in sudan the statement called on government to release persons detained for political reasons the eu expects the sudanese government to release all journalists members of the opposition human rights defenders and other protesters in detention some of those with whom the dialogue is set to take place have been arbitrarily detained for over two months now the statement read in part bashir steps aside as head of sudan ruling party the sudanese professionals association spa which is behind the protests wrote in an update on its twitter page that five people had been killed on thursday and one casualty as at today march 1 march is the fourth month of continuous protests in the country today marks a week since the state of emergency was declared and government dissolved and reconstituted regime forces continue to directly fire teargas canisters at peaceful protesters from close proximity five protesters were injured during sudanuprising rallies on 28 feb and another one today many were hospitalized suffering teargas suffocation spa said declaration by the high representative on behalf of the eu on the situation in sudan the eu is closely following the situation in sudan measures being adopted under the newly declared state of emergency the increased role of the military in governing the country further curtail fundamental freedoms and undermine the recent offer of a new political dialogue they create a permissive climate for the security services to act with impunity against peaceful protesters the latest attacks against unarmed students in the university of medical sciences and technology and against peaceful protesters in omdurman are deeply disturbing genuine political dialogue requires an environment in which the sudanese people can exercise their legitimate right to express their views this will be essential to create the national consensus needed to find sustainable responses to sudan s deep political and economic crisis the eu expects the sudanese government to release all journalists members of the opposition human rights defenders and other protesters in detention some of those with whom the dialogue is set to take place have been arbitrarily detained for over two months now an independent investigation into the deaths and abuses should be undertaken with those responsible held to account the respect for these fundamental principles are at the core of the eu s phased engagement with the government of sudan we will continue to monitor the situation and review the impact of the government of sudan s actions on its relations with the european union feb 28 security forces struggling to

with potential employers at a city of boston neighborhood career fair on may day in boston massachusetts u s may 1 2017 reuters brian snyder by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s employment growth almost stalled in february with the economy creating only 20 000 jobs adding to signs of a sharp slowdown in economic activity in the first quarter the meagre payroll gains reported by the labor department on friday were the weakest since september 2017 with a big drop in the weather sensitive construction industry they also reflected a decline in hiring by retailers and utility companies as well as the transportation and warehousing sector which is experiencing a shortage of drivers the sharp step down in payrolls was another blow to president donald trump who has suffered a series of setbacks in recent weeks including failed nuclear talks with north korea a record goods trade deficit despite his administration s america first policies and the economy missing the white house s 3 percent annual growth target in 2018 but the stumble in job growth which followed two straight months of hefty gains likely understates the health of the labour market as other details of the closely watched employment report were strong the unemployment rate fell back to below 4 percent and a wider measure of underemployment fell by the most ever in addition annual wage growth was the best since 2009 and the economy created 12 000 more jobs in december and january than previously reported bringing the total for the two months to 538 000 we had warned that recent employment gains had overstated the underlying strength of the u s labour market said harm bandholz chief u s economist at unicredit research in new york and the correction now came in february with a bang rather than spread out over various months still the mixed report was another indication the economy which in july will mark a record 10 years of expansion is slowing and supports the federal reserve s patient approach towards further interest rate increases this year the economy is losing speed as the stimulus from a 1 5 trillion tax cut and increased government spending ebbs the record goods trade deficit is also hurting activity as well as slowing global economies growth estimates for the first quarter are around a 1 percent annualised rate economists polled by reuters had forecast nonfarm payrolls rose by 180 000 jobs last month in addition to the weather and rising worker shortages a stock market selloff and jump in u s treasury yields in late 2018 which tightened financial market conditions also likely curbed hiring the length of the average workweek fell to 34 4 hours last month from 34 5 hours in january all this report did was remind people that the economy is decelerating and a moderating economy doesn t create a massive number of new positions said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania u s stocks fell as the employment report added to concerns of softening global growth sparked by weak china export data and a prolonged slowdown in eurozone the dollar dropped against a basket of currencies u s treasury prices were mixed solid wage gains job gains over the last two months averaged 186 000 per month well above the roughly 100 000 needed to keep up with the working age population the unemployment rate fell two tenths of a percentage point to 3 8 percent in february also as federal government workers who were temporarily unemployed during a 35 day partial shutdown returned to work the longest shutdown in u s history ended on jan 25 a broader measure of unemployment which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment dropped to 7 3 percent the lowest since march 2001 from 8 1 percent in january the decline in the so called u6 rate was the largest since the bls launched the series in 1994 average hourly earnings rose 11 cents or 0 4 percent in february after gaining 0 1 percent in january that raised the annual increase in wages to 3 4 percent the biggest gain since april 2009 from 3 1 percent in january overall wage inflation remains moderate a report on thursday showed labour costs rising only 1 4 percent in 2018 the smallest gain since 2016 after increasing 2 2 percent in 2017 economists say employers have kept hiring at a strong pace despite low unemployment as more people returned to the labour force including students women and people who had dropped out to collect disability benefits they however say that source of labour supply is dwindling the labour force participation rate or the proportion of working age americans who have a job or are looking for one was unchanged last month at more than a five year high of 63 2 percent economists expect job growth to average about 150 000 this year last month employment at construction sites fell by 31 000 jobs the biggest drop since december 2013 after increasing by 53 000 in january the leisure and hospitality sector added no jobs after payrolls increased by 89 000 in january the manufacturing sector created 4 000 jobs the fewest since july 2017 after hiring 21 000 workers in january the diffusion index of manufacturing employment which measures the proportion of industries that showed job gains during the month fell to 51 3 in february weakness in capex and exports much of it tied to knock on effects from the tariffs and trade war confusion generally are likely behind the slowdown in hiring by the manufacturing sector said steve blitz chief u s economist at ts lombard in new york retail payrolls fell by 6 100 jobs there were also job losses in the utilities as well as transportation and warehousing industries government payrolls dropped by 5 000 jobs last month pulled down by declines both local and state government education professional and business services employment increased by 42 000 jobs in february the

unable to lower rates further the committee turned to two novel tools to promote the recovery the first was forward guidance which is communication about the future path of interest rates the second was large scale purchases of longer term securities which became known as quantitative easing or qe there is a range of views but most studies have found that these tools provided significant support for the recovery from the outset the committee viewed them as extraordinary measures to be unwound or normalized when conditions ultimately warranted today i will explore some important features of normalization and then turn to what comes after in some ways we are returning to the pre crisis normal in other ways things will be different the world has moved on in the last decade and attempting to re create the past would be neither practical nor wise as normalization moves into its later stages my colleagues and i also believe that this is an important moment to take stock of issues raised by the remarkable experiences of the past decade we are therefore conducting a review of the fed s monetary policy strategy tools and communications practices i will conclude with some thoughts on the review balance sheet normalization between december 2008 and october 2014 the federal reserve purchased 3 7 trillion in longer term treasury and agency securities in order to support the economy both by easing dislocations in market functioning and by driving down longer term interest rates consistent with the committee s long stated intention in october 2017 we started the process of balance sheet normalization we began gradually reducing the reinvestment of payments received as assets matured or were prepaid allowing our holdings to shrink the process of reducing the size of the portfolio is now well along to frame the discussion of the final stages of normalization of the size of the balance sheet it is useful to consider what the phrase normal balance sheet meant in the decades before the crisis during that period the main monetary policy decision for the fomc was choosing a target value for the federal funds rate subject to that choice the fed allowed the demand for its liabilities to determine the size of the balance sheet this is a feature of normal that we are returning to after normalization the size of the fed s balance sheet will once again be driven by the demand for our liabilities to see what this means consider figure 1 which shows the size of the fed s balance sheet through time as measured by total liabilities the values are stated as a percentage of the dollar value of gdp or gross domestic product 1 liabilities began to grow sharply at the end of 2008 and continued to increase until the end of 2014 since that time liabilities relative to gdp have fallen appreciably to understand these changes it is useful to focus on a snapshot of the balance sheet at three points in time before the crisis when the balance sheet was at its largest and a rough projection for the end of this year table 1 in 2006 the dominant liability was currency held by the public and the dominant asset was treasury securities the fed s asset purchase programs increased the balance sheet from just below 6 percent to nearly 25 percent of gdp by the end of 2014 2 balance sheets must balance of course and the fed issued reserves as payment for the assets purchased this action pushed reserves to nearly 15 percent of gdp the committee has long said that the size of the balance sheet will be considered normalized when the balance sheet is once again at the smallest level consistent with conducting monetary policy efficiently and effectively just how large that will be is uncertain because we do not yet have a clear sense of the normal level of demand for our liabilities current estimates suggest however that something in the ballpark of the 2019 q4 projected values may be the new normal the normalized balance sheet may be smaller or larger than that estimate and will grow gradually over time as demand for currency rises with the economy in all plausible cases the balance sheet will be considerably larger than before the crisis to understand the differences between the new and old normal consider the final column in the table which shows the change measured in percentage points of gdp between 2006 q4 and the 2019 q4 projection in the table in this estimate relative to before the crisis the balance sheet will have grown as a share of gdp by about 10 6 percentage points bank reserves account for the biggest part of the growth or about 5 6 percent of gdp the crisis revealed that banks especially the largest and most complex faced much more liquidity risk than had previously been thought because of both new liquidity regulations and improved management banks now hold much higher levels of high quality liquid assets than before the crisis many banks choose to hold reserves as an important part of their strong liquidity positions the rest of the increase in liabilities is accounted for by three other categories first public currency holdings will have grown by 2 4 percentage points as a share of gdp second the u s treasury maintains an account at the fed which has been running 1 4 percentage points higher as a share of gdp and third other liabilities which are mainly associated with the mechanics of the national and international financial system will have grown by 1 1 percentage points as was the case before the crisis the fomc s chosen operating regime for controlling short term interest rates also plays a role in determining the appropriate quantity of reserves in january the committee stated its intention to continue in our current regime in which our main policy rate the federal funds rate or possibly some successor is held within its target range by the interest rates we set on reserves and on the overnight reverse repo facility 3 in this system active management of the supply of reserves is not required thus the supply of reserves must be ample in the sense of being sufficient to satisfy reserve demands even in the face of volatility in factors affecting the reserve market 4 put another way the quantity of reserves will equal the typical reserve demands of depositories plus a buffer to allow for reserve market fluctuations while the precise level of reserves that will prove ample is uncertain standard projections such as those in the table suggest we could be near that level later this year as we feel our way cautiously to this goal we will move transparently and predictably in order to minimize needless market disruption and risks to our dual mandate objectives the committee is now well along in our discussions of a plan to conclude balance sheet runoff later this year once balance sheet runoff ends we may if appropriate hold the size of the balance sheet constant for a time to allow reserves to very gradually decline to the desired level as other liabilities such as currency increase we expect to announce further details of this plan reasonably soon there is no real precedent for the balance sheet normalization process and we have adapted our approach along the way in these final phases we will adjust the details of our normalization plans if economic and financial conditions warrant after decisions regarding the size of the balance sheet have been made we will turn to remaining issues such as the ultimate maturity composition of the portfolio the committee has long stated that it intends to return to a portfolio consisting primarily of treasury securities forward guidance and the normalization of policy communication the committee has also been normalizing communication about our policy after a decade of forward guidance since december 2008 the fomc s postmeeting statement had contained ever evolving forms of guidance about keeping the federal funds rate at the elb or about the gradual pace at which that rate would return to more normal levels we removed the last elements of this crisis era guidance in january 5 the federal funds rate is now within the broad range of estimates of the neutral rate the interest rate that tends neither to stimulate nor to restrain the economy committee participants generally agree that this policy stance is appropriate to promote our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability future adjustments will depend on what incoming data tell us about the baseline outlook and risks to that outlook policy communication will not simply revert to the ways of the early 2000s however for transparency advances have continued apace since then the most significant change from the standpoint of forward guidance is that since january 2012 the fomc s quarterly summary of economic projections sep has included federal funds rate projections reaching up to three years into the future often referred to as the dot plot returning to a world of little or no explicit forward guidance in the fomc s postmeeting statement presents a challenge for the dot plot has on occasion been a source of confusion until now forward guidance in the statement has been a main tool for communicating committee intentions and minimizing that confusion for example in early 2014 the committee s intentions were at odds with a common misreading of the dots and chair yellen explained ne should not look to the dot plot so to speak as the primary way in which the committee wants to or is speaking about policy to the public at large the fomc statement is the device that the committee as a policymaking group uses to express its opinions about the likely path of rates 6 if the committee remains largely out of the business of explicit forward guidance we will need to find other ways to address the collateral confusion that sometimes surrounds the dots as readers of the fomc minutes will know at our last meeting in january there was an impromptu discussion among some participants of general concerns about the dots my own view is that if properly understood the dot plot can be a constructive element of comprehensive policy communication let me follow my two predecessors as chair in attempting to advance that proper understanding each participant s dots reflect that participant s view of the policy that would be appropriate in the scenario that he or she sees as most likely as someone who has filled out an sep projection 27 times over the last seven years i can say that there are times when i feel that something like the most likely scenario i write down is indeed reasonably likely to happen at other times when uncertainty around the outlook is unusually high i dutifully write down what i see as the appropriate funds rate path in the most likely scenario but i do so aware that this projection may be easily misinterpreted for what is most likely may not be particularly likely very different scenarios may be similarly likely further at times downside risks may deserve significant weight in policy deliberations in short as chairman bernanke explained the sep projections are merely inputs to policy that do not convey the risks the uncertainties all the things that inform our collective judgment 7 effectively conveying our views about risks and their role in policy projections can be challenging at times and we are always looking for ways to improve our communications i have asked the communications subcommittee of the fomc to explore ways in which we can more effectively communicate about the role of the rate projections for now let me leave you with a cautionary tale about focusing too much on dots here is a picture composed of different colored dots figure 2 the meaning of it is not clear although if you stare at it long enough you might see a pattern but let s take a step back figure 3 as you can see if you are too focused on a few dots you may miss the larger picture delivering on the fomc s intention to ultimately normalize policy continues to be a major priority at the fed normalization is far along and considering the unprecedented nature of the exercise it is proceeding smoothly i am confident that we can effectively manage the remaining stages beyond normalization we live in a time of intense scrutiny and declining trust in public institutions around the world at the fed we are committed to working hard to build and sustain the public s trust the fed has special responsibilities in this regard our monetary policy independence allows us to serve the public without regard to short term political considerations which as history has shown is critical for sound monetary policymaking but that precious grant of independence brings with it a special obligation to be open and transparent welcoming scrutiny by the public and their elected representatives in congress only in this way can the fed maintain its legitimacy in our democratic system among other initiatives my colleagues and i on the fomc are undertaking a year long review of the federal reserve s monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices the review will involve a series of fed listens events around the country these will include town hall style meetings and a conference where academic and nonacademic experts will share their views these events will inform staff work and fomc discussions as we plan for the future while this is the first time the fed has opened itself up in this way many central banks around the world have conducted similar reviews and our approach builds on their experiences we believe that our existing framework for conducting monetary policy has generally served the public well and the review may or may not produce major changes consistent with the experience of other central banks with these reviews the process is more likely to produce evolution rather than revolution we seek no changes in law and we are not considering fundamental changes in the structure of the fed or in the 2 percent inflation objective while there is a high bar for adopting fundamental change it simply seems like good institutional practice to engage broadly with the public as part of a comprehensive approach to enhanced transparency and accountability without ruling out other topics we have highlighted three questions that seem particularly important at present figure 4 1 can the federal reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective 2 are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability or should the toolkit be expanded 3 how can the fomc s communication of its policy framework and implementation be improved i would like to spend a few minutes discussing the first topic because interest rates around the world have steadily declined for several decades rates in normal times now tend to be much closer to zero than in the past figure 5 8 thus when a recession comes the fed is likely to have less capacity to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy than in the past suggesting that trips to the elb may be more frequent the post crisis period has seen many economies around the world stuck for an extended period at the elb with slow growth and inflation well below target persistently weak inflation could lead inflation expectations to drift downward which would imply still lower interest rates leaving even less room for central banks to cut interest rates to support the economy during a downturn it is therefore very important for central banks to find more effective ways to battle the low inflation syndrome that seems to accompany proximity to the elb in the late 1990s motivated by the japanese experience with deflation and sluggish economic performance economists began developing the argument that a central bank might substantially reduce the economic costs of elb spells by adopting a makeup strategy 9 the simplest version goes like this if a spell with interest rates near the elb leads to a persistent shortfall of inflation relative to the central bank s goal once the elb spell ends the central bank would deliberately make up for the lost inflation by stimulating the economy and temporarily pushing inflation modestly above the target in standard macroeconomic models if households and businesses are confident that this future inflationary stimulus will be coming that prospect will promote anticipatory consumption and investment this can substantially reduce the economic costs of elb spells 10 researchers have suggested many variations on makeup strategies 11 for example the central bank could target average inflation over time implying that misses on either side of the target would be offset by the time of the crisis there was a well established body of model based research suggesting that some kind of makeup policy could be beneficial 12 in light of this research one might ask why the fed and other major central banks chose not to pursue such a policy 13 the answer lies in the uncertain distance between models and reality for makeup strategies to achieve their stabilizing benefits households and businesses must be quite confident that the makeup stimulus is really coming this confidence is what prompts them to raise spending and investment in the midst of a downturn in models confidence in the policy is merely an assumption in practice when policymakers considered these policies in the wake of the crisis they had major questions about whether a central bank s promise of good times to come would have moved the hearts minds and pocketbooks of the public part of the problem is that when the time comes to deliver the inflationary stimulus that policy is likely to be unpopular what is known as the time consistency problem in economics 14 experience in the united states and around the world suggests that more frequent elb episodes could prove quite costly in the future my fomc colleagues and i believe that we have a responsibility to the american people to consider policies that might promote significantly better economic outcomes makeup strategies are probably the most prominent idea and deserve serious attention they are largely untried however and we have reason to question how they would perform in practice before they could be successfully implemented there would have to be widespread societal understanding and acceptance as i suggested a high bar for any fundamental change in this review we seek to start a discussion about makeup strategies and other policies that might broadly benefit the american people conclusion tonight i have focused on policy normalization and our efforts to engage the public in what may come after before concluding i will say a few words on current conditions and the outlook right now most measures of the health and strength of the labor market look as favorable as they have in many decades inflation will probably run a bit below our objective for a time due to declines in energy prices but those effects are likely to prove transitory core inflation which is often a reliable indicator of where inflation is headed over time is quite close to 2 percent despite this favorable picture we have seen some cross currents in recent months with nothing in the outlook demanding an immediate policy response and particularly given muted inflation pressures the committee has adopted a patient wait and see approach to considering any alteration in the stance of policy considering monetary policy more broadly we are inviting thorough public scrutiny and are hoping to foster conversation regarding how the fed can best exercise the precious monetary policy independence we have been granted our goal is to enhance the public s trust in the federal reserve our most valuable asset references bank of japan 2016 new framework for strengthening monetary

italy thinks france is treating africa like a colony one businessman is determined to prove them right with european parliamentary elections around the corner both parties in italy s coalition government have taken the opportunity to burnish their anti establishment credentials the target emmanuel macron the reason colonialism and migration luigi di maio italy s deputy prime minister and leader of the populist 5 star movement said if people are leaving today it s because european countries france above all have never stopped colonising dozens of african countries if france didn t have its african colonies because that s what they should be called it would be the 15th largest world economy instead it s among the first exactly because of what it is doing in africa he said adding that many african countries use french currency and pay for the french deficit di maio was referring to the cfa franc two interchangeable currencies used in 14 former french colonies in central and west africa they are pegged to the euro and backed by the french treasury but only in return for holding half the foreign currency of participating countries france says this provides financial stability and credibility critics say it hinders economic development most of the current migrants come from countries that do not use the cfa franc such as eritrea italian interior minister matteo salvini leader of the far right league party that forms the other half of italy s governing coalition waded in with his own two cents the migrant problem has many causes in africa some take away wealth from the people and the continent france is certainly among them italy isn t shifting focus to the middle east he said in libya france has no interest in stabilising the situation because it has oil interests opposite to those of italy paris summoned the italian ambassador but was diplomatic enough not to publicly bring up rome s own colonial past italy was one of seven european countries with territories in africa controlling at its peak modern day eritrea ethiopia somalia and libya starting in 1886 and ending in 1945 iskandar safa if there was one person who most personifies italy s scathing critique of france it would iskandar safa a french businessman of lebanese descent who made his own empire on the african continent iskandar safa is the ceo of privinvest group a company he founded with his brother akram in the 1990s according to their website privinvest specialises in naval and commercial ships and mega yachts they have subsidiary holdings in the uk france germany greece and abu dhabi its research and development program focuses on marine renewable energy as for safa himself he was born in 1955 in beirut into a maronite christian family he obtained a degree in civil engineering at the american university in beirut in 1978 followed by an mba from insead in france in 1982 he worked for a few years in saudi arabia before taking over constructions mecaniques de normandie a french shipyard within two years he turned around a business that was on its last legs into a successful company in 2007 he set up abu dhabi mar in collaboration with al ain international buying them out in 2011 privinvest is now one of the largest shipbuilding companies in europe and the middle east scrambling africa on 30 december 2018 former finance minister of mozambique manuel chang was arrested in a south african airport on his way to dubai on 2 january 2019 a lebanese citizen and privinvest lead salesman jean boustani was arrested in new york the next day three former credit suisse bankers were also arrested in london andrew pearse surjan singh and deletina subeva this international wave of arrests was provoked by a 2 billion loan to mozambique that almost tore apart its economy as it took on more debts than it could manage according to a us indictment over 2 billion was lent by credit suisse and another bank later revealed to be russia s vtb to three state owned mozambican companies between 2013 and 2016 privinvest played a key role passing money between them and safa was allegedly at the heart of the deal having previously sold the country military and surveillance equipment through privinvest reuters reported that mozambique kept the loans off the books but in 2016 admitted to undisclosed lending furious the imf suspended hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and foreign donors and investors fled resulting in a full blown currency collapse and a default on sovereign debt the country still has not recovered from the resulting debt crisis the money was supposed to be spent on maritime projects with privinvest supplying material and training relevant to exploring new off shore gas deposits as well as helping establish a tuna fishing fleet the three companies that received the loans were in fact fronts for chang and the others to enrich themselves to the tune of 200 million between them e mails show the parties openly discussing bribes angola has found itself in a similar situation luanda in recent times has turned a cold shoulder to lisbon and instead warmed to paris part of this shift was a deal signed in september 2016 with privinvest it was worth 495 million and was to provide 17 patrol boats and technology transfers so that angola could build its own naval vessels in the future privinvest would work with a state owned company run by angola s ministry of defence the problem was two fold firstly angola only has around 1 000 sailors and little ship building experience making the deal suspicious and secondly the country was in dire financial straits reports at the time said that the deal was very similar to the one signed with mozambique business as usual in 2015 abu dhabi mar was contracted to build four sa ar 6 class corvette warships for the israeli navy the 430 million deal was signed with german company thyssenkrupp which sub contracted the work to the lebanese and abu dhabi owned company neither lebanon nor the uae recognises the state of israel safa was previously involved in the release of french journalist roger auque from hezbollah militants and obtaining information about the captured israeli pilot ron arad who was held by the same group these links with israel have made him the subject of intense scrutiny in arabic language media despite this privinvest s chickens are coming home to roost in her book fighting corruption is dangerous former nigerian finance minister ngozi okonjo iweala recounted a meeting between herself the nigerian president chief of naval staff and two representatives from privinvest the admiral was adamant that nigeria s naval infrastructure needed updating and privinvest said it would borrow 2 billion in loans that would be guaranteed by the nigerian government okonjo iweala said the proposal meant nigeria would have to shoulder all the risk and that such a large loan would have to be approved by the national assembly the deal was not

by terence zimwara economic analyst bank service charges or fees make a compelling case for the mass adoption of crypto currencies particularly in developing countries where these fixed costs remain disproportionately high in fact in some lands it is these high bank charges that actually discourage people from using financial services offered by banks the overall cost of accessing banking services increases when expenses like transport to and from the physical offices of the bank are factored in in addition the very low wages earned suggest that since many families survive at or just above the poverty datum line therefore they will be very sensitive to extra costs like bank service charges or fees zimbabwean banks demand their clients to maintain a balance that makes it possible for the bank to deduct 5 in fees every month irrespective of whether the account is accessed during the month or not for the majority of workers who earn less than 400 per month such a fixed monthly cost only drives people away from the traditional banking system and there is documentary evidence to support this to illustrate the reserve bank of zimbabwe s october 2018 monetary policy statement revealed that depositors are not very keen on keeping their funds inside the banking system according to the statement demand deposits customer bank deposits that can be withdrawn any time without notice comprise 65 of all bank deposits a clear indication of an unwillingness to fully use the banking system in any case a number of zimbabweans lost out at the end of the hyperinflation period in 2009 when bank account holders balances simply disappeared without explanation subsequently confidence in banks tanked the same happened to the insurance industry and to this day pension rights groups are still fighting for fair compensation according media reports some pensioners reportedly received payouts not exceeding 5 despite having made contributions for years why many remain unbanked weak consumer protection laws and inept regulatory bodies in some developing countries mean banks can connive to levy high charges without facing significant risks of being penalised when the same banks fail deposit insurance is inconsequential only a maximum of 100 per depositor is paid regardless of the level of losses this reinforces distrust of the financial system a fact supported by a world bank global findex database of 2017 which also revealed that 1 7 billion people around the world remain unbanked according to the global findex database a lack of documentation and distrust in the financial system were both cited as these reasons why roughly a fifth of adults globally do not have a financial institution account interestingly banks cannot carry on the same way in developed countries like the united states as they normally do in developing nations the us has applicable laws and institutions to deal with banks malpractices with respect to deposit taking as well as lending for instance the truth in lending act tila passed in 1968 compelled banks to be more truthful when advertising or informing potential clients about the cost of borrowing there is legal protection for bank clients while such laws do not offer 100 protection the legal threat posed ultimately forces banks to toe the line something that cannot be said of developing countries like zimbabwe which is yet to pass a consumer protection law some 39 years after gaining independence inversely banks refusal to set up in rural areas amplifies the extent of global financial exclusion apparently banks cannot establish a branch in areas not dominated by regular income earners as this denies them the opportunity to earn fixed service income enough to cover overhead costs for instance areas dominated by smallholder farmers are ignored because such farmers do not regularly receive an income which banks use to fund part of their operations crypto currencies case given this whole background it is easy to see why crypto currencies could see a mass adoption in the coming few years whereas potential bank customers have to contend with transport costs when accessing banking services with crypto currencies it is simply getting internet access via a mobile phone or a computer there is no costly and inconveniencing long distance travelling in certain instances people might be compelled to open an account but the centralised nature of the banking system means many will remain under banked despite possessing a bank account to illustrate zimbabwe is a major tobacco producing country with the multi million dollar industry now dominated by tens of thousands of smallholder farmers a few years ago the zimbabwe government made it a mandatory requirement for all tobacco farmers to open a bank account while suspending payments of tobacco proceeds in cash farmers duly obliged by opening bank accounts with different financial institutions which are mostly based in harare and many were issued with credit cards to facilitate payments herein lies the problem tobacco farmers reside in farming towns outside harare and with a few banks having branches in such remote places this meant that for the majority of new account holders they would have to travel to harare or any other town just to access banking services even worse if a tobacco farmer has a major query about their bank account or they lost a credit card then only a visit to the head office in harare will suffice a costly exercise if the tobacco farmer were to opt for crypto currencies instead a similar scenario will be resolved without the need for an account holder to incur transport costs blockchain technology which underpins crypto currencies eliminates the very query to begin with a complex verification and validation of records means there is a remote chance of encountering a typographical error or any other problem which might necessitate the need to travel more than 100 kilometres to get the problem fixed crypto currencies will potentially solve the confidence issues that presently beset the financial system particularly where the unbanked are concerned transparency has been one key to the success of crypto currencies like bitcoin thus far because the blockchain technology which is essentially a publicly distributed ledger allows anyone to verify or authenticate transactions this level of transparency has not existed within financial systems before lower costs of course crypto currencies have small in built transactions costs but these are significantly lower than what is obtaining within traditional banking system the other appealing aspect of crypto currencies has to be the ability of two or more people to transact without having to go through intermediaries a process which normally comes with high costs going back to the example of tobacco farmers further problems are experienced when two neighbours who are new account holders want to perform a transaction with funds in the banking system the buyer will have to travel to the nearest town or business centre to withdraw funds or transfer money to an account of his neighbour the seller this might seem ridiculous but it has been happening for years and it is the only way the seller can be assured that the buyer has an adequate balance to fund the transaction a mobile phone company econet wireless has since stepped in allowing people to transfer fiat money with more ease via mobile phones the mobile phone application ecocash which now enjoys a virtual monopoly can only go as far as facilitating the ease of moving funds inside national borders cross border payments are only possible after one pays a visit to a banking institution to make the deposit of the appropriate foreign currency deposit the intermediaries involved here include the public transport operator the resident bank plus a clearing bank and all demand a fee for their services crypto currency payments or funds transfer are normally seamless inside borders just like they are seamless outside borders and the cost is much smaller than the conventional route there are no intermediaries and this lowers the cost of the entire transaction crypto currencies surpass the mobile money transfer application by a wide margin and once the ignorant population becomes aware of this more people will abandon the banking system zimwara is a writer

wolf richter wolfstreet com www amazon com author wolfrichter and where do chinese consumers fit in americans are infamous for their eagerness to spend money they don t have a whole industry has grown up around making that happen from payday lenders to the government that guarantees or insures a large portion of the mortgages so that lenders and investors don t have to carry the risk consumer debt is turned into asset backed securities from government guaranteed mortgage backed securities to subprime auto loan backed securities whose top tranches carry an aa rating or even a aaa rating it all worked out but then came the moment when americans deleveraged mostly by defaulting on their debts particularly their mortgage debts which triggered the us financial crisis and then the global financial crisis the world should have learned a lesson but no who has learned a lesson american consumers whose household debt in relationship to us gdp has continued to decline us household debt inched down to 76 4 of gdp in the third quarter 2018 according to the newest batch of global data from the bank for international settlements this was the lowest level since 2002 it put americans in the inexplicably wimpy and for the finance sector insufferable 11th place even at the peak just before the financial crisis american household debt never quite reached 100 of gdp this is important as we move on to the winners on this list uk households also deleveraged after the financial crisis with the uk banking system kept upright only by massive bailouts and the nationalization of some banks but recently household debt as percent of gdp has been ticking up reaching 86 5 which put the uk into 10th place this ratio is a function of two factors household debt measured in local currency and the size of the economy measured by nominal local currency gdp this ratio cancels out inflation when household debt grows more slowly than nominal gdp the ratio declines when household debt grows faster than gdp the ratio increases and consumers are becoming an ever riskier part of the financial system then there is sweden swedish households used to be notoriously debt averse like german households and their household debt to gdp ratio remained below 50 until 2001 but then someone figured out how to fix that and suddenly swedes went on a phenomenal borrowing binge and the household debt to gdp ratio nearly doubled over those years to 88 5 earning them the 9th place in the debt slave competition on this list of winners the charts are on the same scale and that s why there is so much white space above american british and swedish consumers consumers that did not do their job in the early part of this century and did not borrow enough fell off the chart entirely which is a fate that afflicted the swedes until 2002 germans with a household debt to gdp ratio of merely 52 7 still after all these years would barely register on the bottom of this chart and austrians with a ratio of 48 7 wouldn t even be on the chart on the other hand the white space in the charts gets filled in by the winners on this list new zealand with a household debt to gdp ratio of 93 3 and in eighth place has been helped along by a property bubble that has been inflating mortgage debts economists love debt slaves we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us household borrowing converts mostly into household spending which is the biggest contributor to gdp so economists adore growing household debt because it means growing gdp and the economic system moves heaven and earth to get consumers to borrow more so that they buy more and add to gdp and these households become enslaved to their debts and their financiers korean households have made amazing progress becoming debt slaves now closing in on the glorious 100 line with household debt to gdp at 96 9 at the current pace a couple more years and they ll have arrived when household borrowing outruns gdp growth for long enough and reaches certain levels things can get iffy as us household debt has shown with its starring role in the financial crisis though it never even exceeded 100 of gdp so below are all the countries whose household debt to gdp ratio now exceeds 100 canadian households have long been making headlines with their top notch borrowing binge to support their top notch housing bubble by other debt measures such as debt to disposable income canadian and australian households have been battling over first place for years in the debt to gdp measure canadian households are in a still respectable 6th place this debt will pose some issues as the majestic housing bubbles in top metros are now deflating norwegian households have bravely taken their household debt to gdp ratio from 81 in 2012 to 101 in 2016 but this has since hit a ceiling as even regulators began to fret about the steep ascent and a down tick has been observed in the third quarter households in the netherlands were track to be undisputed king of the hill with a debt to gdp ratio nearing 120 in part because gdp plunged during the financial crisis which caused the spike in the debt to gdp ratio and the collapse of some banks during the subsequent euro debt crisis gdp declined again but since then the economy has grown and households have curtailed their borrowing edging away from the brink and in the process getting demoted to 4th place households in denmark exploded their debt to gdp ratio from an already high 90 in 2003 to nearly 140 during the euro debt crisis as the country went through a blistering recession gdp still hasn t recovered to the level before the debt crisis as households are maxed out and have been whittling down their debts but at 116 7 of gdp the household debt to gdp ratio lands them on 3rd place on the list of the biggest debt slaves in the world australian households have been caught up in one of the biggest housing bubbles in the world financed by debt the household debt to gdp ratio more than doubled between 1997 and 2016 now that the housing bubble is deflating at an astounding pace the debt ratio has begun to tick down but remains in second place and the 1 debt slaves in the world swiss households this is one of the reasons interest rate repression remains the rule in switzerland the swiss national bank has imposed its negative interest rate policy on the country for years and there have been stories of mortgages with 0 and even negative interest rates there is simply too much household debt and no one wants to see it blow up hence the negative interest rate policy but this policy encourages more household borrowing and the cycle will continue until it can t the most explosive household debt china china is in a category of its own and so the chart has a different scale the household debt to gdp ratio is still in the german neighborhood of just above 50 but it has quintupled in the 12 years since the bis data began in 2006 the idea that chinese households are paying cash to sustain their housing bubble or to buy cars has become a bad joke chinese consumers have discovered debt and they are eagerly turning into debt

by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s employment growth almost stalled in february with the economy creating only 20 000 jobs adding to signs of a sharp slowdown in economic activity in the first quarter the meager payroll gains reported by the labor department on friday were the weakest since september 2017 with a big drop in the weather sensitive construction industry they also reflected a decline in hiring by retailers and utility companies as well as the transportation and warehousing sector which is experiencing a shortage of drivers the sharp step down in payrolls was another blow to president donald trump who has suffered a series of setbacks in recent weeks including failed nuclear talks with north korea a record goods trade deficit despite his administration s america first policies and the economy missing the white house s 3 percent annual growth target in 2018 but the stumble in job growth which followed two straight months of hefty gains likely understates the health of the labor market as other details of the closely watched employment report were strong the unemployment rate fell back to below 4 percent and a wider measure of underemployment fell by the most ever in addition annual wage growth was the best since 2009 and the economy created 12 000 more jobs in december and january than previously reported bringing the total for the two months to 538 000 we had warned that recent employment gains had overstated the underlying strength of the u s labor market said harm bandholz chief u s economist at unicredit research in new york and the correction now came in february with a bang rather than spread out over various months federal reserve chairman jerome powell made no mention of the latest numbers in remarks delivered more than 12 hours later noting simply that most measures of the labor market look as favorable as they have in many decades and adding that there is nothing in the outlook demanding an immediate policy response but the mixed report was another indication the economy which in july is set to mark a record 10 years of expansion is slowing as the stimulus from a 1 5 trillion tax cut and increased government spending ebbs and it supports what powell on friday called the federal reserve s patient wait and see approach to considering any alteration in the stance of policy the record goods trade deficit is also hurting activity as well as slowing global economies growth estimates for the first quarter are around a 1 percent annualized rate economists polled by reuters had forecast nonfarm payrolls rose by 180 000

curbed hiring the length of the average workweek fell to 34 4 hours last month from 34 5 hours in january all this report did was remind people that the economy is decelerating and a moderating economy doesn t create a massive number of new positions said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania u s stocks fell as the employment report added to concerns of softening global growth sparked by weak china export data and a prolonged slowdown in eurozone the dollar dropped against a basket of currencies u s treasury prices were mixed solid wage gains job gains over the last two months averaged 186 000 per month well above the roughly 100 000 needed to keep up with the working age population the unemployment rate fell two tenths of a percentage point

broader measure of unemployment which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment dropped to 7 3 percent the

moderate a report on thursday showed labor costs rising only 1 4 percent in 2018 the smallest gain since 2016 after increasing 2 2 percent in 2017 economists say employers have kept hiring at a strong pace despite low unemployment as more people returned to the labor force including students women and people who had dropped out to collect disability benefits they however say that source of labor supply is dwindling the labor force participation rate or the proportion of working age americans who have a job or are looking for one was unchanged last month at more than a five year high of 63 2 percent economists expect job growth to average about 150 000 this year last month employment at construction sites fell by 31 000 jobs the biggest drop since december 2013 after increasing by 53 000

the past few decades have witnessed increasing influence of the financial sector on the broader economy finance supports investments increases the productive capacity of the economy and constitutes a key ingredient for long term economic prosperity levine 2005 but the global crisis vividly demonstrated that a larger financial sector is not necessarily better beck et al 2014 excessive lending growth drove up levels of private debt causing major stability concerns with real repercussions for the economy in the aftermath of the crisis shularick and taylor 2012 mian and sufi 2014 understanding the role of the financial sector in the provision of firm financing has therefore become more relevant than ever our main question of interest is to what extent firm financing has changed among different groups of eu countries the us and japan ten years after the crisis kalara and zhang 2018 financial systems in the eu comparing financial systems across countries is complicated financial systems are complex they differ significantly between countries and they change over time depending on the relative proportion of finance that is channelled through banks or markets these systems are often classified as being bank based or market based in bank based financial systems monetary financial institutions banks remain the main vehicle of capital allocation and investment while in market based financial system securities markets are equally or more important than banks for transferring the necessary funding towards firms continental europe and japan are traditionally considered to be bank based systems in contrast to market based systems found in anglo saxon countries although the distinction between bank and market based systems has recently become less clear as banks have become increasingly more market oriented the paradigm of bank versus market based systems nevertheless provides us with a useful tool for comparing the development of financial systems using a principal components analysis as in bijlsma and zwart 2013 we categorise the eu countries into four homogenous groups with similar financial sector characteristics in 2015 bank based countries germany portugal ireland spain italy austria greece have large banking sectors and rely less on market financing market based countries belgium denmark france the netherlands sweden finland the uk which are closest to resembling the financial system of the us have more developed equity markets furthermore we distinguish a group of eastern european countries croatia bulgaria estonia poland hungary cech republic slovenia slovakia latvia lithuania romania that joined the eu more recently these countries are found to have smaller financial markets compared to older member states the last group contains the outliers countries that could not be classified in the other three categories cyprus malta luxembourg these countries have a disproportionately large banking sector relative to their size and are often considered tax havens bank financing under pressure bank finance remains a dominant source of firm financing especially in the bank based economies figure 1 shows the stagnation of bank credit to non financial firms after the crisis while all eu countries have experienced a decline in bank lending to firms since 2009 the decline is strongest in the bank based and eastern european countries it has not returned to the pre crisis levels anywhere except in the us and japan these findings are consistent with the restructuring of bank balance sheets after the crisis due to basel iii regulations banks have had to reduce their balance sheets to strengthen their capital positions and they have done so especially on cross border activities for example de haas and van lelyveld 2014 show that multinational bank subsidiaries had to slow down credit growth almost three times as fast as domestic banks this was in particular the case for subsidiaries of banking groups that relied more on wholesale funding figure 1 bank credit to non financial firms shift in capital market financing from stocks to bonds capital market financing constitutes another important funding mechanism for firms while the stock market took a significant hit everywhere after the crisis the recovery path has been quite distinctive across different countries figure 2 whereas the stock market capitalisation as a percentage of gdp in 2016 exceeded its pre crisis level in the us japan and market based eu countries the bank based eu and eastern european countries are still lagging far behind their pre crisis levels imposing additional constraints for market based financing in these countries figure 2 the fluctuation of stock market capitalisation however stock market capitalisation may simply reflect price movements rather than the degree of equity funding obtained by firms from the stock market we further examine the issuance of new shares by listed companies and venture capital investments and find that equity markets have been shrinking globally since 2000 reflected by the decline in new share issuance and venture capital financing in figures 3a and 3b the development of new share issuance after the global crisis varies across countries as shown in figure 3a while new share issuance experiences a substantial decline in almost all country groups except the eastern european countries it has recovered to some extent in the market based and bank based eu countries since 2012 we observe some increase in venture capital financing only in the us after the crisis in figure 3b figure 3 the decline in equity market activity a issuance of listed shares b venture capital investments note greece is not included in the bank based countries in figure 4a this is to avoid one off impact of the greek bailout program see kalara and zhang 2018 16 owing to low interest rates corporate bonds have become an attractive source of financing figure 4 for instance corporate bond issuance as a share of gdp in the market based eu countries has grown on average from 10 to 15 over the past decade figure 4 the development of the corporate bond market alternative finance is on the rise alternative forms of financing for example factoring as well as crowdfunding and angel investments see kalara and zhang 2018 have seen rapid growth during the last years they have become increasingly relevant for financing small and medium sized enterprises smes finance through factoring occurs when a company called a factor buys invoices from another firm at a discount and then collects the debts the goal of the seller is to meet his immediate cash needs and to outsource debt collecting the volume of factoring financing as a percentage of gdp as shown in figure 5 is much higher in the eu countries than in the us and japan we find an increase in the factoring volumes in the eu while the us and japan show a small but steady decrease the increase in the bank based and market based eu countries is remarkable as both groups show an increase of more than 50 during 2007 2016 this may have helped to ease the financing difficulties of european smes after the crisis however alternative finance remains a niche market the volumes of financing through these new forms are significantly lower than through for example bank financing figure 5 the rise of factoring in all the global crisis has put bank finance under pressure bank credit to non financial firms has declined considerably after the crisis and stagnated during recent years posting constraints to economic recovery and future growth especially in bank based europe for these countries a shift to market based financing could be desirable due to the shortage of bank credit although stock market and venture capital financing have declined since 2000 we observe some increase in corporate bond financing especially in the market based eu countries alternative finance is growing rapidly which may have helped to alleviate the financing difficulties of smes to some extent but it remains a small part of the overall financing activity of firms authors note this column is summary of a cpb

one of us president donald trump s campaign promises was reducing the country s trade deficit with the rest of the world and many of his trade policies have been efforts at realising that goal most notably the large tariffs imposed upon chinese exports however by the end of 2018 the trade deficit reached its highest level in 10 years at 621 billion why are mr trump s policies seemingly failing ironically the biggest reason for the ineffectiveness of the president s trade policies has been the effectiveness of his domestic economic policies mr trump s predecessor barrack obama handed over a growing and robust economy and it has continued to improve under him both in terms of the growth of output and in terms of unemployment which is at levels not seen since the 1960s why does an improving economy hurt the trade deficit there are three main channels for this phenomenon first the economy s growth is partially the result of improved consumer sentiment and spending which is in turn due to mr trump s tax reforms when consumers feel confident and spend more some of that extra spending typically goes on imports especially luxury imports such as prada handbags and porsche cars at the same time there is no direct boost to exports the result is a widening trade deficit the fact that other big economies such as the european union and china are struggling relative to the us accentuates this channel as it means that global consumers are not spending more on us exports to offset the increased spending by consumers in america on imports second the improved performance of the us economy compared with the rest of the world means an appreciating dollar as global investors shift their assets there the flow of financial assets to the us is accentuated by the fact that the federal reserve has been increasing interest rates in an attempt to relieve inflationary pressure this causes the trade deficit to widen because when the dollar is worth more us exports become more expensive for the rest of the world meaning decreased exports and imports become cheaper for american consumers meaning increased imports third as confidence in the us economy grows when it imports goods and releases dollars into the international financial system rather than using it to purchase exports that balance the trade equation they end up being used to invest in the country in fact much of the trade deficit that the us has experienced since the global financial crisis of 2008 should be interpreted as a capital account surplus a net positive flow of capital from the rest of the world to the us due to its superior economic performance mr trump has basically set himself up for conflicting goals with the global economy doing so badly improvements in the us economy can only come at the cost of a widening deficit or a shrinking trade deficit can only come at the cost of a deteriorating us economy fortunately for americans mr trump apparently chose to prioritise the economy because in practice in most situations a trade deficit is a non issue and attempting to shrink it does not serve the economic interests of the citizenry a point recently made bluntly by former federal reserve chairwoman janet yellen as part of a broad set of criticisms of mr trump s competence as an economic policymaker so why is a trade deficit benign so what should mr trump do for the most part nothing as the deficit reflects the robustness of the us economy the irrelevance of a trade deficit is evident in one of the few situations where it is damaging when a country runs a fixed exchange rate as the us did from the 1950s to the 1970s as part of the bretton woods agreement a sustained deficit means that a country will run out of the foreign currency necessary to maintain its fixed exchange rate possibly precipitating a damaging currency attack by speculators however since president richard nixon withdrew from the bretton woods system the us has had a floating exchange rate when a currency s value is free to vary then in the long run trade deficits should eliminate itself as deficits cause a decline in the value of the currency which boosts exports and decreases imports and vice versa in the case of a trade surplus the exception is when an economy is attractive as an investment destination for a sustained period of time as capital flows continuously into the economy automatically creating a trade deficit this is the situation the us is facing since the long term economic boom that started during the early 1990s under president bill clinton in these circumstances a trade deficit is an indicator of success so what should mr trump do for the most part nothing because the deficit reflects the robustness of the us economy in fact he should consider rolling back the protectionist measures as they actually harm the economy in addition to worsening diplomatic relations with some of its closest economic partners omar al ubaydli is a researcher at derasat bahrain follow him on twitter omareconomics
washington hiring tumbled in february with u s employers adding just 20 000 jobs the smallest monthly gain in nearly a year and a half the slowdown in hiring though might have been depressed by harsh winter weather and the partial shutdown of the government last month s weak gain came after employers had added a blockbuster 311 000 jobs in january the most in nearly a year and over the past three months job growth has averaged a solid 186 000 enough to lower the unemployment rate over time despite the tepid pace of hiring in february the government s monthly jobs report friday included several positive signs that point to a still sturdy employment market and economy average hourly pay last month rose 3 4 percent from a year earlier the sharpest year over year increase in a decade the unemployment rate also fell to 3 8 percent near the lowest level in five decades from 4 percent in january the u s labor market is still in good shape said gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial slower job growth was expected after huge average gains of better than 250 000 over the preceding four months job growth should bounce back in march and through the rest of this year last month s pullback in hiring does follow signs that u s economic growth is slowing because of a weaker global economy a trade war between the united states and china and signs of caution among american consumers those factors have led many economists to forecast weaker growth in the first three months of this year the sluggish hiring and job cuts in february were widespread across industries construction cut 31 000 jobs the most in more than five years manufacturing added just 4 000 the fewest in a year and a half retailers cut 6 100 job growth in a category that includes mostly restaurants and hotels were unchanged last month after a huge 89 000 gain in january the financial markets scarcely reacted to the report the dow jones industrial average which had been down before the jobs report was released at 8 30 a m eastern time was off about 110 points in midmorning trading last month the unemployment rate fell partly because thousands of federal workers had been temporarily counted as unemployed in january during the partial government shutdown which ended jan 25 once these workers returned to their jobs they were again counted as employed in february the shutdown however likely weighed on business confidence and may have made businesses more cautious about hiring into february faucher said on a more positive note the proportion of part time workers who d prefer full time jobs fell sharply last month that measure had risen in january during the shutdown as some furloughed government workers took part time jobs temporarily but in february a gauge of what is called underemployment which includes part timers who want full time work and discouraged people no longer looking for jobs reached 7 3 percent the lowest level since 2001 most analysts expect businesses to keep hiring and growth to rebound in the april june quarter it will be harder than usual though to get a precise read on the economy because many data reports are still delayed by the partial shutdown of the government in the meantime there are cautionary signs consumer confidence fell sharply in january held back by the shutdown and by a steep fall in stock prices in december and americans spent less over the winter holidays with consumer spending falling in december by the most in five years home sales fell last year and price gains are slowing after the average rate on a 30 year mortgage reached nearly 5 percent last year sales of new homes also cratered late last year before picking up in december and u s businesses have cut their orders for equipment and machinery for the past two months a sign that they are uncertain about their customer demand the economy is forecast to be slowing to an annual growth rate of just 1 percent in the first three months of this year down from 2 6 percent in the october december quarter growth reached nearly 3 percent for all of last year the strongest pace since 2015 still economists expect a rebound in the april june quarter and there are already signs of one consumer confidence rose in february along with the stock market and more americans signed contracts to buy homes in january propelled by lower mortgage rates analysts have forecast that annual growth will top 2 percent next quarter
stocks fell for a fifth straight day on friday after the u s government released employment data that badly missed expectations adding to growing concerns that the global economy may be slowing down the dow jones industrial average pulled back 22 99 points to 25 450 24 as exxon mobil and pfizer lagged the s p 500 fell 0 2 percent to 2 743 07 as the energy and consumer discretionary sectors declined the nasdaq composite slid 0 2 percent to close at 7 408 14 equities fell sharply at the start of the session before paring losses at its low of the day the dow was down 220 77 points while the s p 500 had lost nearly 1 percent the indexes posted their biggest weekly declines of the year the major indexes all dropped more than 2 percent this week the nasdaq snapped a 10 week winning streak while the dow notched its second weekly decline of the year 20 000 jobs in last month marking the weakest month of jobs creation since september 2017 economists polled by dow jones expected a gain of 180 000 february s anemic 20 000 new jobs will inevitably exacerbate widespread fears of slowing economic growth making it harder to be optimistic about corporate earnings said alec young managing director of global market research at ftse russell all in all there s little in this report to excite investors the data come amid growing concerns about the global economy possibly slowing down data out of china showed its exports slumped 20 7 percent from a year earlier far below analyst expectations and wiping out a surprise jump in january analysts cautioned that data from china at the beginning of the year may be distorted by week long chinese new year public holidays which started in early february this year in 2018 chinese new year holidays started in mid february the weak data all come less than 24 hours after the european central bank slashed its growth forecasts for the euro zone and announced a new round of policy stimulus most investors would agree we are late in the cycle said george schultze founder of schultze asset management having said that gdp growth remains pretty solid we ve had about 10 years of solid growth there are also a lot of things pushing it along including accommodative monetary policy friday s losses come amid growing fears that most of the positive news on the u s china trade front may be baked in at this point most investors expect the two countries to strike a trade deal later this month there are also worries that a deal may not be sure thing cnbc learned through sources that china and the u s have talked about holding further discussions in beijing after the national people s congress concludes on march 15 this was first reported by the new york times a pullback in risk assets was needed but underlying technical and fundamental conditions are positive peter perkins partner at mrb partners wrote in a note to clients the global growth outlook remains mixed but there are signs that economic growth momentum in china and the euro area is bottoming while the u s economy continues to chug along at a moderately above potential pace my own view is following a disastrous q4 it was a time to make stocks great again and the world s most influential allocators stepped in and rebalanced their portfolios into equities when the fed hit the pause button they bought more equities now we are at a point where people are wondering with the fed out of the way for now at least are we going to have another bubble in stocks like 1999 as it stands i wouldn t get too carried away but have a look at the year to date performance of the s p500 sectors click on image as you can see the s p 500 is up close to 12 and the leading sectors are cyclical sectors like industrials xli and energy xle followed by technology xlk and consumer discretionary xly conversely the lagging sectors are defensive like consumer staples xlp utilities xlu and healthcare xlv importantly if we are at the late stages of an economic rally this isn t what you should be seeing so either the stock market is high on cannabis stocks or the bond market has it all wrong but if you look at us long bond prices tlt they re rolling over here as yields back up click on image again this isn t indicative of a global slowdown quite the opposite so maybe there is a renewed economic uptrend taking place or maybe not it could be just another buying opportunity for bonds and come the end of q1 at the end of march if we don t get any clear signs of a trade deal with china i m willing to bet the world s most influential allocators are going to rebalance yet again but this time take money out of stocks and into bonds it won t be a major rebalancing but enough to stall this impressive rally in stocks so don t get too excited nothing goes up in a straight line 10 years ago markets made their crisis lows for 10 years the fed was accommodative for 3 months last year they weren t everything fell apart after markets dropped 20 they went back to accommodative by stopping rate hikes now they re signaling qe neg rates _ ツ _ sven henrich northmantrader march 6 2019 fred imbert of cnbc reports stocks post 5 day losing streak notch worst week of 2019 after anemic jobs report last week i discussed whether a bubble in stocks is brewing and said even though it s unlikely with the fed out of the way for now you can t discount the possibility and some red hot sectors like biotech were getting bubbly in fact this is what i stated when stocks are up over 10 in two months a lot of investors rebalance locking in some gains and wait for a better opportunity to reenter the stock market this is especially true in this environment where there s a lot of uncertainty over brexit china us trade talks etc this morning s us jobs report was abysmal way below what most economists were expecting in fact it was a very weird report and it s hard to read too much into one month but it s clear if this continues it will confirm a us slowdown is underway what s even weirder in canada we added 56 000 jobs last month so either the bls has it wrong or statistics canada has it wrong because these red hot canadian job figures don t jive with a lot of headlines we are seeing in the news i expect major downward revisions in subsequent canadian jobs reports anyway back to the us jobs report from the key takeaways the weaker sectors of the job market last month included construction mining and retail while the healthcare and business services industries created jobs in february despite job creation stalling last month figures from the two prior months were revised higher while a lot of attention has been given to the weak us jobs report i don t think it had anything to do with the stock market s weak performance this week like i said smart investors are locking in some gains waiting for a better time to reenter the market after the surge in stocks in january and february it s only normal we see a pullback as investors wait for a catalyst to send stocks and other risk assets higher click on image can us stocks go lower sure they can especially in the short run but i wouldn t be surprised if this is just a pullback for now just like we need a catalyst to propel stocks higher with the fed out of the way we need one to sink them much lower can the s p500 give back its gains from the first two months absolutely possible but i m not convinced it will can it revisit december lows it can if all hell breaks loose but again with the fed on pause mode i don t see this as a likely outcome at least not now some think the fed is getting wonky here signalling the possibility of more qe and negative rates if needed maybe that s what is unnerving investors but if this happens it will only raise the risk of another stock market bubble down the road as far as i m concerned we re just entering march madness stocks will be choppy you need to pick your spots carefully have a look at the how the s p sectors performed this week courtesy of barchart click on image as shown the s p 500 was down over 2 utilities and real estate were the only sectors posting gains up 0 7 and 0 5 respectively while financials 2 69 industrials 2 86 energy 3 86 and healthcare 3 87 the outperformance of stable sectors like utilities and breakdown in cyclical sectors like financials industrials and energy is normal if we are entering a slowdown but i m a bit perplexed as to why healthcare stocks got slammed so hard part of it is the biotech component as biotechs xbi ibb got slammed this week but the other part of it is maybe healthcare stocks are feeling the bern of top democratic presidential candidates calling for universal healthcare and calling for more regulations on big pharma and big tech i don t know it s a bit weird but that s how these algo driven markets are very weird it s hard to make sense of them when you analyze them rationally especially over a short period anyway here are the top performing us stocks for this past week courtesy of barchart click on image as you can see even though the broader biotech indexes xbi ibb didn t perform well this week pulling back some of the top performers were small cap biotechs i was tracking the action on one of them seelos therapeutics seel as investors got very excited after tuesday s announcement that the small biotech had exclusively in licensed a family of peptide inhibitors from the regents of the university of california the peptide inhibitors which were developed by a research team at the university of california los angeles target the aggregation of alpha synuclein alpha nuclein is a major component of lewy bodies protein clumps that are a hallmark of parkinson s disease anyway the stock was up 70 yesterday and opened up close to 80 today on huge volume before ending the day up 11 click on image no doubt big biotech funds bought in but people are getting excited over nothing and if you look at the long term chart of seelos you ll see that it s been a total disaster but speculators hear about a licensing agreement and potential cure for parkinson s and they jump all over it i feel sorry for retail suckers who bought in at the open today we shall see what next week brings us but right now i wouldn t get too nervous about the pullback in stocks this week think it s perfectly normal below cnbc commentators discuss february s dismal jobs report second chart master carter worth says the best bet investors can make is a retest of the market lows as i stated above with the fed out of the way we could see more of a pullback but i doubt we retest the lows of december and as stocks see their worst week of the year utilities just hit a new high while energy stocks got slammed with cnbc s scott wapner and the options action traders carter worth mike khouw and dan nathan as i said above the breakdown in cyclical sectors like energy and outperformance of utilities and other high yielding sectors like real estate and telecoms suggests there is a slowdown happening and us long bond yields are headed lower in fact kyle bass hayman capital management cio was interviewed by brian sullivan on cnbc earlier this week discussing everything from china to the fed and he said interest rates are headed back to zero in 2020 cnbc s seema mody and the futures now traders jim iuorio and jeff kilburg discussed whether investors should buy bonds over stocks i m still long bonds
colombo march 8 newsin asia gotabaya rajapaksa former sri lankan defense and urban development secretary and younger brother of the country fifth president mahinda rajapaksa is confident of getting elected as president of sri lanka at the end this year he said in an interview here on wednesday that his confidence rests on his belief that sri lankans are yearning for a non mainstream ethnically unbiased and an economic and social development oriented leader to wrench the country from the morass it has been stuck for three decades known to be a hardliner on the ethnic issue dividing the majority sinhalese from the minority tamils and muslims gotabaya however believes that he can get the votes of the minorities on the basis of his ethnically non partisan and economic development agenda people are tired of mainstream politicians who only think of votes and care little for the genuine development and progress of the people i am not a mainstream politician and that is the advantage i have he said recounting his achievements in the developmental field as a top administrator in the mahinda rajapaksa government from 2005 to 2014 even if the minorities especially the tamils are swayed by ethnic considerations he could win with enhanced support from the sinhalese majority gotabaya believes it is not essential to get the votes of the minorities to win a presidential election in 2010 mahinda rajapaksa won by 1 8 million votes without tamil support he lost in 2015 not because he did not get tamil and muslim support but because the sinhalese urban middle class in key districts like gampaha and colombo did not vote for him but still rajapaksa lost the election by only 449 000 votes and even under the unfavorable conditions of that time rajapaksa got more than 100 000 votes in the tamil north gotabaya pointed out since his dual citizenship bars him from contesting elections gotabaya said that the process of getting release from american citizenship is on and that this is not an issue at all ability to implement plans nice plans alone are not enough a presidential candidate must have the ability to implement the plans after the war ended in 2009 i took over as secretary urban development in addition to having defense i renovated roads pathways and buildings to make colombo and other towns livable after the end of the war in 2009 we wanted to develop infrastructure in the country as without infrastructure no investor whether local or international will invest since we did not have the funds we borrowed but we did not fall into a debt trap as it is alleged we got the sri lanka ports authority slpa to take the chinese loan for building the hambantota port because slpa was a profitable organization and could re pay the loan in fact the slpa had paid the first installment of the loan taken for the hambantota port by the time rajapaksa demitted office gotabaya recalled releasing lands in war zone detailing his achievements in the field of ethnic reconciliation he said that during the war jaffna peninsula was bristling with military camps but when the war ended he cleared lands up to keerimalai vasavilan and thondaimannar and kept only the palaly high security zone i had handed over 90 of the private land which the military had taken over only that area under the palaly high security zone was retained for security reasons if we needed some private land we purchased them he said another step he took on the reconciliation front was the infrastructure the rajapaksa government built roads railways and schools and 100 electricity from the national grid demining was done to settle 300 000 people the present modern hospital in kilinochchi was an army camp during the war and all this was done within a short period of time from 2010 to 2014 above all we gave back to sri lankans their most important right the right to live gotabaya said tamils demand for dignity regarding the tamils oft repeated yearning for living in dignity gotabaya said where does dignity come from i don t believe it comes from political power alone a man with no means will have no dignity whether he is a tamil muslim or sinhalese therefore to give dignity to people we must raise their incomes and living standards that was what we were doing within the short time available to us economic roots of separatism according to gotabaya the tamils struggle for devolution had economic and not political roots as tamil politicians would like others to believe when the sirima bandaranaike government imposed restrictions on imports on agriculture products the jaffna farmer producing onion potato chilli and tobacco gained a lot but when the j r jayewardene government liberalized imports jaffna famers were badly hit no wonder then that in the 1982 presidential election the northern tamils voted massively for the slfp candidate hector kobbekaduwa who got few votes in other parts of sri lanka gotabaya pointed out alienated farmers joined the ranks of other alienated sections to struggle for separate tamil country eelam tamil politicians should ask themselves if devolution would actually solve their problems gotabaya said is it not the truth that no province in sri lanka will survive without links with the western province which generates all the income therefore our agenda had been to develop other regions in the country and not just the western province this is why the hambantota port was built and roads and railways were laid in the north and other provinces if there is all round development of the country and there is economic equality a tamil person could be prime minister of sri lanka gotabaya said the tamil parties are going in the wrong direction he pointed out they do not want to participate in governance and develop their people what have they gained by staying out of power and being only in the opposition and when put in charge of the northern province they did not do any development work but returned the money sent for development schemes the tamil parties do not know what the tamil people really want tamil parties demand police powers for the province but the people there do not want locally recruited police so much for the demand for a provincial police force gotabaya pointed out ethnic politics a drag ethnicity based politics has only delayed political settlements and economic development he argued in the early 1980s the district development council were agreed upon but the unp scuttled the scheme in 1987 india got involved and the 13 th constitutional amendment was brought about but the ltte rejected it where is the end to all this when will people get a chance to develop and lead happily he wondered failure of good governance government the failure of the good governance regime works to his advantage he believes it has been four and a half years since the united national party unp led government was set up and yet nothing has been achieved the unp came to power on the platform of anti corruption and the establishment of the rule of law businessmen felt that the unp will help businesses as the party is thought to be business friendly but they have failed in all the areas they said they will punish people who were corrupt but they ended up taking revenge against rival politicians the unp said that mahinda rajapaksa s family had huge amounts of money in foreign banks but four and a half years down the line they have not been able to find anything though it is very easy for governments to get details of foreign bank accounts most international banks are controlled by the us and other western countries which follow strict laws to prevent money laundering in the guise of investigating chinese projects they put these projects on hold for two and a half years the stoppage led to embarrassment as these were government to government projects the chinese companies involved had to pay heavy demurrage local contractors and suppliers suffered as they were out of work and business for two and a half years the total loss was to the tune of lkrs 2 5 billion the whole economy collapsed then they gave hambantota port to a chinese company on a 99 year lease when mahinda rajapaksa was president he did not do that harassment of govt servants thousands of government servants are being investigated by the finance crimes cid gotabaya alleged this has broken the morale of government servants who are a vital element in the development of the country it is unfair to go after government servants because they only carry out orders from their political superiors demoralized government servants are now afraid of taking decisions hampering development work unstable govt the other matter of great concern is the absence of stability in the government gotabaya said the president and the prime minister are at loggerheads coming from an slfp background the president is against privatization but this runs counter to the unp s policy the president finds it difficult to work with the unp decisions taken are countermanded lack of unity of purpose at the top has led to policy instability which in turn has adversely affected local and foreign investment the lack of consensus and continuity on policy has led to problems with india and even china he said he pointed out that promises were made to india in regard to the eastern container terminal in colombo port and the kerawelepitiya lng plant the government had initially agreed to give the lng plant project to a consortium with only one plant envisaged but now there is a tender for another one the same kind of confusion hampered chinese projects abolition of executive presidency as regards the move to abolish the executive presidency through the proposed 20 th amendment gotabaya said that abolition should not be done piecemeal the executive presidency should not be discarded before changing the election system the present proportional representation system should be abolished before the executive presidency is done away with the pr system creates instability in parliament you can t have a divided and weak parliament as well as a ceremonial presidency i don t think that there are many takers for the abolition of the executive presidency he said relations with india and china on the question of relations with india and china gotabaya said that any sri lankan government would need to be non aligned the rajapaksa government did not want to get involved in geo political rivalries may be china had geo political interests in investing in sri lanka but sri lanka was only interested in the commercial aspect of the chinese investments we did not seek a geo political relationship we wanted a commercial relationship on relations with india he said that sri lanka should keep india s friendship and be mindful of the island s environment it should not jeopardize india s security india does not have to worry about us we will not do anything against it but at the same time we do not want to get involved in big power rivalry gotabaya said
washington ap the pace of hiring in the united states fell last month to its lowest point in nearly a year and a half a surprise drop likely reflecting harsh weather and other temporary factors that led most economists to see the slowdown as a temporary blip employers added just 20 000 jobs down from a blockbuster 311 000 in january even with february s anemic gain job growth over the past three months has averaged a solid 186 000 enough to lower the unemployment rate over time and average hourly pay surged 3 4 percent from a year earlier the sharpest year over year increase in a decade the unemployment rate also dropped to 3 8 percent near the lowest level in five decades from 4 percent in january all told friday s monthly employment report from the government pointed to a still sturdy job market and economy the u s labor market is still in good shape said gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial slower job growth was expected after huge average gains of better than 250 000 over the preceding four months job growth should bounce back in march and through the rest of this year last month s pullback in hiring does follow signs that u s economic growth is probably slowing because of a weaker global economy a trade war between the united states and china and signs of caution among american consumers those factors have led many analysts to forecast anemic growth in the first three months of this year but most economists still cautioned against reading too much into february s sluggish pace of hiring the monthly employment data can be volatile during the nearly decade long recovery from the great recession job growth has sometimes plunged in a single month to 15 000 in may 2016 for example and to 18 000 in september 2017 only to rebound to healthy levels in the months that followed and february s increase in average pay suggests that businesses are stepping up their efforts to attract and keep workers the year over year increase of 3 4 percent in february is up from a corresponding figure of just 2 6 percent a year ago julia pollak a labor economist at jobs marketplace ziprecruiter said many companies are becoming increasingly hungry for workers the number of job ads on its site that offer to pay for training she said jumped 42 percent last year from 2017 and positions that offer flexible hours soared 110 percent a trend that could draw more women with family responsibilities off the sidelines and into work employers are finding all these ways to sweeten the deal and invest in their employees pollak said carole witkowski vice president of human resources at batteries and bulbs said her 700 store retail chain has raised starting hourly pay for workers at its distribution center from 11 to 12 with additional raises for those working evening and overnight shifts the company has taken other steps she said jobs at the distribution center located outside milwaukee don t require high school diplomas and have been plagued by high turnover many workers can find jobs elsewhere others haven t worked much before and aren t always used to showing up on time regularly so about 18 months ago the company started paying 250 each quarter to workers who arrive on time every day and in the suburbs outside chicago when the company received no applications in response to retail job postings last winter it offered a 500 signing bonus that shook loose some applicants we got a little aggressive there witkowski said nationally though the sluggish hiring and job cuts in february were widespread across industries construction cut 31 000 jobs the most in more than five years likely because of cold weather manufacturing added just 4 000 the fewest in a year and a half a sign that trump s trade war has raised costs and lowered exports for many factories retailers cut 6 100 positions while jobs in a category that mostly includes restaurants and hotels were unchanged the unemployment rate fell despite the tepid pace of hiring the government uses one survey of households to calculate unemployment and a separate survey of businesses to count job growth and sometimes the results of the two surveys diverge for a single month the jobless rate for african americans which hit a record low of 5 9 percent in may and has frequently been celebrated by president donald trump rose for a third straight month in february to 7 percent its highest point in more than a year the rate for hispanic and latino americans though dropped to a record low of 4 3 percent the overall jobless rate fell partly because thousands of federal workers had been temporarily counted as unemployed in january during the partial government shutdown they returned to work and were counted as unemployed in february also on a positive note the proportion of part time workers who d prefer full time jobs fell sharply that measure had risen in january during the shutdown as some furloughed government workers took part time jobs temporarily but in february a gauge of what is called underemployment which includes part timers who want full time work and discouraged people no longer looking for jobs reached 7 3 percent the lowest level since 2001 there are signs that the economy is slowing consumer confidence fell sharply in january held back by the shutdown and by a steep fall in stock prices in december and americans spent less over the winter holidays with consumer spending plunging in december by the most in five years we are seeing a fading of the effects of the trump tax cut and increased government spending which helped accelerate growth last year said sung won sohn chief economist at ss economics analysts generally foresee growth slowing sharply in the first three months of this year to just a 1 percent annual rate

a trilateral alliance of china pakistan saudi arabia driven by geo economic interests is emerging with the pakistani port of gwadar on the arabian sea as its hub this builds upon a geopolitical foundation dating back to the mid 1960s with the trump administration cutting 2 1 billion worth of financial and military aid to islamabad neighbouring china and friendly saudi arabia have taken cash strapped pakistan under their wings to strengthen its economic base in contrast to the wavering washington islamabad relationship sino pakistani ties have become tighter with each passing decade china s interest in gwadar dates back to 2001 when the visiting chinese prime minister zhu rongji signed an agreement with pakistan to turn the facility into a deep water port china covered three quarters of the 250 million cost of building the port commissioned in 2007 yielding to pressure by the united states pakistan s president opted for giving the 40 year operating lease to psa international owned by the port of singapore authority the port was not operationally profitable and pakistan transferred control to state owned china overseas ports holding company limited in 2013 gwadar advantage gwadar is strategically important for china as 60 of its imported oil originates in the gulf region and passes through the strait of hormuz a gateway for a third of the globe s traded petroleum the port is 650 kilometers from this strait whereas the chinese port of xingjian is 15 000 kilometers away crude oil arriving at gwadar is to transported to china s far western xinjiang autonomous region overland by pipeline and the upgraded 1 300 kilometer karakoram highway which opened to public in 1986 during chinese president xi jinping s 2015 visit to islamabad pakistan and china inked an agreement to start work on the 46 billion china pakistan economic corridor or cpec a network of infrastructure and energy projects the corridor is an integral part of beijing s 900 billion one belt one road later renamed belt and road initiative that was unveiled in 2013 with that gwadar became the end point for one of six economic corridors stemming from china the total investment in cpec rose to 62 billion in 2016 cpec became partially operational when chinese goods were transported over the karakoram highway to gwadar port for maritime shipment to the horn of africa and the middle east five months later the pakistani government leased gwadar port to the china overseas ports holding company limited for 40 years authorising the chinese port holding company to carry out development work on the port and the vast adjoining free economic zone scale of the enterprise could be judged by pakistani media reports suggesting that gwadar s population would rise exponentially to 500 000 by 2023 with gated residential quarters being constructed for about 10 000 chinese and pakistani professionals and their families by all accounts the future of the gwadar port and the free economic zone is rosy that was why during saudi crown prince mohammed bin sultan s february visit to islamabad 8 billion of the 20 billion his government committed to invest in pakistan were earmarked for an oil refinery in gwadar cash rich saudi with its foreign exchange reserves at 506 billion the fourth highest in the world saudi arabia can easily invest the sum it promised islamabad and even throw a 6 billion lifeline to save pakistan from defaulting on servicing a huge loan secured from the international monetary fund in 2013 however the kingdom did so only after pakistan s newly elected prime minister imran khan agreed to attend october s future investment initiative conference in riyadh boycotted by western governments and financial institutions following the grisly murder of the dissident saudi journalist jamal khashoggi at the saudi consulate in istanbul earlier that month underlying these moves by the saudi kingdom is the realisation shared by china that only by building new infrastructure in pakistan and repairing its dilapidated facilities can its chronic economic ills be cured while china is forging ahead with xi s signature belt and road initiative riyadh s overambitious economic blueprint saudi vision 2030 announced in 2016 to wean the kingdom away from oil diversify its economy bolster public services build infrastructure and shore up its defense industry has failed to take off most of the funding for the saudi initiative was to have come from phased privatisation of state owned saudi aramco the globe s largest oil corporation the 100 billion initial public offering of the company s 5 share expected in 2018 was postponed indefinitely due to legal concerns and the kingdom s failure to achieve its total desired valuation of 2 trillion based on oil barrel selling for a minimum of 70 briefed on the hurdles facing saudi vision 2030 xi broached the subject with bin salman during his february visit to beijing our two countries should speed up the signing of an implementation plan on connecting the belt and road initiative with the saudi vision 2030 he said no details were released us cold shoulder in contrast the trump administration is unlikely to end its shunning of islamabad in january 2018 donald trump canceled government plans for 1 3 billion of military aid to pakistan and announced on twitter that pakistan had given us nothing but lies and deceit accusing the nation of providing safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in afghanistan in addition washington cut 800 million to reimburse islamabad for expenses incurred to support the us led coalition s counter insurgency operations altogether since 9 11 pakistan received more than 33 billion in us assistance including more than 14 billion from washington s coalition support funds by contrast china s diplomatic entente with pakistan after the 1962 sino indian war graduated to military cooperation with the common aim of containing the power of india then backed by the soviet union china s military aided its pakistani counterpart to set up ordnance factories with improved technologies china started selling battle tanks and armored vehicles to pakistan later chinese military engineers designed tailor made advanced weapons for pakistan s army and issued licenses for domestic production around the turn of the century beijing started turning attention to the pakistani air force and navy this led to the co production of china s jl 8 fighter aircraft in pakistan and china in 2009 pakistan became the first foreign country to receive china s advanced fighter aircraft jl 10 the two countries also turned to joint development of the jf 17 thunder fighter aircraft and k 8 karakorum training aircraft during a 2015 visit of pakistan s army chief general raheel sharif chinese foreign minister wang yi described pakistan as china s irreplaceable all weather friend three months later china agreed to sell pakistan eight conventional submarines worth 5 billion the biggest arms sale by beijing in addition china s weapons deliveries to pakistan include naval patrol vessels unmanned aerial vehicles and surface to air missiles last december a special forces contingent of china s military arrived in pakistan to participate in the sixth pakistan china joint military exercise pakistani troops played a major role in overpowering the armed militants who had seized the grand mosque in mecca in 1979 threatening the al saud dynasty since then the nation has signed periodic contracts with riyadh to post its soldiers in the kingdom pakistan has lent military expertise to saudi arabia and the two nations conduct joint exercises annually joint naval exercises called naseem al bahr began in 1993 and have become a biennial feature with pakistan becoming a declared nuclear power in 1998 its strategic value to saudi arabia wary of rival iran s nuclear ambitions has risen sharply on the other side india and the united states are worried about the prospect

there are two primary views on china one is bullish one is bearish they both have merit the bull case is that china is in the rise its economic growth is sustainable and soon it will surpass the united states in gdp although with over one billion people it will take far longer to rise to parity in terms of gdp per capita the bear case is that china is the mother of all asset bubbles thanks to an economy managed by the heavy hand of the communist government at every level from the nation to the most remote village so which case is true i m going to say both in the short term the next few years at least the bull case is alive and well china is thriving and any multi year look through the rear view mirror shows a country growing at a rapid rate but the bear case will turn out right as time goes on we know this because china s move is mimicking that of post world war ii japan it s doing that in several ways first china s spending has been fueled by debt putting up gdp growth is easy when your economic base is starting from nothing as china essentially did around 1980 by 2002 joining the world trade organization the growth was still rapid but slower in recent years now there s talk of major trouble already with a growth slowed to the 5 7 percent range still beating the pants off the that growth will stop in time the tree grows toward the sun not to the sun and when that growth stalls enough the growth built on debt will collapse much like how japan s rapid growth in the 1970 s and 1980 s led to bubble valuations in the nikkei index during the 1980 s a great decade for stocks in general japanese stocks averaged over 28 percent per year nearly double the average 16 percent return that the average western nation was getting at the time at one point topping u s stocks in total capitalization the nikkei index fell to less than one fifth that of u s stocks in just a few short years investors in other japanese assets thought they had found a free money machine as well the country s real estate market became so valuable that the land around the emperor s palace in tokyo was considered more valuable than all the real estate in the state of california of course back in the 1980 s california real estate was far more reasonably priced but still the next biggest issue with china is one that plagued japan as well demographics while japan has an aging population that made it the oldest and grayest of the industrialized world china s problem is different because of its one child policy the country has a huge gender mismatch in its working age population right now the ratio of males to females is way out of whack this has created a sort of bulge generation with a larger percentage of males than there would be this partly explains china s military spending priorities a large male only army navy and other military programs provide jobs and a way for the government to spend on this demographic but this will change the ratio will balance without government incentives otherwise and it s likely that the country s population growth will slow and yes age the era of chinese aggression will likely fade in the next few decades although until then it ll be a risky time the country s moves to create artificial islands and expand its territorial waters as a result haven t been challenged as strongly as they could have been by china s neighbors and biggest trading partners while the world tolerates economic aggression this borders on military aggression and should not stand this goes to a fundamental macro investment maxim you can t outrun demographics the united states despite strong immigration legal and otherwise is also joining western nations in becoming older on average things go up and things go down you can t escape a recession yet somehow for nearly 40 years china has done just that but governments can do a lot when they control their chinese invented paper money supply and its 21st century digital equivalent when japan s growth stumbled in the mid 1980 s they used their cheap currency to go on an international buying spree largely in the united states it didn t work out it s always easy to overpay when you feel rich and when financing is readily available there s no telling when the growth will finally stop in china but when the music stops it s going to create a challenge right now the market is ignoring that challenge and at its own peril it s a bigger issue than any trade agreement where the market is focused on china right now at the end of the day however china is putting itself into a debt and demographically created problem that will make one final big growth before bursting how bad the damage will be and how good the buying opportunities are remain to be seen but don t count out a hard landing scenario for china to create the next big buying opportunity for a decade to come so what should investors do there s likely still one or two more big surges left despite the recent market weakness so embracing china now doesn t look like a terrible idea particularly ahead of the announcement of any trade deal just look for a parabolic move in asset prices there to ease out into cash or whatever market is the relative value then and remember a chinese economic recession could be the next big reason for a global recession anywhere near on par with the 2008 market meltdown don

news national by staff reporter reserve bank of zimbabwe governor john mangudya was on thursday grilled in parliament over disparities between the official united states dollar rates of 1 2 5 and the parallel market rate of 1 3 6 resulting in price increases of goods and services mangudya appeared before parliament to speak about fuel challenges in the country when he was asked to explain the impact on the economy of the non availability of foreign currency in the country and the introduction of the real time gross settlement dollars in his recent monetary policy statement mangudya pegged the us exchange rate at 1 2 5 moving away from his initial position that the bond notes and us dollar were at par at a 1 1 ratio uzumba mp simbaneuta mudarikwa zanu pf asked mangudya to explain whether the price of fuel would increase if the exchange rate was to float at for example a rate of 1 3 dangamvura chikanga mp prosper mutseyami also demanded to know how mangudya was going to manage the parallel foreign exchange rates that were always soaring the exchange rate of 1 2 5 is the starting rate and is not a fixed rate and we think that parallel rates exist throughout the world mangudya said however street rates should not determine where prices should be and we will ensure we control that he said there was no money in the country for big companies to be able to purchase foreign currency at the parallel market rate of 1 3 6 mangudya said in terms of fuel the bulk of the orders should be done through the formal inter bank rates what has been happening in the past few weeks is that buyers of foreign currency have not had enough cash to purchase foreign currency we are not convinced that there are companies or firms that can purchase foreign currency at a rate of 1 3 6 because there is no money in the country the people that can afford to buy from the parallel market are only small traders or people that want to pay for dstv otherwise people have no money to buy from the black market some of the fuel dealers are not able to purchase it at the prices we have today because there is no money and because of the balance at their banks he said
america faces several profound challenges most defy easy solutions and even when an appropriate response is apparent multinational cooperation is required as is the case with climate change migration weapons proliferation terrorism and other issues on the other hand budget deficits and the accumulated national debt are within this country s control yet washington is unwilling to responsibly act that fact is apparent from figures released tuesday by the treasury department over the first four months of this fiscal year the federal budget deficit soared from 176 billion to 310 billion a staggering 77 percent increase compared to the same period a year prior what s more according to the congressional budget office by 2022 the annual budget deficit is expected to top 1 trillion this spike is transpiring not during wartime or in response to an economic shock or some other legitimate national emergency rather this happened during a time of economic growth low interest rates and relative peace it is widely agreed that the federal government debt is on an unsustainable path federal reserve chairman jerome powell told a congressional committee hearing in late february congress and president donald trump may agree but they also seem to agree to ignore it breaking previous patterns of the out party suddenly finding fiscal religion and if not religion morality should at least be in play regarding the intergenerational transferring of debt we re just dumping more and more debt on future generations which is limiting their economic prospects and their policy choices so it s generationally very unfair robert bixby executive director of the concord coalition a nonpartisan organization advocating for fiscal responsibility told an editorial writer and the generation equation is exacerbating with baby boomers in a retirement wave and life expectancy along with healthcare costs increasing we ve really done nothing to prepare for it in fact we ve underprepared in running up our debt and deficits over the last 20 years peter g peterson foundation ceo michael peterson told an editorial writer within a decade according to data from the nonpartisan foundation mandatory spending and net interest costs will comprise 78 percent of federal spending leaving just 22 percent as discretionary although many items in this sum are considered mandatory to key constituencies too the economic opportunity and moral costs are significant too spending on net interest costs will soon supersede some other budget essentials like defense and medicaid spending which the peterson foundation notes could crowd out important public investments that can fuel economic growth like education research and development and infrastructure let alone private sector investments that drive our dynamic economy spiraling spending is certainly a factor and both parties are part of the problem republicans backing a spike in military spending among other items and democrats are pushing for other expenditures including extensive new spending promises from many of the party s presidential candidates the irresponsible tax cut passed by a gop controlled congress and signed by trump exacerbated the problem and set up a cynical political trap that makes rectifying the mistake a cudgel in the permanent campaign americans who balance their budgets at kitchen tables deserve real solutions

the pace of hiring in the united states fell last month to its lowest point in nearly a year and a half a surprise drop likely reflecting harsh weather and other temporary factors that led most economists to see the slowdown as a temporary blip employers added just 20 000 jobs down from a blockbuster 311 000 in january even with february s anemic gain job growth over the past three months has averaged a solid 186 000 enough to lower the unemployment rate over time and average hourly pay surged 3 4 percent from a year earlier the sharpest year over year increase in a decade the

the preceding four months job growth should bounce back in march and through the rest of this year last month s pullback in hiring does follow signs that u s economic growth is probably slowing because of a weaker global economy a trade war between the united states and china and signs of caution among american consumers those factors have led many analysts to forecast anemic growth in the first three months of this year but most economists still cautioned against reading too much into february s sluggish pace of hiring the monthly employment data can be volatile during the nearly
