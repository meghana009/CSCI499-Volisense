with monday s 1000 point stock market plunge the internet has been set ablaze with discussion of a new crash looming on the horizon the fact that such a chain reaction collapse was only kept at bay due to massive liquidity injections by the federal reserve s overnight repo loans should not be ignored these injections which began in september 2019 have grown to over 100 billion per night all that to support the largest financial bubble in human history with global derivatives estimated at 1 2 quadrillion 20 times the global gdp sadly economic illiteracy is so pervasive among today s modern economists that the real reasons for this crisis have been entirely misdiagnosed with financial experts from cnn to forbes blaming the volatility on the spread of the corona virus not the corona virus the real cause of the oncoming financial collapse as refreshing as it is to hear candid criticisms of the system s failure and even support for the restoration of glass steagall bank separation from presidential candidates like bernie sanders tulsi gabbard or even the lame elizabeth warren we find that in each case those candidates are on record supporting policies cooked up by the very same oligarchs they appear to despise in the form of the green new deal in spite of what many of its progressive proponents would wish such a global green reform would not only impose malthusian depopulation upon nation states globally were it accepted but would establish a the supranational authority of a technocratic managerial elite as enforcers of a de carbonization agenda due to the rampant lack of comprehension of how this crisis was created such that such idiotic proposals as green new deals are now seriously being suggested as remedies to our current ills a bit of history is in order some necessary background the money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization we may now restore that temple to the ancient truths the measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit franklin delano roosevelt first inaugural address 1933 knowing that the money changers had only been able to create the great bubbles of the 1920s via their access to the deposits of the commercial banks franklin roosevelt made the core of his battle against the abuses of wall street center around a 1933 legislation entitled glass steagall named after the two federally elected officials who led the reform with fdr this was a bill which forced the absolute separation of productive from speculative banking guaranteeing via the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic only those commercial banking assets associated with the productive economy but forcing any speculative losses arising from investment banking to be suffered by the gambler the striking success of this law inspired other countries around the world to establish similar bank separation alongside principles of capital budgeting public credit parity pricing and a commitment to scientific and technological development a dynamic had been created that would express the greatest hope for the world and the greatest fear for the financial empire occupying the city of london and wall street the death of john f kennedy ushered in a new age of pessimism and cultural irrationalism from which our society has never recovered the destruction of a long term vision as exemplified by the space program the st lawrence seaway and the new deal projects had resulted in a tendency within the population to increasingly look upon present pleasures as the only reality and future goods as the mystical expression of the sum of present pleasures in this new philosophical setting so alien in previous epochs money was permitted to act as a power unto itself for short term gains instead of serving the investments into the real productive wealth of society with this new paradigm shift into the now a new economic model was adopted to replace the industrial economic model which had proven itself in the years preceding and following world war ii the name for this system was post industrial monetarism this would be a system ushered in by richard nixon s announcement of the destruction of the fixed exchange rate bretton woods system and its replacement by the floating rate system of post 1971 fame during that same fateful year of 1971 another ominous event took place the formation of the rothschild inter alpha group of banks under the umbrella of the royal bank of scotland which today controls upwards of 70 of the global financial system the stated intention of this group would be found in the 1983 speech by lord jacob rothschild two broad types of giant institutions the worldwide financial service company and the international commercial bank with a global trading competence may converge to form the ultimate all powerful many headed financial conglomerate this policy demanded the destruction of the sovereign nation state system and the imposition of a new feudal structure of world governance through the age old scheme of controlling the money system on the one side and playing on the vices of credulous fools who by allowing their nations to be ruled by the belief that hedonistic market forces govern the world would seal their own children s doom all the while geopolitical structures foreign to the united states constitutional traditions were imposed by nests of oxford trained rhodes scholars and fabians who converted america into a global dumb giant enforcing a neo colonial program under an anglo us special relationship the dulles brothers mcgeorge bundy kissinger and bush all represent names that advanced this british directed plan throughout the 20th century london s big bang the great liberalization of world commerce began with a series of waves through the 1970s and moved into high gear with the interest rate hikes of federal reserve chairman paul volcker in 1980 82 the effects of which both annihilated much of the small and medium sized entrepreneurs opened the speculative gates into the savings and loan debacle and also helped cartelize mineral food and financial institutions into ever greater behemoths volcker himself described this process as the controlled disintegration of the us economy upon becoming fed chairman in 1978 the raising of interest rates to 20 21 not only shut down the life blood of much of the us economic base but also threw the third world into greater debt slavery as nations now had to pay usurious interest on us loans in 1986 the city of london announced the beginning of a new era of economic irrationalism with margaret thatcher s big bang deregulation this wave of liberalization took the world by storm as it swept aside the separation of commercial deposit and investment banking which had been the post world war cornerstone in ensuring that the will of private finance would never again hold more sway than the power of sovereign nation states after decades of chipping away at the structure of regulation that fdr s bold intervention into history had built the big bang set a precedent for similar financial de regulation into the universal banking model in other parts of the western world the derivative time bomb is set in september 1987 the 20 year foray into speculation resulted in a 23 collapse of the dow jones on october 19 1987 within hours of this crash international emergency meetings had been convened with former jp morgan tool alan greenspan introducing a solution which would have the future echoes of hyperinflation and fascism written all over it creative financial instruments was the orwellian name given to the new financial asset popularized by greenspan but otherwise known as derivatives new supercomputing technologies were increasingly used in this new venture not as the support for higher nation building practices and space exploration programs as their nasa origins intended but would rather become perverted to accommodate the creation of new complex formulas which could associate values to price differentials on securities and insured debts that could then be hedged on those very spot and future markets made possible via the destruction of the bretton woods system in 1971 so while an exponentially self generating monster was created that could end nowhere but in a meltdown market confidence rallied back in force with the new flux of easy money the physical potential to sustain human life continued to plummet nafta the euro and the end of history it is no coincidence that within this period another deadly treaty was passed called the north american free trade agreement nafta with this agreement made law protective programs that had kept north american factories in the u s and canada were struck down allowing for the export of the lifeblood of highly skilled industrial workforce to mexico where skills were low technologies lower and salaries lower still with a stripping of its productive assets north america became increasingly reliant on exporting cheap resources and services for its means of existence again the physically productive powers of society would collapse yet monetary profits in the ephemeral now would skyrocket this was replicated in europe with the creation of the maastricht treaty in 1992 establishing the euro by 1994 while the liberalization process of perestroika replicated this agenda in the former soviet union while some personalities gave this agenda the name end of history and others the new world order the effect was the same universal banking nafta euro integration and the creation of the derivative economy in a space of just several years would induce a cartelization of finance through newly legalized mergers and acquisitions at a rate never before seen the multitude of financial institutions that had existed in the early 1980s were absorbed into each other at great speed through the 1990s in true survival of the fittest fashion no matter what level of regulation was attempted under this new structure the degree of conflict of interest and private political power was uncontrollable as evidenced in the united states by the shutdown of any attempt by securities and exchange commission head brooksley born to fight the derivative cancer at its early stages by 1999 a politically castrated bill clinton found himself signing into law a treaty authored by then treasury secretary larry summers known as the gramm leach bliley act which would be the final nail in the coffin for the glass steagall separation of commercial and investment banking in the united states the new age of unregulated trading and creation of over the counter derivatives caused these strange financial instruments to grow from 60 trillion in 2000 to 600 trillion by 2008 the 2000 2008 frenzy with glass steagall now removed legitimate capital such as pension funds could be used to start a hedge to end all hedges billions were now poured into mortgage backed securities mbs a market which had been artificially plunged to record breaking interest rate lows of 1 2 for over a year by the us federal reserve making borrowing easy and the returns on the investments into the mbss obscene the obscenity swelled as the values of the houses skyrocketed far beyond the real values to the tune of one hundred thousand dollar homes selling for 5 6 times that price within the span of several years as long as no one assumed this growth was ab normal and the unpayable nature of the capital underlying the leveraged assets locked up in the now infamous sub primes and other illegitimate debt obligations was ignored then profits were supposed to just continue infinitely anyone who questioned this logic was considered a heretic by the latter day priesthood the stunning success of securitizing housing debts immediately induced a wave of sovereign wealth funds to come into prominence applying the same model that had been used in the case of mortgage backed securities mbs and collateralized debt obligations cdo to the debts of entire nations the securitizing of bundled packages of sovereign debts that could then be infinitely leveraged on the de regulated world markets would no longer be considered an act of national treason but the key to easy money conclusion this is the system which died in 2008 contrary to popular belief nothing was actually resolved for all the talk of an fdr revival under obama speculation wasn t actually regulated under the dodd frank act or the volker rule of 2010 no productive credit was created to grow the real economy under a national mission as was the case in 1933 1938 banks were not broken up while derivatives grew by 40 with the new bubble concentrated in the corporate household debt sector now collapsing during this time nation states continued to be stripped as austerity was rammed down the throats of nations it should be no surprise that in the midst of this despair a creative alliance was consolidated in defense of the interests of sovereign nation states and humanity at large led by the leadership of russia and china this leadership took the form of the china led belt and road initiative which has grown to embrace over 130 countries today and looking more and more like an asian led version of the new deal of the 1930s indeed china s capacity to unleash long term credit for thousands of international long term infrastructure projects was made possible by the fact that it was the only country on the globe which had not given up the principles of bank separation which were destroyed in every other nation very few western figures stood up to this self induced destruction over the decades but one notable exception here worth mentioning is the figure of the late american economist lyndon larouche 1922 2019 who not only resisted this process for over four decades but fought alongside the schiller institute to promote new silk road as early as 1996 with the 2016 brexit and election of president trump a new wave of nationalist spirit has become a fire which the technocrats have lost their capacity to snuff out increasingly the idea that nation states have a power over the private banking system has become revived and discussion for reforming the now dead trans atlantic system is increasingly shaped not by the calls for a new world order as sir kissinger would have liked but rather for a new silk road and a true new deal the eurasian nations are already firmly committed to this new system and if the west is to qualify morally to take part in this new epoch then the first step will be a return to a glass steagall
hiruni a fisherman s wife who has to manage her household of five people with an income of about 2 5 euros 500 sri lankan rupees per day is heavily indebted in order to increase her household income she borrowed 50 000 rupees 250 euros from a local money lending institution which specialises in micro credit with this money she started producing insecticide treated mosquito nets as recommended by foundations such as bill gates which she sold for rs 2 000 eur 10 each for a while this worked but two factors beyond her control worked against her 1 the grossly abusive interest rate charged by the money lending institution over 50 interest rate and the huge penalties for late payments 2 a powerful commercial firm started selling imported nets at 25 lesser that hers and payable in two installments hiruni was not able to withstand this competition because the price offered by this firm was much lower than her production costs she had to stop production and marketing of nets and was no longer able to repay loans this led her to contract another loan from another bank in order to settle the lending institution hiruni became desperate and heavily indebted imf s actions has a direct impact on the fate of hundreds of thousands of women like hiruni in sri lanka it supports the lending and other financial institutions to set the rates they want in the name of freedom of prices and the market for years the imf has been pushing for an end to customs barriers protecting local producers whether farmers fishermen artisans or others this is one of the reasons why hiruni and others like her can no longer make a living out of what they produce the imf together with the world bank and other international institutions also promotes the deregulation of the banking sector and micro credit it supports the right of credit companies to set the rates they want in the name of freedom of prices and the market this is why hiruni and so many others have to pay exorbitant interest rates the imf in collaboration with other international institutions put pressure on governments to privatize or close down public credit banks who were providing loans at reasonable usually at subsidized rates i e without making profits which the imf and the world bank abhor this is another reason why hiruni and others cannot find credit from government sources to complete this negative picture one must add several conditionalities imposed by the imf s credit policy handed out to sri lanka like in so many other countries the imf wants the government to reduce the public deficit by trimming social spending and reducing government staff as a result hiruni and millions of people in sri lanka witnessed the free education and healthcare drastically eroded indeed sri lanka is one of the few countries where health and education are still free in principle but the austerity measures imposed by the government in complicity with the imf mean that the real cost of education including primary education and basic health is constantly rising as school books and medicines have to be paid for and parents are also being pushed into private education and healthcare to escape the falling public service therefore poor families have to go into debt from micro credit agencies to meet school and health expenses and it is the women who are directly affected since they are primary responsible for ensuring education and health for their children the imf states that the government s decision to set a maximum interest rate of 35 on micro credit loans can only be temporary because the distortion sic of the functioning of the financial market must be avoided the list of neo liberal measures recommended by the imf having a disastrous impact on the daily lives of millions of people in sri lanka and hundreds of millions worldwide is enormous and this will only change if the people get rid of the imf by electing such political forces in the government that have the will to bring radical solutions that ensure respect for social justice the enjoyment of human rights and respect for nature current imf policy in sri lanka in 2016 the neo liberal government of sri lanka appealed to the imf which in return pledged us 1 600 million in credit on the condition that it would follow the imf s recommendations this programme is still being implemented and the balance sheet is entirely negative on february 7 2020 an imf visit to sri lanka concluded the imf states that the government s decision to set a maximum interest rate of 35 on micro credit loans can only be temporary because the distortion of the functioning of the financial market must be avoided it should be noted that the government set such a ceiling as it was under pressure from the streets thousands of women victims of micro credit and its abusive rates had mobilized in the north of the country to demand that interest rates should not exceed 25 which remains an extremely high rate since the inflation rate is only 4 setting the maximum interest rate at 35 is a limited concession made by the government in view of the scale of the social drama and the risk of extending the mobilizations it should also be noted that in a very clear report the united nations independent expert on debt and human rights sounded the alarm about the dramatic situation experienced by the very many victims of micro credit in sri lanka his report written after completing a field mission was damning for the government financial institutions and other foreign donors he called on the government to act the volume of sri lanka s public debt has risen sharply over the past three years and now exceeds 90 of gdp it should be recalled that the current imf arrangement dates back to 2016 however between 2016 and the end of 2018 public debt increased by 30 the government had tried to justify itself by claiming that it was pursuing a policy of poverty reduction it should also be noted that the independent expert followed with keen interest the proceedings of the 7th south asia cadtm workshop held in colombo in april 2018 and that sri lankan social movements had submitted to him a public document at the time of his visit in august 2018 as a result of various forms of pressure exerted on it the government set a maximum rate of 35 although this rate is still completely exaggerated and must be characterized as usurious the imf has the audacity to state in its february 7 2020 press release that it is necessary to soon restore the right to freely set rates the imf also calls on the government to end as soon as possible the moratorium on the payment of debts of small and medium sized enterprises it must be said that following the terror attacks of april 2019 tourists have deserted sri lanka for months which has damaged the economy and in particular small and medium enterprises in order to prevent an increase of bankruptcies the government has decreed a suspension of payment of their debts and it is this measure that the imf is also asking to be cancelled soon in addition the imf calls on the government to continue austerity measures and the underhand and gradual privatization of state owned enterprises this applies in particular to srilankan airlines the oil company and the electricity company the european union eu is not to be outdone its investment bank the eib actively supports micro credit enterprises that exploit and despoil hundreds of thousands of women in sri lanka the imf calls on the government to deepen international trade liberalisation and measures to attract foreign investment the negative consequences of this policy are well known the imf is banging its fist on the table to call on the government to implement a firmer policy of austerity in public spending hiruni like the overwhelming majority of sri lanka s population has no fair expectations from the imf the cadtm which held its 8th south asia regional workshop in colombo in february 2020 supported the struggle of victims of government and imf policies the un independent expert on debt and human rights sent a message to the cadtm workshop participants that addresses the substantive issues it should be noted that in addition to the fatal agreements with the imf the deadly action of the trump administration also plays a significant role in the deterioration of the living conditions of a large majority of the sri lankan population one of the channels of washington s intervention is a federal agency created in 2004 called the millennium challenge corporation mcc which has been active in sri lanka since april 2019 it assigns good or bad ratings to the countries in which it operates its deleterious action is combined with that of usaid the other federal agency that strongly encourages further job insecurity in sri lanka so that the imf does not deal with it directly cadtm joins hiruni and other like her has finally decided to resist for after having been a passive victim hiruni joined the action of active resistance like many other women who demonstrated in colombo on 27 february 2020 to request that the government respond to their demands the eu is not to be outdone its investment bank the eib actively supports micro credit enterprises that exploit and despoil hundreds of thousands of women in sri lanka it should also be noted that the so called ethical european private bank also invests in the micro credit business in the country of course we must not forget china for which sri lanka occupies a geo strategic position in terms of trade routes china is building a number of ports without taking into account the preservation of the environment and it is doing so while putting sri lanka into debt china is not giving a gift either eric toussaint is a

this post was contributed by a community member the views expressed here are the author s own politics government bloomberg will reduce budget deficit by raising taxes on wealthy connecticut campaign chief says democratic presidential hopeful will invest in up to 30 innovation growth hubs by scott benjamin milford brett broesder who is managing mike bloomberg s campaign in connecticut for the democratic presidential nomination says the former new york city mayor has the equivalent of an aaa bond rating and it s not just because he is according to forbes the ninth richest man in the world he came in after 9 11 and 12 years later he left it with a budget surplus said broesder during an interview at one of the 10 bloomberg campaign headquarters in the nutmeg state there are two in each congressional district connecticut will hold its primary on april 28 former new york times columnist bill keller wrote in 2013 that bloomberg left the big apple in a better place than when he arrived at gracie mansion not only did gotham rebound from the terrorist attacks on the world trade center but it survived the 2008 financial crisis occupy wall street was not part of the vernacular when bloomberg was initially elected however does bloomberg need to change the subject from the economy since there s not much gloom as the nation is enjoying the longest expansion its 244 year history new york times columnist david brooks wrote recently that john kennedy won in 1960 emphasizing the missile gap and richard nixon prevailed in 1968 with a pledge toward law and order bloomberg is running on the slogan mike will get it done but wouldn t the admirers of gotham s most famous real estate mogul say that when it comes to the economy donald has already gotten it done the washington post has reported that gallup polls indicated that 68 percent of americans in 2020 are satisfied with the economy in contrast to just 46 percent when trump took office in january 2017 the most challenging thing in a presidential election is to be the party out of power when there is a strong economy lynn vavreck the ucla political science professor who wrote a landmark book in 2009 on presidential campaigns the message matters princeton university press 232 pages told los angeles times columnist doyle mcmanus in 2019 unemployment is at a 50 year low under republican president donald trump as he seeks a second term the washington post reported that economic growth was steady at 2 3 percent in 2019 and inflation has been tame trump also got a free trade agreement with mexico and canada approved in the u s house a feat that contrasts with the failure of his predecessor democrat barack obama in getting the proposed 13 nation trans pacific partnership to a vote brooks wrote that an opposition party can retake the white house in a time of rising economic conditions but it can t do it by denying the felt reality of a majority of americans however is there a hidden reality the hill reported last year that former massachusetts gov william weld who is seeking the 2020 republican presidential nomination criticized the president for burdening the economy with deficits of a trillion dollars every year following his supply side tax reform of late 2017 former south carolina gov and former u s rep mark sanford who withdrew last fall from the republican presidential race wrote recently in the new york times that we have never run deficits this big in peace time the fastest growing spending item for the federal government is interest on the national debt broesder said mike believes that in the end public spending has to be paid for president trump has ignored this and has put the government s debt on an unsustainable path he is committed to addressing the gross domestic product to debt ratio university of california at berkeley economists emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman advisors to democratic presidential candidate elizabeth warren s campaign wrote in their 2019 book the triumph of injustice w w norton co 229 pages that the ultra rich are paying at the lowest tax rates since the 1920s broesder remarked that bloomberg s plan calls for taxes that put the additional budget on those who can best afford to bear it by reversing the trump tax cuts for high income earners restoring the top rate on ordinary income from 37 percent to 39 6 percent larry kudlow of redding the director of the national economic council in 2016 co authored with brian domitrovic jfk and the reagan revolution penguin random house 250 pages which endorsed the supply side tax reforms of presidents john kennedy a democrat and ronald reagan a republican they stated that federal officials needed to again endorse the free market principles of limited government low tax rates and a strong dollar however washington post economics columnist robert samuelson has stated that the kennedy tax cut is probably the worst domestic policy decision in the united states since world war ii he wrote that the tax reductions were partly responsible for four recessions between 1969 and 1982 and the policy made it more politically acceptable to run budget deficits since the kennedy tax cut was signed there have been only five years 1969 and 1998 2001 when there were surpluses former greenwich resident david stockman the director of the federal office of management budget criticized in his 1986 book the triumph of politics public affairs 466 pages the economic program that he helped create under former republican president ronald reagan in a new york times review of stockman s book michael kinsley wrote a presidency founded on a pledge to balance the federal budget managed to double the national debt in just four years when former republican president george w bush signed the 1 35 trillion tax reduction in june 2001 the country was in the fourth consecutive year of budget surpluses all of which had been submitted by democratic president bill clinton who had increased taxes in 1993 and then followed policy of fiscal discipline that along with republican congressional leaders addressed deficit reduction and welfare reform the budget that w bush submitted in october 2001 went into deficit as has every federal budget since then regarding trade broesder said bloomberg supports the efforts of u s house speaker nancy pelosi d calif and her caucus to improve the proposed united states mexico canada agreement usmca the democrat s plan lowered pollution increased infrastructure resiliency eliminated handouts to big companies and included provisions to lower drug costs he added it has the strongest enforcement mechanisms of any u s trade agreement the proposal would replace the north american free trade agreement that clinton signed in 1993 as for the future peter diamandis and steven kotler wrote in their recent book the future is faster than you think simon schuster 384 pages that there will be more upheaval and wealth creation in the next 10 years than the previous 100 years combined as a result of such factors as artificial intelligence and the elon musk hyper loop train broesder said that bloomberg will launch a major research and development initiative to create up to 30 new growth hubs in regions that need good jobs the most the investment modeled on the federal programs that brought us the internet and the bioscience industry will focus on generating scientific breakthroughs in areas such as public health hydrogen power green technology and sustainable agriculture brooks recently applauded bloomberg for transforming the city of heroes to the point where it is second in the country behind silicon valley in technology investment university of california at berkeley economist enrico moretti who in 2012 wrote the new geography of jobs mariner books 304 pages has stated that the future success for the american economy is in trying to emulate the five major innovation hubs silicon valley seattle the north carolina research triangle austin and the route 128 corridor in massachusetts he has stated that usually each new innovation related job creates up to five spin off positions in the local economy regarding the presidential campaign broesder who worked for gov ned lamont d greenwich and lt gov susan bysiewicz d middletown during the 2018 state campaign said that he is encouraged noting for example that 70 people attended an outreach session recently in stamford and volunteers have been manning phone banks for weeks including making calls to the 14 states voting in the march 3 super tuesday primaries former bridgeport mayor bill finch and former new haven mayor toni harp have endorsed bloomberg to win the general election broesder said among the democrats prime targets are suburban women who voted democratic in the 2018 mid term election blue collar workers who supported obama in 2008 and 2012 but went to donald trump in 2016 and people of color who had supported obama in his two races but didn t go to the polls in 2016 entering the race just last fall bloomberg did not compete in the first four primaries caucuses held in iowa new hampshire nevada and south carolina dan balz the longtime political writer for the washington post wrote shortly after former vice president joe biden s resounding victory in the february 29 south carolina primary that the race has been recast into a two way campaign between front runner bernie sanders the vermont u s senator who was second in delegates to hillary rodham clinton in 2016 and biden said broesder i think the race is far from over dan pfeiffer who served as communications director in the obama white house has said 80 percent of his time on the 2008 campaign was on what the mainstream news media might report and with the changes resulting from twitter and iphone any 2020 campaign devoting that amount of time on those activities will lose broesder agreed that digital advertising and the social media have become larger components in campaigns even to the point that some candidates are running fewer television commercials he added that bloomberg has the resources to match trump who in 2016 was light years ahead of where the democrats have been on digital communication

the euro us dollar exchange rate is hovering around 1 11434 0 01 on monday march 3 ahead of the european trading session technically erik bregar currency analyst at the exchange bank of canada thinks the market could be rip for a short term pullback the result of which would create a new trading range now albeit higher now lets call it 1 1000 1 1160 exchange rates uk research team have compiled a roundup of expert fx views on the current eur usd outlook from eighteen leading fx analysts eighteen currency analyst views and opinion on euro near to medium term outlook shaun osborne chief fx strategist at scotiabank eur usd short term technicals are neutral bullish the eur hit its highest mark in over five weeks as it targets a firm and sustained breach above the 1 11 mark continuing a steep and nearly uninterrupted rally from its year to date low of 1 0778 just seven sessions ago today s move has seen the eur blast past its 40 100 and 200 dma to trade above all three marks for the first time since midjan while the eur stubbornly traded in oversold territory for around a ten day stretch in mid feb it is now quickly racing toward trading in overbought territory we think the eur should start to lose momentum above the 1 11 mark with the 1 1150 area acting as resistance following an intermediate ceiling at 1 1120 support is 1 1080 90 erik bregar exchange bank of canada euro dollar surged higher to chart resistance in the 1 1150s overnight as global bond markets now demand immediate rate cuts from the fed fridays intra day hesitation at the 1 1000 level proved short lived after the market closed ny trade firmly above it and with that traders had another positive technical development to latch on to at the start of asian trade last night weve rallied over 250pts now however since eurusd ended its downtrend with a break above the 1 0880 1 0900s last week and we feel as if the market has now probably flushed out all the new fund shorts that entered during the first three weeks of february fridays cot report showed the fund net short eurusd positioning extending to a new 3 year high as of february 25th with that we think the market could be rip for a short term pullback the result of which would create a new trading range nowalbeit higher now lets call it 1 1000 1 1160 mary mcnamara market analyst at acy securities advertisement robin wilkin global cross asset strategy at lloyds commercial banking prices continue to extend the rebound from the 1 0780 lows now approaching resistance in the 1 1090 1 1160 region momentum studies and elliott wave structures would suggest that the upside should be limited to this region and another pullback will develop support on that move lies currently in the 1 1000 1 0950 region however we will be watching to see if pullbacks remain corrective in nature for a test above 1 1160 and 1 1240 in the future or we just head back to channel support mohammed isah fxtechstrategy com eurusd faces risk of further move higher following its past week rally resistance comes in at the 1 1050 where a break will turn risk to the 1 1100 level a breach below here will target the 1 1150 level further up resistance stands at the 1 1200 conversely on the downside support comes in at 1 1000 level with a violation of there opening the door for further gain towards the 1 0950 level further down resistance lies at the 1 0900 level a cut through that level will clear the way for a move towards the 1 0850 level all in all eurusd looks for more recovery higher fx analyst at credit suisse eurusd has been floored as expected by the long term potential uptrend from 2000 at 1 0778 51 and although the market remains in a clear medium term downtrend we think the risks are likely that we see a reversal back higher within the shallow downtrend very much in line with the previous immediately reversed breakdowns that we have seen during this shallow downtrend in contrast a move below 1 0751 would suggest the medium term downtrend is accelerating with the next support on a break below 1 0778 51 seen at 1 0682 a corrective price low before a more prominent price low at 1 0569 anton kolhanov kolhanov com the uptrend may be expected to continue while pair is trading above support level 1 0940 which will be followed by reaching resistance level 1 1087 and 1 1170 a downtrend will start as soon as the pair drops below support level 1 0940 which will be followed by moving down to support level 1 0829 dr jörg krämer chief economist at commerzbank low fx volatility has made carry trades more attractive this is negative for eur because of its interest rate disadvantage with usd eur usd is likely to remain under pressure for some time avery shenfeld cibc safe haven assets have been on a tear lately in the wake of widespread concern about the novel coronavirus the us dollar in particular has caught a bid over the past five weeks up more than 5 against some majors but how big are these moves looking back to the financial crisis it s clear that the latest run of dollar buying pales in comparison while the financial crisis was born in the us it didn t stop capital from piling into safe dollar based assets in the wake of lehman brothers as a result the risks today appears to be toward more near term dollar strength even if the virus reaches america in a meaningful way chris turner ing eur usd is rallying on the back of broad based de leveraging recall that the eur had become a popular funding currency and we ve recently seen huge unwinds of popular carry trades in high yield em currencies such as rub zar and mxn the ecb will be in no mood to jump in with a pre emptive rate cuts but could be forced to act were equities to continue to fall hard here the market looks like it is pricing a 10bp ecb rate cut over coming months it is still not clear the ecb would go with a rate cut e g an increase in the tiering of deposits is another option but we hear little from the ecb ahead of the 12 march meeting the first look at february cpi and retail sales are the key eurozone releases in the week ahead despite some better activity data in january the fear is that covid 19 will hit europe hard in 1h20 and that is why we view the current eur usd rally as short term and corrective in nature christin tuxen head of fx research chief analyst at danske bank for eur usd we are seeing an illustration of why paralysed central banks mix up the relative rates channel in fx we believe the ecb is unlikely to cut as a virus response eur positive given pricing while the fed might soon be ripe to give in usd negative as this is likely to spark hopes of more while the fed is now priced for a full cut in april our base case pricing could easily become more aggressive if the risk of the tail increases thus we could see eur usd testing 1 11 near term john hardy head of fx strategy saxo bank group the euro move continues and eur usd may not find meaningful resistance until at least 1 1200 if the negative market energy continues regardless the eurusd chart has turned and the chief question for bulls now will be the magnitude of any backfills lower if any relief rally in risk appetite appears for example on a surprise fed move or other kathy lien bk asset management the best performing currency was the euro which rose nearly 1 against the us dollar the currency pair benefitted from stronger eurozone confidence numbers and a downward revision to the personal consumption component of us q4 gdp it is difficult to foresee the rally in eur usd continuing with the virus spreading quickly across europe the german and italian economies were faltering before we even heard about the words coronavirus and with the outbreak hitting the industrial heartland of italy 2020 could be another ugly year for europe italy was one of the weakest european economies in 2019 while germany barely avoided recession for all of these reasons we expect the rally in eur usd to hit a brick wall quickly sal guatieri director and senior economist at bmo we now assume that at least a modest outbreak of the virus will occur on this side of the pond the number of new cases outside of china is on the rise forcing some countries to shut down factories that will help contain the spread of the virus but also disrupt the global supply chain that greases u s production the tourism industry faces a deeper chill as businesses shelve travel plans and people stay home and despite lower interest rates financial conditions won t remain supportive if equities continue to buckle credit spreads widen further and the u s dollar keeps rising a recent improvement in u s labour productivity could reverse as businesses will likely try to avoid lay offs given the assumed temporary impact on demand martin enlund nordea haven demand has been the general trend in the fx space as well the usd ought to be faring well from a relative macro point of view as the news flow has been worse out of the euro area moreover going by the latest and official virus numbers the situation in china is improving from a weak level while europe is getting worse despite this eur usd has been moving higher we think the main driver of this eur strength is unwind of eur funded em carry trades eur usd looks nicely and inversely correlated with the s p500 future for now jane foley rabobank the usd was spooked yesterday by the news that the us centres for disease control and prevention reported a new case of covid 19 in california which could represent the first us case spreading within the general population the related concerns have taken some of the steam out of the usd s recent gains however it remains the case the eur is also blighted by coronavirus concerns marc andré fongern head of fx research keynote speaker at fongern global forex fiscal stimulus becomes the pivotal issue inevitably the german government has hardly any other option but to lend a helping hand to the economy as the consequences of the virus particularly for the industrial sector are likely to be clearly evident over the next few months richard perry hantec markets the euro was already engaging a technical recovery but the gains seen in yesterday s session would have surprised even the more positive of traders adding 118 pips on the session was the biggest one day rise on eur usd since january 2019 the technical rally accelerated through key resistance at 1 0980 and also broke an eight week downtrend with rsi into the high 50s macd and stochastics accelerating higher the bulls are in control for now however we would caution backing against the dollar for too long here the sell off on the dollar is similar to the sell off on the yen last week a move which quickly unwound we have been seeing a technical rally on eur usd as counter trend and a move which is likely to be short term in duration the move has gone further than we anticipated but technically the outlook is still corrective on a medium term basis old resistance is at 1 1065 1 1100 with falling moving averages overhead a move above 1 1100 which is a lower high would change the outlook but this is still likely to be a short term rebound that hits the buffers once more initial support at 1 0965 eur usd weekly recap and 5 day outlook at the start of the week the euro us dollar eur usd exchange rate edged lower with the pairing dropping back towards 1 08 due to the spread of coronavirus the rapid spread of covid 19 pushed traders towards the safe haven dollar as investors feared the outbreak could become a pandemic as south korea italy and iran battled with outbreaks usd benefitted as many analysts viewed the american economy as being well shielded from the covid 19 outbreak the pairing remained largely flat on tuesday after data revealed the german economy stagnated in the final three months of 2019 shrinking exports weighed on economic activity and the data confirmed the bloc s largest economy had been struggling before the outbreak of coronavirus meanwhile the greenback remained under pressure as traders now expect an interest rate cut from the federal reserve a cut would relieve any pressure put on the country s economy caused by the outbreak of covid 19 the pairing edged up slightly after a us official from the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc said that the country needed to prepare for the virus to spread within the usa the single currency made some gains despite italy reporting more than 300 cases and 11 deaths from the virus thursday saw the eur usd exchange rate rise after the eurozone s business was better than expected in february meanwhile the us reported a coronavirus infection of unknown origin and the cdc warned of the possibility of community spread many feared other countries would face similar issues as china which saw its economy paralyzed by the efforts made to contain the outbreak on friday eur usd volatility jumped to the highest in more than a year due to growing fears about the covid 19 outbreak the increased fears saw recession fears increase and this fuelled large currency movements marc andré fongern head of fx research at fongern global forex said the virus has turned the markets upside down stocks are collapsing while for the foreseeable future abysmally poor economic figures are likely to be the rule rather than the exception consequently the japanese yen remains the preferred currency looking ahead looking ahead the euro eur could edge higher against the us dollar usd following the release of german manufacturing data if markit reveals the german manufacturing pmi has edged higher in february the single currency will edge higher meanwhile the pairing could slump on monday afternoon following the release of the us federal reserve s preferred measure of manufacturing pmi if the ism manufacturing pmi rises higher than expected the greenback will edge higher tuesday could see the pairing extend losses if february s flash eurozone consumer price index cpi disappoints meanwhile the single currency could make some gains if german retail sales rebound in january and the country s markit pmi composite remains firmly in growth territory february s us ism non manufacturing pmi could dampen dollar sentiment if the figure comes in below expectations showing the rate of growth has slowed friday could see the us dollar make further gains against the euro following the release of february s non farm payrolls data if the us adds more jobs than expected to its economy the euro to us dollar eur usd exchange rate will slump at the end of the week

share transalta renewables inc transalta renewables or the company tsx rnw announced today solid financial results which were at the upper end of its guidance for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 along with its 2020 outlook comparable ebitda decreased by 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to lower revenues from canadian wind due to the timing of recognition of environmental attributes and incentives lower earnings from canadian gas due to a one time positive market pricing event in 2018 lower earnings from australia due to the weakening of the australian dollar relative to the canadian dollar and higher litigation costs these were partially offset by the receipt of insurance proceeds related to a fire at summerview full year comparable ebitda increased 8 million to 438 million compared to 2018 mainly due to the inclusion of a full year of results from the lakeswind wind farm and the mass solar facility and the receipt of insurance proceeds related to 2018 tower fires at the summerview and wyoming wind farms partially offset by an unfavourable foreign exchange impact on the australian gas operations due to the weakening australian dollar relative to the canadian dollar higher comparable ebitda lower interest expense and higher interest income contributed positively to higher affo and cafd but were offset by higher current income tax expense and higher tax equity distributions overall our affo of 343 million was consistent with 2018 affo for 2018 was positively impacted by the change in long term receivable in our australian gas business segment cafd decreased by 2 million year over year to 293 million due to higher principal repayments on the amortizing debt and finance leases net earnings attributable to common shareholders decreased by 57 million the decrease was attributable to a reduction in finance income of 53 million primarily related to higher return of capital and redemptions compared to 2018 lower interest income of 37 million primarily due to the redemption of the mandatory redeemable preferred shares mrps higher foreign exchange losses of 37 million recorded on the preferred shares tracking the amortizing term loan of transalta energy australia pty ltd tea an australian subsidiary of transalta and higher depreciation expense of 14 million mainly due to changes in wind component useful lives partially offset by an increase in the change in fair value of the preferred shares tracking the amortizing term loan of 50 million and a decrease of interest expense of 6 million the company also declared a monthly dividend of 0 07833 per common share for holders of record on april 15 2020 may 15 2020 and june 15 2020 payable on each of april

2019 respectively in conjunction with the big level and antrim wind farms reaching commercial operation approximately 166 million us 126 million of tax equity financing proceeds were raised by the project entities to partially fund the projects from the tax equity proceeds a subsidiary of transalta repaid 52 million us 40 million of interest bearing promissory notes issued by the company to fund the construction of the big level and antrim wind farms the remaining amount of the tax equity proceeds is held as reserves within the project entity and will be released upon certain conditions

here s our summary of key economic events over the weekend that affect new zealand with news the economic and behavioural impacts of the virus emergency are now starting to show and we start another chaotic week china s official pmi revealed a stunning contraction in january it recorded a stall but no expansion or contraction 50 0 but in february it records a precipitous fall nationwide down to a sharp contraction at only 35 7 and that is having very severe knock on impacts their service sector recorded an even more severe contraction going from an expanding 54 1 in january to 29 6 in february that is close to a standstill in most industries as they noted only the monetary and financial services and capital market services business activity indexes remained in the expansion range with the rest frozen new order levels were even worse and on instructions from beijing china s banks are no longer recording loans as bad as a result of coronavirus economic pressures the latest compilation of covid 19 data is here there are now 7644 cases outside china a rise of 1713 in one day a week ago that outside china number was 2208 so it has more than trebled in a week south korea italy and iran have all reported a spike in cases of course we now have one too from an incoming kiwi who traveled to iran but take caution with this data china isn t adding those who test positive but are asymptomatic and iran s data is likely vastly higher than reported the disease is raging there across the whole country the who has still not declared a pandemic preferring to focus on positive progress in china however wall street is still running very scared with investors collectively consumed by a risk off mood that is throwing up some odd reactions stocks were down sharply at the end of last week benchmark bond yields reached record low levels there is a general flight to safety and the gold price has sunk trading on wall street was volatile closing down 0 8 for the day down 11 5 for the week it was the largest weekly correction since 2008 and tops a us 3 tln drop in capitalisation in the real world of economic data the widely watched chicago area pmi is still contracting but less so and also less than analysts were expecting the us fed s preferred measure of inflation came in unchanged at 1 6 pa and not making the rise that was expected the same january data showed a surprisingly strong rise personal incomes which should have been market positive but consumer spending dipped more than expected indicating american consumers are fearful of the future these are measures of actual behaviour on the business side wholesale inventories keep on falling while retail inventories keep on rising and american trade data shows exports falling marginally in january while imports fell slightly faster so there was a small improvement in their merchandise trade deficit even if it wasn t significant for their economy on a year on year basis north of the border canada posted a better than expected gdp result for the final quarter of 2019 but was still only at a tepid 1 9 pa level but none of this slew of basically positive data actually means much it s is all about fear and panic by investors on how consumers are reacting to the covid 19 virus the us fed is under pressure from the financial markets to cut its policy rate but most governors are not sympathetic to a bailout cut right now in fact in most countries bankers and financial industry analysts are seeking rate cuts and other monetary policy easing measures in response to the pressures in essence taxpayer support for their businesses the us fed put out a short statement saying they will use all their tools to act if it becomes necessary elsewhere eyes are on the vast world of junk bond financed businesses investors seem to be fleeing quickly now and this will be existential for many if they can t roll over their debt financing the ust 10yr yield is now at 1 16 and lower by a sharp 31 bps for the week and their rate curves are behaving strangely today their 2 10 curve is more positive at 23 bps their 1 5 curve is more negative at 7 bps and their 3m 10yr curve has shifted sharply more negative at 33 bps these are more like signs of confusion rather than indicators the aussie govt 10yr is down 26 bps for the week at just 0 68 the china govt 10yr now at 2 80 and down 13 bps for the week the nz govt 10 yr is down 20 bps for the week at 1 06 all these are are unprecedented drops and gold also made a spectacular retreat at the end of last week down us 64 to us 1 586 oz the expected behaviour in the face of sudden rising risks is that the gold price would jump but it has done the opposite us oil prices are sharply lower at just us 44 50 bbl the brent benchmark is also lower at just under us 50 50 bbl but both represent big 15 falls for the week the kiwi dollar starts this week at 62 5 usc after another 1c fall last week it is now at its lowest level since 2009 since the start of 2020 the devaluation is down to 7 5 on the cross rates we have held at 95 9 auc against the euro we are also down nearly 1c for the week at 56 7 euro cents that means our twi 5 is now at 68 2 and also its lowest since 2019 bitcoin is now at us 8 514 which is more than an 13 retreat in a week on top of the prior week s 5 fall the bitcoin rate is charted in the exchange rate set

an american stevenson yang 56 is fluent in mandarin although her husband a former people s liberation army intelligence officer and their two adult children sometimes mock her accent for stevenson yang who toted chairman mao zedong s little red book in high school her years in china have given her a skeptical view of the nation s miraculous growth her disenchantment arises from the stark inequality of wealth and opportunity the thuggishness of the communist elite and the amount of chicanery and accounting fraud engaged in by chinese companies and government organs read on to find out why she thinks that china has entered the early stages of slowing expansion severe credit problems and potential instability barron s investors seem far more concerned about europe s sinking into economic despond than slowing growth in china are they whistling past the graveyard stevenson yang i think so china for all its talk about economic reform is in big trouble the old model of relying on export growth and heavy investment to power the economy isn t working anymore sure the nation has been hugely successful over recent decades in providing its people with literacy a decent life basic health care shelter and safe cities but starting in 2008 china sought to counter global recession with huge amounts of ill advised investment in redundant industrial capacity and vanity infrastructure projects you know airports with no commercial flights highways to nowhere and stadiums with no teams the country is now submerged by the tsunami of bad debt that begets further unhealthy credit growth to service this debt the recent lowering of benchmark deposit rates by the people s bank of china won t accomplish much because it won t offer more income to households it also gave china s biggest banks the discretion to raise their deposit rates back up to old levels which would give them a competitive advantage how bad can the situation be when the chinese economy grew by 7 3 in the latest quarter people are crazy if they believe any government statistics which of course are largely fabricated in china the heisenberg uncertainty principle of physics holds sway whereby the mere observation of economic numbers changes their behavior for a time we started to look at numbers like electric power production and freight traffic to get a line on actual economic growth because no one believed the gross domestic product gdp figures it didn t take long for beijing to figure this out and start doctoring those numbers too i put much stock in estimates by various economists including some at the conference board that actual chinese gdp is probably a third lower than is officially reported and as for the recent international monetary fund report calling china the world s biggest economy on a purchasing power parity basis how silly was that china is a cheap place to live if one is willing to eat rice cabbage and pork but it s expensive as all get out once you factor in the cost of decent housing a car and health care i d be shocked if china is currently growing at a rate above say 4 and any growth at all is coming from financial services which ultimately depend on sustained growth in the rest of the economy think about it property sales are in decline steel production is falling commercial long and short haul vehicle sales are continuing to implode and much of the growth in gdp is coming from huge rises in inventories across the economy we track the 400 chinese consumer companies listed on the shanghai and shenzhen stock markets and in the third quarter their gross revenues fell 4 percent from a year ago this is hardly a vibrant economy how bad do you see things getting i hate to wear sackcloth since in late 2011 i became quite bearish and yet a sharp dose of government stimulus managed to steady the economy by our calculations since june the central government directly and indirectly has added more than 400 billion of stimulus and relaxed lending terms for housing purchases yet every spasm of new stimulus seems less and less effective in boosting the economy so most likely china is sinking into a deflationary recession that s increasing in speed and may take some time to run its course investors have lost faith in the property market which alone comprises about 20 percent of gdp when taking into account the entire supply chain from iron ore production to construction to related financial services and appliance sales employment and wage compensation will suffer consumption will continue to suffer there s even an outside possibility that china s economic miracle could end up in a fiery crash landing if a surge in banking system loan defaults outruns government regulators attempt to contain such a credit crisis and restore financial confidence what are some of the other signs of economic malaise a big one is increasing capital flight from china on the part of wealthy chinese and corporations using phony trade invoicing and other ploys to get around the country s capital controls this trend so far has been masked by the influx of hot money into china to take advantage of its higher money market rates strong foreign direct investment and of course china s positive trade balance but something curious is happening in the third quarter china s vaunted foreign currency reserve balance actually declined by 100 billion to 3 89 trillion sales of luxury foreign brands are faltering clearly a lot of wealthy chinese are rushing to cut back on in country assets and get money offshore if one has the ability to own a house in sydney over an apartment in suburban shenzhen the choice is obvious rampant capital flight could turn into a rout given the ridiculous concentration of wealth in china cutting the seemingly impregnable foreign reserves dramatically any other worries the giant government economic stimulus programs since 2008 are rapidly losing their effectiveness the reason is simple much of the money has been squandered in money losing industrial projects and vanity infrastructure spending that make no economic sense beyond supplying temporary bump ups in gdp growth china is riding an involuntary credit treadmill where much new money has to be hosed into the economy just to sustain ever mounting bad debt totals capital efficiency or the amount of capital it takes to generate a unit of gdp growth has soared as a result and what about the much predicted popping of the chinese real estate bubble it is already under way though in seeming slow motion government price data such as its 70 city report aren t all that helpful since the numbers are cherry picked and manipulated but we do know that sales volume has been dropping this year the chinese home real estate market mostly units in high rise buildings is truly bizarre many chinese regard apartments as capital gains machines rather than sources of shelter in fact there are 50 million units in china that are owned but vacant the owners won t rent them because used apartments suffer an immediate haircut in value it s as if the government created a new asset class that no one lives in this fact gives lie to the commonly held myth that the buildout of all these empty towers and ghost cities is a chinese urbanization play the only city folk who don t own housing are the millions of migrant laborers continuously flocking to chinese cities yet they can t afford the new housing what would be the impact of a significant drop in chinese housing prices we ve talked about housing s immense weight in national gdp likewise a huge proportion of financial assets in china both in the banking and shadow banking system are exposed to the real estate market all of china s major corporations are speculating on residential real estate with either cash reserves or borrowed money who wants to build say a shipbuilding plant when a company thinks it can make a lot more speculating in the housing market families have more than half of their wealth in housing including the less affluent in recent years who have taken to buying fractional shares in luxury apartments and town houses local governments which rely on land sales to developers and real estate transfer taxes for something like 35 percent of their revenue would be in a bad way in a housing price bust the psychology bolstering the housing market is changing despite all the efforts of the government to control prices people are starting to realize that housing isn t a one way street to future wealth and selling pressures are starting to build conventional wisdom holds that china has plenty of levers it can pull to stave off severe economic contraction and any debt crisis do you agree not really take for example the 3 9 trillion foreign currency reserves that we discussed many people regard it as a giant piggy bank that can be tapped at will to rectify any financial problem but the reserve is only good for defending the yuan and is a lot less liquid than many people realize and as we pointed out capital flight could dramatically diminish the size of the reserve interestingly liquidity seems to be a growing problem in china chinese corporations have taken on 1 5 trillion in foreign debt in the past year or so where previously they had none a lot of it is short term if defaults start to cascade through the economy it will be more difficult for china to hide its debt problems now that foreign investors are involved it s here that a credit crisis could start bad debt in china never seems to get written down the huge pile of nonperforming bank loans that beijing assumed earlier in the millennium in order to be able to take its major banks public still sits on the balance sheets of various asset management companies all that the government can do is hose down economic problems with more and more cash certainly such investment has proved a powerful tool but you shouldn t mistake wanton money creation with omnipotence you don t put much stock in the rhetoric of president xi jinping s administration about economic reform giving wider sway to free market principles and bolstering chinese consumer spending i see such moves as unlikely to occur anytime soon will be hampered in carrying out such policies by special interest groups and the xi patronage network s desire to maximize their slice of what may well be a diminishing pie china has to invest more and more at falling rates of return just to keep growth going thus by necessity consumption has to decline as a proportion of gdp can you expand on your feelings on xi jinping and his first two years in power he has captivated the foreign press with his seemingly unassuming manner glamorous entertainer wife and the wide diplomatic swath he cut at the asia pacific economic cooperation summit in beijing in my opinion the press is somewhat guilty of willing suspension of disbelief on developments in china xi s agenda of confucian purification has nothing to do with opening up the economy or social reform he wants to bolster the power of the communist party and tamp down the cynicism about the system that is increasing in china this explains in large part his bellicosity in the south china sea quashing of dissent on the internet and elsewhere and heavy handed attacks on non han populations like the uighurs he openly disdains western democratic values of the same piece is china s attacks on foreign companies and brands on the grounds of claimed antimonopoly practices discriminatory pricing corruption and inadequate product quality chinese state owned companies and firms in which party members are invested however are largely exempt from such scrutiny in a state economy like china s the playing field is increasingly tilted so ultimate gains go to chinese companies as for xi s much ballyhooed anti corruption campaign inside china it offends me that international media depict it as a good governance effort what s really going on is an old style party purge reminiscent of the 1950s and 1960s with quota driven arrests summary trials mysterious disappearances and suicides which has already entrapped by our calculations 100 000 party operatives and others the intent is not moral purification by the xi administration but instead the elimination of political enemies and other claimants to the economy s spoils ok anne on that happy note let s conclude
claudio borio s remarks hyun song shin s remarks head of the monetary and economic department claudio borio markets had a rude awakening last week after an initial short lived shock in january market participants had taken a rather benign view of the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy finding comfort also in an accommodating global monetary policy stance everything changed as the week began and news hit the wires that the virus was spreading further and faster than anticipated acute concerns and uncertainty gripped market participants as the expectation of a rapid v shaped recovery now appeared grossly unrealistic markets in risk assets plunged as if no bottom was in sight no one wants to catch a falling knife and yet for all the turmoil and anxiety both market functioning and financial intermediation more generally proved resilient the post crisis regulatory reforms aimed at strengthening financial institutions are bearing fruit the tremors shook markets in successive waves as news unfolded and participants struggled to regain their footing by thursday s close in the united states the more than 10 drop in global equity markets was the worst since the euro area crisis in 2011 the vix soared touching one of the highest levels in recent years safe haven sovereign yields sunk to all time lows or thereabouts in several countries high yield corporate spreads jumped by roughly 100 basis points returning to levels that had prevailed during the heightened trade tensions in early 2019 fixed income assets in emerging market economies emes also experienced a sell off although the correction has been relatively more muted thus far the us dollar appreciated against most currencies but not the euro or the yen or indeed the renminbi which rose in value markets priced in considerable further monetary policy accommodation the federal reserve s greater room for manoeuvre no doubt explains in part the dollar s relative weakness vis à vis the other major currencies the emergence of the first concerns about the virus outbreak in late january had reversed a prolonged risk on phase triggered by the easing of trade tensions and that had taken a number of markets to frothy heights indeed the us equity market had reached an all time high and while the risk off phase had depressed bond yields substantially on balance it had remained muted this was evident from the behaviour of risky assets before the sell off last week stock markets in advanced economies had largely recouped losses and some had again reached new peaks although those in emes were still well below previous highs especially in asia more to the point risky fixed income as an asset class had proved surprisingly resilient throughout showing all the hallmarks of a search for yield alongside buoyant issuance corporate spreads in the united states had drifted down to comparatively low levels and those in the euro area were even tighter by historical norms indeed sovereign spreads on high yielding bonds in the euro area periphery notably italy and greece had actually narrowed and the same was true of eme corporate and sovereign spreads which had reached multi year lows on the back of continued inflows into eme bond funds signs of risk taking were also evident in broader segments of corporate credit this was true not just in the well known leveraged loan and collateralised loan obligation clo markets but also in the less familiar private credit market box a a market that involves loans to smaller often risky firms originated mostly by non bank financial institutions notably private equity firms this roughly 800 billion large segment which has grown rapidly in recent years has also seen a deterioration in credit standards and the spread of illiquid and leveraged financing structures opaque and infrequent pricing by artificially reducing the measured volatility of underlying returns has further increased the appeal of the loans to investors and flattered recovery values no doubt the development of the private credit market has provided a welcome additional financing channel for those firms that may face difficulties or find it too costly to borrow from banks even so it is also another reminder of how risks have been migrating outside the banking sector sometimes towards less transparent corners of the financial system now uncertainty rules globally the situation remains fluid the official community is monitoring developments closely where do we go from here one thing is sure financial markets will continue to dance to the tune of news about the virus and of the authorities response economic adviser and head of research hyun song shin this special issue of the bis quarterly review examines the fast changing world of payments payments are the counterpart to the transactions underpinning the economy safe and efficient payment systems are therefore vital technological innovations are shaking up these systems disrupting the instruments eg cash institutions eg banks and processes involved the pace of change and potential for disruption have propelled payment systems to the top of policymakers agenda indeed the g20 made improving cross border payments one of its priorities in 2020 the articles in this issue provide an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the existing systems describe how the rapid pace of technological change is impacting them and assess emerging solutions in his introduction shaping the future of payments bis general manager agustín carstens emphasises that central banks stand at the centre of payment systems and that given the changes under way they need to step up and play a more significant role in improving the safety and efficiency of those systems the bis committee on payments and market infrastructures cpmi is working with other relevant international bodies to develop a roadmap to enhance cross border payments also the bis has established its innovation hub to foster international collaboration on innovative financial technology within the central banking community the hub aims to catalyse collaborative efforts among central banks and cooperate where appropriate with academia financial service providers and the broader private sector to develop public goods for the benefit of the global financial system wholesale payment systems for large value transfers mainly between banks have experienced successive waves of innovation over the past few decades retail payment systems for low value but high volume transfers between consumers and businesses initially experienced slower innovation but are now changing rapidly in fast retail payment systems morten bech jenny hancock and wei zhang trace the adoption of new systems for near instantaneous retail payments notably early adopters were predominantly emerging market economies rather than advanced ones notwithstanding the rapid pace of change payment systems still suffer from shortcomings in at least two areas access and cross border payments as discussed in innovations in payments by morten bech and jenny hancock large numbers of people have limited if any access to a bank or other type of account for making payments especially in emerging market and developing economies emdes furthermore cross border payments remain slow expensive and cumbersome in emdes where remittances sometimes account for a substantial proportion of gdp these two shortcomings feed off each other to magnify the inefficiencies a high share of cross border payments is channelled through correspondent banks correspondent banking refers to an arrangement where a bank holds deposits owned by other banks including those in another country and plays the role of a payment intermediary as well as providing other services the number of correspondent banks fell by about 20 between 2011 and 2018 in on the global retreat of correspondent banks tara rice goetz von peter and codruta boar examine the drivers of this decline and assess its potential consequences for countries access to the global financial system the costs of cross border payments and the use of less regulated payment networks initiatives are under way to improve the infrastructure that links banks and other payment service providers in different countries in payments without borders morten bech umar faruqui and takeshi shirakami review initiatives to build payment systems designed to operate across borders link domestic systems or establish procedures for payment service providers to access systems remotely while there are currently a small number of functioning examples including in mexico south africa and switzerland more such cross border or multicurrency initiatives are being implemented or planned the most far reaching option for improving payments is a peer to peer arrangement that links payers and payees directly and minimises the number of intermediaries in on the future of securities settlement morten bech jenny hancock tara rice and amber wadsworth analyse how tokenisation the process of converting assets into digital representations not recorded in accounts could transform the clearing and settlement of securities they conclude that tokenisation might reduce costs and complexity but does not eliminate the risks associated with one party failing to settle transactions central bank digital currencies cbdcs have gained prominence in recent years in the broader debate on digital currencies if a central bank were to decide to issue its own cbdc to general users it would face several crucial technological design choices in the technology of retail central bank digital currency raphael auer and rainer böhme identify a number of such design features namely whether the central bank issues digital currencies directly or through delegation whether settlement follows decentralised consensus or takes place on a centralised ledger and whether the cbdc is account based or token based the challenge is to design a digital currency that balances the credibility of direct claims on the central bank with the convenience of using payment intermediaries
in a sign global central banks are preparing to spend their limited ammunition on injecting stimulus into the economy and possibly liquidity into shaken credit markets us federal reserve chairman jerome powell issued an unscheduled statement to declare we will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy the comments illicited an immediate reaction with new york markets rallying to finish with the strongest buying of the week warwick mckibbin cutting interest rates is not going to help much commenting from washington former rba board member and global economist warwick mckibbin said cutting interest rates in response to a supply disruption shock is not going to help much the government needs to be ready with financial support for businesses and workers whose incomes are temporarily affected by this type of shock professor mckibbin said keeping the economy afloat is more important the external shock could be quite severe depending on how covid 19 develops advertisement demand management through interest rate policy is not the answer international credit markets seized up last week as the coronavirus uncertainty forced corporate bond investors to hang back on the sidelines threatening funding lines to companies and banks regulators are closely monitoring credit markets rba investor liaison as of late last week suggested some blue chip companies were still able to attract debt investors big four bank anz tapped american investors for us1 billion 1 5 billion in a short term commercial paper deal last thursday night sources said fiscal stimulus longer term debt funding markets remain precarious particularly for non financial companies advertisement developments in credit markets in coming days will test mr morrison s reassurance that the coronavirus is a global health crisis not a financial crisis mr morrison last week shifted towards preparing for a fiscal stimulus by moving ahead of global health authorities to declare a global pandemic and pledging that any extra budget spending would be targeted modest and scalable to counteract the economic hit from coronavirus the government tasked treasury with developing budget assistance options with sectors hard hit by the indefinite china travel ban in line to be the top priorities it was a further shift from the government s election pledge to deliver a budget surplus this financial year which is looking increasingly shaky the morrison government s budget position was more than 3 7 billion worse off at the end of january than treasury forecast in december new monthly budget figures revealed on friday global investors have been spooked by the rapid spread of the virus outside china into south korea italy and iran with government response measures impeding the flow of people around the world slowing international trade and disrupting business supply chains advertisement amp capital chief economist shane oliver said the rba was likely to cut interest rates on tuesday policy stimulus won t stop the spread of the virus but it will help supercharge the eventual recovery in global growth and share markets he said the bottom line is that share markets face significant uncertainty in the short term and remain at high risk of more downside given the unknowns around covid 19 professor mckibbin who is a visiting senior fellow in economic studies at the brookings institution in washington said australia is in a good position for responding to the outbreak from a medical point of view and we are lucky to still be in summer but most countries are not well placed this will severely test the us public health system and poor countries advertisement apra is monitoring bank liquidity and contingency plans in case branches need to close if the virus spreads in australia ensuring banks can keep lending and provide cash to depositors asic is monitoring corporate contingency plans in case the virus spreads locally and is checking that listed companies are disclosing to investors any material impact on their profits in my own experience you find that when there is market dislocations then you often find issues that have been bubbling away under the surface that are only revealed in the times of market dislocation or market downturns asic chairman james shipton told a parliamentary hearing on friday an australian securities exchange spokesman said asx is engaging with the regulatory agencies asic and the rba on this issue particularly on planning and preparedness matters we are also engaging with industry associations and customers on their own arrangements as a market operator we are closely monitoring market orderliness and the responsiveness of our risk management processes to changing customer exposures during the heightened volatility asx is also working to ensure its own business continuity arrangements are in place planning for various crisis scenarios and monitoring the advice and guidance from health authorities and the government
anywhere else news that a cratering economy a collapsing currency and evaporating international reserves had pushed sovereign debt to unsustainable levels would be occasion for national dread yet the international monetary fund s woeful bill of health on feb 19 brought relief and even something close to exaltation to the governing halls of argentina i celebrate the imf for recognising the argentine position regarding debt president alberto fernández said on twitter late wednesday shortly after the fund concluded a weeklong visit if all parties are willing to agree we can return to growth honour our commitments and put argentina on its feet again it s going to be a long way up argentina desperately needed the imf s imprimatur before it could strike a pact with private creditors yet while the fernández government read the washington based lender s bulletin as vindication of the argentine demand that private creditors take a hit on their loans the way forward is far less certain neither the imf which is on the hook to argentina for us 44 billion or 47 percent of its entire credit exposure nor the minimum 75 percent or so of bondholders required to sign off on any agreement will be bullied easily into a bad deal any more than they will be moved by pope francis s prayers that s the cue for the country s ruling peronists to swap the balcony for the negotiating table will they ever since he swept argentina s presidential primaries last august virtually ensuring his electoral victory alberto fernández has been the topic of fierce speculation would a famously behind the scenes politician serve as merely the mouthpiece for his willful deputy the former president cristina fernández de kirchner or would he outflank the peronist flamethrowers and work up a pragmatic plan to spare the nation another ruinous default half a year on we re no wiser though the signs out of buenos aires are hardly auspicious the ruling front for all electoral alliance remains a coalition of rivals the resulting mixed messaging from fernandez s inner circle is confusing investors and lenders and stoking popular demands that his administration will be hard pressed to meet in january buenos aires governor and alpha peronist axel kicillof issued creditors an ultimatum take a late payment on us 250 million in provincial debt or face a disorderly situation his mentor fernandez de kirchner upped the ante warning on a trip to cuba no less that the international monetary fund wouldn t get even half a cent back until the country grew again and only if it agreed to a big haircut on argentine debt both petards may have been no more than ill wind off the pampas neither the provincial bondholders nor the imf blinked but the malodorousness was hard to miss reprieve not a pass the imf has given argentina a reprieve but not a pass fernandez must convince chary creditors to come to terms with a nation storied for serial default his self imposed timeline for closing a deal march 31 yet the government s economic agenda offers few clues and thin hopes on the campaign trail fernandez pledged to find an amicable solution to the country s debt imbroglio argentina owes around us 312 billion worth 91 percent of gross domestic product he also promised to spare his compatriots any more pain and scolded the imf for deepening the country s woes fernández then doubled down on that message during a recent diplomatic tour on which he sought the blessings of european heads of state and pope francis ahead of the country s debt negotiations he left the details to economy minister martín guzmán a young he s 37 respected academic with no hands on experience like his mentor the nobel laureate joseph stiglitz guzmán is no fan of laissez faire economics at the same time he has been hailed as a moderate and a rare pragmatist in a palace packed with nationalist hardliners optimists took heart from fernandez s first policy initiative the december economic emergency law which included measures to rein in the primary fiscal deficit to 0 4 percent of gdp in 2020 by raising taxes on farm exports tourism personal goods buying dollars and reducing spending by selectively freezing prices and capping pension increases yet the government s subsequent loose money policies could erase even those modest savings and fuel what oxford economics calls the highest rate of monetary expansion in 16 years nor was guzmán s debut in congress reassuring in a hearing before lawmakers he warned bondholders to brace for frustration over the coming deep debt restructuring and forecast reaching fiscal balance only in 2023 we re not going to allow foreign investment funds to set the guidelines on macroeconomic policy he said argentina s dollar bonds slumped populist pitch the populist pitch was likely a nod to the domestic audience which is bracing for a third straight year of recession with one of every three argentines already living in poverty the government position may reflect the paranoia of a leader in a region on fire benjamin gedan director of the argentina project at the wilson center in washington told me austerity was a trigger for social unrest across latin america over the last year and after four years of worsening poverty and a deep recession argentina has every ingredient for explosion adjustment is a toxic word alternatively standing tough with creditors may have been guzman s strategic opening move in an eventual compromise on debt but if that s so the government s leverage is limited in a marketplace already inured to argentine bluster when buenos aires s creditors refused to budge on provincial debt kicillof paid them in full the message from buenos aires was that argentina will do anything to avoid default said gedan the fernández government is not wrong to say that under current conditions the debt is unpayable and to ask creditors to sit down to discuss better terms said adriana dupita of bloomberg economics but first you need to have the right diagnosis of the problem and a plan and i don t see one dupita is not alone just to repay the imf the country s priority creditor argentina will have to spend out the equivalent of a quarter of all export revenues projected for 2022 and 2023 financial analysts nouriel roubini and alessandro magnoli bocchi wrote this week since that s out of the question the only recourse is for argentina to persuade the fund to reschedule its debt yet in lieu of a sensible plan a new loan arrangement with an easier repayment schedule is unlikely they concluded given the current lack of a clear and comprehensive strategy by the government a formal default on the foreign law debt appears to be quite likely at this stage roubini and bocchi wrote before argentina can come up with a solid economic plan it needs a credible political pact that takes a government which speaks with one voice mutes the palace incendiaries and treats debt and economic recovery not as a passion play but as part of a national business plan argentines need to have a discussion of what type of country they want a state led industrial policy a country open to global trade said nicolas saldias an argentina expert at the wilson center that requires cutting across partisan lines and getting the opposition on board to come to an understanding about economic basics now that would be something to celebrate

pound sterling is acting as the wild card in a coronavirus dominated market mostly reliant on investors mood when it comes to fiscal stimulus expectations ahead of the uk budget and uk eu trade negotiations say analysts at ing bank on sunday next week these two drivers will remain predominant as the calendar offers very little in terms of market moving data releases gbp usd exchange rate falls as uk economic outlook darkens last week saw the pound to us dollar gbp usd exchange rate fluctuate on rising fears of a no deal brexit with the eu the gbp usd fell from highs of 1 301 to a low of 1 282 as downing street continued to harden its stance on negotiations with the eu ahead of june s trade negotiations paul meggyesi head of research at jp morgan was however mixed in his analysis commenting gbp continues to perform idiosyncratically rather than as a traditional reserve currency risk of no deal come december which we continue to believe the market underappreciates and thus underprices leaves a low ceiling for the currency but considerable downside brexit developments continued to haunt uk markets and weaken sterling however after comments from downing street indicated that the uk could walk away from uk eu trade talks in june due to a lack of progress as a result the gbp usd exchange rate began to fall due to rising odds of a no deal brexit scenario following the end of the transition period which ends in late december this year friday saw the release of february s uk gfk consumer confidence which increased for its third month straight joe staton client

global financial crisis in february weakness was primarily seen in the service sector where the first drop in activity for four years was reported but manufacturing production also ground almost to a halt due to a near stalling of orders usd investors were also becoming more concerned over the slowing chinese economy due to the coronavirus epidemic this was perceived as having a negative impact on the us economy in the near term despite the temporary gains for the usd due to its safe haven status the usd gbp exchange rate also fell on rising odds of a rate cut from the federal reserve cleveland federal reserve president loretta mester commented that she saw some downside risk to the us economy due to the covid 19 s impact on the chinese economy she added at this point it is difficult to assess the magnitude of the economic effects but this new source of uncertainty is something i will be carefully monitoring the usd gbp exchange rate began to pick up by mid week however due to the pound s weakness and a rise in investors seeking out safe haven currencies former federal reserve chairwoman janet yellen s comments capped some of the greenback s gains however after she predicted a possible recession for the american economy mrs yellen commented we could see a significant impact on europe which has been weak to start with and it s just conceivable that it could throw the united states into a recession the us dollar usd closed the week up against the pound gbp as markets became increasingly jittery over the coronavirus outbreak advancing beyond the borders of china and worldwide this provided a boost for safe haven currencies like the us dollar japanese yen and swiss franc looking ahead us dollar usd investors will be looking ahead to monday s release of february s ism manufacturing pmi which is expected to dip from 50 9 to 50 5 any unexpected increase however could further buoy the usd gbp exchange rate sterling investors will be awaiting monday s uk markit manufacturing pmi for february if this improves we could see the sterling claw back some of its losses against its peers wednesday s uk markit services pmi for february will also give some indication for the direction of the british economy we could see the gbp usd exchange rate begin to edge higher if the uk s largest sector continues to show improvement thursday s us jobs reports will also remain in focus for usd investors this week if these show a deterioration in february however we could see the greenback suffer the gbp usd exchange rate could claw back some of its losses on friday if february s us nonfarm payrolls confirm consensus and sink from 225 thousand to 178 thousand brexit will continue to dominate headlines next week with gbp falling if the uk continues to maintain its hard stance on eu trade negotiations the coronavirus will also continue to remain in focus for us dollar investors any further signs of it having a negative impact on the us economy would weaken the greenback and raise the odds of a rate cut from the federal reserve

general news of sunday 1 march 2020 source classfmonline com the president of tescon matin abdallah has described as sub standard bolgatanga central mp isaac adongo s recent analysis of ghana s foreign exchange regime responding to mr adongo s recent attacks on vice president dr mahamhudu bawumia that his fx analysis of the ghanaian economy was wack mr abdallah said hon adongo engaged in ignorant effusions shabby analysis wobbly economic thoughts and anaemic academic presentation at a pristine forum which was supposed to be used to engage in a stimulating intellectual discourse below is the tescon president s full statement an academic response to the ignorant effusions of hon isaac adongo i listened with shock the analysis of the fx by hon isaac adongo with a surreal conclusion that dr mahamudu bawuamia s analysis of the fx is wack he further suggested that dr bawumia needs a refresher course to better understand the fx dynamics while i still hope that hon adongo would take up the challenge to debate me on the economic performance of the current government and on the subject matter of economics in general i will take a moment to address the ignorance of hon adongo on the fx with a blend of academic prepositions and practical applications this statement is a response to a part of the ignorant effusion by hon adongo at the forum organised by the coalition for restoration i hope hon adongo will learn some valuable lessons from this and will further submit himself to learn more nonetheless if he has any disagreements to what is contained in this epistle we should address those through the debate i requested the foreign exchange fx exposing the sheer ignorance of hon adongo and positing the discussion for a better understanding of the fx requires a bit of explanation on what fx is the fx exchange rate is simply the price of a currency the price of one currency in terms of another like any commodity a currency too has a price and yes the currency is a commodity traded in the market the fx market in the fx market the forces of demand and supply of currency determine its price a currency is depreciating when a unit of that currency is cheaper than before and the opposite is true for an appreciating currency in ghana and many other jurisdictions the local currency is usually matched against a vehicle currency the united states dollar the us dollar is a vehicle currency because it is widely used to denominate international contracts made by parties residing outside of the us this explains why the dollar is relatively a powerful currency there is a global demand for the currency unlike inconvertible currency like the indian rupees the ghanaian cedi and the mexican peso i took my time to give this background because i want that to be the basis to addressing the fatally misleading statements and intellectually impotent analysis of the exchange rate by hon adongo the incoherent presentation by hon adongo can be summarised into the following relatively intelligible assertions as he surmised 1 the 243 depreciation of the ghana cedi calculated by dr bawumia is not founded on any sound economic analysis 2 exchange rate is not a goal variable and undeserving of the debate 3 exchange rate determinants are more exogenous 4 exchange rate is a shock absorber for managing volatility 5 exchange rate depreciation is not the absence of changes in exchange rate 6 average depreciation is a convenient analysis indulge me to address these assertions one after another the assertions are related but their underpinning is greatly misunderstood by hon adongo a person with a foundational knowledge of economics will not make such assertions depreciation 243 of the cedi before i address this point i wish to put on record the ndc lost the debate on this same issue when it was first broached it beats my imagination why hon adongo will resurrect this issue again even with the support of dr nii thompson and cassiel atto fosu the ndc still lost the argument but since it has come up i wish to repeat some pertinent points firstly to understand why a currency could have lost over 100 of its value is to go back to the basics of exchange rate depreciation appreciation it is the lack of this basic understanding that is making the likes of hon adongo not to understand dr bawumia s analysis in the background i observed that currency is a commodity traded in the market let us assume that it use to cost ghs2 00 in ghana to buy an american candy in ghana which cost 1 00 in america in 2016 however in december 2018 the same 1 00 candy cost say ghs 5 00 with this intuition one will appreciate why a currency can by 100 or more also based on the theory of purchasing power parity which states that exchange rate between countries is in equilibrium when the purchasing power between these countries is at par thus when general prices levels in ghana and the us are at ratio 1 then we experience exchange rate equilibrium i am sure hon adongo needs to read about the exchange rate and relative prices to appreciate this analysis therefore for hon adongo to have made this assertion gives me an impression that he has a weak understanding of aspects of the exchange rate dynamics even after some 1 5 years have gone by fx is not a goal variable and undeserving of the debate another blatantly ignorant statement made to the applause of people who did not really know what he was talking about i suppose was when hon adongo asserted that the exchange rate is not a goal variable and that argument debate about the exchange rate was not necessary before i address the debility of intellect regarding this assertion i want to remind hon adongo that he or the ndc cannot approbate and reprobate he approbates when the exchange rate is depreciating and reprobate when exchange rate is appreciating hon adongo asserted that unlike inflation exchange rate is not a goal variable i say with certainty that hon adongo rather has a wack understanding of what a goal variable is admittedly inflation is a goal variable and government sets inflation targets usually a single digit target similar there are exchange rate targets if hon adongo cares to learn one of the six ecowas single currency convergence criteria is the stability the exchange rate this is so crucial a goal to meet before we can come under a currency zone while government might not set a specific currency volatility band it does not suggest that maintaining exchange rate stability is not a goal the most ludicrous of hon adongo s explanation for why the exchange rate is not a goal variable is because it has no midterm forecast really fx determinants are more exogenous the factors that impact your exchange rate are often more external than the economy hon adongo noted one would have thought hon adongo was making sense with this point until he said in a rather contradictory note that when your exports are not coming is not fundamentals so the factors are more exogenous any first year economics student knows that there are inextricably linked indigenous and exogenous factors that determine the exchange rate i dare say that for a developing country like ours many of the risks to the exchange rate are domestic import export issues are more domestic economic structural issues and the denomination of contracts in foreign currency the dollar is also a structural problem considering the ghana s developing nature government s focus is on building reserves through more exports and working to avoid currency shortages which sometimes spikes the currency depreciation it really takes skilful economic managers to main a stable exchange rate in an economy which is structurally import dependent but here again one needs to point out to the approbation and reprobation of hon adongo the exchange rate is a shock absorber for managing volatility it is unfortunate that hon adongo is the star economist of the ndc for this to come from him it exposes that lack of knowledge on the fundamentals of economics and therefore depending on the volatility that the economy faces and double digit depreciation may be the appropriate depreciation it is a major tool for managing external shocks and external volatilities hon adongo stated it is telling to observe that hon adongo has completely ignored or completely unaware of the fact that ghana is not practising a fixed exchange rate system such that we can devalue and overvalue the national currency at will depending on the shocks with a floating exchange rate regime how could he make this a suggestion exchange rate is a tool for managing what did he even say double digit depreciation versus single digit depreciation which volatility requires single digit inflation this understanding of exchange rate dynamic hon adongo shudders when dr bawumia speaks about exchange god have mercy i can say without any iota of doubt and with certainty of probability that hon adongo was absent minded when he made this comment let me provide a bit of schooling here the exchange rate is not a tool for managing any shocks as per the fx regime in ghana it is the price of an asset commodity currency it is structurally determined based on the interaction of demand and supply of the commodity currency you get a good rate or bad one depending on the determinants of demand and supply of the currency when a rate is not favouring the country both short term and long term measures such as export driven growth fx regulatory framework hedging among others are employed to ensure a stable or favourable rate average depreciation is convenient analysis hon adongo concluded his presentation with a suggestion that the analysis of the exchange rate by the bawumia using average was a convenient analysis let me set the records that daily weekly bi weekly monthly annual currency performance match between the ndc and the npp will still present the npp as a better performer when it comes to managing the fx dynamics hon adongo would have done a better job if he had told ghanaians the best approach either than averages to measuring exchange rate over a period of time at the end of the semester a student s position is based on the average of the scores for various courses otherwise you would not have an idea of the student s overall performance conclusion in conclusion hon adongo engaged in ignorant effusions shabby analysis wobbly economic thoughts and anaemic academic presentation at a pristine forum which was supposed to be used to engage in a stimulating intellectual discourse his analysis of the economy and economic variables were sub standard and ones that do not merit a response from even the technical assistants to the vice president talk less of his good self my decision to take up the challenge to debate hon adongo was after a cursory examination of his presentation considering the quality of analysis and the presentation of his thoughts i have no doubt i can beat hon adongo when it comes to economic analysis i hope this write up will serve as a precursor to the debate with hon adongo god bless our homeland ghana and make her great and strong matin abdallah president ug tescon
the fed and white house deliberations illustrate how policymakers are searching for ways to arrest the sudden selloff which some analysts say raises the possibility of a recession later this year typically the fed responds to economic trouble by lowering interest rates to make credit easier to obtain it also can offer loans to banks or buy large quantities of us treasury securities effectively adding money to the financial system and making it easier for some corporate borrowers to get cash the white house and congress meanwhile can approve new spending or tax cuts to flood the economy with money fed chairman jerome powell s attempt to calm markets on friday didn t work credit ap but the best remedy for the coronavirus which has sickened more than 83 000 people worldwide and killed nearly 3 000 could lie beyond washington s immediate powers central banks don t make vaccines said david kotok chairman of cumberland advisors the renewed selling intensified calls for the fed to rescue the economy from an unforeseen shock the medical emergency already has disrupted global production networks curtailed air travel and hobbled economies in asia europe and the middle east with medical experts urging americans to prepare for serious disruptions in their daily lives pleas for early action are coming from wall street and some former members of the fed s rate setting committee the fed can t fix broken supply chains or calm concerns about health and safety but the fed can ensure that liquidity conditions remain supportive so firms can get funding through the disruption it can also provide support to financial markets said nathan sheets chief economist for pgim fixed income more generally the message that the fed is attentive and on the case has tended to help soothe the economy and the markets during past episodes central banks don t make vaccines david kotok chairman of cumberland advisors by friday surveys of investors showed there was a nearly unanimous belief that the fed would cut rates by at least a quarter per centage point at its march 17 18 meeting that represents a sharp and sudden change from one week ago when just 11 per cent expected fed action according to the cme group the shift comes as capital economics told clients that the continued spread of the disease in the united states which has seen roughly 60 cases so far could be enough to tip the economy into a mild recession it s uncertain though how effective cutting interest rates might be economists call episodes like the epidemic or the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks an exogenous shock meaning an unpredictable development that arises from outside the economy or financial system yet has significant economic consequences the fed normally acts only after assessing voluminous data on business and consumer activity using sophisticated computer models that forecast the future by comparing current conditions to what s happened in the past there is no recent precedent for the coronavirus outbreak for the fed to use in its models recessions can occur after the fed has begun raising interest rates to head off incipient inflation or after warning signs such as widespread layoffs or falling equipment orders as the economy gradually deteriorates the fed can cut rates to encourage more spending the white house and lawmakers meanwhile often support more spending or tax cuts to boost the economy the coronavirus which first emerged in china and has now spread to countries including south korea japan italy iran brazil and the united states poses a unique challenge in this case the virus materialised with no warning and after initially appearing to be confined to china swept into roughly 60 countries trump who has been criticised for a delayed and uncertain response to the crisis so far has given no hint of plans for any economic stimulus but his aides are looking at a range of options china stands as a cautionary tale the chinese government s aggressive measures to fight the crisis which included imposing quarantines over an area that is home to perhaps 60 million people chilled both supply and demand china s virus fighting campaign prevented employees from leaving their homes and working on assembly lines thus depressing the supply of goods and it kept people from patronising restaurants movies or retail stores thereby cutting demand if the united states suffers a serious outbreak and people stay home fearing possible contagion cutting interest rates would probably do little to persuade them to return to work or go out to shop or dine this is a very tough one for the fed to deal with said dean baker senior economist at the centre for economic and policy research the fed has a long history of fighting financial and economic downturns including the 1987 stock market plunge known as black monday and the russian debt default more than a decade later in 2008 after the collapse of the housing bubble the fed dropped interest rates to zero and held them there for years in a bid to resuscitate the us economy the fed moved quickly in the wake of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks to try and limit the economic fallout six days later with financial markets closed and smoke still curling from the world trade centre rubble then fed chairman alan greenspan cut the benchmark us lending rate by half a percentage point the central bank also pumped us102 billion into the financial system to grease the gears of the economy and ease an anticipated slowdown according to a subsequent study by the federal reserve bank of st louis until friday fed officials had been cautious in their public comments richard clarida the fed s vice chairman said earlier this week that the upheaval in china could reverberate through the global economy but it is still too soon to even speculate about either the size or the persistence of these effects or whether they will lead to a material change in the outlook he said in a speech to an economists conference in washington for the past three years the fed has helped investors shrug off trump s serial trade wars cutting interest rates three times last year as inflation remained low between election day in 2016 and february 12 of this year the dow jones industrial average rose by 61 per cent in four days this week it surrendered one third of that gain as investors puzzled over what the virus will mean for corporate earnings by itself this past week s historic stock market meltdown erasing nearly two years worth of gains and incurring the fastest 10 plus per cent drop in history highlights the current peril economists are struggling to assess the extent of the calamity amid conflicting information about the virulence of the illness the likely public reaction if it spreads in the united states and the potential response from the fed or the trump administration to some the profound uncertainty recalls the financial crash that hit the united states and europe more than a decade ago forecasting in this environment feels eerily reminiscent of the crises the ground keeps shifting beneath me as i try to gain my footing diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton

economies including germany after already having lowered its asian estimates
this week s staff level agreement announced by the international monetary fund with the government of pakistan may have surprised many economic experts as it is no secret that there still exists a wide gulf between the country s targeted and realised tax collection the resultant budget deficit stands at 7 4 per cent of the gdp and the country s debt is projected at just under 79pc of the gdp growth has already fallen sharply to about half of what it was a mere three years back and continues to head southwards it is difficult to see how the deficit and the debt can be cut as the government will need to pump some stimulus into the economy while still battling double digit inflation a very tough some would argue impossible task according to reported figures in january this year the shortfall in meeting the first six month tax collection target was rs287 billion and this after the imf ceding to pakistan s request had cut the annual target by nearly rs265bn that is from rs5 5 trillion to 5 23tr perhaps the one area of some satisfaction to the economic managers imported from the imf and elsewhere is the falling current account deficit but with many of the cpec related frontloading capital transfers having happened and falling imports in a contracting economy that is not surprising continued imf support must be seen against the backdrop of regional political developments rather than economic benchmarks the freefall of the rupee initiated under imf pressure has tragically had little or no impact on exports as a result we have 14pc inflation nearly one million more joining the ranks of the unemployed and a dramatic growth slowdown according to an econometric model used by one of the sharpest economists in the country hafiz pasha the growth figure is likely to be no more than 1 2pc dr pasha fears another million are headed towards losing their jobs against this rather dismal backdrop the imf said that a staff level agreement has been reached with pakistan after its executive board s approval expected in five to seven weeks time the imf will be able to release about 450m to islamabad traditionally the imf is known around the world for inflicting pain on the masses where countries have approached it for a bailout and has clamped down on large budget deficits and such high debt vs gdp ratios as pakistan s as part of its so called structural reform programmes there is no doubt the masses are in agony here as well however with some of the key deficit and debt figures still showing no signs of declining the continued imf support must be seen against the backdrop of regional political developments rather than economic benchmarks it is clear that the trump administration is very keen to get out of afghanistan and asked the pakistanis who have considerable influence over the taliban to allow it to have a facesaving exit agreement which has been signed in doha many observers also suggest that even the bailout that came from saudi arabia in the initial months of this same page with the military government was a link in the same chain as us encouragement rather than love for another muslim nation in crisis was behind riyadh s decision pakistan will continue to play the good boy role till at least the us pullout is complete though the modalities of the withdrawal are still to be worked out as also what numbers of american troops will if at all they do remain in afghanistan a manifestation of pakistan s influence over the taliban appeared to be the op ed article written by naib amir sirajuddin haqqani of the famed haqqani network in the new york times last week sirajuddin haqqani used to be america s enemy number one in afghanistan it was haqqani and his so called network that were the subject of endless demands by washington to rawalpindi to do more in terms of taking away space for the network to operate as it reportedly had safe havens and bases in pakistan s now merged tribal areas bordering afghanistan if donald trump were to win a second term pakistan will continue to gain breathing space for being a good boy and delivering at least for the time being a more flexible taliban that will make public claims about being committed to pluralism in afghan society including equality for women as haqqani s nyt oped did if trump is not returned to the white house an uncertain scenario will unfold for pakistan islamabad will need to learn to stand on its own feet in terms of its economy it will need to quickly set its own house in order this will be a huge ask how huge here is an example my former colleague moni munizah alam shah who worked at the news in the early 1990s moved to the united states some 25 years ago she has not worked in or got an income from pakistan for over two and a half decades having a longing to return one day to pakistan in 2017 she transferred a not insignificant amount of money from the us in order to purchase a residential plot so she could build a house

published monday 2 march 2020 print disqus y2k redux supply chains unlinked fed futility some silver linings how to find the opportunity i see everywhere for the last 3 years i have maintained it would take an exogenous event to send the united states into recession historically suboptimal growth sure but sub 3 growth isn t a recession the coronavirus obviously qualifies as an exogenous event but that doesn t mean a textbook two quarter recession although it certainly may financial markets aren t waiting to find out what covid 19 will do much of the selling is fear of the unknown the modern world hasn t faced anything quite like this and it s coming at a time when the economy is vulnerable for other reasons we actually face two concurrent crises one is about public health the other about the economy and markets they won t necessarily track each other we might find the virus is less deadly and infectious than feared but that the fear itself plus the control and containment measures harms the economy after talking to economists and medical researchers this week i am pretty confident in two things first this is going to be a long slog the virus will spread slowly but widely the containment measures are simply buying time there s no need to panic but we should all take common sense protective measures second as usual i am the muddle through guy i think we ll get through this not without some damage and tragic loss of life but it won t be the end of the world this is not the zombie virus i wasn t thinking of viruses when i said the 2020s would be the decade of disruption but covid 19 may mark the beginning of it here s the worst part the federal reserve and other central banks can t bail us out this time their tools aren t designed for this kind of problem powell lagarde kuroda and others are all making their ritual pledges to stand ready with support they may even be serious but they have little to offer rate cuts are not vaccines we may soon after a dozen years in monetary policy training wheels find out if we can still ride a bike y2k redux longtime readers may recall these letters began in the late 1990s when i was writing about the y2k computer problem looking back it is hard to believe how much fear it generated some people literally headed for the hills i said consistently we would have problems but get through them and that s more or less what happened a few little glitches then it was over however the problem was real many vital systems would have stopped working on 1 1 2000 had they not been painstakingly rebuilt we avoided catastrophe because smart people got to work and prevented it having that fixed date helped focus their efforts the coronavirus is different in that regard experts are sure it will spread but they can t say how fast this week i spoke with among other experts dr joseph kim the ceo of inovio his company like several others is working on a covid 19 vaccine he s been in this field many years and knows how these diseases spread and he believes this one is not going to care about borders the outbreaks we are now seeing in south korea italy and other places are only the beginning similar clusters will eventually appear in the us this virus s unique challenge is its ability to spread via asymptomatic carriers with sars and ebola it s very obvious that someone is sick and contagious they are relatively easy to avoid infection mainly happens with medical personnel and family caregivers with covid 19 you can seem perfectly healthy have no fever or other symptoms but still carry the virus and spread it to others you can also catch the virus recover and never know you were infected we don t know how often that happens which makes evaluating the data difficult the chinese data seems to show about a 2 fatality rate among the people who show symptoms and are diagnosed positive that s not necessarily everyone who is infected so the true fatality rate could be lower dr mike roizen said the problem is we don t know how many people actually have had the virus and how many died as a result in calculating a fatality rate we know neither the numerator nor the denominator with truly accurate precision for the equation as we get more accurate data we can make better assessments that being said dr roizen and dr kim both told me this virus is far deadlier than our standard influenza it appears about 20 of symptomatic people are sick enough to need hospital care even though most ultimately recover that s enough to potentially strain our healthcare resources generating second order effects as people with other medical conditions have to wait for treatment covid 19 is unlikely to disappear in warm weather hong kong is always warm and that does not seem to be stopping the virus the likeliest scenario is that the world now has in effect another flu like virus that will be with us for years if clinical trials are positive one or more of the vaccines currently in development could be ready later this year many biotech companies are working on it moderna said it plans phase 1 trials to start in april dr kim cautiously which is his way said inovio s trials should begin in late spring or early summer multiple vaccines will compete and we will see which is the most effective but we are at minimum several months away from that point and the virus is still spreading in the absence of reliable information well meaning people will try to fill the void and make matters worse a lot of misinformation is spreading on social media and sometimes in real media too i saw one story calling it an infodemic that s funny but accurate we have better data on the economic impact supply chains unlinked we see many comparisons of this virus to the 2003 sars outbreak that one also began in asia and quickly spread worldwide there was great concern at the time but the economic damage proved minor china s economy is both much bigger now and more integral to world trade chinese gdp is up 4x since then and its share of worldwide trade flows has grown 10x businesses all over the world depend on chinese made components and raw materials many of which can t be sourced elsewhere at least not at the same prices and just in time production means producers don t have much inventory on hand right now it is dwindling as chinese factories and ports are either shut down or operating at much reduced capacity here s how one expert described it to south china morning post with my emphasis it really is death by a thousand cuts said john evans managing director of tractus asia a company that has 20 years experience helping firms move to china but which over the past two has had more enquiries from businesses looking to leave this is a black swan event and i don t think we ve seen anything like it in recent history in terms of the economic and supply chain impact in china and across the globe as i write this china s travel restrictions have eased and businesses are starting to reopen but schools remain closed which suggests they are not confident the outbreak is truly under control beijing is letting local governments set their own rules so conditions vary greatly across the country the economic problem is that inability to obtain one critical component can shut down an entire factory in this situation 95 or even 99 may not be good enough we could be weeks away from some us and european producers running out of input materials then what plant closures and probably layoffs worse some chinese producers depend on parts from the west which they may stop buying if their own factories stay closed that s not only a potentially huge problem for us semiconductor makers but others as well and it s not just china and not just the virus growth was already weakening for other reasons such as the trade war here s david rosenberg the bottom line is that the coronavirus occurred with much of the world experiencing anemic growth after a year in which supply chains were already negatively affected by all the tariff actions phase one did not completely ameliorate that condition world growth was the weakest in a decade in 2019 and the latest move by the imf was to trim this year s outlook and that was before the coronavirus which has imposed tail risks for the global economy and financial markets a tail risk in the sense that we have such little knowledge about this coronavirus why it is spreading or how to treat it the spread of the virus outside of china to south korea the other economic giants in asia and to italy is particularly worrisome the only thing we know with certainty is that south korea is a massive exporter and much of its outbound manufacturing shipments are inputs into the global production process so the implications for disruption to global supply chains are significant irrespective of the slowing in the rate of infections in china the cat is out of the bag david s point about south korea is important the outbreak there could well lead to the kind of industrial paralysis seen in china that would have a quick and severe impact on companies in japan north america europe and everywhere else the italy outbreak could have a similar but smaller result italian authorities responded quickly but people infected there have already spread it throughout europe meanwhile here s a map of cases in japan excluding cruise ship passengers note the cluster in aichi that s toyota headquarters and a heavy manufacturing region source nhk japanese prime minister shinzo abe has asked schools to close throughout japan if the map keeps reddening factory workers may be told to stay home too even if their plants can get the parts they need this would cascade through the world economy fed futility we all learn by experience for a dozen years now investors have been rewarded for buying every market dip indexes always recovered to new highs often because central banks delivered some kind of stimulus or at least promised to do so so in one sense seeing this week s losses as another buying opportunity is rational possibly time will show that s what it was but count me dubious we have known for a long time something would pop the balloon it proved to be teflon coated impervious to everything bears could throw at it but bears didn t create this virus nonetheless investors are increasingly convinced the fed will respond with more rate cuts at year end 2019 the futures implied probability of three rates cuts this year was only 20 now it s up to 80 source wsj note any rate cuts would be on top of the existing t bill purchase program and repo market liquidity injections i think those are more likely to be expanded than reduced if it happens the fed will be in full on stimulus mode akin to 2008 2009 but it probably won t have the same kind of effect peter boockvar explained this week a rate cut won t bring chinese factories back online any quicker and a rate cut won t get people flying and traveling again until the virus peters out either way the us bond market has already eased for them the us 10 year yield at 1 37 has essentially cut rates by 25 bps over the past two weeks for those looking to refi or purchase a home lower rates may ease the cost of buying a car but with car prices at record highs not hedonically adjusted it won t do much credit card rates with 3 fed rate cuts are still near 17 so another rate cut or two won t help much here and with respect to a rate cut encouraging more capital spending the cost of capital clearly hasn t been a binding constraint on any capital decision for years will a rate cut or two ease financial conditions aka goose asset prices maybe but maybe not monetary policy tools just aren t designed for this situation all they can do is stimulate demand and virus containment measures will make any such demand hard to fill fiscal stimulus might help but would also increase the already massive deficit in china the government and central bank are responding with targeted loans to affected businesses rather than macro policy changes that s probably the right move but with debt at such high levels they really had no choice that s the big risk here i think investors are about to learn central banks won t always be there for them in every situation if the delicate faith that s kept markets rising should break then what it s a long way down so what do we do in my case this doesn t change investment strategy i am not a buy and hold advocate i m in funds and professionally managed accounts that can move out of the markets or directly hedge when necessary some have already done so i expect others will do likewise if conditions worsen as an aside bond markets are acting as if this is a massively deflationary event some silver linings we must remember that 86 of americans are employed in the service industry related areas the manufacturing industry won t simply shut down either absent multiple large outbreaks in cities across the us which would cause serious changes in consumer behavior the us could prove more resilient than some others this will be contained at some point and business and consumer life move on last week only a few us labs could test for the coronavirus clearly we were massively unprepared but that is changing fast as you read this already 93 labs should have testing facilities a bedside diagnostic is coming too as 70 companies are working on it the fda is changing its procedures to allow confirmation at labs other than at the cdc s main headquarters this will ease concern by quickly separating actual covid 19 cases from common colds and flu i expect the number of labs which can administer tests to increase dramatically over the next few weeks new testing kits will come online i can imagine hospital administrators and staff are beginning to think about how they would handle an outbreak in their city there is a high probability that vaccines will be available by the end of the year early next year we may all be getting an annual vaccine for covid 19 along with the flu shot this may seem counterintuitive but in a certain sense covid 19 provides a massive wake up call to the world we were not prepared i perhaps optimistically think that will be different in the future this is not the zombie virus of the post apocalyptic movie genre but it should make mankind in general and countries in specific start thinking about the next perhaps more serious outbreak on the economic front i think it is safe to say that supply chains will be radically different by 2022 technology was already bringing manufacturing closer to the consumers i expect that trend to accelerate that should mean significant capital investment after the covid 19 problem is contained providing a nice economic stimulus governments everywhere including the us need to think about the supply chain vulnerability of certain critical necessities i don t mean t shirts and auto parts i am thinking of medicines and medical supplies many of which are now produced in china do we need multiple sources are some items so critical we should produce them in multiple places within countries just asking this should begin now as of friday there were 60 cases of coronavirus in the united states the bulk of which were from one cruise ship all but one could be traced to either a cruise ship or a person or spouse coming from china we should expect more but for now it seems to be spreading slowly here i think the base case is that china and europe enter recession i would think the us is a coin toss because we don t know of the extent of the potential outbreak it s really hard to say the foreign slowdown will have an effect but recession isn t inevitable on a personal level i think we should all just exercise common sense i asked dr kim if he was cutting back on his travel including his international travel his answer was no life has to go on other frequent international travelers i know expressed the same sentiments some say they will avoid china more because they don t want to land in quarantine upon return than fear of getting the virus mike roizen said he will still be traveling within the us where he is already scheduled of course follow official advice if you live in an affected area but we can t all seal ourselves into bubbles i will be traveling to new york in two weeks and plan many dinner meetings as well as other business meetings as my wife shane said about my future travel stay calm and wash your hands i have no way of knowing how far the market will fall but i do expect this current problem will be solved and life will return to normal this will represent a good and perhaps great buying opportunity how to find the opportunity i see everywhere okay i just spent a letter talking about the crisis du jour but it doesn t change my long term outlook i am still bullish on humanity and bearish on government the problems and the opportunities i see everywhere aren t going away i seem to find more every week i have structured this year s strategic investment conference to both help you avoid the problems and find the opportunities we will talk about more specific investment opportunities than in previous years today i don t want to go into a long list of the fabulous speakers and faculty who will be there as you can see them on the website while the information they give us will be invaluable most attendees say they get as much or more from their discussions with their fellow attendees people like you who can share their ideas i learn more at the conference too attendees point me to new thoughts and research they show me new opportunities i truly think this year s sic will the best and most

the fed and white house deliberations illustrate how policymakers are searching for ways to arrest the sudden selloff which some analysts say raises the possibility of a recession later this year typically the fed responds to economic trouble by lowering interest rates to make credit easier to obtain it also can offer loans to banks or buy large quantities of us treasury securities effectively adding money to the financial system and making it easier for some corporate borrowers to get cash the white house and congress meanwhile can approve new spending or tax cuts to flood the economy with

according to the cme group the shift comes as capital economics told clients that the continued spread of the disease in the united states which has seen roughly 60 cases so far could be enough to tip

gold and stocks are both headed lower butâ gold and stocks are moving south together but they are not correlated nor are they inversely correlated as some gold enthusiasts claim reference to gold as a safe haven has some investors buying gold to hedge against a stock market crash it is almost as if gold has become a pseudo defensive stock it seems investors actually expect gold s price to go up when the stock market goes down and vice versa if that were the case how do you explain the extended periods when both moved together or the price action of gold relative to stocks in the past four days gold currently is lower in price than it was before stocks tumbled nearly 4000 points for five full years from the fall of 2002 until late 2007 both stocks and gold prices moved in tandem during that period stocks were up eighty percent certainly no need for a defensive posture right crazy thing is the price of gold was up too and much more than stocks at the end of the five years gold s price had increased by more than double the next year in 2008 stocks and gold turned about face and marched together in the opposite direction both stocks and gold prices lost more than thirty percent so why does the theory persist that gold and stocks move inversely probably it has its origins in the price action of stocks and gold during the decade of the 1970s gold s price went up throughout the 1970s reflecting a dramatically weaker us dollar some of the price increase was catch up for several decades of lost purchasing power in the us dollar part of the increase was due to anticipation that the us dollar would continue to weaken much more stocks on the other hand underwent several unsuccessful attempts to crack the 1000 level for the dow jones industrial average followed by agonizingly long declines during 1969 74 the dow jones industrial average dropped forty percent so is there correlation of some kind positive or negative for stocks and gold no no correlation between stocks and gold in order for correlation to exist there must be fundamentals that directly connect the two items being compared for example there is a possible correlation between localized bad weather and crop failures but how do you predict the timing and extent or the effects to a degree that can be profitable and there certainly is a correlation between the price of labor and materials vs the finished cost of building a new home but there is no correlation between the price of labor and materials vs the number of new housing starts stocks and gold prices move independently of each other for different reasons lower stock prices over an extended period of time are usually the result of poor economic conditions gold s price is not affected by economic conditions the price of gold is a reflection of the changing value purchasing power of the us dollar which is a financially specific issue not an economic one gold s higher price over the past century correlates to the ongoing decline in the value of the us dollar not changing economic conditions recently some have said that in order to have a huge burst upwards in gold s price there would need to be a collapse in the stock market not so the only thing necessary for a much higher gold price is a much weaker us dollar without a significantly weaker us dollar from current levels you won t see significantly higher gold prices another unrealistic expectation is that a credit collapse and huge drops stocks and bonds leading to a depression will send gold soaring in price no it won t first huge price drops won t be limited to stocks and bonds anything denominated in dollars will be affected including real estate and commodities and yes gold that is because the conditions resulting from a credit collapse will lead to radically bad economic conditions accompanied by deflation see gold prices inflation vs deflation deflation means lower gold prices deflation is characterized by a contraction in the supply of money hence each remaining unit is more valuable i e its purchasing power increases regardless of the fed s attempts to avoid it deflation is a very real possibility an implosion of the debt pyramid and a destruction of credit would cause a settling of prices for everything stocks real estate commodities etc worldwide at anywhere from 50 90 percent less than current levels the end result would be a very strong us dollar and a much lower gold price if and when gold prices move dramatically higher it will only happen in conjunction with a correspondingly weaker us dollar until that happens all bets are off also see gold vs stocks ratios do not imply correlation by kelsey williams kelsey williams is a retired financial professional living in southern utah his website kelsey s gold facts

a swathe of highly indebted companies face an incipient funding shock and risk being shut out of the capital markets as the covid 19 epidemic mushrooms into global crisis standard poor s has warned there are mounting risks of a credit crunch in vulnerable sectors of the corporate bond market potentially rocking an unstable financial edifice with record levels of debt and set off a dangerous chain reaction could this be the straw that breaks the camel s back asked paul watters s p s head of credit research for europe and the middle east the market has suddenly woken up and realized that this is no longer just a china story and we may be going into a global pandemic clearly the view two or three weeks ago that this would peak in march is no longer appropriate the question becoming very relevant is which companies are going to be able to refinance he said moody s has issued a global recession alert should the coronavirus turn into a global pandemic deemed inevitable by many of the world s top virologists after exponential outbreaks in korea iran italy and now france the economy was already fragile before the outbreak and vulnerable to anything that did not stick to script covid 19 is way off script said the rating agency s p s mr watters said sectors with a toxic mix of high leverage and poor cash flow are coming under the microscope health care borrowers in the high yield league are the most stretched with a debt to earnings ratio of six times followed by media on 5 5 times europe s car industry is also in the sights moody s downgraded renault to junk last month s p has placed the company on creditwatch negative at bbb just one rung short of junk status and alongside gkn iho verwaltungs and zf friedrichshafen the world s number one car maker vw is at bbb and no longer has much buffer we re looking to see what access issuers have and if they have to refinance over the next year they ll be marked down said mr watters
will gold shine due to coronavirus infecting the global economy with new cases of covid 19 outside china rising the chances of a pandemic and global recession have increased recently what are the implications for the gold market coronavirus spreads over the world unfortunately the new coronavirus remains the hottest topic of the news although the covid 19 epidemic has been slowing down in china since the beginning of february it has quickly spread to several other countries the who s situation report from february 26 says that the infections of the new coronavirus has been reported in 37 countries actually for the first time since the beginning of the epidemic on december 8 there have been more new cases reported from countries outside of china than from china with so many countries including the western ones struggling with the disease the covid 19 ceased to be asian issue and has become a truly global issue as world inches closer to the real pandemic the financial markets could become even more nervous so we could see more safe haven flows into the gold market recessionary odds increase although the covid 19 outbreak has not evolved yet into the full blown and officially declared pandemic it has already infected the global economy this is because the new coronavirus has hit not west africa as ebola or china s from 2003 as sars but the very second biggest economy in the world according to nominal gdp according to the ppp the largest which is the center of manufacturing and global supply chains and although it is true that the covid 19 is less lethal than previous viruses investors should acknowledge that the majority of the economic costs associated with epidemics comes not from the increased mortality or morbidity but from the behavioral changes of people who fear the infection so they reduce their activities the world s economic growth in 2019 was barely above the recessionary threshold of 2 5 percent the recent increase in cases in japan and italy which are both large economies already on the brink of recession should hamper the global growth instead of the recovery we could thus see even bigger slowdown although the us has looked teflon like so far the recent ihs markit report casts doubt about the resilience of american economy according to the survey business activity in the u s contracted in february for the first time in since the great recession with the exception of the government shutdown in 2013 due to the disruptions caused by the new coronavirus what is important is that the decline was driven not only by the deteriorating manufacturing performance yet still expanding but also by the decline in the service sector moreover the long term interest rates have declined as the chart below shows the 10 year treasury yield has plunged below 1 4 percent pushing the spread between long term and short term bond yields into negative territory again the inversion of the yield curve increases the odds of recession it also makes the fed more likely to step in and cut the federal funds rate you know just in case indeed the markets expect the dovish move as early as in april chart 1 10 year treasury yields blue line left axis and the spread between 10 year treasuries and 3 month treasuries red line right axis from january 2019 to february 2020 implications for gold what does it all mean for the gold market well the covid 19 is beneficial for gold s outlook even before the epidemic started the gold s prospects were positive due to the easy monetary policy and increased recessionary risk the outbreak of the new disease may only strengthen these tendencies i e slowing down already fragile global growth and push central banks to adopt an even more accommodative stance moreover as the chart below shows the stock market volatility and the credit spreads have increased meanwhile the us dollar has weakened recently which makes the macroeconomic environment even more friendly to gold chart 2 cboe vix index green line right axis and ice bofaml us corporate bbb option adjusted spread red line left axis in 2020 now the key question is of course how persistent the effects of the coronavirus shock will be if it is contained quickly the risk appetite comes back to the markets and investors may withdraw somewhat from the gold market however with new cases rising outside china it is likely that the new virus would stay with us for some time affecting the global economy beyond the first quarter of 2020 and thus supporting gold prices if you enjoyed the above analysis we invite you to

jerusalem when the cosmetics salesman from petah tikva rolls his toyota out of the driveway each morning he does not worry about the palestinians the trump middle east plan or tensions with iran the issues most of the world thinks of when it thinks about israel no ronen yom tov just thinks about traffic and he has plenty of time it takes him half an hour just to reach the highway four miles away it s one enormous jam with no end in sight he said that about sums up all of israel and it s not just the traffic even as israel has matured from a small desert nation fighting for its survival into a regional power with an enviable high tech industry it has neglected the transportation education and health care systems that experts say are vital to its prosperity
a sense of panic was palpable in all corners of the international financial system on friday as coronavirus cases spread relentlessly across europe the americas and reached sub saharan africa for the first time determined efforts of the chinese authorities to contain the outbreak failed to settle frayed nerves after the world health organization reacting to the news that four continents had at least six affected countries raised its impact risk alert from high to very high oil prices slumped to below 50 a barrel for the first time since the summer of 2017 and stock markets saw a week s worth of frenzied trading translate into a 5 trillion loss equal to an 11 fall in the value of all listed companies this massive sell off the worst since the 2008 financial crash triggered a rush to buy assets considered safe havens in times of stress including government bonds and gold the interest rate on us treasury bonds considered the safest of such havens dropped to the lowest level on record the extent of the panic and the potential for widespread global economic damage brought a response from central bankers led by bank of england governor mark carney and jerome powell chair of the us federal reserve who took the unusual step of issuing a statement to reassure americans carney said it was clear that global economic growth this year would be lower than it otherwise would be and that has a knock on effect on the uk he hinted that an interest rate cut could be the bank s next move to shore up business and consumer confidence because if the world is slower than the uk a very open economy it will have an impact but he insisted the uk economy remained in good health for the time being within hours of carney s comments powell said we will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy city analysts struggling to cope with the implications on their economic forecasts were unable to give a sense of how individual economies could be affected or where stock markets might settle there were several strands to their thinking what if china and japan s factories were forced to close in china s case for a second time limiting the supply of vital industrial components to the rest of the world japan has already shut its schools and may need to order the closure of business parks and factories to prevent the virus s spread without the parts that japan and china produce by the shipload there will be little to supply germany s factories and the rest of europe s for that matter when they are already struggling after 18 months of a tit for tat trade war between the us and china analysts worry that a supply shock will hit manufacturing businesses hard worse could befall service companies if the fresh cases in the us and europe that have no known source become a source of dread among consumers the clampdown by the swiss on commercial gatherings of more than 1 000 people which forced the cancellation of the geneva motor show could become a more widely used measure to contain the virus if consumers shun shopping malls and high streets for fear of getting the virus economies could be pushed into recession in sub saharan africa where there is already concern about high government and corporate borrowing levels a virus outbreak and economic downturn could be the tipping point into unsustainable debt for several countries the economic consultancy oxford economics said the uk while on the periphery of the virus outbreak so far was always going to suffer from the negative impact on tourism and disruption to imports from east asia but the slump in share prices had opened up a new channel through which the coronavirus outbreak could weigh on the uk economy it said stock market losses have already exceeded those that we modelled in our global pandemic scenario in which high infection rates spread globally and the combination of disruption to activity and tighter financial conditions cause world gdp growth to slow to near zero in the first quarter of 2020 there could be a quick bounce back if the virus is seen to be contained but with dire manufacturing data already out this weekend from china markets probably have further to fall before they finally turn
over ten years ago on oct 3 2008 united states president george w bush signed the troubled assets relief program tarp that promised 700 billion to support banks and companies that were hit by the global financial crisis as u s congress granted its support for the historic bill it seemed like liberal democracy was rising to the challenge posed by the global financial crisis yes the bill would be very expensive for american taxpayers but the cost seemed justified in the face of the potential collapse of the global economy a decade later the financial crisis is a distant memory the tarp funds have been repaid with interest and stock markets are reaching new heights yet switch from the business pages to the front page and a much darker picture appears a particularly virulent strand of right wing populism is popping up around the world while doug ford and donald trump are wreaking havoc with our democratic institutions exploiting weaknesses it turns out that the greatest cost of the 2008 global financial crisis was not the bailouts but rather the cost to our democratic system conservative populists have been able to exploit a series of weaknesses in liberal democratic society weaknesses that predate the global financial crisis but were exacerbated by the failure of our political leaders to respond effectively to it in the decades leading up to the 2008 crisis governments rejected the more cautious approach to economic management that had emerged after the great depression and the second world war those traumatic historical events produced policies that focused on employment and economic stability delivering a decrease in inequality and fuelling solid economic growth those concerns were pushed aside in the 1980s and 1990s as governments of all political stripes sought to focus on inflation rather than unemployment and to roll back regulations in the belief that this would produce a more dynamic economy cuts to social spending the results were a massive growth in the size of the financial sector and a tolerance for increasingly risky investments with little genuine oversight a recipe for financial disaster as we saw unfold a decade ago as governments sought to get leaner and cut back on social spending as the jean chrétien liberals did in the 1990s inequality grew and middle class incomes stagnated many middle class families adapted by dipping into their home equity with lines of credit or simply loading up on credit card debt another time bomb that exploded in the u s britain and throughout europe in 2008 but has yet to detonate in canada once the global financial crisis hit it became much easier to see that the economy wasn t working for everyone in the u s the federal reserve bank of st louis estimates that nine million families lost their homes in that crisis between 10 and 15 per cent of all homeowners in the u k between 2008 and 2009 the sudden drop in housing prices pension funds and equities translated into a loss of 31 000 pounds or almost 50 000 canadian for every household drowning in debt the household debt that had seemed like a clever solution to stagnating wages suddenly became a huge problem for those families who found themselves with a house worth a lot less one of their household s jobs gone and debts still to pay governments response to the crisis only made things worse sure in the short term they acted to shore up the financial system and used fiscal stimulus to reduce the severity of the recession but by 2010 just about every western government including canada s conservatives had changed their tune and shifted back to austerity arguing that we couldn t afford more fiscal stimulus austerity measures land hardest on those who most need government help like those families who were down one job and couldn t make the payments on a mortgage that was worth more than their house it also turns out that this rapid shift to austerity was counterproductive damaging the recovery in many countries and actually increasing debt to gdp ratios inequality also grew after the crisis as economist branco milanovic s research shows the stagnation in western middle class wages expanded to include upper middle class earners in fact the only people who really benefited from the austerity push were the hyper rich meanwhile governments around the world billed their austerity measures as necessary and inevitable denying any responsibility for the suffering these policies caused economics helped fuel populism add it all up and you get ripe conditions for the kind of economic insecurity and frustration that is fertile ground for populist sentiment of course the rise of soft authoritarianism cannot and should not be reduced to economic factors but those factors do play a role after all if political leaders tell us that they have no choice but to enact these painful economic policies that these issues are beyond democratic control why should we be surprised when someone like donald trump nigel farage or doug ford comes along and promises to take back and give them back control in order to oppose the authoritarianism of these conservative populists and challenge their lies we need to start by recognizing that the economic experiments of the last few decades have failed the ultimate test building a prosperous and democratic society for all jacqueline best professor of

bloomberg investors aren t buying the idea that central banks wait and see approach to the coronavirus will last ramping up bets on interest rate cuts that could start within months money markets now see three federal reserve reductions this year starting in april and one by the european central bank in july the bank of england will cut in august according to a similar metric the ecb is in a tougher position than other central banks with limited ammunition if the situation worsens and top officials including president christine lagarde have signaled that more time is needed to weigh the impact of the outbreak but even for those with more space such as the fed there are doubts that monetary policy response will prove effective with the shock concentrated on the supply side of the economy the problem with doing monetary stimulus is that it will have limited impact on the effects of the virus said jens peter sorensen chief analyst at danske bank a s in copenhagen the covid 19 virus is keeping people from work the supply chain is disrupted and tourists are not going to italy monetary policy can do very little so far the view among central bankers across the world is it s too early to assess what the economic damage will be bank of korea governor lee ju yeol said the appropriate response at this stage was targeted support for the companies most affected by the biggest virus outbreak outside china not a wider reaching rate reduction the governor of the bank of france francois villeroy de galhau said that the virus is a supply shock and monetary policy may not be the right response and ecb executive board member isabel schnabel said they need more clarity about the implications of the virus echoing fed vice chairman richard clarida s statement this week they would prefer not to rush to judgment and stay on hold for now roberto perli a partner at cornerstone macro llc in washington said of the fed the likely outcome is they don t cut in march but issue a statement that makes it clear they are ready to act if the situation deteriorates meanwhile investors are buying up havens sending yields on u s treasuries to record lows and putting the dollar on course for its best month since july and volatility has returned to the currency market with demand for protection against price swings in the euro jumping a sign traders clearest expectation is for turbulence rather than direction taking it easy while policy makers don t want to rush there s a growing view that what was meant to be a year of central banks on hold will instead see monetary stimulus in some of the world s biggest economies even if the situation improves later this year the hit in the first half could be severe credit suisse group ag on thursday cut its 2020 global growth projection to 2 2 from 2 6 and its euro area outlook to just 0 5 it sees the ecb lowering rates by 10 basis points in june there ll be a lot of damage done on the way down before we get back up said neville hill the bank s chief european economist if the major central banks do hold fire it would be one of the rare times since the financial crisis that they haven t capitulated to money market sentiment while policy makers probably won tadmit to being out of options they ve been keen to keep the pressure on governments to be the first responders if the nascent recovery gets cut short fed first the fed is one of the few central banks with room to act but its domestic economy remains relatively strong the ecb by comparison already has interest rates well below zero and its stimulus policies have struggled to lift growth its track record of sensitivity to investors rate expectations makes the recent tilt toward predictions of a cut stand out this time last year traders in money markets slashed bets that the ecb would raise interest rates by september it had cut borrowing costs to a record low of 0 5 and restarted quantitative easing ecb president christine lagarde has been calling for more fiscal spending reflecting thinking that the ecbs monetary tools are close to being maxed out governments response has been muted particularly from germany although it has revealed plans to temporarily suspend limits on public borrowing to allow its regions to spend more the move could prove to be the first step toward fiscal stimulus one of the ecb s few options is to boost bond buying but this remains likely to meet fierce opposition from germany said london based mark dowding the chief investment officer at bluebay asset management llp i m not sure that cutting rates will help he said the pandemic is clearly a real risk and with it the threat that this leads to recession the correct response will be a fiscal one in this case with assistance from steve matthews and anooja debnath to contact the reporter on this story john ainger in london at jainger bloomberg net to contact the editors responsible for this story dana el baltaji at delbaltaji bloomberg net fergal o brien michael hunter 2020 bloomberg l p

been blooming for weeks and crocuses are trying to pop in sunny places view larger as happens in most years new proposals have cropped up in the rhode island general assembly to impose tax increases on high earners well i think that public needs both at the state and nation levels will require tax increases on the wealthy and the middle class too education and physical infrastructure should be at the top of the spending list and something must be done to slow the swelling of the national debt which is a slow motion disaster modest tax increases on estates seem the fairest place to start to get more revenue and a way to narrow the ever increasing advantage of people with wealthy parents but the tiny ocean state must remain tax competitive with much bigger massachusetts you could almost say that whatever massachusetts does in taxes rhode island has to follow for that matter most major tax changes should start at the federal level to minimize the race to the bottom effect in which states cut taxes and public services to lure rich companies and individuals those public services primarily serve low income and middle class people the role of taxes in the decisions of rich people on where to live is exaggerated surveys have shown that bigger concerns are the locations of family and personal and business friends weather local culture crime rates such natural attractions as proximity to water mountains and so on and yes even the quantity and quality of public services some of which even very rich people must use still there s no doubt that for some rich folks taxes are a big factor and we obviously want wealthy folks around to spend money and invest in local businesses thus the general assembly should be very careful indeed about tax increases that drive people to the bay state and any extra money from tax increases should be clearly earmarked for public education kindergarten through college and to improve rhode island s subpar transportation and other public infrastructure both of these will tend to make the state more economically competitive and please beware of using higher tax rates to offset the revenue lost from giving rich companies special tax incentives to lure them here or get them to expand here the macro economic benefits are usually much exaggerated and short term and unfair to companies that aren t getting these goodies last summer the w e upjohn institute released a useful study of the effectiveness of cities and states tax incentive programs to read it please hit this link of course politicians often with the support of many voters will continue to chase big name companies and often get into stupid bidding wars to attract them the report s abstract says o ur current place based jobs policies under which state and local governments provide long term tax incentives to megacorporations are poorly targeted and designed such incentives are as large in nondistressed areas as in distressed areas and they are excessively costly what reforms are needed first job growth policies should target distressed areas suburban atlantis i wonder how much planners and resilience projects can really do to save the very low lying communities of

three hole one a putting green metacom encompasses 105 acres lots of open land to play with fewer people seem to have the time or the inclination these days to spend the hours necessary to play 18

fewer successful people can or want to take the time for a leisurely lunch and it s long been unfashionable to drink at lunch that activity used to be major attraction of club lunches but tax changes under reagan and bill clinton reduced the deductibility of what used to be called the three martini business lunch i remember with a pang the boozy business lunches i had in new york and paris i usually drank little or nothing but most of my table mates knocked back the stuff one of these people offered me a job which i took later on one of my bosses in paris insisted on my joining him for frequent vinous lunches at a restaurant near the office to plan i d be lucky to escape in two hours to rush back to my deadline work toward the end of the meal the very patient waiter would ask my boss another irish coffee monsieur when back in the early 70s i was briefly an intern at business week magazine in new york two editors took me to lunch several times at a famous restaurant called sardi s they always ordered a bottle of wine and one of them a cocktail then after an hour and half lunch we d straggle back to the office where one of them the executive editor would light his pipe and run the daily editors meeting with great skill and astonishing memory for economic data the other went to sleep in his office but the most impressive three martini lunch man i broke bread with was a college classmate and an account executive for a big ad agency who seemed to spend most of his waking hours in overpriced manhattan restaurants he often paid for our lunches on his expense account

opened its first cashierless grocery in seattle i d guess that there will be plenty of these in several years meaning that many thousands of people who have had cashier positions as their main

words were the koch brothers and some other plutocrats will pull out all the stops to keep their man in the oval office mr glass wrote the phrase koch brothers is inaccurate here as it generally refers to charles and david koch and david passed away in august 2019 the other two brothers william and the late frederick are not involved additionally the political network koch network associated with charles koch did not endorse president trump in 2016 and it has made no such endorsement this year either therefore the inclusion of the reference to the koch brothers is not appropriate and i recommend clarifying for readers while some in the vast koch network the core of which is the huge very well managed and family controlled koch industries have expressed public distaste for some of trump s policies particularly on immigration and trade and his crude and divisive rhetoric it has pushed for and gotten what it most wanted from him big tax cuts for companies and rich people deregulation and conservative judges and regulators you can bet that they want to continue that especially as they re staring at bernie sanders a democratic socialist actually he s just a social democrat as the democrats potential presidential nominee by the way william koch has been a major contributor to republican candidates the koch network founded by charles and david koch is a collection of tax exempt groups and companies in which the source of campaign cash is often hard to trace some of the koch network people who have worked with the trump regime include corey lewandowski one of trump s presidential campaign managers in 2016 he had worked for americans for prosperity a koch backed group alan cobb who was national director of state operations of that organization became a senior adviser to the trump 2016 election effort marc short now chief of staff to vice president pence had been president of freedom partners another koch backed group donald mcgahn a lawyer who worked for freedom partners became for a time trump s white house counsel there are others tim phillips the long serving president of americans for prosperity told the washington post that he and his colleagues regarded 2017 as the most productive year in the existence of this network at the federal level and that the koch policy apparatus had been invited to take part from day one in formulating the tax changes that trump signed into law in december of that year robert whitcomb and golocal ceo josh fenton kudos to michael bloomberg for not jumping on the trendy marijuana legalization campaign that was generally touted at the democratic presidential debate last tuesday mr bloomberg noted that much research needs to be done on the neurological effects of pot use especially in young people this has been treated far too lightly the debate was almost as chaotic as the republicans primary debates in 2016 i wonder how many other americans would be willing to have their pasts raked up in such detail as are the past lives of political candidates i admire candidates courage and rhinoceros skin xxx i wonder who might quickly become the front runner for the nomination if bernie sanders 78 keels over from another heart attack in the next few months which reminds me if an old friend wants to get together always try to accept national service world war ii with its huge manpower demands brought together many americans of widely different backgrounds with many benefits such as reducing racial bias now when americans are so divided politically socially and economically we could use a new broad but voluntary national service program mostly for young adults that would bring people together to help address community needs in infrastructure repair education health care and other areas the volunteers would be paid very modestly and receive free housing perhaps something like foreign exchange students staying with host families to reduce

entertaining boundary dispute underway between kittery and york maine that reminds us how old new england is the origins of the dispute go back to at least 1653 when puritan invaders from massachusetts drew a straight line to mark part of the two towns boundary with each other but reports the boston globe property ownership changes and long forgotten handshakes had incorporated wobbles and bumps into what became an accepted meandering boundary from brave boat harbor to the present day town of eliot which borders both kittery and york the argument commenced in 2018 when york developer duane jellison had bought property on route 1 that he believed was evenly divided between york and kittery his surveyor concluded instead that the majority of the property is in york the

new york as stocks around the world tumble on worries about a fast spreading virus investors have been clamouring for the superheroes of the financial world to ride to the rescue once again yet this time there are doubts can central banks really fix this crisis as they have so many others as much as anything the federal reserve and its counterparts around the world have helped drive up stocks over the past decade with their interest rate cuts stimulus programs and promises of support through the 2008 financial crisis the 2011 european debt crisis and intermittent worries about a looming recession actions by central banks have helped place a floor under stock prices and one result was the longest u s bull market on record now with the standard poor s 500 stock index having just plunged 12 8 in barely more than a week the dizziest such fall since the 2008 financial crisis many investors are calling for the fed to swoop in yet again with rate cuts and perhaps other stimulative actions we need the fed to come out and say basically guys we got your back said gene goldman chief investment officer at cetera financial group traders are pricing in a 100 certainty that the fed will cut interest rates at its next meeting on march 18 a month ago those traders had seen less than an 8 likelihood according to cme group the fed is being called into action bofa global research economists wrote in a report friday they expect the fed to cut short term interest rates by half a percentage point at its next meeting and possibly even before then that would be the steepest rate cut since the financial crisis was still at full bore in 2008 the hope and expectation that the fed can provide the ultimate backstop for stock prices isn t surprising given its recent history of serving just that role its abrupt reversal from having raised rates four times in 2018 to cutting them three times in 2019 helped launch the s p 500 into one of its most dazzling years in decades a 31 5 return but this crisis is distinct from most others and some investors say the tools at the fed s disposal aren t ideally suited to address the economic damage from a viral outbreak verging on a global pandemic that reality has set the market up for a series of potential disappointments one is that the fed won t yield to expectations for a rate cut perhaps so as not to appear unduly beholden to investor demands the fed s dual mandate as an institution is to maximize employment and keep prices stable not to serve wall street it s dangerous when the expectation is 100 that we re going to get a cut said ann miletti head of active equity at wells fargo asset management when expectations get disjointed from reality that gets problematic that risk might have been lessened after the central bank put out a statement friday that pledged to use our tools to support the economy a sign that fed officials may indeed decide to cut rates soon yet what if they do lower rates can lead people and businesses to borrow and spend which can boost economic activity but they can t make sick people healthy reopen factories whose workers are kept home because of quarantines or restart supply chains in areas of the world struck by the outbreak from an optics perspective maybe a rate cut makes a difference in psychology for investors said debbie cunningham chief investment officer of global liquidity markets at federated hermes i don t think on a quantitative basis it makes a hill of beans difference the virus is squeezing sales and profits for many companies large and small around the world sharp drops in tourism have hurt shopkeepers from bangkok to venice to seoul economists worry that if covid 19 breaks out as a global pandemic panicky consumers would avoid shopping malls and restaurants while businesses would close as workers stay home many companies would delay hiring expanding and investing collectively those trends could tip the u s and global economies into recession the fed would face such a downturn with interest rates already low its benchmark short term rate is in a range of 1 50 to 1 75 down from 2 25 2 50 in late 2018 and from 5 25 before the great recession that means the fed would have less ammunition in the form of rate cuts even if lower borrowing rates were the right prescription for this crisis other central banks have even less monetary firepower after having already cut their benchmark rates below zero ultimately some investors say the markets will be able to recover only after the virus has been contained regardless of what the fed does in the interim melda mergen deputy global head of equities at columbia threadneedle investments said she is optimistic that the market s sell off will let up soon still she suggested investors are likely monitoring the number of new infections outside china if that number were to accelerate stock prices will likely head further down regardless of what the fed does maybe it helps the market on a short term basis because people say ok the fed is reacting and we need them to do that said miletti of wells fargo asset management they re important but they can t solve all the problems one potential source of support for the market is the federal government in the form of spending programs on infrastructure or a new tax cut yet given that capitol hill is essentially paralyzed by partisan gridlock in an election year few expect anything to get done anytime soon that leaves the central banks stock prices rise and fall with how much profits companies make along with how much investors are willing to pay for each 1 of those earnings when the fed cuts rates it can encourage investors to pay higher prices than they otherwise would for stocks because bonds become less attractive as rival investments but by several measures stocks are still trading at above average prices relative to their earnings even after last week s plunge still some investors who are hopeful for a robust market recovery if the virus can be contained soon note that the u s economy has been relatively healthy corporate profits are still near record highs even if they aren t growing quickly anymore the unemployment rate is low and economists have been expecting a pickup in growth as trade tensions diminished all of that is why some analysts say that even if the coronavirus tips the economy into recession they expect a relatively quick rebound most acknowledge though that it s particularly hard to forecast how the economy and any response from the fed will unfold this is something that s very unprecedented both globally and in the u s said kathy bostjancic chief financial economist at oxford economics ___ rugaber contributed from washington ap business writer damian j

new vat rate takes toll on businesses barely one month after the new 7 5 value added tax rate took effect not a few companies are happy with the development which many argue is already taking a heavy toll on their businesses ibrahim apekhade yusuf charles okonji and medinat kanabe examine the issues one of the civic responsibilities of every citizen whether as individuals or corporate entities is to pay taxes which in all intent and purposes is a duty that should be fulfilled by all and sundry but that otherwise simple act of patriotism is a source of nightmare to many nigerians who have continued to taste the bitter pill of taxation as the case may be enter new vat rate following the approval of the new finance act the new tax regime raised vat from 5 percent to 7 5 percent commenced in earnest in february 1 2020 it would be recalled that the minister of finance budget and national planning mrs zainab usman had informed that the implementation of value added tax vat new rate of 7 5 per cent will commence on february 1 2020 after all the necessary administrative procedures have been completed especially the gazette of the act by the federal ministry of justice justifying the need for the new tax regime the minister at the time said the vat was increased from 5 per cent to 7 5 per cent in government s bid to boost revenue which is badly needed to close the deficit gap in the 2020 budget according to the minister the standard rate of tax has now been raised to 7 5 of invoice value of goods and services except items specifically stated as exempt or zero rated for which small businesses with less than n25million turnover are exempted the vat system in nigeria is administered by the federal inland revenue service firs however despite blessed assurances from the authorities that the after effects of the new tax regime would not pose additional burden on the taxpayers there are fears that the implementation of the new tax policy is already taking a heavy toll on businesses tax burden borned by businesses many business owners have continued to lament what they desc as excruciating burden of taxes that in recent times one they say is detrimental to their well being as a profit oriented venture speaking with separate members of the organised private sector they literally poured out their hearts as they lamented the pitiable state of their businesses firing the first salvo stanley aghomi a warri based manufacturer who produces uniforms for off shore workers said the new vat increase has shoot update his operational cost and adversely reduced his profit margins based on the new increase already he says he have had to close down some of his production lines aghomi s lamentations is not any different from olawale tijjani s tales of woes who is the head of manufacturing plant in fast moving consumer goods company in lagos according to him the much touted ease of business policy is pure propaganda as far as he is concerned the government has a long way to go if it must achieve that laudable height we are involved in the manufacturing of food supplements as such we have to import some of the components which we cannot source locally the new vat rate is already affecting our business substantially our continuous survival is not guaranteed anymore he said like aghomi and tijjani not a few businesses are affected and already counting their losses while addressing a selected team of journalists in lagos recently at the company s corporate head office the managing director of guinness nigeria plc baker magunda had disclosed that the company is not immuned to the growing wave of incessant government policies which has huge implications for businesses specifically he said taxes remains a major cause for concern while noting that the government deserves to demand taxes required for the overall development of the country he was however quick to add that companies operating in the country need to be factored into the scheme of things as they remained an integral part of the business ecosystem contributing to the economic well being of the country as a whole going down memory lane magunda who presented a score card of the company s business during the financial year end observed that guinness nigeria plc as remained a formidable partner specifically he said the company paid over n1 6billion in taxes in 2019 this he said was despite the many challenges that confronted the business echoing similar sentiments colman hanna supply director at guinness nigeria plc while speaking on some of the challenges said to the operating costs of the business according to hanna logistics of the business is worst hit by the new regime of taxes normally we move a container from the lagos apapa port for n500 000 the cost of moving the same container rose to about n800 000 within the space of three weeks and we had to pay to avoid further surcharges incidental expenses such as this he notes are disincentive to businesses speaking with a cross section of operators within and around the nation s ports the same complaints resonated as they all lamented the increasing burden businesses have to bear and may ultimately be passed to the final consumers out there tax aversion a lot of nigerians are averse towards payment of any form of taxes because they feel governments at all levels are not accountable according to a note by lagos based csl stockbrokers limited in fact they disclosed that a few small business owners they engaged in recent times were apathetic toward taxes payments according to them the reasoning of the small business operators was that it would be pointless to pay taxes to an allegedly corrupt government that has proven itself incompetent in terms of providing critical infrastructure and basic amenities nigeria s tax system has been described by experts as one with various forms of loopholes as such it is not inconceivable that the rate of tax underpayment by the upper class may be significant abc of tax there are a good number of taxes payable by persons doing business in nigeria these include companies income tax personal income tax capital gains tax value added tax education tax technology tax stamp duties and withholding tax according to the extant laws every business name owner who earns an income in nigeria either from employment or from carrying on a business is subject to tax under the personal income tax act it is however instructive to note that the federal inland revenue service firs has continuously stressed that it is determined to bring many people into the tax net especially high networth individuals and corporate citizens most of who form the bulk of tax evaders and defaulters alike echoing similar sentiments the former director general budget office mr bode agusto while speaking at a public forum recently weighed in on tax evasion and default in payment that has been reported in the media space in recent times while noting that some nigerians are averse towards payment of any form of taxes because they feel governments at all levels are not accountable agusto however observed that over 200 000 wealthy nigerians are the biggest tax evaders in the country he also added that tax laws be made simpler man s position in the view of the manufacturers association of nigeria man on the recent increase in value added tax there is an urgent need to look at the rippled negative effects of the policy in a position paper signed by the director general of man segun ajayi kadir and made available to our correspondent m mrambrose oruche director of media and publicity who is also the acting dg of man stated that the vat increase of 50 percent would increase the cost of production according to the media minder of the association it is not all vat that you can recover people may argue that vat is an input tax that would be recovered on your products but the truth remains that it is not all vat that is recoverable but the firs do not want to take off such vat away from the manufacture and such will hinder manufacturers greatly plausible as the recommendation to increase vat may look implementing it at this time would boomerang because the timing is inappropriate especially at a time when the minimum wage of n30 000 was just agreed upon he maintained expatiating he said this could send a wrong signal that the government is not sensitive to the plight of the low and middle income earners who are clearly in the majority a typical case of government simply taking back what was given with the right hand through the national minimum wage with the left hand through 50 per cent increase in vat according to the document released by man on vat the following are possible implications of 50 per cent vat increase economic realities of the proposed increase in vat in terms of misery index rating low per capita income heavily lopsided income distribution pattern the nigerian economy will be in a more vulnerable state if vat is increased no controversy the burden of the tax would be shifted to the nigerian consumers that are already struggling the economy would certainly experience demand crunch inventory of unsold items would soar profitability of manufacturing concerns would be negatively impacted many factories will witness serious downturn or wind down operations this would also worsen the already high unemployment position of the country which is above 23 as nigerians currently employed by manufacturing concerns and other businesses may join the reserved army of unemployed and further bloat the unemployment rate in the country man noted that as a strategic stakeholder in the nation s development agenda which appreciates the need for government to generate more revenue to fund its developmental initiatives amidst declining revenue from oil however government should thread with caution in the drive for improved revenue for the following reasons the economy just recently exited recession with the fragile growth rate of less than 2 recorded in 2018 and should be delicately managed the precarious macroeconomic condition of the country requires palliatives that would improve investment and not higher tax burden the prevailing high lending rate double digit inflation low per capita income high unemployment rate and a low 1 91 growth rate amidst 2 6 population growth rate that are already cumulatively limiting competitiveness could be further worsened any increase at this time would not be in sync with the standard practice that expects the administration and implementation of vat to be effected in a manner that distortion and possible adverse effect on the economy are minimised or avoided an increased vat will spur spontaneous increase in inflation rate occasioned by increased prices of goods and services the obvious resultant effects of implementing an increased vat on the manufacturing sector includes lower purchasing power of consumers sharp reduction in consumption drop in sales decrease in production capacity lower government revenue increase in unemployment and stifled economic growth unfair comparison of vat rate in nigeria and other countries in africa forgetting the fact that macroeconomic dynamics and the level of competitiveness in these countries are not the same with that of nigeria the fact that many states of the federation also have other consumption taxes like vat currently being levied on businesses should call for circumspection standard considerations for an ideal vat tate for nigeria there is no doubt that vat is an important revenue source to the government for running the affairs of the country however the principle of a good tax system is predicated on payment convenience otherwise it could boomerang leading to crowding out of businesses more misery to the citizens and even lesser revenue to the government the nigerian economy has consistently ranked top in africa with only south africa presenting a fair challenge years back following the economic feat and potential of the country it assumed an emerging economy status like china india malaysia turkey and south korea only south africa and egypt made this economic bracket in africa it is important to state that on economic front nigeria should ideally be compared with the emerging economies and not just any country in africa comparative economic policies should be predicated on what obtains in this economic frontier therefore an ideal tax policy should be such that takes into cognizance the status of the economy an ideal vat policy for nigeria should take into account the current profiles of nigeria s per capita income pci national minimum wage nmw and global competitiveness pci and nmw will help highlight what will be the implication of upward review of vat on the already depleted wellbeing of majority of nigerians while global competitiveness will present insight on the impact of such review on the real sector particularly manufacturing sector a cross reference of selected emerging economies in terms of pci nmw and gci in the table below is revealing from the cross country indicators computed from the world bank report it is quite discernable why vat is high in these emerging economies including south africa the high pci and national minimum wage are able to adequately offset the impact of high vat on growth and wellbeing of the populace while the high global competitiveness ensures that the countries secure a fair share of global market recently nigerian has been recording influx of businesses from south africa conversely given the low nigeria s pci nmw and global competitiveness any increase in vat at this time will further depress consumption industrial production and wellbeing of nigerians in man s previous position and recommendations the association advised government to widen the tax net rather than increasing the rate to meet the growing need for more revenue to address the development objective of the country there is also the need to harmonize taxes levies fees payable by businesses in the country so as to attract more investment that would translate to higher productivity and more tax revenue for the government in the medium and long term in consideration of all the above man hereby implore government not to increase the vat at this point in time but consider the implementation of the afore mentioned tax specific recommendations and continue to ramp up support for the manufacturing sector in the best interest of the over 200million nigeria in search of tax policy with back human fac in the view of mr afam mallinson ukatu the chairman of non metallic mining sector of the manufacturers association of nigeria man there has been a long drawn battle between tax authorities and manufacturers in the country over multiple taxation of our businesses and if the issue of multiple taxation is not urgently addressed by government more manufacturing companies are likely to exit the economy as far as ukatu is concerned the lamentations about all sorts of taxes are not yet addressed now the government has come up with increase in vat the implication of this is that manufacturers would further be impoverished while most smes would be forced out of business because it cannot compete favourably with the imported goods that find their way into the nation s market government he stressed should look into multiple taxation and vat i have always argued that taxes should be paid on your turnover but what of a situation where a manufacturer is losing money it is obvious that a manufacturer produces and still losses money and you are still expected to pay your tax in his honest opinion he believes there should be a system whereby individuals are evaluated by the tax authorities just like china usa and other countries there is what they keep as special rebate for manufacturing companies because this is what encourages people to go into manufacturing without manufacturing there wouldn t be any way to for high rate of unemployment to reduce government he insists can only provide about 10 percent of the total job requirement of the population whereas manufacturing can generate over 60 70 percent of the needed employment
please make sure these dispatches reach as many readers as possible share with kin friends and workmates and ask them to do likewise dispatches from moon of alabama by b this article is part of an ongoing series of dispatches from moon of alabama the new york times abuses the coronavirus pandemic to push more of its anti china propaganda the new york times nytimes 10 40 utc feb 28 2020 the chinese government silenced whistle blowers withheld information and played down the threat of the new coronavirus now the ruling communist party is trying to rehabilitate its image by rebranding itself as the leader in the fight against the virus china spins coronavirus crisis hailing itself as a global leader the propaganda push suggests the chinese government might be worried about the lasting damage of the outbreak when a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin appeared in wuhan the first reaction was of course confusion and not an immediate large scale response yes china could have been a bit faster and some local administrators made mistakes but who please if not the chinese government has since led the global fight against the novel coronavirus the report of the who mission to china is lauding it for good reasons china s bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic a particularly compelling statistic is that on the first day of the advance team s work there were 2478 newly confirmed cases of covid 19 reported in china two weeks later on the final day of this mission china reported 409 newly confirmed cases this decline in covid 19 cases across china is real it is the u s which is lagging in the fight as it still can not even test people who need to be tested the federal agency shunned the world health organization test guidelines used by other countries and set out to create a more complicated test of its own that could identify a range of similar viruses but when it was sent to labs across the country in the first week of february it didn t work as expected the cdc test correctly identified covid 19 the disease caused by the virus but in all but a handful of state labs it falsely flagged the presence of the other viruses in harmless samples the cdc is still acting irresponsibly some american cities may need to wait weeks for a virus test that works across the u s fewer than 2 000 people had been been checked for the virus by thursday a bare fraction of those in other large countries city and state officials are frustrated by the federal centers for disease control and prevention s slowness to distribute accurate tests that could identify spreaders of the coronavirus that the cdc botched its response is probably not astonishing when its highest boss calls the obvious danger a hoax president donald trump on friday night tried to cast the global outbreak of the coronavirus as a liberal conspiracy intended to undermine his first term lumping it alongside impeachment and the mueller investigation he blamed the press for acting hysterically about the virus which has now spread to china japan south korea iran italy and the u s and he downplayed its dangers saying against expert opinion it was on par with the flu the democrats are politicizing the coronavirus they re politicizing it he said they don t have any clue they can t even count their votes in iowa no they can t they can t count their votes one of my people came up to me and said mr president they tried to beat you on russia russia russia that did not work out too well they could not do it they tried the impeachment hoax then trump called the coronavirus their new hoax it is not a hoax for the government workers who cared for the covid 19 cases the u s evacuated from japan but were left unprotected and had received no training they should all be in quarantine but were seemingly allowed to leave it is not a hoax for the guy in brooklyn who just came back from japan developed a high fever and can not get a test it is not a hoax for the man in miami who came from china was tested and will now have to pay 3 270 for it it will not be a hoax for many million u s citizens the u s is botching its response to the outbreak just like japan has botched it south korea shows how it should be done raphael rashid koryodynasty 14 35 utc feb 28 2020 south korea has gone through over 10 000 covid 19 tests today people who have any slightest of symptoms or not can even get themselves tested at these testing drive thru stations the whole process takes 10 mins i m in awe as jeeabbeylee points out these covid 19 tests are free anyone can get tested and with emergency localised messages being beamed to almost every phone in the country you cannot switch these alerts off people know exactly whether they ve been in the path of the virus or not it s really incredible might i also point out that not only is covid 19 testing in s korea free it s open to all including foreign residents incl undocumented immigrants medical centres are exempt from obligation to notify immigration office of visa status of patients oh also while covid 19 tests in s korea are free if the medical team determines the test to not be necessary but someone insists on wanting to be tested they ll have to fork out 160 000 won 132 the way the u s health system is structured will make it difficult to avoid an wider epidemic it will hit workers especially hard the cdc released very clear instructions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases including staying home when you are sick not everyone has that option overall just under three quarters 73 of private sector workers in the united states have the ability to earn paid sick time at work and as shown in the figure below access to paid sick days is vastly unequal the highest wage workers are more than three times as likely to have access to paid sick leave as the lowest paid workers whereas 93 of the highest wage workers had access to paid sick days only 30 of the lowest paid workers were able to earn sick days the second recommendation from the cdc is to contact your healthcare provider we know in that the united states millions of people delay getting medical treatment because of the costs the latest census numbers tell us that over 27 million people in this country are uninsured up nearly two million over the previous year these trends are moving in the wrong direction notably because of losses in medicaid coverage the cdc recommendations all seem well and good but how does someone with no paid sick days or insurance cope there are also the undocumented immigrants who will fear that health personal may inform the immigration authorities national nurses united warns that u s hospitals and hospital staff are unprepared for handling an epidemic the single covid 19 patient admitted to the on feb 19 has now led to the self quarantine at home of at least 36 rns and 88 other health care workers these 124 nurses and health care workers who are needed now more than ever have instead been sidelined lack of preparedness will create an unsustainable national health care staffing crisis national nurses united is conducting a survey of registered nurses across the country on hospital preparedness and will be releasing those results next week preliminary results from more than 1 000 nurses in california are worrisome only 27 percent report that there is a plan in place to isolate a patient with a possible novel coronavirus infection 47 percent report they don t know if there is a plan only 73 percent report that they have access to n95 respirators on their units 47 percent report access to powered air purifying respirators paprs on their units only 27 percent report that their employer has sufficient personal protective equipment ppe stock on hand to protect staff if there is a rapid surge in patients with possible coronavirus infections 44 percent don t know most of the issues above can be fixed if the government and congress start to take the covid 19 seriously i have yet to see any sign that this is the case tests must be freely available for anyone with even slight symptoms those who test positive must be isolated there must be teams to trace and alarm all their contacts all costs for covid 19 cases including money to pay people during for quarantine must be paid by the government services must be set up for deliveries to people who quarantine themselves at home each new cluster must receive an immediate response on a large scale health staff needs to get extra pay the above will require new legislation it should be discussed today not tomorrow china has shown how a response can be done effectively south korea is following that path and will likely be equally successful there are also the economic consequences which only slowly start to come into view economist nouriel roubini predictsthat the pandemic will cause a very strong global recession i expect global equities to tank by 30 to 40 percent this year the recession will also require massive government stimulus and work programs as most central banks already have extremely low interest rates and no room left to act to panic over the above facts is not useful at all but people should press their governments and legislators to at least start the fight against the epidemic and its predictable consequences previous moon of alabama posts on the issue posted by b on february 29 2020 at 19 21 utc permalink comments sampler about the

london cnn business a version of this story first appeared in cnn business before the bell newsletter not a subscriber you can sign up right here from stocks to bonds and currencies the coronavirus outbreak is rocking all corners of financial markets for oil producers the pain has been particularly acute with demand dissipating oil has plunged into a bear market putting pressure on opec to step in and attempt to stabilize prices but as the coronavirus continues to spread around the world can the cartel really play the savior that s the question this week as opec members and allied producers gather in vienna for meetings on thursday and friday the backdrop brent crude futures the global benchmark finished friday at 50 52 per barrel down 13 6 for the week us oil was trading at 44 76 a 16 2 weekly decline prices haven t been that low since late 2018 why opec needs to act the economies of some opec members are reliant on crude production and the coronavirus has sharply reduced demand for products such as gasoline and jet fuel to keep prices from dropping further opec may turn to what has become its preferred strategy in recent years coordinated production cuts the financial times has reported that saudi arabia is pushing for a cut in production of 1 million barrels per day much more than first expected the kingdom would shoulder the brunt of the reduction while kuwait the united arab emirates and russia would split the rest according to the ft russia is not a member of opec but it has coordinated production levels with the cartel in recent years giovanni staunovo an analyst at ubs thinks that may not be enough to alter oil s trajectory in the near term i m not sure this sufficient to change the negative market sentiment he told me what is cheap can get cheaper bright spot staunovo points out that oil prices aren t sustainable for long at their current level within six months and a year lower business investment across a struggling industry will restrict supply helping to prop up prices he said plus bargain crude will eventually stimulate demand oswald clint an analyst at bernstein agrees that prices will need to push higher before long he thinks that an opec cut of 1 million barrels per day would be sufficiently supportive especially given falling oil production in countries like norway that predated the coronavirus outbreak but both staunovo and clint agree that oil markets need a bailout from opec and soon stocks just had a brutal week the next one may not be easier global stocks have fallen for seven trading sessions in a row lodging their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis and putting investors on edge as the novel coronavirus continues to spread outside china what s happening stocks plunged and financial conditions tightened

economy remain strong he said while acknowledging that the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity the central bank powell said will act as appropriate to support the economy to investors the message was loud and clear expect the fed to cut interest rates when it meets in march according to cme group s fedwatch tool 100 of investors now predict a rate cut in march with nearly 95 forecasting that the fed will lower rates by a decisive 50 basis points will that reassurance be enough to help markets stabilize this week it s hard to say after years of persistently low interest rates investors are worried that central banks lack sufficient ammunition to stave off a crisis an interest rate cut in this environment will arguably do little to affect real economic activity morgan

file this jan 31 2020 file photo shows a wall street sign in front of the new york stock exchange stocks plunged on wall street as investors feared that a virus outbreak that originated in china will dent the global economy investors might be on edge after the stock market surrendered five months worth of gains in an alarmingly short amount of time a viral outbreak has spread to nearly 60 countries and shows little sign of abating that in turn has stirred worries about the economy on a global scale ap photo mark lennihan file as stocks around the world tumble on worries about a fast spreading virus investors have been clamoring for the superheroes of the financial world to ride to the rescue once again yet this time there are doubts can central banks really fix this crisis as they have so many others as much as anything the federal reserve and its counterparts around the world have helped drive up stocks over the past decade with their interest rate cuts stimulus programs and promises of support through the 2008 financial crisis the 2011 european debt crisis and intermittent worries about a looming recession actions by central banks have helped place a floor under stock prices and one result was the longest u s bull market on record advertisement now with the standard poor s 500 stock index having just plunged 12 8 in barely more than a week the dizziest such fall since the 2008 financial crisis many investors are calling for the fed to swoop in yet again with rate cuts and perhaps other stimulative actions we need the fed to come out and say basically guys we got your back said gene goldman chief investment officer at cetera financial group traders are pricing in a 100 certainty that the fed will cut interest rates at its next meeting on march 18 a month ago those traders had seen less than an 8 likelihood according to cme group the fed is being called into action bofa global research economists wrote in a report friday they expect the fed to cut short term interest rates by half a percentage point at its next meeting and possibly even before then that would be the steepest rate cut since the financial crisis was still at full bore in 2008 the hope and expectation that the fed can provide the ultimate backstop for stock prices isn t surprising given its recent history of serving just that role its abrupt reversal from having raised rates four times in 2018 to cutting them three times in 2019 helped launch the s p 500 into one of its most dazzling years in decades a 31 5 return but this crisis is distinct from most others and some investors say the tools at the fed s disposal aren t ideally suited to address the economic damage from a viral outbreak verging on a global pandemic that reality has set the market up for a series of potential disappointments one is that the fed won t yield to expectations for a rate cut perhaps so as not to appear unduly beholden to investor demands the fed s dual mandate as an institution is to maximize employment and keep prices stable not to serve wall street it s dangerous when the expectation is 100 that we re going to get a cut said ann miletti head of active equity at wells fargo asset management when expectations get disjointed from reality that gets problematic that risk might have been lessened after the central bank put out a statement friday that pledged to use our tools to support the economy a sign that fed officials may indeed decide to cut rates soon yet what if they do lower rates can lead people and businesses to borrow and spend which can boost economic activity but they can t make sick people healthy reopen factories whose workers are kept home because of quarantines or restart supply chains in areas of the world struck by the outbreak from an optics perspective maybe a rate cut makes a difference in psychology for investors said debbie cunningham chief investment officer of global liquidity markets at federated hermes i don t think on a quantitative basis it makes a hill of beans difference the virus is squeezing sales and profits for many companies large and small around the world sharp drops in tourism have hurt shopkeepers from bangkok to venice to seoul economists worry that if covid 19 breaks out as a global pandemic panicky consumers would avoid shopping malls and restaurants while businesses would close as workers stay home many companies would delay hiring expanding and investing collectively those trends could tip the u s and global economies into recession the fed would face such a downturn with interest rates already low its benchmark short term rate is in a range of 1 50 to 1 75 down from 2 25 2 50 in late 2018 and from 5 25 before the great recession that means the fed would have less ammunition in the form of rate cuts even if lower borrowing rates were the right prescription for this crisis other central banks have even less monetary firepower after having already cut their benchmark rates below zero ultimately some investors say the markets will be able to recover only after the virus has been contained regardless of what the fed does in the interim melda mergen deputy global head of equities at columbia threadneedle investments said she is optimistic that the market s sell off will let up soon still she suggested investors are likely monitoring the number of new infections outside china if that number were to accelerate stock prices will likely head further down regardless of what the fed does maybe it helps the market on a short term basis because people say ok the fed is reacting and we need them to do that said miletti of wells fargo asset management they re important but they can t solve all the problems one potential source of support for the market is the federal government in the form of spending programs on infrastructure or a new tax cut yet given that capitol hill is essentially paralyzed by partisan gridlock in an election year few expect anything to get done anytime soon that leaves the central banks stock prices rise and fall with how much profits companies make along with how much investors are willing to pay for each 1 of those earnings when the fed cuts rates it can encourage investors to pay higher prices than they otherwise would for stocks because bonds become less attractive as rival investments but by several measures stocks are still trading at above average prices relative to their earnings even after last week s plunge still some investors who are hopeful for a robust market recovery if the virus can be contained soon note that the u s economy has been relatively healthy corporate profits are still near record highs even if they aren t growing quickly anymore the unemployment rate is low and economists have been expecting a pickup in growth as trade tensions diminished all of that is why some analysts say that even if the coronavirus tips the economy into recession they expect a relatively quick rebound most acknowledge though that it s particularly hard to forecast how the economy and any response from the fed will unfold this is something that s very unprecedented both globally and in the u s said kathy bostjancic chief financial economist at oxford economics ___ rugaber contributed from washington ap business writer damian j troise in new york also contributed to this report

families for stockton resident tomas vargas 36 getting 500 extra each month has changed his attitude on life it s all a far cry from 2012 when 13 of his friends were killed in a period when stockton was plagued by homicides advertisement advertisement vargas is married with two children under his roof an 8 year old girl and a 6 year old boy another child died while still another lives with his parents one of the things he managed to do with the ubi grant was spring for tutors for them his daughter wants to be an astronaut and his son is good at math it freed me up and gave me just another gust of wind says vargas who recently landed a new job at the local airport he remembers what it was like growing up poor often he wouldn t even have dinner school lunches and sometimes breakfasts were his only meals as an adult he still can t go down the hamburger helper aisle of the grocery store without getting queasy because he ate the boxed meal so much as a kid when his family was low on money these days vargas feels more free psychologically if nothing else he stops in on his mother more often and sometimes lingers to tease her cat and his new job pays around 40 000 a sum that promises to provide him with enough to help his young kids achieve their potential advertisement advertisement some people need encouragement and it s rare to see somebody just give somebody something he says as an economic concept ubi has deep if controversial roots in american politics figures as politically disparate as richard nixon and martin luther king jr talked about different versions of a ubi program conservative thinkers often argue that a ubi should replace costly social safety net programs while liberals insist such a payment must supplement those critical services more recently ubi has been touted in talks by the likes of tesla founder elon musk and facebook founder mark zuckerberg who see it as a hedge against tech fueled job displacement democratic presidential candidate andrew yang addresses supporters in des moines after the iowa caucuses in february yang s campaign was anchored to his passion for universal basic income or ubi where each american would get 1 000 a month for life critics contend the program would cost too much and jeopardize existing welfare programs democratic hopeful yang took particular aim at tech companies while on the campaign trail saying they benefit the most from today s economy and with a coming age of artificial intelligence robots taking over jobs deserved to pay into a ubi sukhi samra seed s director says she is buoyed by some signs that leading politicians are trying to address the nation s growing income inequality gap even if it isn t by talking specifically about a national ubi for example she points to california gov gavin newsom s expansion of the earned income tax credit which refunds money to low income earners a reform that many economists say is the simplest way to put more money into the pockets of those struggling on the margins samra also cites national efforts to put more money in low income people s pockets such as sen kamala harris lift the middle class act and rep rashida tlaib s boost act each of which would provide 6 000 a year to middle and working class families through a tax credit suki samra with the stockton economic empowerment demonstration seed speaks during a roundtable discussion with community leaders focusing on economic justice criminal justice reform education and environmental justice at city hall in downtown stockton california it s all about trusting and empowering folks says samra success for us looks like moving the policy conversation to one where we re recognizing that everyone deserves an income floor and that the economy just isn t working in its current form for a lot of people critics say americans should earn their money not everyone agrees many politicians have argued that welfare programs hinder people from bettering themselves president donald trump has repeatedly slashed benefits programs since taking office including an announcement in december that some 700 000 unemployed people would be losing access to food assistance this year administration officials have argued that people should only be eligible if they have found some kind of employment even some labor officials have concerns about ubi s implications steve smith spokesman for the california labor federation says jobs are indeed in danger because of massive leaps in automation but he says giving people say 1 000 a month to compensate for this impending shift is a trojan horse trotted out by the tech community instead americans need better jobs and pay he says this is their plan to essentially keep pitchforks from coming out when they start to automate jobs on a massive scale says smith whose organization represents 2 million members across 1 200 unions under this scheme inequality would be exacerbated smith says unions such as his want a federal jobs guarantee such as the one put forth by democratic candidate bernie sanders under the vermont senator s plan citizens would be guaranteed a stable job that pays a living wage with some 20 million jobs to be created in a proposed green new deal and still more in healthcare and early childhood education for many americans the notion of free money in a country known for pull yourself up by your bootstraps capitalism is far from an easy sell a 2019 gallup poll found that only 43 of americans supported a ubi as a means to hedge against automation related job losses many critics of ubi tend to raise the same issues beyond the big one where would the money for a multi trillion dollar national program come from there s the issue of putting the value of work in jeopardy while some ubi researchers repeatedly stress that ubi type programs and pilots suggest a regular small check does not discourage recipients from getting jobs others remain skeptical we have something in place that cuts your taxes so as to help bring you up to a level where you re doing ok and it makes sense to use tools that encourage work rather than just hand out money because that s welfare and that didn t work says peter cove author of poor no more and founder of america works which helps those living on the margins find employment in stockton four time city councilman and tubbs critic ralph white has reservations about his hometown s ubi experiment in part because he feels the money which was randomly distributed isn t going to the truly needy seed recipients all met the criteria of living in neighborhoods where the median income is 46 000 a year but white says some residents make as little as 1 000 or less a month and those people are the ones who need 500 white also is bothered about the lack of details released to date about the 125 beneficiaries and wants to know things such as whether they live alone or with an extended family precisely how much they make each year what their bills amount to each month and how many children they have i m against what i don t fully understand says white universal basic income gives some new hope for everett stockton s ubi program felt literally heaven sent the 500 has allowed her to fill the tank not only of her own car regularly but also that of her husband s the money also goes to everyday expenses such as her mobile phone plan home internet bill and doctor co payments when her husband who has worked as a contract based based truck driver isn t employed gets sick or just needs a break the couple now has extra cash to fill the gap i know it s god there s no way around it all these people in this city she says stockton is an inland city in california but the san joaquin river extends all the way to its downtown and has given rise to the port of stockton everett still collects recyclables for extra income and looks to save money however she can as they do for other participants those ubi funds each month offer her a safety valve from life s sudden financial pinch points it s those little pieces being put together it s less arguments in the marriage she says it s you know all of that things are looking up for everett she recently heard that her temporary job at tesla s automotive plant will become permanent perfect timing as the seed program heads into its final stages when she s not building upscale electric cars everett says she plans to take online courses to earn a bachelor s degree in accounting by 2024 she wants to become a certified public accountant she jokes that maybe tesla founder musk might need her one day if there s one misperception about a universal basic income that everett would like to correct it s the notion that the money is a license to relax if anything she says it is merely a lifeline

oil backed loans comprise a large share of africa s debt afp via getty images like many borrowers the republic of congo would have preferred to keep its money problems quiet but as debt service payments began to take a toll on its finances in the wake of a 2014 oil price crash congo revealed that it had taken out billions in previously undisclosed loans it needed a bailout and eventually the international monetary fund imf gave it one the episode illustrates why many sub saharan african countries now stand at the brink of what many observers warn could be another debt crisis debt likes to stay in the dark especially when the lenders are state owned chinese banks and private sector commodity firms excluding high income countries sub saharan africa s total debt nearly doubled to 584 billion over 2010 2018 while public debt as a share of gdp has risen from 40 to 59 percent according to the world bank these are not unmanageable levels experts say provided the proceeds of the loans are used to invest in badly needed infrastructure projects to lift economic growth however unlike in the sovereign debt crisis of the 1990s which ended after africa s multilateral creditors forgave much of the debt a large share of the new debt is owed to china with billions more owed to commodity giants like trafigura or glencore neither is likely to be particularly lenient should borrowers fall into distress in a report published this week the natural resources governance institute nrgi a non profit warns that many of the new loans extended by chinese and private sector actors are not traditional loans that need to be paid back in cash but instead are resource backed loans that need to be paid back with a specified amount of some physical good usually crude oil the terms of resource backed loans vary widely and are often hidden raising the risk that countries accountable only to themselves might continue to borrow heavily until they are forced like the republic of congo to seek help as debt servicing burdens climb resource backed loan terms are seldom public and do not lend themselves to straightforward comparison due to their complexity according to the report in contrast to more established forms of lending like sovereign bonds or loans from multilateral institutions where key terms are widely disclosed and understood it said among the 52 loans examined by nrgi the interest rate could only be identified in 19 this tally also included resource backed loans in latin america the other region examined in the report complicating the problem a majority of the loans have gone to countries that score poorly on measures of transparency one of the worst angola has taken out 24 billion in such loans one key reason why resource backed loans often don t show up in official data in at least some cases the borrower isn t the government itself but one of its state owned entities when the republic of congo s state owned oil company société nationale des pétroles du congo snh took out billions in new pre financing contracts it did so on behalf of the government but the new loans didn t show up in the government s books and went unnoticed for two years this type of loan reporting issue may not be isolated nrgi found that for as many as 40 of the resource backed loans it identified the borrower was a state owned enterprise in many of the oil producing nations of sub saharan africa such as nigeria or gabon the national oil company is the most important state owned enterprise but national oil companies are also among the most opaque in december the imf said that only 62 percent of national oil companies in an index of such firms compiled by nrgi were weak poor or failing on measures of public transparency according to this week s report more than half of national oil companies don t even publish audited financial accounts compared to traditional loans resource backed loans do have some advantages brent crude oil prices have dived 17 percent in the last six market sessions as covid 19 the coronavirus that emerged in wuhan late last year inflicts damage on economic sentiment but countries that have taken out resource backed loans can take comfort in the fact that they need not sell their oil on international markets to make good on their repayments in most cases they might only need to ship a predetermined amount of product in other words resource backed loans can mitigate foreign currency risk that hasn t stopped some countries from deciding that the costs of such loans outweigh the benefits in june south sudan said that it would stop selling pre sales oil contracts these pre sales contracts are not healthy and they are actually destroying the economy information minister michael makuei lueth told reporters at the time in doing so south sudan was taking aim at another aspect of resource backed loans that has come in for criticism the markets for such loans are often uncompetitive since few actors are offering such loans and because they are doing so through private rather than public channels they are able to get away with charging interest rates that are too high and terms that are too strict experts say during a war that began in 2013 south sudan took out loans from chinese companies and pledged to repay them with proceeds from sales of oil but that arrangement has only ended up diverting badly needed resources from peace building efforts the imf said to be sure not all of africa s recent borrowing has been in the form of loans that need to be repaid in physical resources rather than cash in the last few years many countries have issued generous amounts of eurobonds as yield hungry investors turned to emerging markets for returns the wave of eurobond issuances carries its own risks if oil production falls or stagnates a real concern and african currencies depreciate borrowers could struggle to make good on a wall of debt payments that will hit these borrowers starting in around 2024 meanwhile in the republic of congo the government s finances may still not be totally clear in january non profit global witness found 3 3 billion in liabilities owed to some the country s joint venture partners which hadn t been included in earlier imf estimates of debt
sharpest selloff since financial crisis rate cut likely but to limited effect gold plunge signifies irrational market pessimism that a recovery in the global economy will not be able to withstand the global spread of coronavirus provoked the worst weekly sell off in u s equities since the 2008 crash u s markets lost 3 6 trillion in value last week as investors fled to a small group of safer havens demand for the and treasurys increased while both the and sold off enduring negativity loop the and all closed lower on friday though the managed to eke out a small gain nevertheless each of the major u s indices slumped into correction territory as the trading week came to a close stocks dropped for the seventh straight day on friday with the s p plunging 12 6 percent the dow jones industrial average plummeted 14 to its lowest level since june the nasdaq dropped 12 5 and the russell 2000 was down 13 by thursday american equities had already fallen more than 10 the official figure for a slide to be considered a correction we ve written repeatedly about there being with that prediction fulfilled the technicals are now indicating there could be a bounce at least in the short term on friday the dow produced a powerful hammer at the june 3 low which also hits above the uptrend line since the february 2016 bottom a point that happens to encompass the entire trump trade to be clear we re not saying the sell off is over no one can know that rather the selling has reached a technical point that provides room for a bounce to whatever degree or duration of course the fundamental problem remains covid 19 global economic growth is still in shock from the epidemic and company earnings are taking a hit the result of supply chain disruptions and rising costs as workers are furloughed and factories closed overlaying all this are the unsettled financial markets leading to pockets of illiquidity provoking the stress selling we ve been experiencing unfortunately business and financial conditions feed into each other right now they re creating an enduring negativity loop we re looking for the formation of a bottom which has not yet taken place however some investors in search of the big score will likely take the risk of riding a potential rebound that could be as violent as the freefall that preceded it on the final day of weekly as well as february trade the s p 500 declined 0 8 trimming losses of more than 3 during the final 15 minutes of trading the benchmark index still dropped for a seventh day its longest slide since 2016 bank shares underperformed jpmorgan chase nyse sank by more than 4 this fits with the financial disruption we discussed above as liquidity evaporates funding may dry out as lenders assume defensive positions something that was done during the 2008 financial crisis all of which may force the fed to as a way of trying to ease credit though probably moreso to placate markets since the u s central bank already knows such a move won t have any lasting effect a move such as that would lead europe and japan to punish banks with even deeper negative interest rates could that be where the u s is ultimately heading as well yields on the u s treasury plunged taking them deeper into uncharted territory after having fallen below the previous record low of july 2016 this was before the election of donald trump reawakened the market s animal spirits right now however a death cross suggests there are more potential declines ahead for rates which have actualized the drop implied by the previous two patterns the u s dollar also had a terrible week the global reserve currency fell 1 75 in four out of the last six sessions after its feb 20 high saw the greenback hit the highest point since apr 21 2017 however the sell off provided an opportunity for the uptrend line since the beginning of the year to prove itself and it didn t undo a golden cross gold was annihilated on friday the yellow metal experienced its worst plunge since 2013 this is nothing less than shocking given the obvious risk off sentiment currently pervading markets what s more the usd plunged at the same time making gold even cheaper this indicates an irrational selloff one we can only attribute to profit taking gone bad however the price s obvious support by both the 50 dma and the uptrend line since mid december suggests the panic driven repositioning is over on the other hand if we re right about a possible equity bounce gold is likely to fall the next uptrend line dived for the seventh straight session dropping 16 3 in total it was the worst week for commodity since the financial crisis black gold is now closer to 40 than to 50 as last week wti is reaching a staunch support line in place since 2016 will it endure sending

as coronavirus panic intensifies around the globe the list of countries touched by the virus has climbed to nearly 60 more than 86 000 people have been infected and over 2 900 have died what is next for the markets the gold price was almost unchanged last week after a roller coaster ride during the fastest ever correction on wall street that left the dow jones down 12 per cent gold ended the week at 1 586 dh5 825 an ounce exactly the same amount as it started the previous friday but last monday the yellow metal surged to 1 665 its biggest leap in price in more than a decade before returning safely back to earth mainly in late trading on friday us treasury bonds worked much better as a hedge against the collapsing stock market 10 year treasury yields fell 25 points to below 1 2 per cent for the first time ever stoking up bond prices that move in the opposite direction to yields that said holding gold last week was one of the very few safe havens in a nasty storm this saw the dow jones make a historic record points loss for a single day on thursday other gold related investments did not fare as well silver was off over 10 per cent shares in gold and silver producers were dragged down along with the rest of the stock market bitcoin and the dollar fell bullion holders must be wondering whether their luck can last or is it time to sell probably not friday s wall street sell off looked like the end of this correction with shares first plunging deeply at the open with losses of over 1 000 points but then attracting late bargain hunters to close a more modest 357 points down how will investors viewing their battered portfolios this weekend take the news to some extent this will hinge on how the us coronavirus scare pans out the first us death was confirmed in the state of washington at the weekend a man in his fifties who had underlying health conditions but who hadn t travelled to any affected areas there are now 24 cases of infected people in the us excluding 47 others with the virus who had been repatriated from wuhan or from the diamond princess cruise ship the main problem for us stock markets is not the virus induced panic but massive overvaluation and a possible socialist candidate for president the parabolic recent price moves in stocks like apple can only ever end badly and these stocks do have a lot more room to come down yet the us federal reserve is bound to respond with interest rate reductions and extraordinary monetary policy before last week one rate cut was expected later this year that has now trebled to three cuts with the first in march almost certain quantitative easing and other monetary tricks will also be back on the agenda public spending to counter an economic downturn with actual production down might well prove inflationary for example hong kong gave all its residents 1 200 to spend last week nevertheless this should all help share prices to stabilise and this is a us presidential election year such policies will definitely be a great support for precious metals albeit prices will likely be very volatile think how gold prices trebled and silver prices moved up five fold from the sell off in 2008 to the highs of 2011 that happened in the wake of the last global economic bailout by the fed and china will it really be any different this time if you want to diversify into gold the easiest way to do it is to buy a suitable gold backed exchange traded fund like gld bar or sgol this is a lot simpler than lugging gold bars around solves the security problem and offers instant liquidity be more careful about rushing to invest in the shares of gold producers as like last week they get dumped as the stock market falls gold share etfs like gdx and gxdj also closed sharply lower wait for the stock market sell off to show clear signs of reaching a bottom this could take three to six months but gold prices will likely carry on upwards regardless my prediction for the highest gold price is on us presidential election day as for silver etfs there is the ishares silver trust slv last week s losses in silver left the ratio of gold to silver at a near record 95 by comparison to the long term average of 55 that sets silver up for massive outperformance against gold in the near future when it comes this will likely be right out of the blue so stocking up on silver now and riding with its notorious volatility should pay off handsomely gold and silver are still on a path that leads to much higher prices peter cooper has been writing about gulf finance for two decades
stocks sank again friday after another wild day on wall street extending a rout that handed the market its worst week since october 2008 at the height of the financial crisis the market clawed back much of its intraday losses in the last 15 minutes of trading as some buyers emerged keeping the indexes from another steep plunge the dow jones industrial average swung back from an early slide of more than 1 000 points to close around 350 points lower the s p 500 fell 0 8 per cent while the nasdaq reversed an early decline to finish flat the market s losses moderated somewhat after the united states federal reserve released a statement saying it stood ready to help the economy if needed investors increasingly expect the fed to cut rates at its next policy meeting in mid march global financial markets have been rattled by the virus outbreak that has been shutting down industrial centers emptying shops and severely crimping travel all over the world more companies are warning investors that their finances will take a hit because of disruptions to supply chains and sales governments are taking increasingly drastic measures as they scramble to contain the virus headlines delivered to your inbox sign up for the gleaner s morning and evening newsletters the rout has knocked every major index into what market watchers call a correction or a fall of 10 per cent or more from a peak the last time that occurred was in late 2018 as a tariff war with china was escalating market watchers have said for months that stocks were overpriced and long overdue for another pullback bond prices soared again as investors sought safety and became more pessimistic about the economy s prospects that pushed yields to more record lows the yield on the 10 year treasury note fell sharply to 1 14 per cent from 1 30 per cent late thursday that s a record low according to tradeweb that yield is a benchmark for home mortgages and many other kinds of loans crude oil prices sank 4 9 per cent over worries that global travel and shipping will be severely crimped and hurt demand for energy the price of benchmark us crude has now fallen 15 per cent this week all this says to us is that there are still a lot of worries in the market said gene goldman chief investment officer at cetera financial group we need the fed to come out and say basically guys we got your back traders have been growing more certain that the federal reserve will be forced to cut interest rates to protect the economy and soon goldman said the fed s current lack of action amounts to a tightening of rates compared with other nations and their actions to offset the impact of the coronavirus investors now widely expect the fed to cut interest rates by a half point at its meeting that winds up march 18 according to data from cme the expectations for a half point cut jumped from 47 per cent just before the fed s statement was released to 100 per cent shortly thereafter eye popping damage the damage from a week of almost relentless selling was eye popping the dow fell 3 583 points or 12 4 per cent microsoft and apple the two most valuable companies in the s p 500 lost a combined us 300 billion in a sign of the severity of the concern about the possible economic blow the price of oil sank 16 per cent the latest losses have wiped out the s p 500 s gains going back to october the benchmark index is still up 6 1 per cent over the past 12 months not including dividends the sell off follows months of uncertainty about the spread of the virus which hit china in december and shut down large swathes of that nation by january china is still the hardest hit country and has most of the 83 000 cases worldwide and related deaths uncertainty turned into fear as the virus started jumping to places outside of the epicentre and dashed hopes for containment fear is a stronger emotion than hope said ann miletti head of active equity at wells fargo asset management this is what we re seeing today and this week and over the past seven days airlines have suffered some of the worst hits as flight routes are cancelled along with travel plans big names like apple and budweiser brewer ab inbev are part of a growing list of companies expecting financial pain from the virus dell and athletic wear company columbia sportswear are the latest companies expecting an impact to their bottom lines cruises hit hard cruise operators have also been hard hit with shares sinking 30 per cent or more as shipboard infections rose but those companies were having a far better day friday with some on wall street believing that the sell off was overdone shares of royal caribbean cruises rose 4 4 per cent while norwegian cruise line holdings gained 7 3 per cent carnival s shares climbed 5 1 per cent a big concern investors have is that the stock market rout could have a psychological effect on consumers making them reluctant to spend money and go to crowded places like stores restaurants and movie theatres the late 2018 stock market plunge for instance derailed holiday sales that year now analysts are worried that the latest stock swoon could cause consumer spending which makes up some 70 per cent of the economy and has played a huge role in keeping the us expansion going to contract again craig johnson president of customer growth partners a consumer consultancy says he had expected annual retail sales to be up 4 1 per cent but he now says it could increase just 2 2 per cent if the impact of the new virus in china persists beyond april this is a moving target right now he said there is a lot of uncertainty many companies face the prospect of crimped financial results with their stocks already trading at high levels relative to their earnings before the virus worries

it looks more and more likely that the novel form of coronavirus will do meaningful economic damage to the united states stock and bond prices already suggest that the outbreak could halt the longest expansion on record and even send the nation into recession the risks loom larger because this particular crisis is ill suited to the usual tools the government has to stabilize the economy if a recession happens it will probably be a result of this poor fit between the economic effects of the potential pandemic and the mechanisms the government uses to try to keep the economy growing interest rate cuts by the federal reserve which appeared more likely friday after a late afternoon statement by its chairman jerome powell can lower borrowing costs and raise stock prices but they can t replace the goods made by factories closed to keep their workers from getting sick with covid 19 the serious respiratory illness the virus causes the government can try to pump more money into people s pockets directly such as with tax rebates but money alone won t put goods on empty store shelves beyond the natural limitations of policy to cushion the damage there is the economic and political backdrop of the current moment a fed with little room to cut already low interest rates and a congress divided along partisan lines while a president seeks reelection if a potential coronavirus downturn were a fire the recession fighters would be like a fire brigade low on supplies fighting among themselves and probably lacking the right chemicals to quench the flames anyway i m looking at the combination of fiscal and monetary policy as potential triage said joseph brusuelas chief economist at the accounting firm rsm all they can do is really mitigate the shock of supply chains and reduce the second order effects a recession defined as a significant decline in economic activity lasting more than a few months hasn t occurred in the united states in more than 10 years if one happens it will mean higher unemployment and lower incomes and it would be a different kind of downturn from most of the recent ones the core of the economic problem emerging from coronavirus is a supply shock meaning a reduction in the economy s capacity to make things companies in china that have shut down because their workers are quarantined are not making goods that could eventually mean shortages of certain items for which there are few sources elsewhere in the world multinational companies typically operate complex supply chains with lean inventories and essential merchandise that often arrives just in the nick of time that means u s companies that rely heavily on chinese suppliers might begin facing shortages of key goods in the weeks ahead said nada sanders professor of supply chain management at northeastern university i believe we re going to have a massive shortage of goods she said two weeks ago i told people this was coming the big problem was economists don t understand how global supply chains work how intertwined and interconnected they are it is an issue she said would particularly affect pharmaceuticals and electronics macroeconomic policies can t really do anything about supply shocks like those but it s possible that supply shocks can bleed into demand shocks and there economic policy can help tara sinclair who studies business cycles at george washington university compares it to a grocery store a store with no goods on the shelves has a supply problem while a store with full shelves but no customers has a demand problem and it is generally easier to boost short term demand than short term supply but supply problems can bleed into demand problems and vice versa if first the store is empty of products and then people don t go to the store anymore and they lose their jobs they can t buy anything sinclair said that s what we re risking here in parts of italy for example where outbreaks of the virus have disrupted daily life tourism is slowing and restaurants and stores are reportedly empty as people seek to avoid exposure that could result in waiters and store clerks who endure a drop in income which could in turn feed back into less demand for all sorts of products and a weaker economy similarly businesses might go bankrupt if the financial markets freeze up and they cannot get access to credit meaning otherwise sound businesses end up laying off employees or closing down the role for economic policy in that sense wouldn t be to solve the supply shock but to try to prevent that initial supply shock from triggering a demand shock so for example the government could offer widespread tax breaks or direct payments to unemployed workers the fed with interest rate cuts can help ensure financing keeps flowing those actions might in turn give consumers and businesses the space to figure out how to operate despite the problems they face but this is not the only challenge if coronavirus were to spread widely in the united states and officials decided to impose widespread quarantines the economic impact is hard for economists to model what happens to a service economy if people can t safely travel go shopping or even go to work the answer is no one really knows the closest comparison may be the aftermath of the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks when air travel was temporarily suspended but that didn t keep the vast majority of americans from going to work and in those more dire scenarios it s anybody s guess how things might shake out there are a lot of reasons to think we don t have a lot of tools for this sinclair said it s more of a supply side issue and we can t do a whole lot to stimulate supply and if it does trickle over into demand it will be a real test of whether the fed has any firepower left and whether we have appetite for the kind of fiscal stimulus that s actually impactful in other words it would be best if the public health efforts to contain the spread of the virus are effective enough that we don t have to ask very much of the economic firefighters

chemical and oil tanker tina theresa right sits docked near shipping cranes at the port of hamburg in hamburg germany on wednesday feb 12 2020 germany s biggest bank has given the strongest warning yet that the nation is close to a recession as the coronavirus outbreak exacerbates its long running industrial slump photographer krisztian bocsi bloomberg via getty images from stocks to bonds and currencies the coronavirus outbreak is rocking all corners of financial markets for oil producers the pain has been particularly acute with demand dissipating oil has plunged into a bear market putting pressure on opec to step in and attempt to stabilize prices but as the coronavirus continues to spread around the world can the cartel really play the savior that s the question this week as opec members and allied producers gather in vienna for meetings on thursday and friday the backdrop brent crude futures the global benchmark finished friday at 50 52 per barrel down 13 6 for the week us oil was trading at 44 76 a 16 2 weekly decline prices haven t been that low since late 2018 why opec needs to act the economies of some opec members are reliant on crude production and the coronavirus has sharply reduced demand for products such as gasoline and jet fuel to keep prices from dropping further opec may turn to what has become its preferred strategy in recent years coordinated production cuts the financial times has reported that saudi arabia is pushing for a cut in production of 1 million barrels per day much more than first expected the kingdom would shoulder the brunt of the reduction while kuwait the united arab emirates and russia would split the rest according to the ft russia is not a member of opec but it has coordinated production levels with the cartel in recent years giovanni staunovo an analyst at ubs thinks that may not be enough to alter oil s trajectory in the near term i m not sure this sufficient to change the negative market sentiment he told me what is cheap can get cheaper bright spot staunovo points out that oil prices aren t sustainable for long at their current level within six months and a year lower business investment across a struggling industry will restrict supply helping to prop up prices he said plus bargain crude will eventually stimulate demand oswald clint an analyst at bernstein agrees that prices will need to push higher before long he thinks that an opec cut of 1 million barrels per day would be sufficiently supportive especially given falling oil production in countries like norway that predated the coronavirus outbreak but both staunovo and clint agree that oil markets need a bailout from opec and soon stocks just had a brutal week the next one may not be easier global stocks have fallen for seven trading sessions in a row lodging their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis and putting investors on edge as the novel coronavirus continues to spread outside china what s happening

and territories the dow finished the week down 12 4 while the s p 500 slid 11 5 us stocks recovered some losses in the late hours of trading on friday after federal reserve chairman jerome powell put out a rare statement the fundamentals of the us economy remain strong he said while acknowledging that the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity the central bank powell said will act as appropriate to support the economy to investors the message was loud and clear expect the fed to cut interest rates when it meets in march according to cme group s fedwatch tool 100 of investors now predict a rate cut in march with nearly 95 forecasting that the fed will lower rates by a decisive 50 basis points will that reassurance be enough to help markets stabilize this week it s hard to say after years of persistently low interest rates investors are worried that central banks lack sufficient ammunition to stave off a crisis an interest rate cut in this environment will arguably do little to affect real economic activity morgan stanley economist ellen zentner told clients friday and the market remains driven by news of how the outbreak is moving around the world as well as how it s hitting businesses and economies on saturday china said that factory activity in february hit the weakest level on record and the first person died from the coronavirus in the united states

marco della cava cassie dickman usa today network stockton calif after losing a steady job two years ago zohna everett struggled to make ends meet she drove for ride hailing services clipped grocery coupons turned in recyclables for gas money and traded manicures for press on nails from walmart then a phone call changed her financial outlook everett learned she had been selected to become one of 125 stockton residents receiving 500 a month for 18 months a first in the nation pilot test of a universal basic income or ubi everything in me was like yes says everett 48 i needed this right on time eight years ago this central california agricultural town known for producing almonds and grapes became the nation s largest municipality to enter bankruptcy now stockton is in the news for a project that seeks to lift up low income residents with a ubi an oft resurrected economic idea thrust into the national limelight by the recently shuttered presidential campaign of andrew yang the idea of free money grabs headlines and stirs debate while extra cash each month no doubt is a boon to the dozens of stocktonians in the program economists researchers politicians and labor leaders are mixed about whether this small and privately funded experiment will provide major proof points in support of a truly national ubi which by some estimates would cost taxpayers upwards of 3 trillion supporters are resolute that a financial assist to those living at the poverty line allows recipients to gain control of their financial lives improves their mental and physical health and gets them focused on investing in their own futures overall the results of a ubi are quite encouraging says ioana marinescu assistant professor of public policy at the university of pennsylvania s school of social policy and practice and the author of 2017 s no strings attached the behavioral effects of u s unconditional cash transfer programs marinescu has researched similar programs where taxpayers get money from the government unrelated to employment such as the alaska permanent fund which since 1976 has socked away some 64 billion in oil production revenue that is used each year for dividend payments to residents in 2019 631 000 alaskans each received 1 606 we found that ubi increases health and education outcomes among the poor says marinescu it does not increase spending on drugs and alcohol and one study showed a decrease in drug use and crime critics of a universal basic income however worry that free money would erode the value of work as well as jeopardize existing social safety net programs on which many living at or below the poverty line rely others stress it s difficult to predict whether a national ubi program would work for a nation as large and politically divided as the united states i expect stockton s ubi experiment to be positive says jesse rothstein co director of the opportunity lab at the university of california berkeley which examines the causes and impact of poverty but you can t answer the really big questions until you implement it on a large scale for a long time mayor everyone can use a little help the stockton economic empowerment demonstration or seed began in february 2019 and will conclude in july it has a 3 million budget for both the financial payments and resulting research with 2 million coming from donations from foundations and individuals and 1 million from the san francisco based economic security project which supports economic efforts to battle poverty natalie foster co founder of the economic security project along with early facebook employee chris hughes says whether it s seeing people leave behind a side job or not driving another five hours that day for lyft or being with their families more that sense of well being 500 can give them is very profound stockton s 29 year old mayor michael tubbs grew up here in poverty watching as his mother worked long days and rarely had time off a lot of people are struggling in our national economy not just single mothers says tubbs the city s first african american mayor there are teachers cops firefighters social workers people with a lot of credit card debit or student loan debt or rising housing costs and everyone could use a little bit of help most of the randomly selected participants are women 70 and the overall group breaks down as 47 white 28 african american 11 asian 2 american indian 2 pacific islander and 10 other roughly 43 have full or part time jobs 20 are disabled or not working 11 are caretakers and 11 are looking for work when asked by researchers what they have been using the 500 on each month recipients report that 40 of the money was spent on food 25 on merchandise and 12 on utilities according to a report seed officials released last fall people are covering their basic needs and using the money in a way that makes sense for their families says stacia martin west who helps lead stockton s seed research team she says she isn t surprised grocery runs make up half of the spending food is the one thing you can control it expands or shrinks based on the amount of resources stockton has known hard times the city of stockton sits in the heart of the san joaquin valley in central california a massive river delta flows from the san francisco bay about 70 miles inland to stockton giving rise to the port of stockton a racially diverse city just 19 of its 300 000 plus residents identify as white with the rest reporting largely as hispanic and black according to the census stockton has gold rush roots but in recent years has fallen on hard times crime poverty and illiteracy have been persistent issues in 2009 and 2011 forbes magazine named stockton one of the country s most miserable cities in 2012 poor city leadership unsound financial decisions soaring unemployment rates and a crippling housing crisis created by the 2008 great recession resulted in the city declaring bankruptcy at the time it was the largest city in the u s to do so since exiting bankruptcy in 2015 the city has improved its lot and was even cited in 2018 as a model of fiscal responsibility by the california policy center but its citizens still need help today 66 000 of stockton s 300 000 residents live below the poverty line that 22 representing about twice the national average the poverty line is 12 000 for an individual and 24 000 for a family of four stockton may be starting something local leaders in newark new jersey milwaukee and chicago currently are mulling over their own ubi pilot programs and tubbs says he s heard from state senators in washington and massachusetts as well as city supervisors in san francisco who are interested in copying the program with the income inequality gap in the u s growing the need among the poor is dire according to a report on economic well being put out last year by the federal reserve 27 of americans would need to sell something or borrow money if they suddenly had to raise 400 for the city of stockton which has had its ups and downs for us to now be at the center of a global conversation about what capitalism and the economy look like in the 21st century it s very special says tubbs it s unclear what sort of long term benefits the program will provide for participants or for the city stockton researchers are monitoring the effects on not just a family s financial standing but also its emotional well being seed researcher martin west does anticipate one hypothesis will be proven correct when the ubi experiment concludes that the 500 will reduce the amount of stress and anxiety in the brain and body from the fluctuation of an unstable financial situation the money provides a floor for people to rest their feet on can free money empower families for stockton resident tomas vargas 36 getting 500 extra each month has changed his attitude on life it s all a far cry from 2012 when 13 of his friends were killed in a period when stockton was plagued by homicides vargas is married with two children under his roof an 8 year old girl and a 6 year old boy another child died while still another lives with his parents one of the things he managed to do with the ubi grant was spring for tutors for them his daughter wants to be an astronaut and his son is good at math it freed me up and gave me just another gust of wind says vargas who recently landed a new job at the local airport he remembers what it was like growing up poor often he wouldn t even have dinner school lunches and sometimes breakfasts were his only meals as an adult he still can t go down the hamburger helper aisle of the grocery store without getting queasy because he ate the boxed meal so much as a kid when his family was low on money these days vargas feels more free psychologically if nothing else he stops in on his mother more often and sometimes lingers to tease her cat and his new job pays around 40 000 a sum that promises to provide him with enough to help his young kids achieve their potential some people need encouragement and it s rare to see somebody just give somebody something he says as an economic concept ubi has deep if controversial roots in american politics figures as politically disparate as richard nixon and martin luther king jr talked about different versions of a ubi program conservative thinkers often argue that a ubi should replace costly social safety net programs while liberals insist such a payment must supplement those critical services more recently ubi has been touted in talks by the likes of tesla founder elon musk and facebook founder mark zuckerberg who see it as a hedge against tech fueled job displacement democratic hopeful yang took particular aim at tech companies while on the campaign trail saying they benefit the most from today s economy and with a coming age of artificial intelligence robots taking over jobs deserved to pay into a ubi sukhi samra seed s director says she is buoyed by some signs that leading politicians are trying to address the nation s growing income inequality gap even if it isn t by talking specifically about a national ubi for example she points to california gov gavin newsom s expansion of the earned income tax credit which refunds money to low income earners a reform that many economists say is the simplest way to put more money into the pockets of those struggling on the margins samra also cites national efforts to put more money in low income people s pockets such as sen kamala harris lift the middle class act and rep rashida tlaib s boost act each of which would provide 6 000 a year to middle and working class families through a tax credit it s all about trusting and empowering folks says samra success for us looks like moving the policy conversation to one where we re recognizing that everyone deserves an income floor and that the economy just isn t working in its current form for a lot of people critics say americans should earn their money not everyone agrees many politicians have argued that welfare programs hinder people from bettering themselves president donald trump has repeatedly slashed benefits programs since taking office including an announcement in december that some 700 000 unemployed people would be losing access to food assistance this year administration officials have argued that people should only be eligible if they have found some kind of employment even some labor officials have concerns about ubi s implications steve smith spokesman for the california labor federation says jobs are indeed in danger because of massive leaps in automation but he says giving people say 1 000 a month to compensate for this impending shift is a trojan horse trotted out by the tech community instead americans need better jobs and pay he says this is their plan to essentially keep pitchforks from coming out when they start to automate jobs on a massive scale says smith whose organization represents 2 million members across 1 200 unions under this scheme inequality would be exacerbated smith says unions such as his want a federal jobs guarantee such as the one put forth by democratic candidate bernie sanders under the vermont senator s plan citizens would be guaranteed a stable job that pays a living wage with some 20 million jobs to be created in a proposed green new deal and still more in healthcare and early childhood education for many americans the notion of free money in a country known for pull yourself up by your bootstraps capitalism is far from an easy sell a 2019 gallup poll found that only 43 of americans supported a ubi as a means to hedge against automation related job losses many critics of ubi tend to raise the same issues beyond the big one where would the money for a multi trillion dollar national program come from there s the issue of putting the value of work in jeopardy while some ubi researchers repeatedly stress that ubi type programs and pilots suggest a regular small check does not discourage recipients from getting jobs others remain skeptical we have something in place that cuts your taxes so as to help bring you up to a level where you re doing ok and it makes sense to use tools that encourage work rather than just hand out money because that s welfare and that didn t work says peter cove author of poor no more and founder of america works which helps those living on the margins find employment in stockton four time city councilman and tubbs critic ralph white has reservations about his hometown s ubi experiment in part because he feels the money which was randomly distributed isn t going to the truly needy seed recipients all met the criteria of living in neighborhoods where the median income is 46 000 a year but white says some residents make as little as 1 000 or less a month and those people are the ones who need 500 white also is bothered about the lack of details released to date about the 125 beneficiaries and wants to know things such as whether they live alone or with an extended family precisely how much they make each year what their bills amount to each month and how many children they have i m against what i don t fully understand says white universal basic income gives some new hope for everett stockton s ubi program felt literally heaven sent the 500 has allowed her to fill the tank not only of her own car regularly but also that of her husband s the money also goes to everyday expenses such as her mobile phone plan home internet bill and doctor co payments when her husband who has worked as a contract based based truck driver isn t employed gets sick or just needs a break the couple now has extra cash to fill the gap i know it s god there s no way around it all these people in this city she says everett still collects recyclables for extra income and looks to save money however she can as they do for other participants those ubi funds each month offer her a safety valve from life s sudden financial pinch points it s those little pieces being put together it s less arguments in the marriage she says it s you know all of that things are looking up for everett she recently heard that her temporary job at tesla s automotive plant will become permanent perfect timing as the seed program heads into its final stages when she s not building upscale electric cars everett says she plans to take online courses to earn a bachelor s degree in accounting by 2024 she wants to become a certified public accountant she jokes that maybe tesla founder musk might need her one day if there s one misperception about a universal basic income that everett would like to correct it s the notion that the money is a license to relax if anything she says it is merely a lifeline out of poverty that empowers her to stay positive people say it s extra money but it s not extra money she says it s money that you need now marco della cava marcodellacava is a

the president of the republic nana addo dankwa akufo addo has called for the removal of the africa risk premium from the credit rating structure for african countries seeking finance on the international capital market delivering a speech at chatham house on thursday 27th february on the theme financing for sustainable development of africa president akufo addo noted that the global development finance architecture created almost four score years ago by multilateral and development finance institutions is not fit for the scale of work needed to transform the continent into an africa beyond aid with the african development bank intimating that africa s infrastructure requirements amount to between 130 to 170 billion united states dollars a year the president explained that nearly half of the funds required to fill this financing gap can be found on the continent if we can prevent which we must their outflow according to president akufo addo our level of development means that multilateral and development finance institutions will automatically disqualify lower income countries from accessing concessional long term finance ghana with a gni per capita of some 1 970 no longer enjoys ida financing countries that do not enjoy ida financing have to go to the capital markets for more expensive financing he said he continued on the capital markets credit rating agencies and lenders add an african risk premium which makes it expensive to raise sustainable and competitive long term capital to support transformation meanwhile africa offers the highest return on foreign direct investments in the world the president told the gathering that the time has come for us in africa to take the lead in generating for herself the additional funds needed to advance as the continent is well resourced in natural and human resources africa president akufo addo said must build robust institutions to protect herself strengthen the capacity of her geological services to determine exactly what and how much resources the continent has and establish legal departments in governments that will ensure african countries get their due in contracts that they sign in the process we can draw on the expertise of private practitioners we must strengthen our tax authorities to counter tax avoidance practices such as base erosion and profit shifting by multinationals in other words we must entrench the rule of law the plethora of unbalanced contracts with their pernicious effects has to cease if we are to realise our vision of rapid socio economic development he added whilst striving for increased domestic revenue mobilisation and leveraging on technology to strengthen the performance of revenue institutions the president stressed that we must also be mindful how the revenues are spent and accounted for the institution of transparent budget and expenditure management systems that allocate resources wisely to agreed national priorities and that ably monitor their implementation is therefore of the utmost importance africa president akufo addo said must invest in education and emphasise the importance of exposing african youth to technical and vocational education and training tvet because that is where the skills needed for the modern economy can be developed we have to maintain stable macroeconomic environments in the context of growing economies in order to attract private sector investment and move away from the raw material producing and exporting economies of the past our economies should be based on value addition and industrial activities i e on things we make and grow he said he continued that is the best way we can take advantage of the african continental free trade area whose secretariat is located in ghana a potential game changer in our quest to moving africa to a situation beyond aid a large part of the growth and prosperity that we seek on the continent will come from us trading more among ourselves to the gathering made up of policy makers academicians economists president akufo addo stated that the time has also come for the removal of the africa risk premium from the credit rating structure for african economies additionally with the co operation of all the president was confident that africa can successfully stem the 50billion illicit flow of capital as a start the oecd s new initiative that would require multinationals to pay tax in countries where they have commercial not jurisdictional presence is a welcome one the acid test of our friendship with countries which are the hosts of these multinational corporations should be the extent to which they oblige them to comply with this new initiative we must be vocal in defence of our objectives he added dailyguidenetwork

new york as stocks around the world tumble on worries about a fast spreading virus investors have been clamouring for the superheroes of the financial world to ride to the rescue once again yet this time there are doubts can central banks really fix this crisis as they have so many others as much as anything the federal reserve and its counterparts around the world have helped drive up stocks over the past decade with their interest rate cuts stimulus programs and promises of support through the 2008 financial crisis the 2011 european debt crisis and intermittent worries about a looming recession actions by central banks have helped place a floor under stock prices and one result was the longest u s bull market on record now with the standard poor s 500 stock index having just plunged 12 8 in barely more than a week the dizziest such fall since the 2008 financial crisis many investors are calling for the fed to swoop in yet again with rate cuts and perhaps other stimulative actions we need the fed to come out and say basically guys we got your back said gene goldman chief investment officer at cetera financial group traders are pricing in a 100 certainty that the fed will cut interest rates at its next meeting on march 18 a month ago those traders had seen less than an 8 likelihood according to cme group the fed is being called into action bofa global research economists wrote in a report friday they expect the fed to cut short term interest rates by half a percentage point at its next meeting and possibly even before then that would be the steepest rate cut since the financial crisis was still at full bore in 2008 the hope and expectation that the fed can provide the ultimate backstop for stock prices isn t surprising given its recent history of serving just that role its abrupt reversal from having raised rates four times in 2018 to cutting them three times in 2019 helped launch the s p 500 into one of its most dazzling years in decades a 31 5 return but this crisis is distinct from most others and some investors say the tools at the fed s disposal aren t ideally suited to address the economic damage from a viral outbreak verging on a global pandemic that reality has set the market up for a series of potential disappointments one is that the fed won t yield to expectations for a rate cut perhaps so as not to appear unduly beholden to investor demands the fed s dual mandate as an institution is to maximize employment and keep prices stable not to serve wall street it s dangerous when the expectation is 100 that we re going to get a cut said ann miletti head of active equity at wells fargo asset management when expectations get disjointed from reality that gets problematic that risk might have been lessened after the central bank put out a statement friday that pledged to use our tools to support the economy a sign that fed officials may indeed decide to cut rates soon yet what if they do lower rates can lead people and businesses to borrow and spend which can boost economic activity but they can t make sick people healthy reopen factories whose workers are kept home because of quarantines or restart supply chains in areas of the world struck by the outbreak from an optics perspective maybe a rate cut makes a difference in psychology for investors said debbie cunningham chief investment officer of global liquidity markets at federated hermes i don t think on a quantitative basis it makes a hill of beans difference the virus is squeezing sales and profits for many companies large and small around the world sharp drops in tourism have hurt shopkeepers from bangkok to venice to seoul economists worry that if covid 19 breaks out as a global pandemic panicky consumers would avoid shopping malls and restaurants while businesses would close as workers stay home many companies would delay hiring expanding and investing collectively those trends could tip the u s and global economies into recession the fed would face such a downturn with interest rates already low its benchmark short term rate is in a range of 1 50 to 1 75 down from 2 25 2 50 in late 2018 and from 5 25 before the great recession that means the fed would have less ammunition in the form of rate cuts even if lower borrowing rates were the right prescription for this crisis other central banks have even less monetary firepower after having already cut their benchmark rates below zero ultimately some investors say the markets will be able to recover only after the virus has been contained regardless of what the fed does in the interim melda mergen deputy global head of equities at columbia threadneedle investments said she is optimistic that the market s sell off will let up soon still she suggested investors are likely monitoring the number of new infections outside china if that number were to accelerate stock prices will likely head further down regardless of what the fed does maybe it helps the market on a short term basis because people say ok the fed is reacting and we need them to do that said miletti of wells fargo asset management they re important but they can t solve all the problems one potential source of support for the market is the federal government in the form of spending programs on infrastructure or a new tax cut yet given that capitol hill is essentially paralyzed by partisan gridlock in an election year few expect anything to get done anytime soon that leaves the central banks stock prices rise and fall with how much profits companies make along with how much investors are willing to pay for each 1 of those earnings when the fed cuts rates it can encourage investors to pay higher prices than they otherwise would for stocks because bonds become less attractive as rival investments but by several measures stocks are still trading at above average prices relative to their earnings even after last week s plunge still some investors who are hopeful for a robust market recovery if the virus can be contained soon note that the u s economy has been relatively healthy corporate profits are still near record highs even if they aren t growing quickly anymore the unemployment rate is low and economists have been expecting a pickup in growth as trade tensions diminished all of that is why some analysts say that even if the coronavirus tips the economy into recession they expect a relatively quick rebound most acknowledge though that it s particularly hard to forecast how the economy and any response from the fed will unfold this is something that s very unprecedented both globally and in the u s said kathy bostjancic chief financial economist at oxford economics ___ rugaber contributed from washington ap business writer damian j troise in new york also contributed to this report stan choe and christopher rugaber the associated press
it looks more and more likely that the novel form of coronavirus will do meaningful economic damage to the united states stock and bond prices already suggest that the outbreak could halt the longest expansion on record and even send the nation into recession the risks loom larger because this particular crisis is ill suited to the usual tools the government has to stabilize the economy if a recession happens it will probably be a result of this poor fit between the economic effects of the potential pandemic and the mechanisms the government uses to try to keep the economy growing interest rate cuts by the federal reserve which appeared more likely friday after a late afternoon statement by its chairman jerome powell can lower borrowing costs and raise stock prices but they can t replace the goods made by factories closed to keep their workers from getting sick with covid 19 the serious respiratory illness the virus causes the government can try to pump more money into people s pockets directly such as with tax rebates but money alone won t put goods on empty store shelves if a potential coronavirus downturn were a fire the recession fighters would be like a fire brigade low on supplies fighting among themselves and probably lacking the right chemicals to quench the flames anyway i m looking at the combination of fiscal and monetary policy as potential triage said joseph brusuelas chief economist at the accounting firm rsm all they can do is really mitigate the shock of supply chains and reduce the second order effects a recession defined as a significant decline in economic activity lasting more than a few months hasn t occurred in the united states in more than 10 years if one happens it will mean higher unemployment and lower incomes and it would be a different kind of downturn from most of the recent ones the core of the economic problem emerging from coronavirus is a supply shock meaning a reduction in the economy s capacity to make things companies in china that have shut down because their workers are quarantined are not making goods that could eventually mean shortages of certain items for which there are few sources elsewhere in the world multinational companies typically operate complex supply chains with lean inventories and essential merchandise that often arrives just in the nick of time that means u s companies that rely heavily on chinese suppliers might begin facing shortages of key goods in the weeks ahead said nada sanders professor of supply chain management at northeastern university i believe we re going to have a massive shortage of goods she said two weeks ago i told people this was coming the big problem was economists don t understand how global supply chains work how intertwined and interconnected they are it is an issue she said would particularly affect pharmaceuticals and electronics macroeconomic policies can t really do anything about supply shocks like those but it s possible that supply shocks can bleed into demand shocks and there economic policy can help tara sinclair who studies business cycles at george washington university compares it to a grocery store a store with no goods on the shelves has a supply problem while a store with full shelves but no customers has a demand problem and it is generally easier to boost short term demand than short term supply but supply problems can bleed into demand problems and vice versa if first the store is empty of products and then people don t go to the store anymore and they lose their jobs they can t buy anything sinclair said that s what we re risking here in parts of italy for example where outbreaks of the virus have disrupted daily life tourism is slowing and restaurants and stores are reportedly empty as people seek to avoid exposure that could result in waiters and store clerks who endure a drop in income which could in turn feed back into less demand for all sorts of products and a weaker economy similarly businesses might go bankrupt if the financial markets freeze up and they cannot get access to credit meaning otherwise sound businesses end up laying off employees or closing down the role for economic policy in that sense wouldn t be to solve the supply shock but to try to prevent that initial supply shock from triggering a demand shock so for example the government could offer widespread tax breaks or direct payments to unemployed workers the fed with interest rate cuts can help ensure financing keeps flowing those actions might in turn give consumers and businesses the space to figure out how to operate despite the problems they face but this is not the only challenge if coronavirus were to spread widely in the united states and officials decided to impose widespread quarantines the economic impact is hard for economists to model what happens to a service economy if people can t safely travel go shopping or even go to work the answer is no one really knows the closest comparison may be the aftermath of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks when air travel was temporarily suspended but that didn t keep the vast majority of americans from going to work and in those more dire scenarios it s anybody s guess how things might shake out there are a lot of reasons to think we don t have a lot of tools for this sinclair said it s more of a supply side issue and we can t do a whole lot to stimulate supply and if it does trickle over into demand it will be a real test of whether the fed has any firepower left and whether we have appetite for the kind of fiscal stimulus that s actually impactful in other words it would be best if the public health efforts to contain the spread of the virus are effective enough that we don t have to ask very much of the economic firefighters neil irwin c 2020 the new york times company
dr ayhan kose director of prospects group world bank usa pics salim matramkot the peninsula by satish kanady i the peninsula doha the outbreak of coronavirus rapid debt accumulation and sharper than expected slowdown in emerging economies are posing major risks for 2020 global growth according to two top economists just last year we had elevated concerns that the global economy was heading for recession not least as a result of the us china trade war and even as those concerns have eased somewhat we now have the shock of the coronavirus outbreak which is having a range of serious economic impacts adrian cooper ceo oxford economics uk told the peninsula speaking on the sidelines of the just concluded doha islamic finance conference cooper said the world economy is observing the continuing so called japanisation of economies with slow growth sustained below target inflation very low or even negative interest rates and high levels of public and private sector debt this is leading to extended levels of risk taking by investors in the search for yield resulting in stretched asset price valuations and deteriorating credit quality and while we haven t yet seen major market corrections in this cycle there is need for increasingly vigilance the longer the period of very low interest rates lasts he said cooper said that the oxford economics in its study released in january 2020 prior to the outbreak of coronavirus had placed just a 15 percent probability on global financial crisis for 2020 now the spread of the epidemic has the potential actually to lead to a much more slowdown in economic growth we don t yet know how exactly it can turn out but if china can contain the large number of cases effectively and other economies are able to check the smaller numbers then clearly the global recession could be avoided but if this becomes a global phenomenon we could be in a situation where actually the global economy will see no growth in 2020 addressing the conference dr ayhan kose director of prospects group at world bank usa said rapid accumulation of debt especially in emerging markets ems is posing great challenge to global growth possibility of financial crisis is higher when debt accumulates at a faster rate given the historical averages dr ayhan said private debt is higher than government debt which aggravates the situation with global economy going through a rough period there is a need for comprehensive country specific policies world must make sure public health systems are ready for any potential epidemic outbreaks there is a need for rebuilding buffers and improve debt management and transparency fostering technology and adoption of and innovation is key for a sustained future growth on emerging markets debt growth cooper told the peninsula there is an important distinction to be drawn between the rise in debt in emerging market economies and the debt level in advanced economy there are number of emerging market economies which are following a debt reliant model of growth they take a lot of debt and then actually they certainly can t repeat the same model of growth the next ten years those debt levels may be a weight on certain emerging market that prevent them in growing in the future as in the past in contrast in advanced economies there are lot of ways to being cautious with regard to debt in advanced economies there are enough room to borrow more invest more and help to stimulate their economies further in terms of debt management the situation is clearly different in gcc compared to other emerging market economies given the resource this region has a number of economies in this region who are looking to transform to diversify their economies can actually take more debts in order to achieve that transformation as long as that is done in a careful way with an clear evaluation of the quality of the projects in which they are investing and the way in which those projects are actually run so that they are delivering value from money gcc has enough room for more debt to finance economic growth cooper said
washington democratic presidential candidates have seized on president trump s response to the spreading global coronavirus outbreak and the growing threat it poses to america s record long economic expansion to attack the president on what has been his greatest strength with voters the economy until last week the candidates had largely attacked mr trump s economic management on inequality grounds at a time when growth has been steady and unemployment has sunk to a half century low but they have begun to attack his stewardship more directly after fears over the effects of the virus dealt stock markets their worst week since 2008 and forced federal reserve officials to reassure investors that they were considering interest rate cuts to combat a potential growth slowdown two candidates in desperate need of delegates on super tuesday senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts and former mayor michael r bloomberg of new york revamped their stump speeches in recent days to aggressively attack mr trump s handling of the issue and portray themselves as the type of president the united states needs to endure a potential economic and public health crisis mr trump has played down the virus insisting several times last week that it might not spread any further in the united states and the economic threats from it and he has lashed out at democrats saying they were the ones spooking investors
only 12 months after the official launch of president xi jinping s personal master plan for an integrated economic powerhouse of nine chinese cities combined with hong kong and macau the greater bay area gba project appears to be dead in the water since last february when beijing published the outline development plan odp for what is officially called the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area there has been no shortage of corporate leaders lining up to heap superlatives upon the project greater bay area photo govhk however some admit to reservations in private and the combination of the us china trade war prolonged social unrest in hong kong and the deadly coronavirus risk sinking the project as a viable economic entity there are many in hong kong who think that the gba is looking increasingly like an unpopular political manifesto masquerading as a business plan the gba is just a horrible concept for me says carmen li ka man due to graduate from hong kong s shue yan university this summer who has been involved in the pro democracy protests both as a participant and as an intern reporter for a local news agency she says despite the economic problems in hong kong she will not be looking to cities in the gba for employment or further education opportunities if you go to the gba you will not have a bright future she says i just don t trust the government the legal system or the policies in the gba cities media reports of a survey published in january by the hong kong guangdong youth association indicate these views are by no means exceptional more than 70 per cent of the young people in hong kong interviewed held that the city should keep its distance from mainland china and almost 60 per cent said the gba plan would bring more harm than good to hong kong cities like shenzhen may be modern and affluent and maybe i can get a good job but it only takes one new policy from beijing and i could lose everything overnight li says carmen li ka man photo stuart heaver hkfp asked if her friends feel the same way li just laughs none of my friends would ever go to mainland china to develop their career path the social movement over the last eight months has changed all that she says many local politicians concur after the social movement in the second half of last year our younger generation find it difficult to integrate into the living of gba says former lawmaker and democratic party treasurer sin chung kai sin thinks that the vast majority of young people will not pursue opportunities in the gba and while not totally against the project he questions the economic sense of hong kong being assimilated into guangdong province some outside the pro democracy camp have also questioned the speed of integration with other gba cities in january property tycoon adam kwok kai fai suggested to the guangdong chinese people s political consultative conference cppcc in guangzhou that the daily quota of people from mainland china relocating to hong kong should be halved to 75 to ease cross border tensions while the corporate business and real estate sector have the most to gain from the gba recent surveys suggest that even their enthusiasm is waning kpmg china hsbc and the hong kong general chamber of commerce hkgcc commissioned yougov to conduct a survey in july september 2019 of 747 business executives in mainland china hong kong and macau about the gba carrie lam photo govhk the headline findings were generally warm in that about half 52 per cent of surveyed executives plan to expand geographically into the gba by 2022 but fractures in confidence were also exposed according to the report survey respondents highlighted a number of challenges to realise growth and almost three quarters of executives 73 per cent cited policy or regulatory ambiguity uncertainty and unfamiliarity as the most significant risks to their gba business plans up from 68 per cent in 2018 it is a highly complex task to integrate three different economies with variant laws customs regulations tariffs business subsidy schemes environmental regulations immigration rules quality control accreditation and currencies experts say little progress is being made on the important details essential for the free movement of goods and people in one glowing official tribute to mark the one year anniversary chinese state media xinhua described how cities in the bay area have built increasingly close ties with each other and achieved much easier flows of talent goods and capital but this seems an extremely optimistic assessment i am not that optimistic maybe even pessimistic about the gba so far it s just piecemeal progress says dr collin wong associate dean external of the school of decision sciences at hang seng university of hong kong dr collin wong wong is an expert in trade logistics and supply chain management who generally supports the concept of the gba but thinks recent events have slowed down progress or even put it into reverse the gba is all about integration and cooperation within two sars and nine cities but the social unrest in hong kong raised issues of separation and isolation this won t help she says and thinks trust and confidence in government is a crucial challenge for the gba however her biggest concerns are about the poor execution of the gba vision the lack of a strategic plan and the failure to persuade citizens that it is of any tangible benefit to them central government really want this to succeed but i don t see at a working level the coordination required to make it feasible and viable she says adding there are four international airports and three of the world s top ten ports in the gba but currently they have no idea how they should collaborate she says her research indicates that key businesses and other stakeholders typically only hear about the latest initiative when it is released and there is a complete absence of transparency in policy making or consultation with key stakeholders and there is another perceived obstacle to the free movement of business expertise in the gba zone even before the current coronavirus health scare seasoned expatriate business people in hong kong were becoming more wary about travelling in mainland cities after a rash of detentions arrests and refusals of entry to foreign nationals in december two senior american officials at the hong kong american chamber of commerce were detained and refused entry to macau for no given reason despite the evidence of political resistance to the gba the failure to sell its benefits to ordinary citizens its inept implementation and the lack of trust in legal and political systems there are still experts who think it is unstoppable and corporate leaders who perceive it as an economic panacea in a tribute to mark the first anniversary of the gba xinhua reported kpmg china s hong kong partner maggie lee as saying the policies have created tangible benefits for hong kong businesses and residents the quote referred to efforts to reduce the tax burden for hong kong people working in the gba and to make it easier for them to educate their children and purchase homes there but unless the welfare and social systems compare favourably with those in hong kong and citizens have trust in the political system as a whole there remain insufficient rational reasons for people to relocate christer ljungwall is an economist with longstanding research experience in china and a senior country economist at the asian development bank who has studied the gba he maintains that the gba concept will not be damaged by trade friction with the us social unrest in hong kong or the more recent coronavirus health scare he says this is simply because the gba outline development plan odp is part of a long term structural transformation of the region cy leung matthew cheung and paul chan visited the daguang bay economic zone planning exhibition centre in jiangmen as part of the tour to the pearl river delta bay area in april 2017 file photo govhk mainland china would never allow that plan to derail perhaps slow down but never stop it is way too important he says the plan has already slowed to a virtual stop though and despite its importance to beijing looks in imminent danger of sinking without a trace at least with hong kong as a central part of it the energy and resources required to deal with the coronavirus public health crisis will mean the gba will slide further down the political agenda at least temporarily conferences may still be held familiarisation trips staged and glowing surveys published but sometimes the gba looks like the mythical emperor s new clothes as corporate leaders rush to heap praise on a conceit that does not really exist except in the mind of the emperor the lack of tangible progress does offer beijing the opportunity to review its approach and employ a more transparent consultative and engaging approach the flaws of politically driven top down authoritarian policy implementation were exposed in the early stages of the wuhan public health crisis the gba concept is still good to reduce internal competition and establish a long term dream but the execution has not been so good recent events may not have completely sunk the gba project but it might have temporarily left and a re think is required says wong

afford child care but if they take time out of the workforce both their family s short and long term financial stability are harmed by that choice it relieved a lot of stress for stocks washington s public preschool program has meant that she could keep the jobs she needed to make ends meet for her family and also have the time to earn the certifications she needed to improve her work prospects when her oldest child justina was born stocks was working at macy s and kay jewelers and was having trouble affording the 68 a week she owed for child care after receiving city subsidies for low income families stocks needed multiple forms of public transportation to get to the child care facility then to her two jobs and then back in time to get justina some days she d end up spending 20 she could ill afford on a taxi to get back in time things became easier when justina turned 3 and became eligible for the preschool program at her neighborhood school garfield elementary the school was easier to reach the cost of child care dropped justina still went at 6 a m before school started at 8 a m and stocks was happier with the quality of care it relieved a lot of stress off of me she said since then stocks earned a certification at university of the district of columbia community college that allowed her to qualify for a job at the u s postal service where she s able to earn a higher and steadier salary she said without free full time child care she couldn t have made that switch related finding a good preschool isn t easy try it washington s publicly funded full day preschool program was responsible for increasing the city s maternal labor force by 10 percentage points from 2008 to 2017 according to research published in 2018 by the center for american progress researchers determined that the bump in employment affected women at both the upper and the lower ends of the pay scale those in the middle already a highly employed group did not see much change teacher irene taguian leads a 4 year old preschool class at lafayette elementary school in washington d c lillian mongeau the hechinger report nationally the american female workforce is shrinking and the birth rate is slowing neither of which are good for the country s bottom line just 57 percent of women work now compared to a high of 60 percent in 1990 according to the u s bureau of labor statistics women have been having fewer children year over year for about the same amount of time even though many report wanting more than they have mary charles and her husband who have one child live in washington she is an information technology manager at a government office and he is a government contractor they are firmly middle income earners in their city and say paying for child care in the years before their daughter could start preschool was a big stretch it was 20 000 a year and that s considered not expensive charles said for us that was a significant part of our budget related who should pay for preschool for the middle class to make more money they rented out their basement which meant sharing their kitchen and charles husband worked as a dj on the weekends for extra cash they were not eligible for income based child care subsidies charles said the availability of public preschool which has exceeded her expectations for quality was a large part of their decision to stay in the city rather than moving to the otherwise cheaper suburbs i think it should be available more places charles said an expensive proposal but for now most children with working parents are not eligible for subsidized child care on any significant scale until the school year following their fifth birthday the federal funding that does exist about 22 2 billion is meant to help poor families cover child care costs but only 1 in 6 eligible families get the aid because there is not enough money for all of them and that figure does not take into account the many families who earn more than 85 percent of their state s median income and are therefore ineligible for federal help but are still unable to cover the cost of child care now that middle class moms are facing many of the same challenges low income moms have faced for decades unaffordable unavailable or unsatisfactory care for their children while they must work to put food on the table the needs of the two groups may be aligning in ways that could drive real change this issue has come to a head in the last couple years because families can t make ends meet with one full time worker said elise gould a senior economist at the economic policy institute a think tank people are beginning to realize that it s not their fault or an inability to manage their own finances that is making the cost of child care unaffordable for them both warren s and sanders plans would offer subsidized care to a broader swath of the public on a smaller scale so would the child care for working families act of 2019 sponsored by sen patty murray of washington and rep bobby scott of virginia both democrats the bill boasted 209 co sponsors in the house and the senate including warren sanders and klobuchar but has not made it out of committee all of these plans depend on the federal government spending significantly more money president donald trump has presided over one of the most significant increases to subsidized child care funding more than 3 billion since fiscal year 2017 and though republicans in general are supportive of expanding child care subsidies the bolder of the democratic plans from warren and sanders count on a new wealth tax that is unlikely to gain conservative support the economic policy institute report that calculated current federal spending at 22 billion per year estimated that a national early childhood system that compensated caretakers in line with k 12 teachers and served all children from infancy to age 5 would cost 337 billion to 495 billion a year warren s plan at an estimated cost of 1 07 trillion over the coming decade would cost less on an annual basis in part because higher income families would pay a sliding scale fee sanders has said his plan would cost 1 5 trillion over 10 years but he hasn t provided a detailed breakdown while most politicians have proposed incremental less expensive solutions the child care for working families act has been priced at 40 billion a year some experts say that more comprehensive plans are what s needed to not only change the reality for working families but also to provide a needed jolt to the national economy offering subsidies to only the poorest families saves the government money gould said but it doesn t get at the workforce issues for the providers or the parents increasingly no one is left out of the delicate balance of how to afford having kids ensure they are well cared for and work the hours necessary to make a living jamie smith is a lawyer by training but hasn t worked full time in law since her oldest now 13 was born

donard dwyer special to the times editor s note this opinion column was written before the recent stock market plunge reading the pages of the wall street journal or listening to cable business channels you would have the impression that the economy has never been stronger the dow and nasdaq reach record heights daily but let s take a closer look at the economy first some facts the gross domestic product gdp or size of the economy was 21 4 trillion in 2019 the budget deficit was 587 billion in 2016 president obama s last year it will rise to 1 1 trillion this year due to tax cuts for the greedy increased military spending and bribes to farmers hurt by president trump s moronic trade policies the increase in the deficit is 513 million which amounts to 2 4 of current gdp thus the economic growth rate last year was mainly attributable to deficit spending by trump and not to his economic policies any fool can juice the economy through deficit spending and we have nothing to show for it no new roads bridges or airports just as trump bankrupted many companies in the past he s now destroying our economy does this sound like a healthy economy to you record levels of corporate debt record levels of americans personal debt manufacturing that has stalled for several months significantly more people lacking health insurance the services sector index reached its lowest level since 2013 this month retail store closures are up dramatically in 2020 after suffering a terrible year in 2019 and nearly 12 million children are living below the poverty line the federal reserve pegged interest rate is currently 1 5 1 75 economists calculate the natural interest rate to be around 4 and it has fluctuated around that mark for most of the past 75 years the great recession of 2008 09 being the exception so if the economy is in such great shape why is this interest rate still so low when the fed tried to raise it back to normal levels the economy started to tank this is not a healthy sign the economy has been artificially propped up by easy money and tax cuts for greedy companies these companies continue to offshore jobs to cheaper labor markets and replace us by automation yet we re still not furious with those who cause our distress exploitative billionaires such as trump bezos gates malevolent ceos financial vultures and corrupt politicians from both parties instead we turn on each other while stuck in the same sinking boat fighting over the crumbs they give us meanwhile they relegate us to gig jobs and take away our pensions and healthcare benefits one thing working class democrats independents and republicans can agree on is this we re all working harder toward a more uncertain future the difference comes down to who you blame for economic insecurity working class republicans blame taxes and the poor because they have been hilariously brainwashed by their greedy masters democrats blame republicans in truth rapacious capitalism is the villain here when working class blacks and working class whites realize that they have more in common with each other desire to live in safe neighborhoods affordable healthcare good schools for their children etc than they do with the greedy then it will no longer be possible for malignant opportunists like trump to divide us on the basis of race the health of the economy is largely a mirage hyped up by business pundits what growth occurs does not provide benefits to all hardworking citizens millennials and younger feel the brunt of the insecurity and have trouble believing their economic futures are bright the economy is strong in words only
the federal reserve is now prepared to reduce interest rates this month even though it recognizes monetary policy cannot completely shelter a u s economy increasingly threatened by the coronavirus fed chairman jerome powell opened the door to a rate cut at the fed s march 17 18 meeting by issuing a rare statement friday pledging to act as appropriate to support the economy he was pushed into making that assurance by spectacular losses in u s stocks as investors turned fearful that the spreading virus would significantly damage the american and global economies traders and a string of wall street banks now expect the fed to lower rates in the coming months with some seeing the possibility of an emergency cut before the central bank s march meeting in doubt though is how much effect rate cuts will actually have amid a health emergency that threatens to reduce both supply and demand in the economy no matter what the fed does factories can t churn out goods if they can t get needed materials from abroad consumers are also unlikely to spend if scared to leave their homes but cheaper credit can still help drive an economic rebound and restore confidence once the virus is controlled and while it doesn t like to be depicted as racing to the rescue of markets the fed can limit the damage from tighter financial conditions on the economy monetary policy certainly can t meaningfully affect how the virus spreads former fed governor laurence meyer said but that doesn t mean you do nothing you still do what you can powell s intervention 90 minutes before the stock market s close on friday marked a sharp pivot from the previous message of policy makers that it was way too soon to judge the economic impact of the china borne epidemic it also called into question the fed s hopes that it could hold policy steady in 2020 after cutting rates three times last year stock rout driving the rethink was the worst week for u s stocks since the 2008 financial crisis they didn t want to have a continued free fall said peter hooper a former fed official who is now global head of economic research for deutsche bank ag they know that the one thing that monetary policy can do is to give risk assets a bit of a lift stock prices bounced up in the wake of the powell statement the s p 500 index ended 0 8 lower on friday rallying back in the final 15 minutes of trading from losses that topped 3 for the week the index lost 11 but in the wake of a series of worrying virus related headlines on saturday investors are on edge again hooper expects the fed to cut rates by a quarter percentage point in march and april his counterparts at bank of america corp predict a half point cut this month those at goldman sachs group inc see reductions totaling three quarters of a point through june the u s s first fatality from the coronavirus was a man in his 50s washington state health officials said on saturday president donald trump briefing reporters at the white house after the news renewed his public attacks on the central bank and said it was about time the fed acted like a leader and lowered rates if the market rout continues the bank of america economists said an emergency cut outside of the fed s normal schedule of meetings is also possible it s not done that since october 2008 in trying to figure out what to do policy makers are pondering the same imponderables that investors are their initial thought was that the contagion would be contained mostly to china and that the impact on the u s economy would be small and fleeting not if but when that assumption was thrown into question as the virus spread from china to the rest of the world with the centers for disease control and prevention saying it s not a question of if but when it affects the u s we re going to get infections here and there for quite a while said former international monetary fund chief economist olivier blanchard who is now with the peterson institute for international economics in washington the economic cost may be large in a report released on friday goldman sachs economists led by jan hatzius said they anticipate the virus will inflict a short lived global contraction on the world economy that stops short of an outright recession such concern will have mounted over the weekend with news saturday that chinese manufacturing activity contracted sharply in february with an official gauge hitting a record low supply shock blanchard questioned though how much good a fed rate cut would do in the face of what he called an unusual supply shock where factories are forced to curtail production because they can t get parts from abroad decreasing the policy rate by 25 basis points in that context doesn t feel quite useful blanchard said what s more important he said is ensuring that credit keeps flowing to small and medium sized companies that may face a liquidity squeeze due to supply chain disruptions from the virus fed officials seem alert to the importance of maintaining the supply of credit the first way i m going to think about this is whether or not lending behavior is adversely influenced chicago fed president charles evans said on feb 27 in laying out his thinking on the potential for looser monetary policy policy support with rates at a target range of 1 5 to 1 75 fed officials reckon that monetary policy is already accommodative and providing support to the economy some of the dangers the committee was worried about last year have also diminished with the signing of a phase one u s china trade and ebbing risks of the u k crashing out of the european union all things equal fed watchers says the central bank would probably prefer to stay on the sidelines during a u s election year
the day after the us midterm elections in 2018 paul krugman wrote in the new york times about the opposition between a real america representing urban diverse and educated in the house and a senate america mostly white rural and uneducated with this blunt remark krugman challenged the democratic nature of the the american legislative branch of government established by article 1 of the us constitution 200 years ago as the united states moves toward the 2020 presidential elections to be held in november the divide has only deepened this democratic deficit is nothing new but the deepening of the geographical racial gender educational divisions has made it more acute especially since the 2016 elections here here here or here regarding these divisions today s america is a lot like the america of 1920s after all the roaring 20s were also the tribal 20s the fear of a foreign and threatening other back then just like today rapid change in society was a prime reason for the tension the most critical change having to do with demography and ethnicity these changes bring back to the surface america s original sin a nation defined exclusively in terms of whiteness which explains why immigration is such a hot divisive issue today the fear of immigration focuses on hispanics in the 1920s it was centered on southern and eastern europeans in both cases it is fed by a rhetoric of fear of invasion of an external other who might threaten the very existence of the national community the bolsheviks and the anarchists in the 1920s let s not forget the first red scare or the palmer reds the gang member ms13 and the terrorist today either way immigrants are always depicted as criminals in the 1920s the italians were blamed for driving up the crime rate today it is the mexicans or central americans this type of rhetoric hits a raw nerve in homogeneous communities who are less exposed to diversity and more easily fantasise about it it is not without political consequences in 1924 the most restrictive immigration law the johnson reed act was signed by president hoover in 2018 the birthright citizenship guaranteed by the 14th amendment to the us constitution is being challenged by the president with the threat of an executive order more than economics immigration is the reason why the white working class vote shifted toward trump the rise of racist rhetoric similar to the 1920s but thankfully to a lesser degree this fear of immigration has fueled the rise of xenophobic racist and anti semite forms of expression the hundreds of white supremacists who protested in charlottesville in august 2017 and again in washington d c a year later have been the most visible ones even if they pale in comparison to the 50 000 ku klux klan demonstrator who paraded through the streets of washington in 1925 yesterday s kkk and today s white nationalists have something in common they both try to redefine what it means to be an american by using a rhetoric of exclusion while claiming ownership through patriotic symbols the 1920s were also characterised by the divide between modernists and traditionalists that presaged today s culture war the hot button issues like the prohibition evolution and sexual freedom are echoed in today s debates over gun rights climate change and the role of religion in society then as now these issues demonstrate a similar tension between a more conservative whiter and more patriarchal society on the one hand and the construction of a more open diverse and progressive society on the other so it is not surprising that in both eras the tension also centers on the role of women religion minorities and the role of science those divisions seem to be neatly divided along the traditional geographic fault lines separating the rural from the urban areas today as in the past certainly from an economic standpoint rapid change spurred by technological advances has had dire consequences on the more traditional sectors the farming and mining industries in the 1920s steel textile coal and manufacturing today a political decline the analogy with the 1920s also extends to politics for instance the 1928 elections just like the 2016 and 2018 elections were notable for the electoral divide between urban and rural areas also there are a number of similarities between president herbert hoover and president donald trump both have supported protectionist measures hoover raised tariffs on agricultural products the hawley smoot act despite the overall condemnation of economists and members of his own party while trump took similar measures on metal tariffs causing great consternation in his own party in the 1930s the trade war with europe that followed worsened the economic depression trump s immigration rhetoric carries echoes of hoover as well hoover promised american jobs for real americans as a result he implemented a program of repatriation of persons of mexican ancestry that resulted in the deportation of almost 2 million people many of whom were american born lastly trump and hoover were both outsiders who have been the only career businessmen ever elected to the presidency they governed alone by sweeping away past doctrines and shattering the ideological consensus for political scientists stephen skowronek hoover belongs to the category of presidents who signal the end of a political cycle it is the failure of their presidency that makes room for the coming of a new kind of presidents who can reconstruct a new cycle by establishing new ideological foundations hoover did fail to manage the aftermath of the economic crash in 1929 and he was followed by franklin delano roosevelt and 35 years of more or less consensus around new deal policies similarly president jimmy carter is remembered for his failed presidency he was succeeded by reagan and his conservative revolution that impacted his successors for the next 30 years according to stephen skowronek donald trump is one of these failed presidents a crisis to come some might object maybe rightfully that from an economic perspective trump s presidency is a success the united states has strong growth and low unemployment yet some believe we should prepare for economic disruption partly because of the prospects of a trade war others at j p morgan or in the business world see the looming of an economic crisis maybe even before the end of donald trump s term thomas piketty has shown that inequality has reached levels not seen since the late 1920s recently the economist warned that toxic politics and constrained central banks could make the next downturn hard to escape and the new york times sees a recession as a likely possibility some economists even believe the crisis has already begun and could be worse than 2008 if that is the case trump s inability to heed the advice of experts especially in a context of trade wars low interest rates and massive debt will likely leave him unable to properly respond president trump may also willingly or unwillingly create another crisis of his own constitutional military diplomatique or otherwise his subversion of democratic norms may have serious enough consequences to bring forth a new political regime this doom like scenario may not happen historical comparisons have their limits and history never repeats itself the same way today s american society is more diversified and open than in the 1920s the world is also more connected the only thing we can conclude for certain is that donald trump is more the symptom than the cause of the current political and societal tension here here here and here as barack obama also admitted leaders like trump emerge in a context of deep change and swift transition toward a world whose shape remains obscure jérôme viala gaudefroy assistant lecturer université paris nanterre université paris lumières this article is republished from the conversation under a creative commons license read

although donald trump might veto a bill passed by congress preventing him from launching a war with iran the u s already has the upper hand and trump has no need to use force on feb 13 the senate passed a resolution to prevent donald trump from recklessly attacking iran after the vote senate minority leader chuck schumer said a bipartisan majority of senators just sent a clear shot across the bow saying president trump cannot wage war without congress explicit approval last dec 27 an american military base in iraq was struck in an iranian attack causing the death of an american contractor in response trump ordered the assassination of iran s second in command gen qassem soleimani at iraq s baghdad airport via drone strike the u s iranian relationship is still tense however although the senate vote passed with a vote of 55 to 45 senate majority leader mitch mcconnell strongly opposed this resolution and because both houses lack the two thirds majority needed to override a veto it is still possible for trump to overturn the resolution congress remains concerned that trump could initiate war with iran despite congressional objections however an actuary minded businessman like trump isn t likely to recklessly start an unnecessary war as a matter of fact iran has been suffering under u s sanctions because of the nuclear issue its economy is facing a severe crisis and with already insufficient accumulation of resources by the government iran is facing its most trying time since the 1979 revolution before 2016 iran exported 2 5 million barrels of oil daily now that number is only about 200 000 barrels per day iran s economy has always depended heavily on oil in its annual national budget of 39 billion almost 25 billion comes from oil exports not only that but in the interest of dominating the middle east iran invests around 16 billion per year toward maintaining its political and military influence in the region in addition iran s total oil production has been reduced and in late november of last year the price of oil rose 50 affecting public oil consumption and leading to an outpouring of popular discontent according to the international monetary fund s estimate iran s economy may shrink 9 5 this year and inflation could exceed 35 now iran is faced with a difficult choice if it yields that means admitting defeat under u s sanctions and the regime will lose its dignity and legitimacy if iran chooses to be aggressive it s still powerless it will only make its financial situation even worse make the deadlock even harder to resolve and make things even more difficult down the road it appears that using economic sanctions to deplete iran s strength was the correct strategic choice for the u s at present time is on the united states side if the u s uses delaying tactics iran will surrender in the end however recently the u s media has been heatedly discussing certain tweets by trump in 2011 in which he criticized obama for starting a war with iran calling it a sign of weakness and saying it was only to gain reelection on jan 5 trump ordered the assassination of iran s second in command soleimani this was interpreted as a show of toughness to voters in his bid for reelection as well as a way to shift attention from the january impeachment proceedings in the senate but after the assassination the iranian public was furious and swore vengeance and there was concern that iran like a cornered dog would retaliate against the u s no matter how catastrophic the results would be if trump was forced to return fire then the u s would be drawn into a war with no end in sight and war is costly in 2001 and 2003 the u s was drawn into a war with afghanistan and iraq causing a substantial decline in america s national strength and indirectly causing the 2008 financial crisis which had lasting negative effects congress apprehensions are fair and reasonable however with that said trump took targeted action and didn t declare all out war which was a rational calculation trump is a calculating businessman he wouldn t fight a war with excessive costs moreover his campaign promise was to make america great again but since he took office and initiated tax cuts government spending has exceeded tax revenue the 2019 financial year budget deficit rose 26 to 984 billion the record high since 2012 trump can t be unconcerned by that in addition iran is in a tough spot due to economic sanctions after its second highest military leader was assassinated iran s authorities have raised funds from its people swearing retaliation however it is believed that on jan 8 before iran fired missiles at two u s military bases located within iraqi borders it notified iraq in advance the missiles were shot down and the u s military suffered no casualties iran s authorities were clearly showing restraint based on this we can see that the actuary minded trump shouldn t have any need to start a war with iran what s more his principal strategic axis is the indo pacific and his target is china he is unlikely to carelessly start a war with iran in a moment of frenzy turning a small problem into a very big one
sen bernie sanders s overwhelming success in the nevada caucuses makes him the prohibitive favorite for the democratic party nomination that sanders i vt is not even officially a member of the party and is an unapologetic democratic socialist seems to be less noteworthy with the passing of each news cycle considerable handwringing ensued and continues following the election of president trump in 2016 with respect to his norm breaking behavior specifically the often crass and overly direct manner in which he expresses himself has been characterized as demeaning the office of the presidency and that of our political culture more generally and opinion leaders mostly though not exclusively of the left have demanded that such behavior not be normalized of course what is deemed dignified mannerly or even normal is typically in the eye of the beholder and changes with the times readers of a certain age might recall how scandalous it was that president kennedy chose not to wear a top hat for the entirety of his inauguration in 1960 however odious trump s conduct might be to some the prospect of it being normalized in comparison to the risk of normalizing sanders s political ideals at the ballot box seems like pretty small beer much will be done in this election cycle to obfuscate that the sanders ascendancy represents a potential tectonic change in american society and to our economy both ends of the political spectrum are and or will be guilty of blurring the lines of how radical sanders s presidential campaign and its unabashed promotion of collectivist principles truly is today s democratic party along with much of the center left establishment is so infected with trump derangement syndrome that members will engage in whatever delusional ideological gymnastics are required to rationalize their support for a sanders candidacy just this past weekend economist paul krugman tweeted that a sanders administration would probably leave center left policy wonks like me out in the cold at least initially b ut this is no time for self indulgence and ego trips f reedom is on the line at the same time republicans over the years have so frequently cried wolf about creeping socialism in opposing democratic policies that now with the real wolf of socialism at the door such claims appear less credible or perhaps just less scary past political battles over the size of the federal government as a percentage of gdp the allocation of the federal tax burden and the composition of the welfare state whatever their partisan merits never were about socialism as right leaning partisans often alleged the u s has been what economists would call a mixed economy defined as one combining market forces with state intervention in the form of regulation macroeconomic policies and social welfare initiatives aimed at improving market outcomes since at least the time of the new deal while there undoubtedly has been an inexorable leftward trend in american public policy since the progressive era of the early 20th century this trend largely has been incremental in nature and has advanced in fits and starts with the exception of the new deal the new deal was implemented during the great depression and represented a step change in governmental involvement in the economy in response to what was believed to be an existential crisis in 1925 u s federal government spending as a share of gdp was less than 4 percent in 1955 by which time the distortions of world war ii related spending had abated it was 17 percent while there have been periods of consolidation and even slight rollback in federal spending since the new deal even as state and local spending were also rising there never has been a true reversal of the new deal s impact on the u s economy and it is the seminal event in the growth of government s place in american life normalizing socialism in the american political context with the sanders campaign as its vehicle risks shifting the overton window such that a further massive expansion of governmental intervention in the american economy becomes not only possible but acceptable sanders s platform calls for medicare for all embraces the green new deal offers tuition and debt free public college education and proposes wholesale student loan debt cancellation among other expansive and expensive policies some estimates suggest the cost of these policies could be as high as 100 trillion over the next 10 years on top of approximately 60 billion already expected to be spent at the federal level during this timeframe when added to state and local spending this would raise the total cost of government to roughly 70 percent of gdp compared to a share in the mid 30s today even the european social democracies that sanders lauds only spend in the range of 45 55 percent of gdp an intellectually dishonest media as mouthpieces for the democratic party may try to spin the sanders candidacy as the lesser of two evils but the degree to which his policies would transform our economy polity and society dwarfs the new deal great society and most certainly anything associated with president trump in both word and deed the aftermath of the passage of new deal programs illustrates why it is critical to not normalize socialism no serious attempts were made to overturn the new deal consensus following franklin roosevelt s presidency much less 50 or more years later under various conservative free market republican presidents once such policies are uncorked as it were they risk becoming irreversible the reasons for a newfound acceptance of socialism by the democratic primary electorate a narrow swath of the broader polity granted is an exegesis best left to another day but arguably much blame can be laid at the feet of a public educational system alongside advocacy journalism and a shallow popular culture which jointly champion collectivist ideals and actively seek to diminish entrepreneurship and business acumen work as a measure of self worth and wealth creation as a healthy consequence of self actualization such activities are at best seen as inconveniences to be tolerated in service of feeding the ravenous maw of an insatiable welfare state so let this political season do the work in refuting socialism that the civic institutions sitting at the commanding heights of our culture refuse to do it is a time for all people of good will conservatives libertarians centrists reagan democrats classical liberals small business people and freedom loving rationalists of all stripes to make not only an economic efficiency argument against socialism but a moral one as well the time for believing there is no need to make such arguments has passed and the battle is now upon us richard

managerial roles for firms including the blackstone group goldman sachs and perella weinberg partners among others
washington ap as global markets plunged amid growing fears about the coronavirus outbreak president donald trump and his allies pulled from a familiar playbook friday and blamed others for the slide it s a challenging sell for a president who has lashed his fate to wall street like no other the president s team responded to the biggest one week wall street sell off in more than a decade with a deflection strategy playing down the threat and eagerly parceling out responsibility to democrats the media and the entrenched government bureaucracy trump tweeted that the do nothing democrats had wasted time on impeachment and anything else they could do to make the republican party look bad while defending his own response which many democrats have deemed sluggish and scattershot at a political rally friday night in north charleston south carolina trump asserted that democratic complaints about his handling of the coronavirus threat are their new hoax echoing similar past complaints by the president about the russia investigation and his impeachment democratic presidential candidate joe biden called trump s language absolutely dangerous everything s about him biden said during a visit to a greenville south carolina polling site after it opened for saturday s democratic presidential primary i know he s a stable genius but it s ridiculous the thing s he s saying some of trump s closest allies amplified that message and accused the administration s perceived enemies of hyping the threat posed by the virus which has killed more than 2 800 people most of them in china where it originated the flu kills people said acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney speaking at the conservative political action conference an annual gathering for conservative activists this is not ebola it s not sars it s not mers it s not a death sentence it s not the same as the ebola crisis mulvaney went on to accuse the news media of giving short shrift to administration efforts to combat the virus namely barring entry by most foreign nationals who had recently visited china in favor of focusing on negative stories about trump why didn t you hear about it what was still going on four or five weeks ago impeachment that s all the press wanted to talk about mulvaney said the reason you re seeing so much attention to it today is that they think this is going to be the thing that brings down the president that s what this is all about the travel restrictions were widely covered in the news media donald trump jr embraced another unfounded conspiracy theory claiming without evidence that democrats were rooting for people to die for them to take a pandemic and seemingly hope it comes here and kills millions of people so they can end donald trump s streak of winning is a new level of sickness the president s eldest son said on fox and friends the comment drew an immediate rebuke from democrats including rep john garamendi of california who said trump jr should keep his distance after the totally outrageous comment because there would be a serious altercation the president has been consumed by the virus impact on wall street peppering aides with questions about the markets and supply chains according to three white house officials and republicans close to the west wing they spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations even as the white house has ricocheted from scandal to controversy to tempest over the past three years including the president s impeachment the nation s economy has hummed steadily along giving republicans reason to stick with the president and bolstering trump s reelection chances while trump remains confident in the economy citing low unemployment numbers and growth in the gdp he has told confidants that a recession or slowdown would be perilous to his presidency his reelection campaign has built much of its messaging around a strong economy and it fears becoming vulnerable to attacks on that front this week s relentless sell off has demonstrated how little authority trump holds over the stock market undermining his previous claims to voters in speeches and tweets that repeated gains reflected his leadership instead the trump administration s words and actions have inspired little confidence among investors who are grappling with the costs and disruptions of the actions needed to contain the virus that causes covid 19 investors have felt too afraid to hold out their hands and in the parlance of traders catch the falling knife that has been the u s stock market we re looking at a serious economic downturn because of coronavirus tweeted 2020 democratic candidate elizabeth warren and the trump administration is bungling every aspect of this crisis the dow jones industrial average has suffered a steep decline since monday and while it could certainly recover the risk is that lower stocks could ripple through the economy and hit consumer confidence and cause household spending to drop right as trump ramps up his reelection efforts this pullback could further hurt demand for manufactured goods consumer confidence may decline and consumers may postpone purchase of big ticket items like cars and appliances warned steve rick chief economist at cuna mutual group an insurer that provides financial services to credit unions and cooperatives trump s own white house briefing room appearance this week did little to reassure investors the administration tried to steady the markets again friday with reassuring words from larry kudlow a top trump economic adviser kudlow said he believed the markets had gone too far in their sell off and would soon bounce back i just don t think anybody ought to panic right now kudlow said we re going to stay the course on our policies tax cuts and deregulation and energy and trade and it s worked and the economy is sound there appeared to be little the white house could do to reverse the slide the president added fuel to the nation s economic growth with his 2017 tax cuts and the resulting deficit spending caused economic growth to accelerate in 2018 but growth slowed in 2019 and analysts expect further deceleration this year

britain has left the european union eu marking the first time that the eu which had only ever expanded before has shrunk it was a historic crossroads for the union britain bade farewell to the eu single market in which people capital goods and services can move freely across borders within the union unencumbered by import duties or other tariffs moves to integrate european countries began with a commitment to peace based on postwar reconciliation between germany and france the number of eu member countries which stood at just six at the time of its inauguration had risen to 28 the eu with a population of some 500 million was dubbed by some the first non imperial empire as mentioned by former european commission president jose manuel barroso three years and seven months have passed since britain which joined moves to integrate europe 47 years ago chose in a 2016 referendum to leave the eu one cannot help but wonder where britain will go after walking away from the european empire britain issued a commemorative 50 pence coin to mark brexit and on it is the phrase peace prosperity and friendship with all nations however the coin does not mention europe british people had kept asking themselves whether their country which is separated from continental europe such as france by the strait of dover is a part of a single europe britain joined the eu s predecessor in 1973 but stopped short of introducing the euro the union s single currency in the meantime the country has maintained special ties with the united states another anglo saxon nation following brexit london will likely have closer relations with washington the eu accounts for half of britain s trade and the british national institute of economic and social research estimates that the country will suffer some 70 billion pounds about 10 trillion yen in economic damage due to brexit britain will have to pay a high price for leaving the union the future distance between britain and the eu will depend on the transition period that will last until the end of 2020 unless britain signs a free trade agreement with the eu to replace the tariff union no deal brexit chaos awaits what is worrisome is that britain and eu are locking horns even before full scale talks on the issue get underway this coming spring british prime minister boris johnson confidently said brexit would re energize our great united kingdom and make the country the greatest place on earth by freeing itself from eu regulation the premier is looking to make britain competitive in the eu market however the eu is determined to block britain from cherry picking its freedom of access to the single market and also urged london to maintain the same environmental and food safety standards as those of the union a no deal chaotic withdrawal would adversely affect not only the eu but also the world economy both sides should do their best to maintain the relations that they have built up over time behind brexit are rising populism opposing rule by elites and calling for the expulsion of immigrants plus my country first sentiments people s dissatisfaction with the status quo gave rise to such trends in the brexit referendum voters dissatisfaction was targeted at the eu unelected eu bureaucrats have been criticized for many years for being undemocratic the eu s hasty moves to promote integration have raised concerns among british people that the country s sovereignty could be threatened another factor is that the solidarity of the eu has loosened in recent years the eu was split over its responses to the euro crisis triggered by greece s fiscal collapse and an influx of refugees mainly from the middle east and africa german chancellor angela merkel said in an interview with the financial times that brexit is a wake up call for the eu the britain less eu s diplomatic power and presence will certainly decline jean monnet the founding father of the eu said europe will be forged in crises and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises the eu should stop and reflect on its integration u s president donald trump who is promoting an america first policy is turning his back on international rules and acting selfishly shaking up the world order at the same time authoritarian china and russia are increasing their influence climate change the spread of infectious disease the threat posed by terror and other issues that cross borders cannot be solved by single countries international cooperation is more important now than ever what is important is the role played by middle powers including japan and europe which share the values of freedom and democracy in maintaining order and stability in a world where major powers are struggling for hegemony japan has maintained good relations with both the eu and britain trade in food and other items between japan and the eu has been expanding thanks to an economic partnership agreement that came into force a year ago britain is enthusiastic about participating in the trans pacific partnership free trade agreement tokyo should strengthen cooperation with both sides and play a key role in building a network of middle powers which will certainly help bridge the gap between britain and the eu
the country experienced increased cash inflow from kenyans living and working overseas after diaspora remittances increased to sh25 94 billion 259 40 million in january this is an improvement of 3 6 per cent from the sh25 billion 250 3 million that was sent in december last year according to the central bank of kenya cbk data the cumulative inflows in the 12 months to january 2020 increased to 2 811 million sh281 1 billion compared to 2 733 million sh273 30 billion in 2019 reflecting a growth of 2 8 per cent said cbk in its latest weekly bulletin north america europe and the rest of the world accounted for 48 per cent 17 per cent and 34 per cent respectively of the total remittances in january diaspora remittances have become critical pillars to the shilling at a time when the country s exports the country s main foreign exchange earner have underperformed nonetheless export earnings and diaspora remittances propped up the shilling against a spike in global oil prices and increased payment of interest to foreign investors exchange rate as a result kenya gained more foreign currency with the shilling s exchange rate against the dollar remaining steady at around 101 throughout 2019 the money workers send home to their families from abroad has also become a critical part of kenya s economy with president uhuru kenyatta taking note of this impact in his jamhuri day speech last year the president noted that diaspora remittances have since overtaken coffee and tea to become the country s main foreign exchange earner the inflows from kenyans living and working abroad surged to an all time high of 295 million sh30 30 billion in june 2019 before it reduced in the subsequent months the head of state attributed this improvement on the country s human capital which he noted had not only propelled the kenyan economy but also that of other nations our highly educated citizens are much sought after all over the globe to signify the changing fortunes of our homeland diaspora remittances grew by 10 9 per cent from sh266 19 billion to sh295 32 billion between june 2018 and june 2019 overtaking earnings from export of tea and coffee as the country s largest source of foreign exchange said the head of state however some experts have attributed the surge to the changes in the law this is because the record breaking remittance inflows coincided with the lapse of the june 30 deadline for the return of taxable money stashed outside the country the significant reading in june is an indicator that there might have been a rush to beat the deadline given by former national treasury cabinet secretary henry rotich in his 2018 19 budget statement on any taxable cash in foreign countries

end 28 years of mismanagement of the hadabima authority of sri lanka by political goons immediately at least now and restore professionalism to save this national project dr sudath gunasekara slas retired permanent secretary to prime minister sirimavo bandaranayaka this is a desperate plea made by me to all concerned as the man who started the sri lanka hadabima authority in 1991 to save the hadabima of sri lanka the geographical heartland of this country using the lessons learnt from my 5 years experience as the director of the then nadsa from 1986 to 1991 with the fivefold objectives of scientific 1 watershed management 2 settlement development 3 agricultural diversification and 4 ameliorating acute landlessness and chronic poverty among the kandyan peasants and 5 addressing the dragging and pestering indian estate tamil labour problem with lasting socio ethnic integration through a mixed settlement programme under the provisions of the nehru kotalawala agreement of 1954 i am making this open plea to president gothbhaya rajapaksa the prime minister and the minister of agriculture in particular to protect this important national project from unscrupulous and self centered opportunists job seekers who have no clue at all on its lofty objectives but are only concerned with making some money and enjoy the benefits of office for which i laid the foundation in 1991 after resurrecting it from demise with a 12 5 million aid package from the wfp none of the 15 chairmen who held office from its inception in 1978 and more so are the last 12 including the present chairman list attached knew the abcd of the project objectives or had any concern for the country or the people without which one is not qualified to head this important national project that holds the key to the survival of the entire life system and the civilization in this country therefore i appeal to the president to immediately appoint a professional as he has promised in his election manifesto who can understand the basic objectives of this project and carry them out to their logical conclusion with dedication and commitment to make the lofty objectives of this project a reality i am giving you here the story of the hadabima project as the man who conceived it in 1991 so that you will get a comprehensive idea about this all important development project and its objectives the origin of the hadabima authority of sri lanka the hadabima authority of sri lanka haritha danav bim sanvardhana madyama adhikariya was founded by me in 1991 to implement a major national development project within the three badly neglected provinces of central uva and sabaragamuwa covering the entire hilly areas within these three provinces consisting nearly 1 3 the area of the country and an approximate rural population of nearly six hundred thousand the project idea was an extension of the former nadsa national agricultural development and settlement authority concept started in 1978 to address three important objectives namely a watershed management b agricultural diversification and c settlement development that was set up to develop the area between 300 900 m ms of the hill country in the two districts of kandy and kegalla within the 4 electorates of gampola and nawalapitiya kandy and mawanella and yatiyantota kegalla which was in my opinion one of the best development projects if not the best ever conceived in the post independent era in this country however due to political and management blunders the then government was compelled to close it down by end of 1986 as a failed project after the world bank withdrew its funding component of 4 5 million us after black listing it hadabima development concept was first conceived by me in late 1986 after i was appointed to preside over the last rituals of nadsa by minnister gamani jayasuriya in april 1986 the new development plan was proposed by me in 1989 with a view to replicate the nadsa experience of a successful period of 3 years as a pilot project to address the above objectives i conceived within a broader national perspective to address the alarming deforestation soil erosion land degradation drying up of all the rivers in the entire central hill country and its fringe land around it and the acute landlessness prevailing particularly among the kandyan peasants focusing on the five major objectives namely a watershed conservation b settlement development c agricultural diversification d ameliorating acute landlessness among the kandyan peasants and e addressing the dragging indian estate tamil labour problem with lasting socio ethnic integration through a mixed settlement programme under the provisions of the nehru kotalawala agreement of 1954 a brief history of the nadsa now called hadabima project for those who do not know whether it is chicken or fish background for nadsa in the wake of the newly emerged worldwide development euphoria in the early 1970s based on environmental protection land reforms and equitable distribution of wealth and to achieve social justice advocated by people like gunnar myrdal in his classic asian drama and the thought provoking concept of appropriate technology enunciated by schumacher the father of that technology as an alternative for modern technology to face the challenges of sustainable development and the need for increased production to avoid worldwide hunger and the dangers of blanket application of modern technology to the so called third world countries the attention of the then government 1970 1977 was drawn to the following problems at home 1 serious soil erosion and land degradation in the hill country and silting of the islands rivers in the lowlands and recurrent floods in downstream areas due to large scale deforestation started by the british in 1830s and still continuing un arrested due to poor land management and inappropriate cultivation practices followed by an utterly ineffective and inefficient plantation sector 2 the problem of serious landlessness and poverty and social injustice particularly in the kandayn provinces due to loss of their ancestral land to the british and non implementation of the recommendations of the kandyan peasantry commission of 1951 and lack of income generating opportunities among the peasant population in the region 3 the crying need to diversify the plantation sector with a package of diversified crops like pepper cloves and coffee combined with other native home garden crops like coconut arica vegetable and fruits and animal husbandry to reduce dependency on few mono crops like tea and rubber and also to avoid the vagaries of recurrent price fluctuation in the world market to face balance of payment problems 4 the need to revisit the kandyan forest garden concept that is as good as the natural forest for environmental protection and to control soil erosion with an annual soil loss rate of 0 1mt ha year with a modified mixed farm version to generate more income than from a traditional kandyan forest gardens recent studies by guido kuchelmeister 1987 and mahaweli authority of sri lanka 1995 have found the kandyan forest garden model to be the best ecosystem for this type of hilly terrain as it possess both ecological and environmental characteristics that are ideal for such situations in a tropical country only second to the natural forests subsequently on a request by the government world bank carried out a comprehensive study on all these aspects and finally they produced 97 excellent research documents that remains a gold mine guideline for any development in this region of the country for a long time the first phase based on the findings of these studies the next unp government that came to power in 1977 set up the national agricultural diversification and settlement development authority nadsa in august 1978 to implement a pilot project in six selected river basins in the kandy gampola and nawalapitiya and kegalla mawanella and yatiyantota districts to be replicated in other hill country areas with similar problems after the trial period these projects were confined to the mid country 300 900m msl the new government started with a bang contributing 2 5m us as gosl component and the world bank providing 4 5m us the minister of agriculture e l senanayaka vested few lrc marginal and neglected tea and rubber lands from the two of kandy and kegalla and established the nadsa in august 1978 and as usual packed it with their political stooges who knew nothing next to the objectives of the project they had no proper plan of development either they also had no vision or a mission on the implementation of this project other than finding some lucrative employment for their supports the minister toured the area by helicopter with wb chairman kapila wimaladharma pathirana slas the general manager was the only professional attached to this project but before long the minister chased him out as he had refused to carry out some of the ministers mad orders and put one of his supporters in that place from kandy a retired kachcheri surveyor by the name wikramasuriya in no time the world bank got disgusted with mismanagement and poor project performance and decided to withdraw from the project with the 4 5 million grant they discarded and blacklisted it as a failed project subsequently on a report by ranjan wijeratna the then secretary to the ministry of agriculture who knew only about tea planting the government decided to close down the project in 1986 thus conceptually one of the best development projects ever conceived in the post independent era in this country finally the government decided to close it down by end of 1986 on his report thereafter productive estates and good bungalows were appropriated by politicians and sometimes even by the officials for example kelli estate with its bungalow was given to deputy minister agriculture imbulana part of ovel estate and its manager s bungalow in gampola to a relation of gamini disanayaka and wariyagala bungalow with few acres of tea was appropriated by the successor to kapila as director and part of the same state was given to the administrative officer of nadsa who was a son in law of a unp stalwart gunasena mudalali of matale meanwhile all the tea factories were given for a song to one karunaratna from colombo a close friend of jr who dismantled them and made a fortune of it immediately after i took over the project in aril 1986 i stopped all such nefarious activities and the assets were used for development within the project the second phase the second phase that opened a new lease of life to the nadsa project later named by me as hadabima project under my administration was set in motion from the date i took it over on april 2nd 1986 i took over a project that was to be closed down by end of the year in fact minister gamani jayasuriya sent me there to preside over the last rituals of nadsa until he takes me as his additional secretary on janu 1 1987 this appointment came at a time when i was getting ready to leave public service in disgust to take up a commonwealth assignment as an expert in handicrafts in new guinea as my appointment as government matale twice and kandy once had been blocked thrice and even as the registrar of peradeniya university in spite of the fact that i had come first at the interview by the then unp government on the day i met minister gamani jayasuriya in this backdrop in the company of mahanaayaka thero of asgiriya after going through my bio data he said he will take me immediately as his additional secretary and moreover there is no point in going to nadsa as it will be closed down by the end of the year had i accepted his offer i could have been the secretary ministry of agriculture in no time since by that time i had completed more than six years in class1 and 21 years in slas it also would have been a very big promotion in my carrier but since i opted to be in kandy for personal reasons till end of year he put me on this job on condition that i will come to the ministry of agriculture as his additional secretary in jan 1987 in spite of objections by the chief cp minister disanayaka for my appointment i assumed duties on 32nd of april 1985 on the directions of the minister in my attempt to get an idea about the project the first document was a comprehensive evaluation report of the project made by kapila the first director that gave me a bird s eye view of the project this was followed by few visits to the field in trying to understand the ground situation by meeting the people to see the actual situation and trying to understand the problems faced by the farmers i met the minister on monday the next and told him how i have understood the project by going through the reports and seeing things on ground on the landscape as a student of geography i told him that in my opinion nadsa is one of the best development concepts if not the best as i see that had ever been proposed in the post independent era in this country by any government and therefore it should never be closed down as long as this country exists on earth he looked at me sharply and said sudath all the other fellows say just the opposite of what you say either all of them are mad or you are mad he posed for a while and continued but having listened to you i too think there is lot of truth in what you say from next day i started my mission by my country and the neglected kandyan peasants with full drive determination and commitment to make this the best small farm development project in this country by the end of the year and to replicate it to all areas with identical problems within three years as a model agricultural settlement development programme in south east asia at least if not the whole world but there were serious limitations to achieving my goals such as 1 lack of adequate staff both in the office as well as in the field 2 lack of sufficient funds materials and equipment 3 an utterly depressed and demotivated set of settlers 4 and above all obstructions from the local politicians on personal grounds for example the office staff was limited to an administrative officer an accountant both retired from public service few clerks and 2 peons three drivers and two labourers in the field there were about 6 field officers to look after 15 settlements in two districts the rest had been discontinued pending the closure of the project in december 1986 the vehicle flight consisted of 1 hacked pajero jeep 3 rackety small daihatsu jeeps one box model mitsubishi lancer old car 2 old lorries all that escaped the hammer all development activities had come to a standstill by that time as such i realized giving a new lease of life to this project was an uphill task but considering the location of the project and its objectives i was determined to take up the challenge the next day i had a staff meeting and briefed them about the situation and my proposed future plans in the backdrop of my understanding and what the minister indicated to me for my proposal to resurrect the project and sought their support for my future plans the first step in this process was to motivate the staff and the settlers with new hopes and then to find sufficient funds to continue my first approach was the treasury but point blank it said no as the government has already taken a decision to close down by the year end as an alternative with my experience in problems of rural development as a dro i met the wfp country director mr hersy in colombo with a modest project proposal for 2 5 million us request but he said the wfp will never agree to reopen this project as it was a project rejected by the wb as a failed project already withdrawn and it was blacklisted i insisted saying that i will give a guarantee that i can resurrect the project since it is one of the best development concepts ever conceived in this country since independence he again said wfp will never agree to come back however as i insisted he finally agreed to take my proposal to rome the following week when he goes there saying just to try your luck to my surprise on his return he rang me up to congratulate me saying that rome has agreed to reopen the project under the new management as they were highly convinced on my reasoning and he wanted me to make it 5 million as he as the country director can recommend up to 5 million us in few seconds he rang me up again and said don t worry mr gunasekara i myself will adjust the figures and as from today onwards i will treat it as one of my own projects that is the way i was able to convince the wfp country director at that time subsequently i was invited to rome for a discussion on my request and i must record it here with gratitude the support given by mahinda katugaha the then procurement manager of the wfp in negotiating this aid package and accommodating me in his apartment for the two days i had to stay in rome in two months time came a project appraisal mission to appraise it along with another proposal for kotmale requested by minister gamini disanayaka i did my homework got an evaluative study done by prof j m gunadasa of the peradeniya university supporting my arguments on the economic viability in the project proposal i submitted it to the appraisal team i also got a 35 minute video film done where i wrote the script on the importance of the objectives of this project and its future potentials in nation building by dharmasena pathiraja a reputed cinema artist called haritha danavva green habitat to be shown to them on a script by me this film was later awarded a merit certificate at the international film festival held that year on eco film international festival held in ostrava praha checholovakia on environment in may 1991 by the time the appraisal team arrived i had got the settlers to clean up their farmsteads and roads on shramadana basis and also got them to start on a vigorous programme of development activities including planting putting up stone hedges for soil conservation and even giving a new outlook to their temporary huts meanwhile i also provided pipe born water services where ever possible for all these activities i gave them only 50 of the cost including material likes s lon pipes i organized the settlers in to groups of 25 families called pasvisi sabaha where they took all decisions and the officials playing the role of facilitators onl using the participatory management technique in developent incidentally one person did a study on the success story of this first highland farmer organization in sri lanka and got a phd from a usa university when the appraisal team came each member was given a docket with reading material along with a copy of the evaluative study followed by screening the video film haritha dannvva by this time i also got the board of directors reconstituted with the directors of the departments of agriculture minor export crops and the two government agents of kandy and kegalla with senior representatives from the ministry of agriculture and the treasury i also had an advisory body formed with eminent men like ray wijewardhana and dr waidyanatha of the university peradeniya who were experts on appropriate technology and planting and kapila the first general manager and director and also prof j m gunadasa who compiled the evaluative study the quality of my team composed of experts in agriculture settlement development and rural sociology and provincial administration impressed the appraisal team and they were convinced that i had a technically competent team to implement a project of this nature i also got my team to participate in field visits as facilitators to the appraisal team i got the farmers to welcome the visitors with traditional bulath hurulu and in some places even by putting up traditional pandoles with local materials which they procured from their own farms at the end of the three day field visit i hosted the appraisal team for lunch at the kegalla rest house while thanking them for visiting to appraise my project i told them that i am fully convinced that it is a herculean task to take this project uphill i also told them that when i think of the constrains b efore me and difficulties of taking it uphill it reminds me the famous dover mail story that comes in tales of two cities of charles dickens i also told them that there were two horses to pull the dover mail where as there is only one little horse here to pull the nadsa mail the two horses there had eight legs whereas this horse here has only two legs the mud on the dover hill was only natural whereas here it is not only natural but also political administrative financial and even psychological in which i am already buried to the neck however i told them i am determined to forge ahead uphill nonstop until i reach the top even if i don t get an ounce of american flour or a grain of rice or an ounce of sugar dhal or dry fish from wfp team leader arora got up and this is what he said in reply mr gunasekara this is my fifth visit to this project what i have seen this time is something entirely different from what i have seen in my all previous visits i do not know what magic you have done to make this change and the brimming enthusiasm and hearty laughs seen on the faces of the settlers you should not have any doubts about your goal you are already at the top of the nadsa hill and i declare on behalf of the whole team that last night we have unanimously decided to approve your project proposal and more over it is not 5 million as you have requested but double that amount at the end instead of 5 million for five years i requested they gave 12 5 million for six years after their second visit having seen my video film the miracle basket a short film made by me showing what a great change the food basket has brought about at the end of that year my project was hailed as the best small farm development project in asia funded by the wfp by end of 1991 the assets of the project went up by millions and the staff increased by hundreds as well as quality of service they did to the people the vehicle fleet rose up to about 50 including 6 tractors a mini bus to transport settles for training in different places and 48 motor cycles for field officers incidentally to everybody s surprise the request for wfp assistance for kotmale made by minister gamini disanayaka whose ministry got 40 of the national budget at that time and who was acclaimed as the yuva raja of the jrj government was rejected by the wfp in spite of the fact that it was heavily supported by the minister secretary of the mahaweli ministry and the chairman of the mahaweli authority who was also the chairman of the ruling unp the third phase encouraged by this success i moved on to the next step of my dream that is expanding the project to all the three provinces around the hill country central uva and sabaragamuwa under the new name sri lanka harita danau bim sanwardhana madyama adikariya sri lanka hadabima adikariya by gazette 687 15 of 91 nov 7 the three provinces together formed one physiographic unit and also correspond with the area covered by the kandyan peasantry commission report of 1951 i visualized this expansion with a holistic perspective of development within a broader geographical area covering the entire cp uva and the sabargamuwa provinces covering about 1 3 the area of this island with an approximate population of 600 000 with the three objectives of firstly to protect the central hill country the nation s mother watershed which i named as the the geographical heartland of sri lanka or bhuugoliya hadabima of sinhale to save the entire life system in this country from its extinction and secondly to rectify the historical injustices done to the kandyan peasants both by the colonial british and the politicians of the post independent period by addressing their acute problems like landlessness more fully identified by the kandyan peasantry commission report of 1951 thirdly to solve their economic problems with a diversified agricultural development programme fourthly to end the estate indian tamil problem in this country by opening up mixed sinhala tamil settlements in the project area on land between1000 3500 ft msl as a model of ethnic reconciliation in this country and finally to retain this land as the land of the sinhala nation as long as the sun and moon shall last on this planet president premadasa lauds the hadabima programme meanwhile president premadasa summoned me for a meeting at the presidential secretariat along with the minister deputy and the chairman at that meeting he asked me 3 questions a the present position of the project b what i propose to do next and c the assistance i need to implement the programme my answers to his 3 questions were preceded by a brief description of nadsa at the time of my taking over in april 1986 after listening to my briefing he asked me why are these gampola side people so angry with you probably referring to the regular objections by the chief minister cp dissanayaka thereafter he explained the importance of this project to those present as i had outlined in my concept paper i had given to him earlier on the geographical heartland of the country where he quoted my statement that as much as the beat of the heart decides the fate of the man similarly the physical stability of the central hill country decides the entire life system and the civilization in the entire island and finally he said gentlemen as sudath says this is a very good project and that is why i have decided to support it this was followed by another meeting in the ministry of agriculture at peradeniya presided over by him and attended by the prime minister minister of agriculture governors of the three provinces and all the mpp and the gaa of the new project area at that meeting after my briefing i requested 40 million for the expansion programme after consulting paskaralingam who was also present he okayed 40 million over the counter after i told him that i am planning to settle 250 000 families under the proposed new project area at completion in all three provinces covered by the kandyan peasantry commission he then said sudath i have given you all what you have asked for now i want you to start a very vigorous publicity programme all this happened within 6 years between april 1986 to july 1992 alarming bells for local politicians this rang up alarming bells for the politicians of the area of the ruling unp they immediately started their war against me perhaps fearing that i would be a political threat to them as they always thought i was a slfp man the chief minister dissanayaka cp rekindled his torch as he had been gunning at me from the day i was appointed as director of this project and soon the doom phase of the project began to raise its ugly head in no time i was taken by surprise when i found that i had been transferred to the pool with immediate effect within a week after the famous peradeniya meeting where the president gave me 40 million over the counter for the expansion i proposed without a blink this decision of premadasa not only put an end to the golden period of the hadabima project but it also drew the curtain over the beginning of the dawn of a new era of physical stability watershed management and a model settlement development programme for the haertland and a new chapter in socio economic prosperity meaningful social integration and human contention and political stability for the whole country but having realized perhaps his mistake within a month president premadasa appointed me as the state secretary to the ministry of health after i got him convinced of the dangers of a proposal before the cabinet for the amalgamation of the divisional secretariats and pradesiyasabha as the president of the slas held at the bmch in december 1992 on behalf of the general membership of the slas i wanted the president to withdraw the cabinet paper to be taken up next day proposing to amalgamate the dss and dcc and to appoint divisional gaa as secretaries to the pradesiya sabha chairmen he also agreed not to appoint anyone outside the slas as divisional gaa as it was proposed to appoint all island class 1 officers as divisional gaa by his government as i sat down on his left after my speech he turned towards me and said sudath my congratulations you made and excellent speech next day he appointed me as the state secretary to the ministry of health over the phone those slas officers who were there would remember how profusely he thanked me for pointing out the dangers of the proposal and he agreed to withdraw that death warrant on the slas i hope all will agree with me that if not for that timely intervention by me there would have been no slas thereafter in this country thanks to jolly somasundaram the architect of that cabinet paper that is a different story altogether the doomsday of hadabima dawned after july 1992 to revert to the original subject of hadabima story i will now give you how politicians again killed a golden hen that would have laid not only golden eggs but even diamond eggs for this nation and created a new chapter in scientific watershed management water resource development settlement development economic and socio cultural renaissance and finally brought about lasting political stability to this island nation by solving the canker that is the indian estate tamil problem forever in this country had my proposal been carried out to its logical conclusion the doom day of the hadabima project dawned after i left in july 1992 dharmadasa banda and wasantha udayaratna the duo played dr jekyll and hyde until d m jayaratna took over as the minister in 1994 d m jayaratna the then minister of agriculture appointed one of his close relations h m godamunna a grocery shop owner from gampola at the doluwa junction wef 1994 9 15 this political goon chairman functioned as the chairman for 6 long years up to 2002 12 31 meanwhile jayaratna got the president to appoint a one man presidential commission under g l m de silva on 1994 nov 7 to find fault with my period but to his dismay he found none on the contrary the commission chairman in his long report hailed the achievements during my period 1986 1992 which has gone down as the golden period of hadabima project and also as the only period during which the objectives of the project were addressed to and even surpassing the original objectives by opening vistas of new development both objectives and development approaches and finally converting it to an internationally acclaimed major small farmer development national project covering 1 3 of the island comprising three provinces central uva and ratnapura including 3 divisional secretaries divisions from ampare district as well by end of 1992 se g l m de silva report 1995 twenty eight years after i left it today sadly only the name hadabima i gave is left none of the objectives of the original fathers of either the nadsa as envisaged in early 1970s or that broad national vision i conceived and perceived in late 1980s on the enormous potentialities of this important project for nation building are active there now just like most other government projects it also has got reduced to another semi government institution that provides lucrative and remunerative political jobs to satisfy those who pretend to have helped the ruling party at elections to come to power all this is done at public expense with no contribution at all to national development the politicians who always put politics first without any concern for nation building in my opinion are mainly responsible for this tragedy no wonder the richest country next to japan in asia in 1948 has today fallen even below afghanistan when are we going to rescue this country from this political mess even after i left in 1992 this authority functioned under the ministry of agriculture up to 2016 but sadly again it went back to the pre 1986 situation and became a heaven for politicians and their unscrupulous henchmen to find employment and enjoy benefits although they had no clue of the basic objectives or the values of this all important national project they were only concerned in making a fast bug and reaping the harvest of what i had planted enjoying the benefits of their official positions like big salaries and remunerations official vehicles with drivers and petrol to attend to all their personal needs doing nothing for the project or the people who pay their salaries it was assigned to the ministry of regional development from 18th march 2016 that enabled minister fonseka s relation and henchman lalindra nagahtenna to function from colombo as chairman for whom fonseka created a new office in colombo as the head office of hadabima now it has been converted to an all island project by the gazette notification no 2026 45 published on 07th july 2017 this was done firstly to cover up financial misappropriation committed by its chairmen board members and even officials in travelling all over the island outside its area of authority between 1992 and 2017 because as we know you can t spend public funds for any work or travelling outside the area of its legitimate operation unless one has the approval of the secretary of the ministry concerned to travel or do any special business outside the area of its legitimate authority doesn t this display the scale of corruption and abuse of authority by all those who have handled this project ever since 1992 these haphazard changes clearly evince the inability to understand the basic objectives of the project for which it was established in 1978 as nadsa political objectives getting precedence over development and creating unproductive jobs for their men and providing more facilities like vehicles and enhanced travelling appear to have overtaken the development objectives of the project they also created a post of deputy chairman and allowed him to function from hambantota as he happened to be a person from that area that is how they have abused political power and misappropriated public funds and ruined this project over the past 28 years of the 15 chairmen from 1992 to date there wasn t a single professional man who knew the job and who had contributed a penny worth of service to the people or the country that has spent billions out of public funds of the post 1992 chairmen one was a grocery shop keeper another a vc chairman and all other political goons either family members of the ministers at the time or henchmen who carry firewood and water for them who made the hay while the sun shines one among them was a defeated politician a jvp man turned slfp who held the post of chairman for ten years enjoying the fruits of my labour and who had done nothing to take forward the vision and mission i introduced in 1991 gazette notification no 2026 45 published on 07th july 2017 enabling its functions to cover the whole island has brutally killed its original objectives designed to serve a specific geographical area and a specific purpose for very good reasons i have narrated this appalling and sad story to the country in order to bring this to the notice of the president and the prime minister and the general public so that they will take suitable measures at least now before it is completely ruined by unscrupulous political appointees for which the final responsibility will come on the president and the minister of agriculture in its long history from 1978 to date it had been run by 15 chairmen and more than 20 directors all the chairmen were political appointees with no qualification to old such responsible positions and in two occasions defeated at elections with no job i challenge any one to pick one chairman out of the whole lot who knew the abcd of this project or has planted a single manioc bush for all the privileges and benefits they have enjoyed as pin chairmen at enormous public costs during my whole period of 6 years from 2 4 1986 to july 17 1992 though there were two chairmen n v k k weragoda ministry secretary and wasantha udayaratna a defeated politician it was i who ran the show single handed with no contribution from them but the support of a very competent professional board of directors selected by me consisting of gaa heads of departments a senior treasury rep and another senior ministry rep and experts in relevant fields sans any political cogs and converted it to a world class small farmer development project in sri lanka recognized as the best among such in asia by the wfp in 1991 but to my great disappointment besides president premadasa and lalith atulatmudali none has recognized the contribution i made to this project up to date the degree of international recognition of my achievements was further marked with invitations to present two papers on the success story of nadsa in laos and bangkok in february 1991 and april in 1993 the only contribution rather the service the chairmen did during my 6 years was to sign the monthly board minutes other than that they only physically presided over the board meeting enjoyed the tea in addition to collecting their board payments salaries and other stipends of office regarding the directors i really do not know how they worked with these illiterate political goons but one thing i know very well is none of them have been able to at least maintain the levels to which i had brought this project apart from doing anything creative and beneficial to the settlers or the country i now understand the present government has appointed another political pick who has no understanding of the project it is strange that this was the man who was appointed as chairman for i year term 2004 205 by anura kumara disanayaka of the jvp however i must make it very clear here that i am not asking for a job by pointing out these blunders i am only requesting the president to rescind the 2017 gazette on hadabima and confine its activities to the project area defined by the 1991 gazette and appoint someone who can understand the abcd of this project in the process if the president cannot find a suitable person i am prepared to take over hadabima as it s head as the founding father of this wonderful project in the event the president wants my services i shall work without a salary with full commitment dedication and determination until i put it back on its wheels as i had dreamt in late 1980s within 2 or 3 years the most and i shall make it the best development project in this country and a model public enterprise by paving the way to realize the following objectives within five years after training a likeminded team of true public servants in the sphere of district and divisional administration within the project area with maximum public participation in development and make history in the development annals of post independent era of this country in people centered development for everyone to see as to how a public institution should be run under sinhala buddhist ethos and perception for the benefit of the many and for the happiness of the many 1 get all the land above 5000 ft declared as a strictly prohibited national forest reserve a thahanchi kele as it was done by our ancient kings 2 get the hadabima 1000 ft msl protected as the nations heart to guarantee that the life system and civilization in this country is not endangered and it will last as the sun and moon shall rise over this land 3 get 250 000 self sustained farmer families settled within the project area on 2 ½ acre model farm lots 4 obtain wfp food assistance for 6 years under the motto food for development to sustain these farm families as i did from 1991 1992 until they are on their own feet 5 draw up a programme to cover the entire hadamima with natural forest and agro forests kandyan forest gardens below 3500 ft to arrest soil erosion and land degradation endangering biodiversity and to make all streams perennial 6 once again restore the central hill country as the nation s biggest natural reservoir and the best hideout in the country and make all the 103 rivers starting on these hills perennial increase water flow in all the rivers and minimize flood and silting in downstream areas and make at least the major rivers like kelani up to yatiyantota rapids as it had been before 1815 and mahaweli and kalu ganga as in ancient times 7 make sri lanka self sufficient in hydro electricity minimizing dependency on thermal power and if possible make it a hydro power exporting country 8 make sri lanka a water exporting country in future as i have stated in my paper on vision and mission on water management in sri lanka in the island 17th monday 2018 9 rectify all the historical injustices done to over 600 000 kandyan peasants by the british and all governments since the so called independence in 1948 10 end the all important pestering indian tamil problem in the hill country by establishing sinhala tamil mixed settlement schemes below 3500 ft msl with the final goal of integrating all of them under the nehru kotalawala agreement of 1954 with the main stream as full citizens of this country and stop an indian tamil malayadu being formed on the nations geographical heartland 11 get a band of 1000 youth male and female organized to implement this programme voluntarily over a period of 6 years until its completion 12 persuade the government to enact laws to implement this programme effectively and severely punish those who violate them as the man who resurrected a once dead and buried project nadsa between 1986 1992 that was rejected discarded blacklisted and money withdrawn in early 1980s by the world bank and decided to close it down by end of 1986 for political and management failures i am deeply concerned and agitated by the present sad plight it has fallen in to after resurrecting it from its abysmal depths and scratches during a short period of 3 years i gave it a new lease of life even before the golden period of this project emerged between 1989 1992 with wfp assistance lalith atulathmudalai the then minister of agriculture on his first visit in dec 1991 to this project described it as the best small farm project in sri lanka at that time incidentally which he described as the best example in the whole world where the poor is made poorer just one month before that date at a heads of departments meeting held at the arti the wfp followed suit by naming it as the best small farm project in asia in 1992 having resurrected this dead project from its grave by awakening a set of utterly disappointed and dejected 35 000 farmers to a highly motivated group of farmers with new hopes i got 12 5 us million grant from the wfp and fed them three meals a day for six years that is 2 5 billion meals from 1991 1992 with the slogan food for development coupled with a vigorous development plan i uplifted the standard of living of these men and women amidst immense political obstruction from the ruling unp and got its area of authority expanded to cover the entire cp uva and the sabaragamuva provinces in 1992 in spite of the objections by the minister dharmadasa banda as the first man who pointed out the crucial dependence of the island s entire life system and its civilization on the physical stability of the central hill country as its geographical heartland and proposed a foolproof proposal to save the hadbima with the lessons learnt from large scale deforestation done by the british and subsequent destructions done by our own politician since the so called independence i am deeply grieved the way this project had been destroyed and vandalized by native politicians and their stooges from 1992 to date for political expediencies none of them had brain to understand the crucial role of the hadabima for the survival of a nation and the need to protect it for the next generation none of the chairmen under both unp and slfp regimes during this period 1992 2020 also had the capacity to understand the real value of this important project and none has done a penny worth thing to protect it all of them are either defeated politicians or political bats who change their party affiliations with every election and creep in to these positions just to collect the money they spend on candidates and rob these institutions they all have only enjoyed the benefits of office inherited from my perilous effort for six years beside mismanaging it and enjoying the benefits at public expense they have killed a hen laying golden eggs and also made it unmanageable and unrealistic by expanding its activities to areas outside its legal operational area of the three provinces set by the sri lanka hadabima authority act of 1991 which i got passed in spite of minister of agriculture dharmadasabanda objecting to it openly most of the chairmen with the exception of one or two have robbed and destroyed the project proving the famous sinhala saying uran kekeuna talapuwama hamban kukulanta magul this illegal expansion they did by gazette notification no 2026 45 published on 07th july 2017 firstly to cover up their gross financial misappropriations done for 25 years since 1992 to 2017 running about all over the country like hambantota in the extreme south and vavuniya in the north outside its legal area of operation and secondly to justify new recruitments loaded to the cadre for political favoritism one last appeal to the president in this appalling backdrop i earnestly appeal to the present president first to appoint a professional keeping with his election promises who can understand the lofty objectives of this project and who can carry them to their logical conclusion and secondly to appoint a presidential commission to inquire in to the misdeeds of all chairmen of this project from its inception in 1978 to date to at least learn a lesson if he does not want to punish the rogues as to how a public institution should be run profitably for the benefit of the nation and what type of people should be appointed to head them so that the findings could be used firstly to use it as a case study as to find out what really ails all public corporations and authorities in this country and why almost all of them have failed to fulfill the original purpose of creating them in order to reduce delays or circumvent bureaucratic barriers like arr and frr as the vocal politician envisaged when they were created in early 1960s secondly to find out as to how a public corporation institution could and should function to serve the people thirdly how could they be run profitably so that they want be a burden to the national economy and how could they be converted to be engines of growth finally why all these public corporations and statutory bodies have failed to fulfill their targets and what remedial measures the government must take to rectify these deficiencies and convert them to lay golden eggs i suggest this paper could be used as the first presentation at the opening session of the proposed presidential commission dr sudath gunasekara slas retired permanent secretary to prime minister sirimavo bandaranayaka president sri lanka administrative services association 1991 1994 and president mahanuwara sinhala bauddha jesta puravesiyange sanvidhanaya
