the millennial congresswoman and instagram sensation added to that list when she said modern monetary theory should be a larger part of the conversation in an interview with insider in january and democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders has an economic advisor who is an mmt proponent mmt is a significant departure from the traditional view of economics taught in most business schools here s an explanation of what mmt is and why people are so interested in it advertisement countries can create and spend their own money and that on its own is not a bad thing in traditional economics the notion of printing money to solve a country s problems is almost universally regarded as a bad idea yet mmt proposes that money creation ought to be a useful economic tool and that it does not automatically devalue the currency lead to inflation or economic chaos mmt argues that by insisting the government rein in its spending to balance its books we re hobbling ourselves with an underperforming economy and all the unemployment and lost opportunities that go along with that to understand where mmt is coming from it s useful to start with two recent occasions when chairmen of the us federal reserve admitted that the government can print all the money it needs and nothing bad happens central bankers almost never say things like this which is why the statements are so interesting advertisement alan greenspan theres nothing to prevent the federal government creating as much money as it wants in 2005 in testimony to the us house committee on the budget former fed chairman alan greenspan was asked by then us rep paul ryan about the solvency of the social security system which americans rely on for retirement payments many americans worry that social security will become insolvent before they retire greenspan told him i wouldn t say pay as you go benefits are insecure in the sense that there s nothing to prevent the federal government creating as much money as it wants in payment to somebody he went on to explain that the real problem is whether there will be enough resources or assets in existence to support all the purchases the extra cash would demand you can see a video of the exchange here c span advertisement ben bernanke its much more akin to printing money than it is to borrowing we need to do that because our economy is very weak then in 2009 former fed chair ben bernanke was interviewed on cbs s 60 minutes about the federal government s 1 trillion bailout of the banking system in the 2008 financial crisis bernanke was asked if the 1 trillion came from taxpayers he said no it was printed it s not tax money the banks have accounts with the fed much the same way that you have an account in a commercial bank so to lend to a bank we simply use the computer to mark up the size of the account that they have with the fed it s much more akin to printing money than it is to borrowing you ve been printing money 60 minutes correspondent scott pelley replied well effectively and we need to do that because our economy is very weak and inflation is very low bernanke says advertisement there is a video of bernanke saying this here the important bit comes in at the 8 minute mark cbs why was there no inflation when ben bernanke created 1 trillion during the financial crisis these admissions that creating money out of thin air is not by itself dangerous and may even be advantageous are the key principles to understanding modern monetary theory traditionally economists understand money creation or money printing as being inherently bad advertisement don t ever try excessive money creation young economists are warned but that raises a question if creating new money out of thin air creates inflation why was there no inflation when ben bernanke created 1 trillion in assets to save the banks during the financial crisis 1 trillion is actually the lower end of the bailout estimate a paper by the levy economic institute argued the cost was as high as 29 trillion japan runs a deficit of 240 of gdp and yet has no inflation advertisement in fact mmt advocates observe new money creation is a very common event and hyperinflation is a relatively rare event japan for instance is currently running a government deficit of close to 240 of gdp and has not experienced runaway inflation the deficit implies that the government has spent a sum vastly greater than the entire value of the japanese economy but has not been able to take in enough tax revenue to cover that expenditure and is thus floating it with debt the inflation rate in japan is currently 0 29 that s negative inflation japan isn t alone the us fed was forced to lower interest rates close to zero in order to counter deflation in the us while bernanke was adding 1 trillion to us bank accounts many economists predicted that the fed s ballooning cash creation would beggar the dollar but it didn t happen in europe sweden denmark switzerland and the 19 countries in the euro currency area imposed negative interest rates to flush money out of bank accounts in hopes of generating inflation at the same time the european central bank hosed the continent with 2 5 trillion 2 5 trillion in quantitive easing new money but with a fancy name but inflation never happened advertisement so mmt theorists argue that mere money creation cannot be the cause of inflation it must be something else what happens when a nation stops growing food in macroeconomics 101 classes everyone learns about the weimar republic in which the german government in defeat after world war 1 printed money to pay its bills hyperinflation set in and people needed wheelbarrows full of cash just to buy loaves of bread similarly when the zimbabwe economy collapsed in the late 1990s mid 2000s robert mugabe s regime printed ever more zimbabwean dollars in response the zimbabwean dollar was so devalued that the country even printed a 100 trillion note as legal tender advertisement in zimbabwe the initial trigger of hyperinflation was clear cut mugabe forced white farmers off their land and gave their farms to the soldiers who had fought to gain zimbabwe s independence from britain the problem was these soldiers were not very good at farming estimates vary but zimbabwe went from being the food exporting bread basket of africa to a nation that was unable to feed itself in a matter of months agriculture was the backbone of the economy but mugabe destroyed in a very short time about 60 of the production capacity according to bill mitchell a professor of economics at university of newcastle australia who supports mmt of course if you keep spending and you can t produce goods to meet that spending you ll get inflation and if you keep spending on top of that you ll get hyperinflation he says the weimar republic was in a similar albeit more complicated situation the war had destroyed germany s productive capacity but the allies were insisting it pay reparations far in excess of the ability of the shattered german economy to pay so the government printed money when a lack of supply met an excess demand from cash then hyperinflation was the result it is the lack of goods or labour or capacity that triggers inflation mmt argues advertisement why not put new money to work that s why there was no inflation in the west in the last 10 years all that extra money from the fed and the ecb was put to use making the recession slightly less awful than it could have been there are still people without jobs and plenty of unused capacity in the us and europe and as long as that remains the case it is unlikely that inflation will happen for mmt that begs a question why doesn t the government increase spending until there is no more unemployment a country could supply free college education build a green power network beef up its military build hospitals or rebuild its transport infrastructure if it knows that it can spend whatever it takes until it runs out of workers or resources to do the job advertisement only when the supply of labour or stuff becomes restricted will the government find itself bidding up the price of everything mmt argues in fact this is exactly what mmt proposes that the government does funnel money into the economy driving businesses to hire more people and consumers to demand more goods and services the existence of unemployment is clear de facto evidence that net government spending is too small to move the economy to full employment wrote phil armstrong of york college in 2015 must use its position as a monopoly issuer of the currency to ensure full employment guaranteed jobs for everyone advertisement when the private sector fails to provide full employment mmt advocates support the idea of a jobs guarantee that provides government funded jobs to anyone who wants or needs one the spending on such a program would be capped when the economy reaches full employment forms of federal job guarantees have existed in the past in 2002 argentina introduced the jefes programme which offered a job to the head of every household and paid a basic wage jefes participants worked on local community projects such as building and maintaining schools hospitals and community centers baking sewing clothing and recycling and repairing sewers and sidewalks in 1933 president franklin roosevelt began rolling out his new deal which provided a wage to unemployed people to build schools hospitals airports roads bridges and other infrastructure and during world war 2 most western governments spent heavily on military and armaments to finance the war policies deriving from mmt will be attractive politically according to warren mosler the american financier and sportscar designer who helped develop and spread mmt we ll get single payer healthcare and all that he told business insider advertisement full employment is the upper limit of non inflationary spending traditional economists regard this type of thinking as highly inflationary and damaging to free markets if the government is printing as much money as it takes to buy up all the unemployed labour then the private sector will be starved of workers employees will be pulled out of productive efficient companies into inefficient government jobs wage inflation will spiral as the government s new money pours in and workers demand higher pay in the private sector mmt ers have answers for this first the government can create jobs that the private sector has no interest in the private sector is bad at building roads bridges railways and airports so the government can build these without competing against the private sector the private sector is bad at building roads bridges railways and airports so the government can build these without competing against the private sector second the government can employ labour at a minimum wage if private employers want to pay more to attract workers away that s a good thing and the government will stop spending if all the workers end up in higher paying private jobs advertisement although the stereotype of mmt is about inflationary spending the reality is that mmt ers take inflation very seriously at full employment except for imports the economy s resources are all used according to l randall wray any further spending will be inflationary at full employment the government is in direct competition with the private sector he says and if the private sector can match you then you get into a bidding war and you can cause inflation and you will drive up prices you can cause inflation and you will cause inflation if you reach full employment and you continue to try to increase spending that by the way is essentially a restatement of alan greenspan s point at the top of this article it s not the money that s the problem it s whether the economy has enough people and goods to supply the demand that cash creates full employment is the upper bound of non inflationary government spending in other words advertisement what is tax for exactly mmt ers also propose that tax policy should become an anti inflationary monetary tool if there is too much money in the economy the government should tax some of it thereby taking it out of circulation when you pay taxes the money is literally destroyed mosler says if you pay by check they debit your account and those funds are gone just like shutting off a light switch if you somehow paid with actual cash with old paper bills they would send them to be shredded you can buy shredded dollars online the idea of increasing taxes as a deflationary measure is probably one of the most controversial aspects of mmt critics are highly sceptical than any government would have the courage to increase taxes during a period of inflation and tax policy is difficult to implement quickly whereas inflation can move fast the role of tax however goes to the conceptual core of mmt which is about how money originates and how it is removed traditionally economists see the role of government as setting taxes in order to raise revenue tax revenue is then used to pay for the things government needs to do police firefighters roads and so on this conception likens the government to a household budget it cannot spend money until it has taken in money any extra money it spends must be financed by borrowing advertisement mmt ers argue that the household metaphor is exactly backwards because the government has to create the money first in order to spend it and only after it is in circulation can it be taxed back associated press four reasons the government is obviously not like a household understanding that the government is not akin to a household is a core part of mmt for four reasons 1 the government can create its own money and set the price at which that money is available to the markets it therefore has monopoly power on the fundamental underlying prices of everything in the economy any debts denominated in its own currency can be paid with its own currency or can be settled by the creation of new money in that currency advertisement 2 the government creates money in order to spend it according to mosler the government does not impose taxes in order to find money in other words mosler told business insider that spending and creation might as well be the same thing in the mmt framework 3 taxes make money valuable money is only valuable when a government has the power to command that taxes be paid in the currency it operates if everyone has to pay tax then everyone needs to earn money a government can create all the money it wants and it can also tax back all the money it wants keeping prices stable the government thus has two levers to propel or retard the economy it can vary taxes and spending up or down in concert or independently 4 the government need not balance its books the way a household does governments create and spend money but they do not tax back 100 of that cash that s why at any given time a government will be running a deficit the deficit is merely the difference between all the cash the government has spent and all the taxes it has collected a deficit signifies that the private sector you and me is holding the difference and that s a surplus so if the government is in deficit the flipside is that the private sector is in surplus similarly if the government is in surplus it must mean that the private folks are in deficit using debt or their savings to get by because total payments to the government are more than the government s spending from this perspective deficits aren t the problem they re the solution advertisement the alternative is squeezing the economy in order to balance the government s books and that makes no sense if the government has the ability to create new cash and wipe away its deficits anytime it wants without raising taxes andy kiersz business insider the bias against deficits makes no sense mmt advocates say the bias against deficits can be harmful the european union s stability and growth pact requires members not to run a budget deficit above 3 of gdp or take on debts greater than 60 of gdp mmt proponents argue these restrictions prevented italy ireland greece and spain from spending enough to mitigate their economic downturns they are the main cause of the ongoing ultra high unemployment and underperformance in general said mosler he has proposed increase the limit from 3 to 8 immediately and then use the limit as a policy tool to adjust aggregate demand going forward advertisement there s more than 5 of excess capacity that could immediately be tapped and as unemployment fell the entire euro experiment would be declared a resounding success he added in a report on the euro area in 2014 the international monetary fund imf noted that the restrictions could be discouraging public investment and the recovery in private investment has been weaker than in most previous recessions and financial crises this was further evidence that fiscal austerity is bad for every sector wrote mitchell mmt experts claim these cases demonstrate the risks of conventional economic policy and its aversion to deficits sluggish growth rising inequality long term debt with crippling interest payments and the perpetual risk of economic collapse oxford economics enter the bond market vigilantes advertisement there is an elephant in the room which we have avoided discussing so far and that is the bond and foreign currency markets countries aren t economic islands their economies are linked to their neighbours and worldwide trading partners even if everything mmt proposed were true and money creation and deficit spending were not inflationary at the national level runaway inflation might still kick in if foreign investors decide that mmt is going to make your nation s currency worthless your government bankrupt and your central bank default bond credit and foreign exchange investors essentially make bets on the health of national economies and their currencies by buying and selling government debt and currency based on how risky it appears to be the fx markets might decide they don t want to hold the currency of a country that is printing money to pay its own bills the bond markets might decide they don t want to buy the debt of a country that has no intention of curbing its deficits the flight of their capital out of your country coupled with short bets against your assets might devalue your domestic currency on the international markets a dramatic recent example of this is turkey whose economy was growing at a robust 7 until last year suddenly president trump imposed economic sanctions on the nation because it had detained an american preacher turkey s economy looked like it might hit a rough patch as a result much of turkey s debts were denominated in foreign currency seeing the writing on the wall investors dumped the turkish lira and its value plummetted turkey s foreign debts became much more expensive as a result with a now crushing debt load a faltering economy and a weak currency turkey went into a sudden recession inflation is high in turkey now because the price of foreign goods and services is relatively higher than it used to be some analysts have wondered if its central bank can sustain the lira without defaulting might not something similar happen with mmt won t the bond market vigilantes attempt to turn you into turkey advertisement they might yes it s possible mosler says higher deficits have t been associated with higher rates except with fixed exchange rate policy in other words mmt isn t magic it has limitations such as the full employment inflation boundary if it is to work it has to work within its limits reuters the downsides of mmt mmt s critics far outnumber its proponents and their arguments are too numerous to summarise here nonetheless there are some obvious risks associated with mmt advertisement political bias if the central bank follows the government s direction it could face accusations of political bias or corruption erode people s trust in financial regulators and struggle to make painful decisions in the short term that benefit the economy in the long term central banks in venezuela zimbabwe and argentina all printed money to please politicians

regulators and struggle to make painful decisions in the short term that benefit the economy in the long term central banks in venezuela zimbabwe and argentina all printed money to please politicians resulting in hyperinflation and economic collapse lack of discipline the government might not spot when the economy has reached full capacity or lack the discipline to stop spending leading to inflation the government might not spot when the economy has reached full capacity or lack the discipline to stop spending leading to inflation politically impractical relying on taxation to extract money from the economy and cool it down could well be politically infeasible in countries where tax hikes are deeply unpopular such as the us if households are feeling the pinch of higher prices

role tax policy plays an important role in redistributing money from the wealthy to the poor repurposing it to reduce the money supply could mean those effects are overlooked tax policy plays an important role in redistributing money from the wealthy to the poor repurposing it to reduce the money supply could mean those effects are overlooked supply side shocks are a problem a supply side shock such as a spike in the oil price could reduce economic growth but with rising prices raising taxes in this case could worsen the economic slowdown and increase unemployment a supply side shock

government holds a significant amount of debt in another currency printing money and depreciating its currency could make that debt harder to pay off and even force it to default if the government holds a significant amount of debt in another currency printing money and depreciating its currency could make that debt harder to pay off and even force it to default fx markets maybe skeptical printing money with reckless abandon could also make investors wary of currency volatility and inflation leading them to ditch the currency for foreign exchange gold and other assets what do experts think of mmt the university of chicago booth school of business recently surveyed 42 of america s top economists on the validity of mmt not one agreed that governments able to print their own currencies should forget about federal deficits or be free to spend what they like several respondents flagged the risk of inflation and questioned the long term sustainability of mmt similarly nobel prize winner paul krugman has argued that running huge deficits could lead banks to refuse to lend at reasonable interest rates creating an unsustainable amount of debt and sparking inflation as the price of credit rises and investors flee advertisement reuters tim shaffer where did mmt come from mmt is rooted in the work of economists such as hyman minsky abba lerner and wynne godley during the 20th century more recently economists such as bill mitchell randall wray and stephanie kelton an economic advisor to vermont senator bernie sanders during his presidential campaign in 2016 have contributed to its development mosler wrote a book called soft currency economics ii in 1993 that has been credited with launching the mmt movement one last thing goldman sachs nearly endorsed mmt advertisement in 2018 goldman sachs analyst jan hatzius and his team published a short paper on us debt as compared to japanese debt japans experience raises an obvious question why should we care about us deficits if japan has sustained a vastly higher debt to gdp ratio without experiencing a sovereign debt crisis after all us debt levels look modest by comparison general government gross debt is 108 of gdp in the us versus 236 in japan while net debt is 81 of gdp in the us versus 153 in japan the team asked they then gave an answer that pleased mmt advocates greatly a sovereign debt crisis is difficult to imagine in a country that issues debt in its own currency has a flexible exchange rate and controls its central bank as paul de grauwe has argued and japans experience supports this view but it wasn t an unqualified endorsement of the principles of mmt because the us and japan both finance their deficits with debt there is a price to pay while such countries have the option to keep interest rates low such fiscal dominance sacrifices other macroeconomic goals as a result high debt levels and unfavorable debt dynamics can force a choice between servicing the debt at a reasonable cost or a potentially unpleasant fiscal adjustment and controlling inflation especially if a depreciation is needed as a fiscal safety valve of course mmt proponents would argue that is exactly the reason both countries should simply be creating money instead advertisement further resources see also advertisement

nigeria back on track towards achieving its full economic potential nigerian gdp at purchasing power parity ppp has almost tripled from 170 billion in 2000 to 451 billion in 2012 although estimates of the size of the informal sector which is not included in official figures put the actual numbers closer to 630 billion correspondingly the gdp per capita doubled from 1400 per person in 2000 to an

160 million in 2010 these figures were to be revised upwards by as much as 80 when metrics were to be recalculated subsequent to the rebasing of its economy in april 2014 although oil revenues contribute 2 3 of state revenues oil only contributes about 9 to the gdp nigeria produces only about 2 7 of the world s oil supply in comparison saudi arabia produces 12 9 russia produces 12 7 and the united states produces 8 6 although the petroleum sector is important as government revenues still heavily rely on this sector it remains a small part of the country s overall economy the largely subsistence agricultural sector has not kept up with rapid population growth and nigeria once a large net exporter of food now imports some of its food products though mechanization has led to a resurgence in manufacturing and exporting of food products and the move towards food sufficiency in 2006 nigeria successfully convinced the paris club to let it buy back the bulk of its debts owed to them for a cash payment of roughly us 12 billion according to a citigroup report published in february 2011 nigeria will have the highest average gdp growth in the world between 2010 and 2050 nigeria is one of two countries from africa among 11 global growth generators countries overview edit in 2014 nigeria changed its economic analysis to account for rapidly growing contributors to its gdp such as telecommunications banking and its film industry in 2005 nigeria achieved a milestone agreement with the paris club of lending nations to eliminate all of its bilateral external debt under the agreement the lenders will forgive most of the debt and nigeria will pay off the remainder with a portion of its energy revenues outside of the energy sector nigeria s economy is highly inefficient moreover human capital is underdeveloped nigeria ranked 151 out of countries in the united nations development index in 2004 and non energy related infrastructure is inadequate from 2003 to 2007 nigeria attempted to implement an economic reform program called the national economic empowerment development strategy needs the purpose of the needs was to raise the country s standard of living through a variety of reforms including macroeconomic stability deregulation liberalization privatization transparency and accountability the needs addressed basic deficiencies such as the lack of freshwater for household use and irrigation unreliable power supplies decaying infrastructure impediments to private enterprise and corruption the government hoped that the needs would create 7 million new jobs diversify the economy boost non energy exports increase industrial capacity utilization and improve agricultural productivity a related initiative on the state level is the state economic empowerment development strategy seeds a longer term economic development program is the united nations un sponsored national millennium goals for nigeria under the program which covers the years from 2000 to 2015 nigeria is committed to achieving a wide range of ambitious objectives involving poverty reduction education gender equality health the environment and international development cooperation in an update released in 2004 the un found that nigeria was making progress toward achieving several goals but was falling short on others specifically nigeria had advanced efforts to provide universal primary education protect the environment and develop a global development partnership a prerequisite for achieving many of these worthwhile objectives is curtailing endemic corruption which stymies development and taints nigeria s business environment president olusegun obasanjo s campaign against corruption which includes the arrest of officials accused of misdeeds and recovering stolen funds has won praise from the world bank in september 2005 nigeria with the assistance of the world bank began to recover us 458 million of illicit funds that had been deposited in swiss banks by the late military dictator sani abacha who ruled nigeria from 1993 to 1998 however while broad based progress has been slow these efforts have begun to become evident in

arabian peninsula country thanks to its strategic location it posses a developed economy and high life quality oman rial is also pegged to us dollar as bahrain dinar it is remarkable that purchase

currency code eur 1 eur 1 14 usd the euro currency has strengthened over the past few years this allowed it to raise the list of the most powerful currencies partially its strength is explained by the

of all world savings us dollar has 62 3 no 8 swiss franc 1 04 usd currency code chf 1 chf 1 04 usd switzerland is not only one of the richest countries in the world but it is also one of the most

canadian dollar is often called the loonie in honor of the bird depicted on the coin worth 1 dollar out of ten due to dynamically changing economical and political situation in the world it is hard for some currencies to remain in this ranking so here is the list of currencies that left the top ten for previous periods australian dollar currency code aud 1 aud 0 73 usd an interesting fact is that the new series of australia banknotes as on picture above would have a tactile feature braille to help the visually impaired community to tell the value of the banknote also in australia the fight against cash is conducted by reducing the share of cash payments when making small retail purchases libyan dinar currency code lyd 1 lud 0 72 usd libyan dinar has token money called dirham it is interesting that one dinar is equal 1000 dirham and not 100 as we all used to think azerbaijani manat currency code azn 1 azn 0 59 usd it was a surprise to see azerbaijani manat in this list however the currency of this near east country is a little bit weaker than us dollar the economy of this country is surprisingly strong and its unemployment rate is low the high value of the currency is a sign of a strong economy it is known that the currencies of not very successful countries tend to decrease in value however when everything is in order with the economy we can hardly see the opposite effect indeed in practice there were practically no cases when the value of a currency was constantly increasing the reasons may be different for a country the constant strengthening of the currency is not profitable because the population is beginning to actively save funds instead of spending them thus the high value of the currency only says that inflation processes in the country are under control in the context of this article mention should also be made of japan and its one of the strongest economies in the world at the same time the value of the japanese yen is very small 1 109 77 information about the highest value of currencies can hardly be used by investors to make any investment decisions in this case it is better to consider the most stable currencies by the way did you mean that you cannot use banknote images without the inscription specimen learning to comply with the laws comrades cc google
the globe is currently saddled with an unprecedented amount of debt and this is expected to rise further as fiscal spending to boost economies takes place central to this trend and related risks is the global economic engine china currently debt ridden governments remain calm as they consider debt to be manageable and some experts believe that controlability is more important than debt size yet history provides plenty of warnings the 1997 asian financial crisis was a result of excessive corporate debt and a decade later the 2008 global financial crisis was triggered by excessive mortgage loans though mortgage backed derivatives in the us hur kyung wook a former south korean ambassador to the organization of economic cooperation and development and an ex vice finance minister warned asia times in an interview that another debt crisis is looming with china the potential trigger debt without deleverage global debt is about 3 2 times gdp according to the international institute of finance hur who currently serves as an adviser to bae kim lee a major seoul law firm and who in addition to his government service also worked at the international monetary fund and the world bank noted but the bigger problem he averred is that the world has largely ignored urgent debt obligations without deleveraging following the gfc of 2008 while households and businesses formerly went bankrupt in crises eventually leading to deleveraging during the 2008 crisis debts were transferred to central banks and governments through quantitative easing and through the rescue of troubled corporates or banks in the past this was never the case in the course of crisis resolution he said debts and the debt ratios to gdp have increased since the crisis in other words liquidity supply has increased monetary easing brought forth low interest rates and low investment returns creating the yield hungry phenomenon of investing in high yield assets through this investment behavior debt was transferred from developed countries to developing countries he said according to a january report from the institute of international finance global debt stood at 244 trillion as of the third quarter of 2018 up about 27 trillion since 2016 the debt to gdp ratio edged down to 318 percent from a record high of 320 percent in the third quarter of 2016 as economic growth has reduced debt to gdp ratios somewhat but it remains stratospheric out of the 244 trillion government debt was tallied at 65 2 trillion non financial corporate debt stood at 72 9 trillion dollars and financial sector debt was 60 trillion dollars while households owe 46 1 trillion dollars the iif noted that government debt and non financial corporate debt in particular have continued to grow accounting for 75 of global debt growth since 2008 previously supplying liquidity would create inflation hur said raising interest rates to counter inflation would make it difficult for debt ridden corporates and banks to repay debts resulting in them selling assets and deleveraging that is not the case today inflation has not occurred despite the quantitative easing of the past decade as the pace of liquidity circulation has slowed hur said the economy is also beginning to slow europe was originally scheduled to normalize its monetary policy following the us but washington stopped that process due to its own slowing economy so rather than monetary tightening europe may lower interest rates yet further and japan is in a similar situation moreover china had been tightening its monetary policy until two years ago but it has turned to an eased stand due to the u s china trade war hur said and there is no end in sight raising risk still further we can t afford to see this situation go on forever hur said no one knows when the debt crisis will happen but chances are getting higher and higher hur expects a bust to occur as a result of a major interest rate hike or economic hard landing populism also bodes ill for the global economy he said in many countries populist governments have come into play further raising the debt issue he said adding that the g20 created post 2008 is failing to address the problem the china risk he predicted that china which has seen a surge in corporate debt is likely to trigger the next crisis china is the country where corporate debt has increased the most since the global financial crisis he said the ratio of corporate debt to gdp is higher in china than that of in the us when the lehman brothers crisis erupted or in japan when the real estate bubble burst currently chinese companies debt is almost 160 of gdp according to the iif way higher than the 132 percent in japan in 1989 when the japanese bubble burst household debt also rose to 51 of gdp local government debt has continued to grow thanks to stimulus measures but the ratio of government debt to gdp is at 48 5 percent a relatively stable level hur agrees in part with the view that the chinese government can control corporate debt but that does not mean that the problem can be resolved there is a possibility of a hard landing even if it may be able to avoid a crash landing that could lead to the collapse of the financial system he said it s hard to tell what would happen if china s debt problem erupts but it could be contained internally as china controls foreign exchange transactions and holds more than 3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves what is helping the country avoid a full blown crisis is that the portion of foreign debt to the country s total debt is relatively small china s financial system is dominated by the government he said the government has transferred the debt of the four major banks to asset management companies established to handle major banks debt to allow these banks to continue lending china will try to gradually reduce its liability for a long time in this way however it seems difficult to avoid negative impact there could be a sharp downturn in the economy with credit slashed and real state prices plunged he suggested and even absent a collapse of the chinese financial system a sharp downturn in the chinese economy could send shockwaves through the global economy he said the korea center for international finance also revealed concerns about china s growing corporate debt in a report published in january saying that corporate debt has been a factor which exacerbates the economic slump by causing bank insolvency and reduced private investment according to the report china s corporate debt amounted to 20 3 trillion as of the second quarter of last year up 4 7 times from 4 5 trillion in 2008 its ratio to gdp also jumped to 155 1 coupled with a contraction of the property market the impact of an economic downturn could be amplified about 60 of collateral in corporate bond issuances is real estate and real estate companies issue 35 6 of corporate bonds the report noted if the chinese government s stimulus policy fails to operate efficiently amid worsening internal and external environments the delayed corporate restructuring and industrial innovation could amplify china s economic instability and put a heavy burden on the global economy don t panic however there are also positive voices china s bankruptcy rate has gone up but it s small in size said an expert who closely monitors global bond markets so far only small businesses have faced defaults big companies which can exert a huge impact on the chinese economy have been saved if the chinese government which controls financial institutions responds to the debt problem like this i think the chances of a crisis occurring are not great other key economies are relatively stable according to the iif us government debt amounted to 108 7 percent of gdp as of the third quarter of last year and japan s government debt has recently exceeded 250 percent of gdp but japan s government debt problem is less severe as it has little foreign debt and low interest rates this means it is manageable as long as japanese government debt growth does not exceed gdp growth and although washington is massively indebted with the dollar the key currency there is no risk of sovereign default some experts see the possibility of a foreign debt crisis rising among emerging economies when the fed signaled a normalization of monetary policy financial markets in some emerging economies panicked however hur sees little problem there there has already been considerable differentiation between emerging economies he said some emerging countries vulnerable to risk have been through crises already and with differentiation underway emerging market crises if they happen will be very regional
we are only 15 minutes to midnight now said the report photo 123rf we are only 15 minutes to midnight now said the report photo 123rf multinational investment bank citigroup has issued an explicit recession warning for the united states advising clients to wind down exposure to risky assets and prepare to ride out the storm the bank s global investment team said the us federal reserve over tightened monetary policy last year waiting too long to stop raising interest rates or to slow the pace of quantitative tightening reverse qe the economy is already shot below the waterline and will most likely succumb to the textbook pathologies of a fading expansion the us economy seems to be transitioning into a stagnation phase after a brief period of goldilocks on a sugar high of fiscal stimulus we advise investors to prepare for recession it said wall street stocks and global bourses may keep climbing for a few more months before peaking in july equities typically rally a little before the cycle ends it said pinning its colours to the mast citigroup predicts the onset of technical recession in december as defined by the national bureau of economic research it won t be exact of course it said the bank s in house model suggests that the likelihood of a recession over the next year has risen to a range of 37pc to 45pc in reality this is already within the danger zone previous episodes show that once it nears 50pc the economy has already buckled we are only 15 minutes to midnight now said the report by jeremy hale and amir amin the key trigger was last week s inversion of the us yield curve when the market rate for 10 year bonds fell below the 3 month rate as the curve inverts more probabilities rise exponentially it said this tipping point amounts to a verdict by the bond markets that the fed has entered overkill territory it also has causal effects the inverted curve eats into the business model of banks which tend to borrow short and then to lend long it cuts financial earnings and ultimately chokes lending citigroup said it was too early to abandon equities but some rotation into fixed income assets would be prudent wall street typically rallies a further 11pc after the curve inverts peaking four months later the stock market top itself anticipates the actual recession by an average of five months but the time lapses vary there was almost no warning before the great recession the s p 500 index peaked in october 2007 and the us economy began to contract in november long before the collapse of lehman brothers and aig a year later policy shifts can make a huge difference if they come soon enough the fed slashed rates by 50 points in an emergency move unscheduled in january 2001 and a further 50 points three weeks later but it was too late to stop recession engulfing the economy in february recessions are toxic because they set off a chain reaction through financial deleveraging such a slump today would lead to an avalanche of fallen angels among us companies that have increased debt from us 2 5 trillion to us 6 5 trillion in nine years mostly to buy back their own stock large numbers rated bbb and bb are clustered precariously just above junk status their average net debt ebitda ratio is almost six off the charts by historical standards a recessionary shock would lead to a corporate massacre this would lead to a self feeding crisis it would also be a shattering blow to the eurozone where italy is already in recession and germany has stalled the european central bank s key interest rate is minus 0 4pc the political bar for relaunching qe is prohibitively high the stability pact prevents radical use of counter cyclical fiscal stimulus christine lagarde the head of the international monetary fund warned on thursday that the currency bloc is not resilient enough to withstand another global downturn we need a european banking system that can bend in a storm without breaking she said citigroup said the us conference board s leading indicator has begun to turn down a signal that should not be ignored the short term boost from donald trump s tax cuts is fading the labour market is strong but it offers a rear view mirror of the economy jobs gave almost no prior warning of recession in 1973 1981 2000 and 2007 one nasty catalyst could be a resurgence of us price pressures despite a slowing economy ushering in a phase of stagflation this would be a horrible combination for equities if you want the ultimate safe haven buy the japanese yen citigroup has pencilled in 105 to the dollar later this year and 93 over the long term it is 111 currently rival bank of america said it expects equities to reach a big top in the second half of this year before investors wake up to the painful prospect of debt deflation policy impotence when the wheels come off the financial system its model is predicting a fall in global earnings per share of 9pc this year bank of america s contrarian bull bear indicator issued a general buy alert at the start of january when fear was prevalent the fed s capitulation then worked its usual pavlovian magic on markets lifting commodities 14 5pc and global equities by 11 5pc over the first quarter the mood is turning as we enter the second quarter investors are switching into deflation assets bonds and the japanisation trade for now the bull bear metric is in neutral territory at 4 4 far short of the bank s sell signal at 8 0 reflecting maximum greed we have time to prepare but beware late cycle dynamics are famously treacherous

the state bank of pakistan sbp has let the rupee depreciate by rs0 49 to a new all time low at rs140 78 to the us dollar in the inter bank market on friday ahead of an expected agreement with the international monetary fund imf for a long term loan programme with this the rupee has cumulatively dropped rs2 25 or 1 6 in the past three weeks in a fresh round of depreciation according to the central bank the imf has asked pakistan to end state control over the rupee and let the currency move freely to find its equilibrium against the us dollar and other major world currencies also the world bank which finances some of the infrastructure and social safety net projects in pakistan has supported the idea of leaving the rupee free from state control in a bid to give much needed boost to exports and fix a faltering economy it seems that pakistan has agreed with the imf condition of leaving the rupee free renowned businessman arif habib said in comments to the express tribune approaching the imf for financial assistance is a good decision of the government however it should have thoroughly negotiated and entered into the loan programme on its own conditions instead of taking dictation he said a leading banker however linked the fresh rupee deprecation with the uptrend in crude oil prices in world markets pakistan heavily relies on imported petroleum products which account for around one fourth of the total import bill the country s foreign currency reserves however are insufficient to continue making expensive import payments and external debt repayments the situation has mounted pressure on the rupee and has forced the authorities to agree to further depreciation he said this coincides with the imf condition of allowing the rupee to move on its own fundamentals finance minister asad umar said the other day the government was close to reaching an agreement with the imf for a long term loan programme there is a possibility that pakistan and the imf may sign a deal at the end of imf s staff level mission which will arrive in the third week of april he said discussions would also take place during spring meetings of the imf and world bank in washington next month he added habib however criticised the government for letting the rupee depreciate saying such measures had never delivered the desired result of reviving exports and trimming imports but increased the cost of doing business and badly damaged investment climate in the country he said authorities had let the rupee depreciate by a cumulative 33 4 in the past 15 months however exports have remained sluggish and a drop in imports came mainly due to a decrease in import of machinery and services for projects of the china pakistan economic corridor cpec early harvest projects of cpec funded by the chinese are close to completion the depreciation has however contributed a lot to the rising inflation in pakistan the government should make policy decisions keeping in view the ground realities instead of implementing book formulas he suggested pakistan forex association president malik bostan also linked the movement in rupee with the upcoming imf programme the retail market of the rupee follows the inter bank market accordingly the open market witnessed a fall in the rupee s value against the dollar bostan said the pakistani currency shed one rupee to rs142 50 to the us dollar in the open market on friday according to dollar east exchange company bostan said speculation about further currency depreciation in connection with the imf s condition prompted people to buy dollars it created additional demand for dollars in the open market apart from that pilgrims going to saudi arabia for umrah and haj also bought dollars and riyals he said published in the express tribune march 30 2019 like business on facebook follow tribunebiz on twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation

this article was reposted with the consent of the world socialist web site the original article can be viewed here by andrea lobo two months after workers launched wildcat strikes in the mexican city of matamoros 89 maquiladora factories mostly in the auto parts electric and metallurgical industries have agreed to workers demands for a 20 percent raise and a bonus of 32 000 pesos us 1 655 half of the average yearly salary the strike wave has become known across mexico as the 20 32 movement the mexican and us ruling classes have sought to claw back concessions and contain and isolate the rebellion by laying off 4 700 workers to date the ruling class has also threatened to fire 50 000 of the 85 000 maquiladora workers in the city and is desperately propping up the trade union apparatus to block further struggles it is accelerating its attacks against democratic rights and is turning toward authoritarian and militaristic forms of rule on march 1 a matamoros worker shared a world socialist web site article online regarding the crippling effects strikes are having on the north american auto industry and the growing support for mexican workers across the continent the worker posted wow finally i read something coherent about workers and their movement as it began to circulate widely on facebook 52 year old labor lawyer susana prieto terrazas intervened to denounce the wsws but this outlet also publishes stupidities she wrote they are also part of my detractors the left that sells the idea that workers can organize by themselves naturally and without help they are pathetic what she calls pathetic workers independent initiative of self organization is precisely the source of the workers power workers in matamoros took the historic and crucial step of forming rank and file committees to by pass the trade unions so that they could communicate democratically appeal not to the mexican government but to workers across the city and internationally and organize the largest strike across north america in at least three decades consolidating these gains and taking the struggle forward under an internationalist and socialist program is the only way forward against mass reprisals for all prieto s left talk the truth is that she is a longtime partner of the us trade union federation the afl cio which makes mexican company unions or charrismo look almost like militants prieto comments on an wsws article a self proclaimed capitalist prieto arrived at matamoros dishonestly denying her ties to any unions and to the ruling bourgeois party movement for national regeneration morena in order to politically disarm workers and find the best way to shut the strike down she offered the legal advice that workers had to remain tied to the union apparatus and place their trust in mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador known as amlo to win their demands she convinced workers to send delegations on march 5 to monterrey león and on march 13 15 to mexico city to discuss joining independent unions bound to the morena government and us and european imperialism tellingly the wall street journal which has historically elevated the most right wing forces featured prieto in its march 14 edition the newspaper sent a photographer to matamoros to portray prieto as a marvel superhero character while rejoicing her efforts have made her a folk hero in matamoros workers have given her cakes flowers and t shirts with her name on it and the legend god sent an angel to matamoros to help the working class some have composed ballads in her honor yet the tribute to prieto by the top media outlet of the american financial aristocracy also exposes another lie the paper indicated that she makes her income as a lawyer for independent unions wall street journals portrett av prieto it is critical to refute prieto s slanders against the wsws because they lie at the center of this political fraud against the working class which must now draw the lessons from the strike and render accounts of the roles played by its protagonists this requires a sober examination of how this strategic experience unfolded within its historical and international context what produced the wildcat strikes and why in matamoros during the 1980s new shipping and information technologies set the stage for the globalization of capitalist production one of its effects was to render unviable the isolated soviet economy fast tracking the dissolution of the first workers state the ussr at the hands of the stalinist bureaucracy the closer integration of production globally and the demise of the ussr only deepened the crisis of the capitalist system japanese and european imperialism had partially recovered since world war ii to become again contending rivals of us imperialism renewed global competition for sources of cheap labor markets and natural resources intensified by the computerization of trade and financial capital was accompanied by the formation of rival trade blocs a 1992 study by the autonomous university of mexico unam on the negotiations of the north american free trade agreement noted the european common market and the potential entailed by a supposed european self sufficiency calls for the integration of regional markets with the magnitude of the so called north american common market the development of this economic stronghold for us and canadian imperialism rested on the exploitation of the mexican maquiladoras as a cheap labor platform however the report warned if the cost of manual labor increases and mexico ceases to enjoy a competitive world wide edge the tendency will be towards the disappearance of the maquiladora industry as such in mexico industrial centers sprung up across the us mexico border and in the bajío region in north central mexico raising the workforce at maquiladora sweatshops from 400 000 to 3 million today with millions more employed in related activities despite the ballooning demand for mexican labor living standards fell a study by the economics faculty in unam titled mexico 2018 another social and political defeat for the working class found that the real purchasing power of mexicans has fallen 80 percent in the last 30 years indicating that more than 24 hours of work today are necessary to afford the staples one bought in 1987 with roughly five hours of work today industrial salaries in mexico are 50 percent of industrial salaries in china the relation was the opposite two decades ago reported the bank hsbc last year seeing their wealth and power increase with the inflow of foreign capital the mexican bourgeoisie and trade unions forged tighter relations with us imperialism and readily enforced the falling compensation for mexican workers labor to meet the globalized profit requirements of the financial elite agapito gonzález cavazos in matamoros strikes during the 1980s had won maquiladora workers unique conditions in the region like a 40 hour week paid at 56 hours in 1983 along with a relatively more militant tradition facing such pressure from below agapito gonzález cavazos after four decades leading the union of laborers and industrial workers of the maquiladora industry sjoiim was one of the few trade union leaders still calling strikes to resist the downward pressures of the approaching nafta agreement on january 31 1992 however during negotiations with 42 companies including general motors gonzález was detained for several weeks by federal authorities on charges of fiscal fraud under gonzález the union had consolidated its significant wealth financial obscurity prominence in the ctm and ruling circles and its corporatist role as a labor contractor subordinated to management the arrest was for gonzález the sign that it was impossible to continue juggling any defense of workers interests and the union bureaucracy s comfortable social standing which rested on the defense of capitalist relations and their nationalist framework along with every trade union in the world the sjoiim responded to the new context under globalization by dropping any serious resistance until gonzalez s death in 2001 and thereafter the 48 hour week was re imposed and according to a recent article by somosmass99 the starting salary being negotiated in 1992 by the sjoiim was the equivalent of 19 50 per day compared to the current 10 86 including the recent 20 percent raise by the end of 2018 the percentage of the working population with an income below the basket of staple foods which the government defines as extreme poverty was 40 percent meanwhile the top 10 percent has hoarded 67 percent of the country s wealth and more than 80 percent of financial assets the number of dollar millionaires increased 27 percent to 88 000 just in 2017 when officials reported that 57 percent of the working population had no access to social security benefits including health care the pressure to transfer ever greater amounts of money into the financial markets only intensified after the 2008 crash at a time when china became a new economic competitor on the world stage facing a continued decline of its relative economic power us imperialism has been compelled to consolidate its own economic political and military sphere of control in preparation for economic and military confrontations against its global rivals these strategic considerations were behind trump s renegotiation of nafta which includes several concessions from the mexican and canadian bourgeoisies in favor of us capital including a ban on forging a free trade agreement with china fundamentally trump s protectionism relies on further downward pressures on wages and conditions to incentivize the reshuffling of production from china europe and asia back to north america and on a lesser degree to the rest of us imperialism s backyard latin america the us commerce department recently listed imports for us auto manufacturers and presumably other key industries as a national security concern the new nafta requires that 75 percent of components of cars and trucks be manufactured within north america an increase from 62 5 percent already 45 percent of auto parts imported into the us come from mexico while 40 percent of mexican made vehicles exported to the us consist of auto parts made in the us the us and mexico auto industries are like siamese twins inseparable and highly intertwined writes the industry magazine mexico now eighty percent of mexican exports mostly industrial products made in maquiladora plants go to the us cheap labor tax cuts land and other incentives for investments in the mexican maquiladora industry lie at the heart of us capitalism s strategy for trade war and military confrontation with its global rivals representing the interests of rent seekers or junior partners to us and foreign capital within the mexican ruling elite and upper middle class including factions of the trade union bureaucracy the amlo administration came up with a scheme to further cheapen labor and cut taxes to attract us investments particularly after the trump administration had brought down the corporate tax rate from 34 to 21 percent at the same time the overwhelming majorities won by morena during the july 2018 presidential and parliamentary elections reflected profound popular aspirations that this party touted as left would implement policies to massively improve social conditions for the toiling masses these considerations led to a signature campaign promise of amlo turning the 18 mile wide strip along the 2000 mile border with the us into a free trade zone the plan which took effect january 1 cut the value added tax from 16 to 8 percent and the income taxes from 30 to 20 percent in the new free trade zone it also raised the minimum wage 16 percent nationally to a meager 102 daily pesos 5 and 100 percent within the free trade zone to 176 daily pesos 9 15 the majority of workers along the border already earned slightly more than 176 pesos in matamoros only 20 percent earned less according to the maquiladora association index the crux of amlo s free trade zone was that companies would be free to eliminate bonuses to compensate for the new minimum wage even if workers were not benefitted by the raise while amlo and morena were taking workers for fools as early as november 13 there were reports of workers at border cities denouncing the elimination of their bonuses in matamoros the situation was even more explosive an old provision in the sjoiim contract stipulated that salaries across the board must increase proportionately to any minimum wage hike to protect purchasing power and that bonuses had to compensate workers for this change mario lópez og andrés manuel lópez obrador throughout december the union leader juan villafuerte morales and the union delegates from the 48 plants a majority of which are owned by us based companies held backroom talks with the local government under the new morena mayor mario lópez nicknamed la borrega or the sheep during these negotiations mayor lópez told reporters from central tv that the wage increase was not financially viable for the maquiladoras so he was intervening in a chat between the union and the companies instead of paying the 100 percent wage increase and the corresponding bonus of 32 000 pesos it turned out that the plan of the sjoiim morena and index was to silently overlook the raise and bonus even the standard annual bonus of 3 000 pesos on december 28 a short wildcat strike of hundreds of workers at the maquiladora of seisa medical in ciudad juárez against the halving of their bonus was a shot across the bow with a social explosion brewing susana prieto returned from a vacation in patagonia

australians should make no mistake the nation will change forever if labor leader bill shorten claims the lodge everyone will be affected from apprentices battling workers and first home buyers to university students young families and retirees the man set to become australia s next prime minister is promising sweeping changes to make australia a fairer place redistributing wealth from the rich and well off to low and middle income earners i want to make sure this economy s managed in the interests of working and middle class australians not just the top end of town he said in an exclusive interview with daily mail australia while on the campaign trail in perth mr shorten declared the upcoming election would be a referendum on wages he said the pendulum had swung too far in favour of big business which had seen corporate profits soar at the expense of everyday workers pay packets at the same time the opportunities and future prospects of young people were increasingly determined by the salaries and savings of their parents i want us to be a country where whatever your postcode whatever your gender no matter how much money your parents had that you can get equal opportunity in this country he said mr shorten has a five point fair go action plan which will take australia into the next decade with a policy program the labor leader says is the most ambitious and detailed for generations bill shorten pictured with wife chloe says australians have nothing to fear from a labor government 10 million workers will receive tax cuts and the country will be a fairer place labor will restore penalty rates in its first 100 days of government and legislate so they cannot be cut again mr shorten says up to 700 000 workers on penalty rates will get more money from introducing a living wage and re instating penalty rates to reforming negative gearing and overhauling health and education mr shorten is promising the biggest shakeup of the nation since gough whitlam came to power in 1972 mr whitlam who campaigned under the slogan it s time went to the polls with policies including an income tax surcharge to pay for universal health insurance free dental care for students and the elimination of university tuition fees a shorten government would see tax cuts for 10 million low and middle income workers re instating penalty rates for 700 000 workers creating a living wage rather than minimum wage uncapping university places creating 200 000 spots reforming negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions reaching 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030 with a federal election due to be called within days mr shorten believed the electorate was ready for change and he said voters had nothing to fear from an incoming labor government we can t be a country run on fear fear of minorities fear of outsiders fear of change he said it s got to be run on hope hope that we can work together hope that we can hand on a better deal to our kids than the one we inherited class warfare s when you can preside over 45 per cent corporate growth and think that 8 per cent wages growth is satisfactory labor leader mr shorten pictured with wife chloe says bill shorten has promised the most detailed and ambitious policy program since the 1972 election of gough whitlam pictured during his it s time campaign with singer little pattie the polls consistently show mr shorten and labor set to win the election which is tipped to be held mid may and after five years in opposition watching the country head in the wrong direction under the coaliton mr shorten declared he was ready for the top job this government essentially for five years has only had a couple of plans crack down on welfare and give big business a tax cut he said barracking hardest for mr shorten at the upcoming election will be wife chloe the daughter of former governor general dame quentin bryce and the rest of the couple s blended family rupert 17 georgette 16 and clementine 9 mr shorten declared 10 million australians would receive bigger better and fairer tax cuts and claimed australia as a whole would be better off under a labor government while labor s policies were concentrated on improving the lot of lower and middle income earners mr shorten denied the government s claim his party was waging class warfare it s not class warfare to make the government work for all people he said i tell you what class warfare is it s stopping kids getting proper funding at schools because they don t come from the right suburbs class warfare s when you can preside over 45 per cent corporate growth and think that 8 per cent wages growth is satisfactory mr shorten said the coalition did not deserve to be rewarded for its part governing the country during 27 uninterrupted years of economic growth this government has had very little to do with the economy he said the only reason why the budget s in an ok position is because of iron ore coal and rising tax receipts from personal income tax that s it there s no strategy mr shorten says voters felt disengaged from the political system and distrustful of politicians they don t like us they think everyone s in it for themselves the leader of the opposition says daily mail australia shadowed mr shorten on the campaign trail during a recent visit to western australia and sat down with him for an extensive interview we asked the former union leader why he wanted to be the nation s 31st prime minister because i want to make australia a fairer place he said i want us to be the best mr shorten said australia should have the best education system in the world and the best health care he wanted lower energy prices while tackling climate change i want us to tackle the cost of living everything in this country s going up but wages so i want to tackle that having played a major role in deposing former labor prime ministers kevin rudd in 2010 then julia gillard three years later mr shorten has been labor s parliamentary leader since october 2013 mr shorten pictured with his family mr shorten says it is heart breaking to watch 20 and 30 somethings bid for a house and be beaten by an investor who s getting a taxpayer top up he said he had a united stable and talented team and he had been preparing to govern for almost six years although he understood many voters felt disengaged from the political system and were distrustful of politicians they don t like us they think everyone s in it for themselves he said mr shorten believed he could restore faith in democracy and the solution was not complicated i can do it by keeping my promises he said i can do it by the fact that we ve shown now for the best part of six years that we re capable of working as a team talking about the people not talking about ourselves mr shorten had outlasted liberal prime ministers tony abbott and malcolm turnbull and said he was ready to topple prime minister scott morrison what people want from us is something more positive he said they don t want to hear me critique the government they can do that themselves they want to hear what i m going to do for the people our party s learnt a very hard lesson mr shorten says of changing leaders if people think you re more interested in yourselves than the people the people will give you the boot this is what a shorten labor government would do taxes mr shorten said labor would deliver bigger better and fairer tax cuts for 10 million working australians everyone earning less than 125 000 a year would receive a bigger tax cut under labor compared with the coalition with more than four million taxpayers better off by 398 a year he said a teacher on 65 000 would receive a tax cut of 928 a year while a couple earning 90 000 and 50 000 respectively would receive a tax cut of 1 855 a year labor would stop a concession which gave cash refunds for excess dividend imputation credits a scheme it said cost the budget more than 5 9billion a year the change would mean no cash refunds for people who did not pay any income tax under the current system someone with 1 16million in shares could get a 25 000 tax refund when they hadn t paid any income tax it s been a good drink but now we re calling last drinks mr shorten said we re not seeking to raise people s taxes mr shorten said we are shutting down tax loopholes that s just saying we re not going to keep giving you money that you don t need for a purpose which doesn t achieve anything for the rest of society you know we ve got a tax system in australia which is basically optional for the top end you get the best accountants you can claim the biggest deductions mr shorten s plan is to improve schools and hospitals stand up for workers relieve pressure on family finances ensure a strong economy and work towards cleaner cheaper energy jobs and wages the election could be seen as a referendum on wages mr shorten said under mr shorten s living wage policy australia s 1 2 million lowest paid workers would receive an increase on the current minimum wage of 18 93 an hour or 719 20 per 38 hour week labor would restore penalty rates in its first 100 days of government and legislate so that they could never be cut again mr shorten said up to 700 000 workers on penalty rates would get more money he said labor would protect sub contractors working on government projects from being left unpaid when dodgy businesses went broke through the implementation of a tradie pay guarantee his government would protect workers and ensure they got a fair deal by tackling labour hire practices used to undermine pay and conditions of direct employees it would boost local jobs by ensuring more government contracts and major projects were delivered by local businesses corporate profits have gone up 45 per cent since 2016 under this government mr shorten said wages have gone up 8 per cent how s that fair what we re proposing is through a series of reasonable mechanisms to help put some upward pressure on wages to return it to somewhere where its long term average has been corporate profits have gone up 45 per cent since 2016 under this government bill shorten says wages have gone up 8 per cent how s that fair mr shorten is tipped for victory in may housing affordability mr shorten said first home buyers would be better off under a labor government labor would limit direct borrowing by self managed superannuation funds increase foreign investor fees and penalties and establish a bond aggregator to increase investment in affordable housing mr shorten said it was heart breaking to watch 20 and 30 somethings bid for a house and be beaten by a property investor who s getting a taxpayer top up i mean is the government really saying the only way the property market survives is by the taxpayer subsidising property investors what drives property in this country is supply what drives it is does someone have a job what drives it is whether or not the house is in an area which is well served by transport by schools by shopping labor would also limit future negative gearing concessions to new housing and reduce the capital gains tax discount from 50 per cent to 25 per cent mr shorten said it was not right to give billions to property investors instead of spending that money on childcare hospitals and schools it s all about opportunity cost i don t want australia to have the world s best tax subsidies for property i want australia to have the world s best education hospitals minimum wage i want people to be better paid everyone earning less than 125 000 a year will receive a bigger tax cut under labor compared with the coalition with more than 4million taxpayers better off by 398 a year climate change energy and power prices labor was committed to reaching 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030 and cutting whole of economy pollution by 45 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030 to reach net zero emissions by 2050 it would double the original investment in the clean energy finance corporation to 10billion to support new power generation and storage concessional loans for household purchases of solar and battery systems and boost investment in energy efficiency and industry transformation it would introduce an independent 5billion energy security and modernisation fund to build and upgrade australia s energy transmission and distribution systems to help households slash energy bills and move to clean energy a shorten government would provide 2 000 rebates to reduce the cost of battery systems it would invest 100million in a neighbourhood renewables program so that renters and social housing residents could also benefit from cheaper and cleaner renewables mr shorten said a labor government would provide 1 000 grants of up to 20 000 to australian manufacturers to help them reduce their energy usage what we will do is create the right environment for downward pressure on prices he said we are bullish about renewable technology and storage technology but coal and gas are still going to be important energy sources for australia in the future as will be coal exports i don t think people are inherently scared of change mr shorten says they re scared of change where they don t know where they fit in they re scared of financial uncertainty borders terror and trump labor would keep people smugglers out of business and maintain australia s strong borders ensuring they are never able to exploit the lives of vulnerable people again it was committed to boat turnbacks when safe to do so offshore processing and regional resettlement mr shorten said labor would spend 2 per cent of gross domestic product on defence one thing i ve been diligent on in opposition is being regularly briefed and working closely with the security agencies he said we talk to them on a very regular basis mr shorten has proposed an australian merchant marine fleet and a national fuel security corporation to ensure the country had its own stocks of fuel in times of global stress the first four countries he would visit if elected prime minister would be new zealand papua new guinea indonesia and east timor because the best security i can give my kids and my grandkids is a good neighbourhood he said mr shorten said he would have no trouble working with united states president donald trump years ago i said that some of his views are barking mad and i was referring to his analysis of the late john mccain he said and some of his comments on women he s the person the americans have chosen i ll be professional and polite and i ve done enough negotiations over time this government essentially for five years has only had a couple of plans labor leader bill shorten says of the federal coalition crack down on welfare and give big business a tax cut immigration mr shorten mocked the government s announcement that it would cap permanent migration at 160 000 for the next four years they ve said that they re going to decrease the immigration intake of permanent citizens by 1 3 per cent he said has anyone raised with them that you only took 162 000 last year we ve got to make sure that we don t bring people in when we haven t got the infrastructure immigration s important because that net population growth is what gives us taxpayers gives us workers but we shouldn t do it in the big city do it without actually making sure that we re looking after our own resources first what we do think though is that we shouldn t be blaming a couple of thousand migrants for government cuts to hospitals and schools when you re sitting in traffic in western sydney or south eastern suburbs of melbourne or coming in from werribee it s not some refugee on manus who s your issue it s a government who won t properly fund infrastructure in melbourne or sydney it s a government who won t properly fund your schools or hospitals labor is promising an extra 14billion the equivalent of 13 000 more teachers for public schools over the next decade which it described as the biggest ever investment in schools education labor has promised to deliver an extra 14billion the equivalent of 13 000 more teachers for public schools over the next decade which it described as the biggest ever investment in public schools it would also introduce a two year national preschool and kindy program guaranteeing about 700 000 australian children a year would be able to access subsidised preschool a 1 75billion investment would allow every three year old in australia access to 15 hours a week of subsidised early childhood education and extend the current arrangement for four year olds accessing preschool an almost 10billion plan would uncap university student places giving an extra 200 000 australians the chance to go to university labor would scrap upfront fees for 100 000 tafe students and ensure one in 10 jobs on commonwealth priority projects were filled by australian apprentices if you look at our education system i want more kids to be able to go to university mr shorten said we re going to create 200 000 extra spots over the next 10 years i want more people doing apprenticeships so we re going to pay the up front portion of 100 000 tafe apprentices labor will invest in every public hospital with an extra 2 8billion in funding for more beds and shorter surgery wait times reversing cuts would mean more beds doctors and nurses health labor would invest in every public hospital with an extra 2 8billion in funding for more beds and shorter surgery wait times reversing coalition cuts would mean more beds in emergency departments and wards more doctors more nurses and more health staff mr shorten said mr shorten said under the coalition the national average waiting time for elective surgery was the longest on record and the number of hospital beds available for elderly australians had hit new lows labor would invest 170million in medicare for comprehensive heart health checks and 80million to boost the number of mri machines it would cap the price increases of private health insurers at 2 per cent for two years a shorten government would provide 12million towards ovarian cancer australia s plan for research potentially preventing 2 500 cases of breast cancer and 800 cases of ovarian cancer labor would provide a record boost for type 1 diabetes research by investing 50million in clinical trials and supporting researchers in their quest for a cure mr shorten said labour would reverse the cuts to hospitals and unfreeze the patient rebate we re going to invest more in our health system so we close the out of pocket gaps
since the global synchronized growth of 2017 economic conditions have been gradually weakening and will produce an across the board deceleration in the months ahead beyond that the prospect for markets and national economies will depend on a broad range of factors some of which do not bode well by dr nouriel roubini professor of economics and international business robert stansky research faculty fellow leonard n stern school of business new york university after the synchronized global economic expansion of 2017 came the asynchronous growth of 2018 when most countries other than the united states started to experience slowdowns worries about us inflation the us federal reserve s policy trajectory ongoing trade wars italian budget and debt woes china s slowdown and emerging market fragilities led to a sharp fall in global equity markets toward the end of the year the good news at the start of 2019 is that the risk of an outright global recession is low the bad news is that we are heading into a year of synchronized global deceleration growth will fall toward and in some cases below potential in most regions to be sure the year started with a rally in risky assets us and global equities after the bloodbath of the last quarter of 2018 when worries about fed interest rate hikes and about chinese and us growth tanked many markets since then the fed has pivoted toward renewed dovishness the us has maintained solid growth and china s macroeconomic easing has shown some promise of containing the slowdown there whether these relatively positive conditions last will depend on many factors the first thing to consider is the fed markets are now pricing in the fed s monetary policy pause for the entire year but the us labor market remains robust were wages to accelerate and produce even moderate inflation above 2 fears of at least two more rate hikes this year would return possibly shocking markets and leading to a tightening of financial conditions that in turn will revive concerns about us growth second as the slowdown in china continues the government s current mix of modest monetary credit and fiscal stimulus could prove inadequate given the lack of private sector confidence and high levels of overcapacity and leverage if worries about a chinese slowdown resurface markets could be severely affected on the other hand a stabilization of growth would duly renew market confidence a related factor is trade while an escalation of the sino american conflict would hamper global growth a continuation of the current truce via a deal on trade would reassure markets even as the two countries geopolitical and technology rivalry continues to build over time fourth the eurozone is slowing down and it remains to be seen whether it is heading toward lower potential growth or something worse the outcome will be determined both by national level variables such as political developments in france italy and germany and broader regional and global factors obviously a hard brexit would negatively affect business and investor confidence in the united kingdom and the european union alike us president donald trump extending his trade war to the european automotive sector would severely undercut growth across the eu not just in germany finally much will depend on how euroskeptic parties fare in the european parliament elections this may and that in turn will add to the uncertainties surrounding european central bank president mario draghi s successor and the future of eurozone monetary policy fifth america s dysfunctional domestic politics could add to uncertainties globally the recent government shutdown suggests that every upcoming negotiation over the budget and the debt ceiling will turn into a partisan war of attrition an expected report from the special counsel robert mueller may or may not lead to impeachment proceedings against trump and by the end of the year the fiscal stimulus from the republican tax cuts will become a fiscal drag possibly weakening growth sixth equity markets in the us and elsewhere are still overvalued even after the recent correction as wage costs rise weaker us earnings and profit margins in the coming months could be an unwelcome surprise with highly indebted firms facing the possibility of rising short and long term borrowing costs and with many tech stocks in need of further corrections the danger of another risk off episode and market correction can t be ruled out seventh oil prices may be driven down by a coming supply glut owing to shale production in the us a potential regime change in venezuela leading to expectations of greater production over time and failures by opec countries to cooperate with one another to constrain output while low oil prices are good for consumers they tend to weaken us stocks and markets in oil exporting economies raising concerns about corporate defaults in the energy and related sectors as happened in early 2016 finally the outlook for many emerging market economies will depend on the aforementioned global uncertainties the chief risks include slowdowns in the us or china higher us inflation and a subsequent tightening by the fed trade wars a stronger dollar and falling oil and commodity prices though there is a cloud over the global economy the silver lining is that it has made the major central banks more dovish starting with the fed and the people s bank of china and quickly followed by the european central bank the bank of england the bank of japan and others still the fact that most central banks are in a highly accommodative position means that there is little room for additional monetary easing and even if fiscal policy wasn t constrained in most regions of the world stimulus tends to come only after a growth stall is already underway and usually with a significant lag there may be enough positive factors to make this a relatively decent if mediocre year for the global economy but if some of the negative scenarios outlined above materialize the synchronized slowdown of 2019 could lead to a global growth stall and sharp market downturn in 2020 originally published by project

u s review resiliency in the face of uncertainty the u s economy continues to show a great deal of resiliency in the face of slowing global economic growth and a whole host of geopolitical uncertainty falling long term interest rates have raised fears about a recession but have also halted the slide in home sales consumer confidence fell in march as consumers expressed less optimism about employment conditions plans to purchase cars and homes both rose notably regional production indices weakened in march but remain at levels consistent with modest economic growth what lies beyond the soft first quarter today marks the last business day of an exceptionally soft first quarter we estimate that real gdp grew at a 1 4 annual rate during the quarter largely due to the weakness in consumer spending and housing at the end of 2018 and at the start of this year the federal government shutdown also negatively impacted q1 growth as did weaker global economic growth and lingering uncertainty surrounding geopolitical events such as brexit and ongoing trade negotiations with china through all of this uncertainty the u s economy has continued to show a great deal of resiliency the downward revision to q4 gdp growth to a 2 2 annual rate effectively lowered the bar for the current quarter which should make it easier to meet our modest growth expectations the trade deficit also shrank sharply in january which should boost q1 growth most data through february show the economy losing momentum income growth has been surprisingly weak with personal income rising just 0 2 in february after declining 0 1 the prior month most of the weakness was in farm income and income from interest and dividends wages and salaries rose 0 3 in both january and february tax payments also apparently jumped in january resulting in a 0 2 drop in real after tax income the softer income data may explain the recent dip in consumer confidence which fell 7 3 points in march but remains at a fairly lofty level the hangover from the government shutdown has the statistical agencies playing catch up only nominal income data are available through february the latest real personal consumption data are for january and they rose just 0 1 following a 0 6 drop in december much of january s weakness in january was in durable goods which plunged 1 6 with incomes growing slowly tax refunds running late and easter falling late this year the risks to q1 spending are stacked to the downside for our 1 7 forecast any shortfall would at least partially result in higher inventories mitigating some of the damage to q1 growth inflation continues to run slightly below the fed s objective the overall pce deflator fell 0 1 in january and prices excluding food and energy rose just 0 1 on a year over year basis the core pce deflator the fed s preferred price gauge is up just 1 8 the lack of inflationary pressure gives the fed plenty of latitude in holding off on any additional rate hikes softer economic news combined with the drop in long term interest rates has produced an inverted yield curve with the yield on the 10 year treasury note falling below the three month t bill on an ominous note every recession for the past 60 years has been preceded by an inverted yield curve every inverted yield curve however has not been followed by a recession fortunately the u s economy is slowing from a fairly strong position employment growth has been fairly strong unemployment is low and household balance sheets are relatively healthy the key areas to watch are the more cyclical areas of the economy most notably motor vehicle sales home sales and factory orders all of which are losing steam u s outlook retail sales monday after the largest monthly decline since the great recession retail sales rose a modest 0 2 in january excluding volatile components the control group rebounded 1 1 in january but that wasn t enough to make up for the cratering in this measure at the end of last year consumer fundamentals have shown some signs of weakness this morning we learned that income growth has been surprisingly weak with personal income rising just 0 2 in february consumer confidence also slipped 7 3 points in march indicating consumers have still not fully found their footing after the stock market selloff late last year given these developments and the more measured start to the year for retail sales consumer spending looks poised to slow well below 2 in the first quarter however we still hold our view that this will not cause a prolonged retrenchment in consumer spending previous 0 2 wells fargo 0 2 consensus 0 3 month over month ism man ism non man mon wed the ism non manufacturing index to be released on wednesday rose three points to 59 7 in february

slowest pace of factory sector activity since 2016 this key gauge of manufacturing momentum appears to have rolled over however that has happened twice in this cycle without a subsequent recession and

failed to find a path forward for brexit this week parliament had an opportunity to vote on a number of alternative options but none received a majority of votes while prime minister may s deal still seems to lack enough support to pass the risk of a nodeal exit and a general election are rising it was a busy week for mexico where the central bank signaled it was in no rush to start cutting interest rates high real interest rates are likely keeping a lid on growth in mexico s economy which also faces challenges from flat demand for autos and ongoing declines in oil production still no clear path forward for brexit the past week featured nearly constant headlines about brexit and yet despite all the back and forth we know nothing more than we did a week ago u k parliament had a chance on wednesday to hold a series of indicative votes on alternative paths forward for the brexit process these were non binding votes but it was widely expected that any plan favored by a majority of members of parliament mps would be implemented by theresa may s government however none of the options received a majority of votes and attention is now shifting back toward may s original brexit deal may vowed to resign if her deal is approved but that does not seem to have swayed enough mps to pass her deal where does that leave things the default legal option as it currently stands is for the united kingdom to leave the e u without a deal on april 12 before then mps must either approve may s deal propose an alternative plan to deliver brexit or seek a longer extension to the article 50 deadline perhaps several years which could open the door to new elections or a second referendum another round of voting and debates in parliament on alternative plans is expected to take place on monday elsewhere in europe activity and sentiment figures for the eurozone were mixed but showed some green shoots germany s march ifo business confidence index recovered to a still low 99 6 top chart the first increase in six months while annual retail sales growth unexpectedly perked up to 4 7 in february still overall economic confidence for the eurozone softened a bit more than expected to 105 5 in march with declines in industrial and services confidence overall it seems that the eurozone economy will remain soft for now and interest rates will likely remain at or near current levels for quite some time perhaps acknowledging that rates would remain negative for an extended period european central bank ecb president draghi this week noted that the central bank would consider measures to mitigate the side effects of negative rates one option that has been discussed would be a tiered deposit system where only a certain portion of commercial bank excess reserves would be subject to negative interest rates currently all excess reserves of commercial banks are subject to a rate of 0 40 however ecb policymakers have had mixed comments on such a policy suggesting it is far from a done deal finally turning to emerging markets mexico s central bank held its overnight rate steady at 8 25 as expected but was more hawkish than anticipated noting inflation risks were still to the upside it seems the mexican economy will not be receiving much relief from high real interest rates anytime soon data released this week showed economic activity rose just 1 3 in the year through january while retail sales climbed just 0 9 middle chart as we wrote in a longer form piece earlier this week mexico s economy is also facing weaker auto demand from its neighbor to the north bottom

important insight into the performance of the economy during a month characterized by the most acute uncertainty over the brexit process the pmis for both the manufacturing and services sectors are only modestly above 50 and somewhat at odds with surprisingly resilient hard economic data nowhere is that dichotomy more apparent than the services sector with a pmi reading of just 51 3 even as retail sales have accelerated in recent months the picture manufacturing is a bit more consistent as output has weakened considerably and sentiment remains soft with the manufacturing pmi currently standing at just 52 0 in our view the longer the uncertainty of brexit drags on the more negative it will become for the economy and the more it will affect the hard data and sentiment data alike previous 52 0 manufacturing 51 3 services consensus 51 3 manufacturing 51 0 services eurozone retail sales wednesday the eurozone economy has been slowing for several months now and fears of a recession in the currency bloc are rising looking at the components of domestic demand consumer spending has been the weakest component with sequential growth of just 0 2 not annualized in q4 2018 and just 0 1 in the prior quarter these data are somewhat at odds with the retail sales figures which have been a bit more resilient and are even harder to square with solid consumer fundamentals in the eurozone wage growth has picked up meaningfully in recent quarters and employment growth remains solid implying strong income growth inflation jumped toward the second half of last year amid higher oil prices but has receded more recently suggesting real incomes have improved we remain of the view that the eurozone will avoid recession helped in large part by solid consumer fundamentals and retail sales will thus be a key activity figure to watch previous 1 3 month over month consensus 0 1 canada employment friday canada s economy has shown recent signs of weakness as q4 gdp rose just 0 4 on a sequential annualized basis that softness in growth has seemingly not yet fed into a weaker labor market however if anything employment growth has picked up in recent months while wage growth has rebounded and the jobless rate remains fairly low to be sure the mix of full time jobs and part time jobs has worsened a bit in recent months but full time job growth is still solid going forward the labor market will be a key signal to watch for whether canada s economy will hold up amid rising risks including housing market weakness and still subdued oil prices wage growth could be particularly important to watch given concerns around elevated consumer indebtedness especially as it relates to mortgage debt solid real wage gains would help offset some of the burden of higher interest rates as consumers pay off their mortgages previous 55 9k consensus 10 0k point of view interest rate watch what is going on in the u s treasury market u s treasury markets have been on a wild ride over the past week or so treasury yields on securities maturing between two and ten years have fallen about 25 bps since the day before the fed meeting accelerating what has already been a steep decline in yields over the past six months as recently as november the 10 year treasury was yielding about 3 25 while today it stands just below 2 40 a softer growth and inflation outlook has likely played a role in the falling yields but the biggest driver has probably been the extent to which all future fed tightening has been removed from the bond market back in november fed funds futures implied that markets were pricing in a bit more than two rate hikes in 2019 today fed funds futures imply markets are priced for a bit more than one cut in 2019 this amounts to a net swing of roughly 80bps middle chart a significant move that has weighed on yields across the treasury curve going out a bit further the story does not change much as fed funds futures currently imply roughly another 40 bps in easing in 2020 a secondary driver was the fed s somewhat dovish approach to ending balance sheet reductions the fed announced last week that it would stop reducing the size of its balance sheet at the end of q3 our forecast had been for the unwind to end one quarter later furthermore the fed chose to reduce the cap on its treasury redemptions by 15 billion a month starting in may though individually neither of these moves were particularly large their cumulative impact was probably enough to reduce the supply of treasury securities available to the market in 2019 by roughly 150 billion relative to our baseline will yields continue to decline we believe the answer is no we do not expect the fed to cut rates in 2019 and we expect foreign central banks like the european central bank and the bank of england to begin tightening either late this year or in the first half of 2020 that said it will be difficult for yields to rise too much unless expectations for fed policy dramatically reverse course or the term premium reemerges from hibernation credit market insights mortgage rates head south the average rate on a conventional 30 year mortgage fell 22 bps over the past week the largest weekly decline since 2008 after reaching a cycle high of 4 8 in november rates have plunged to 4 1 bringing residential financing costs down to the lowest level in more than a year the fed s dovish pivot has reverberated throughout credit markets worldwide sovereign bond yields across the developed world have fallen dramatically in recent weeks as investors sift through indications of weakening economic momentum and shifting central bank intentions the 10 year treasury yield has fallen below 2 4 and now sits below the yield on the three month t bill while the inversion of the yield curve will spark fears of a recession the outlook for the housing sector during this key buying season has become sunnier mortgage applications bounced 8 9 last week and should continue to trend up as lower rates filter through to prospective buyers with prices stretching affordability so thin a drop in rates particularly of this magnitude can induce marginal buyers to re enter the market we have also seen a surge in refinancing activity as homeowners aim to lock in these lower rates implied interest rate volatility has surged this past week as markets increasingly price in a fed rate cut despite officials maintaining they are merely on hold nevertheless the decline in mortgage rates is significant and should be sufficient to stem the decline in housing we observed through the end of last year topic of the week inverted yield curve is it different this time yields on 10 year treasury notes fell below yields on three month treasury bills at the end of last week resulting in an inversion of this measure of the yield curve for the first time since 2007 the front end of the curve inverted in december but the inversion of the 10 year three month is a more widely recognized omen for recession this week we examined the recent inversion of the yield curve and what it suggests for economic growth is it different this time first the degree of yield curve inversion at present is insignificant relative to prior cycles putting the recent inversion of the yield curve into perspective the curve inverted 17 months before the start of the great recession and the spread fell to as much as 60 bps in early 2017 during the previous cycle the curve inverted eight months before the start of the recession and the spread fell to nearly 100 bps in late 2000 the curve would need to invert significantly and remain inverted for weeks if not months before it would be a reliable recession signal recent comments from dallas fed president robert kaplan and st louis fed president james bullard reiterate this point in an interview this week kaplan said i d need to see an inversion of some magnitude and or some duration while bullard said on thursday i think you would have to get a wider variety of spreads to be inverted and it would have to stay inverted and be meaningfully inverted for a while when discussing if the recent inversion was a negative signal there is also some question about unique factors that may make the yield curve more dynamic compared to prior inversions the purchase of treasury securities by the fed as part of its quantitative easing program collapsed the term premium on longer dated treasury bonds that means the yield on the 10 year treasury is arguably lower than it otherwise would be furthermore the yield curve is really the only indicator signaling trouble at present we would need to see further sustained inversion along with generalized restriction in financial conditions in conjunction with deterioration in economic fundamentals before we become truly worried

share all sharing options for the big divide among 2020 democrats over trade and why it matters it s a pretty safe bet that no candidate is going to campaign as a free trader in the 2020 democratic primary setting up the potential for a large scale realignment on a major policy issue for the party the democratic party faces a fork in the road on an issue where president donald trump has scrambled all the old alliances i think we re at a tipping point says thea lee who leads the lefty economic policy institute which is skeptical of free trade agreements you could see democrats retreat to their comfort blanket my hope is we can convince people that s not an option we re not going to go back to the status quo ante what we need to do is have a forward looking vision former democratic presidents bill clinton and barack obama in part because of their decision to work with congressional republicans put the party on the path of free trade they pursued trade liberalization in service of embracing global competition the left s dire warnings of jobs shipping overseas went unheeded then trump staged a protectionist takeover of the republican party on his way to the white house conversations with aides to 2020 contenders show democrats are all over the map on trade there s a contingent of vocal trade skeptics like sens elizabeth warren and bernie sanders who are making the case that trump despite all his tough talk on trade has not been aggressive enough to protect american workers and failed to live up to his promises trade friendly democrats like former rep beto o rourke and former vice president joe biden could stake out more of a clinton obama esque free trade position in this debate stuck between are the likes of kamala harris and pete buttigieg harris particularly has had to answer to the demands of a global california economy without alienating the left wing grassroots one chart from the peterson institute breaks down the 2020 democratic field the institute s experts observed democratic contenders offer widely different perspectives on us trade policy and thus on us engagement with the world in a post trump era democrats are on the cusp of a fundamental reorientation for their trade agenda how 2020 democrats respond to trump s brinksmanship will go a long way to define the united states future role in the global economy trade is one issue where the president has a lot of freedom to set his or her own agenda once in office even if a president ultimately needs congress to ratify new trade deals giving the democratic left a real chance to reorient the country s trade policy if one of their candidates prevails democrats have been trade skeptical for a long time manufacturing jobs have dropped precipitously in the united states over the past 50 years thousands of american workers were left unemployed when the massive gm plant in lordstown ohio closed while the company has been increasing production in mexico and when the textile industry in north carolina moved to cheaper labor markets in brazil china vietnam and bangladesh the labor unions decimated by that macroeconomic trend make up an important piece of any democratic primary coalition trade skeptics point to multinational companies moving us jobs overseas as one of the material consequences of us trade agreements an argument trump adopted during the general election and in the white house progressives believe free trade has done more to line corporate pockets than protect workers or the climate do trade agreements protect multinational corporations that want to outsource and earn big profits and not be subject to a lot of annoying government regulations or should they protect workers and consumers and the environment lee says i would argue right now we don t have the rules right we ve adopted a very corporate approach to trade democrats have always been more skeptical of trade but a reorientation at the top of the party in the 1990s led the two most recent democratic presidents to aggressively pursue free trade deals before that republicans were the ones seeking the free trade agreements with a narrower sliver of mainstream democrats joining them over the objections of their left wing the north american free trade agreement despite trump s claim that it was given to us by bill clinton was originally negotiated by republican president george h w bush nearly half of the house democratic conference along with a handful of conservative republicans voted against it labor and environmental groups decried the deal as too weak and many feared the jobs that would be sent overseas even the two top democrats house majority leader richard gephardt and house majority whip david bonior opposed it at the time likewise the central america free trade agreement cafta george w bush s expansion of nafta passed in 2005 almost entirely with republican support only 15 democrats signed on to it and the trans pacific partnership a behemoth trade deal between countries bordering the pacific ocean including the united states mexico canada japan vietnam australia and chile which was supposed to be obama s liberal successor to nafta died after the 2016 election on the strength of opposition from not only trump but also from progressives it became so politically untenable that hillary clinton who praised the deal during her time as obama s secretary of state withdrew her support during the primary election in 2016 her move showed that even the obama style trade liberalization was going to be a hard sell for democrats that is only truer heading into 2020 as trump s decision to rip up the old rules about trade has emboldened progressive democrats who see an opening to outflank the president on one of their core issues some democrats genuinely thought you could balance trade with populism it hasn t work out obama who had voted against cafta in his first year in the us senate railed against outsourcing jobs on the campaign trail he said he would renegotiate nafta calling it devastating and a big mistake but as president he adopted the more trade friendly stance that trade was merely a scapegoat for other economic factors globalization first and foremost a belief that permeated his administration as it went to work on the tpp deal that would eventually fail trade agreements are how you shape globalization to reflect our interests and our values mike froman who was obama s us trade representative told vox since you don t get a chance to vote on technology or even globalization trade agreements have become the scapegoat for other quite legitimate concerns about jobs and wages free trade proponents argue most of the job losses in manufacturing have actually been the byproduct of better technology not trade they assert the benefits of liberal trade are real but more diffuse lower prices for consumers on a wide range of goods namely while the drawbacks tend to be acute like when a factory closes because its production is moved elsewhere a decade ago george w bush s council of economic advisers estimated that each american household had reaped 10 000 in benefits on average that could be attributed to more liberal trade after world war ii increased trade has made the united states more productive and has contributed to large increases in the u s standard of living the report stated democrats who believe in free trade make the case that more investment in a social safety net and domestic programs would alleviate some of the populist anger over trade for example building a robust jobs retraining program would help to combat the effects of outsourcing some programs do exist trade adjustment assistance a 1960s entitlement program that has been expanded over the years offers unemployment benefits and jobs training programs but the results have been mixed younger participants typically fare better than older workers who generally suffer more financially from outsourced jobs but those who did enroll in the jobs programs did better than those who did not part of the problem is that the two sides disagree on whether they are even having the right debate it s not either or it s both lee says the comfortable fiction that trade is blameless and it s all technology is not supported by the facts how 2020 democratic candidates are positioning themselves on trade for democrats the 2020 primary will center on the question of credibility the obama and clinton compromises on trade have made hawks more cautious about other contenders with less established records the left is eyeing much of the 2020 field warily for that reason bernie sanders has opposed just about every free trade agreement that s come before congress since they got there in early 1990s elizabeth warren who fiercely opposed the tpp enjoys the same cache with the left they ll argue that trump s real record hasn t matched up to his populist rhetoric the free trade skeptics believe in those two they ve saying that stuff for a long time lee says i have less confidence in some of the people who have been all over the map and now want to appeal to voters after having been in a lot of different places that s been a pattern with democratic politicians in the past cory booker and amy klobuchar have also generally opposed free trade deals in office though it is not a signature issue for them in the same way it is for sanders and warren still booker opposed giving obama fast track authority for tpp as did klobuchar who also voted against the central american free trade agreement in 2006 biden if he runs has a worker friendly image but he will inherit the free trade mantle as a veteran of the obama administration beto o rourke voted for the tpp deal in the house which might make him unacceptable to trade hardliners though he said during his senate campaign last year that he wanted to see an improved nafta negotiated in the coming years we cannot lose that critically important relationship with mexico and canada and by extension the rest of the world o rourke said last april whether it is the energy we produce whether it is the cotton we grow whether it is the cattle we raise all of this has a connection to the rest of the world and very often is looking for a market somewhere else somewhere in the middle sits kamala harris the tpp was one of the hottest issues in politics during harris s 2016 senate campaign and harris initially declined to take a firm stance on it we want to strike a balance that allows america s economy to prosper and that s going to be about our workers and our businesses she said in april 2015 neither endorsing nor really opposing the trade deal but once rep loretta sanchez a fierce tpp critic entered the race against her harris came out against the trade pact stating it did not adequately protect us workers or the environment since then harris has sat at every intersection of the trade debate she talks about giving workers a voice and protecting american jobs but she doesn t approve of trump s protectionism a trade regime that she sees as destroying the united states international relations as well as taking a toll on consumers and manufacturers democrats will decide their post trump trade agenda in the 2020 primary in real world policy terms the debate is really about trade agreements and to some extent the world trade organization it s about which rules are set for trade and which rules are enforced trade agreements are negotiated by the administration and given preferential treatment

on specific issues like intellectual property and labor rights and environmental protections the president picks the people who wrote these trade agreements and those rules trump has not only introduced his headline grabbing tariffs but the white house has also overseen the rewriting of a north american trade agreement left wing democrats like warren and sanders do not want to go back to the obama brand of open trade policy so they have to now distinguish their protectionism which sanders popularized on the national political stage during the 2016 election from trump s some of their solutions can feel a little abstract negotiate better trade deals not far afield from what donald trump was promising during the 2016 campaign it s a weakness even lefty wonks recognize to be honest it s something i would like to see all of us on the progressive side spend a lot more time fleshing out lee says what does a progressive globalization trade agenda look going forward people have a little bit of a hard time articulating it meanwhile more free trade friendly democrats have a completely different challenge their positions on trade are easily distinguishable from trump s they largely support free trade but politically dangerous with the progressive grassroots americans broadly are actually more positive toward trade liberalization and wary of protectionism than the rhetoric from the current president or the progressive firebrands might lead you to believe there is an audience for it but not necessarily in a democratic primary

if president trump goes through with his threat to close the border with mexico arizona would feel the effects almost immediately as a border state arizona has a closer tie with mexico than many other states do and in terms of the economy trade and tourism it would feel the impact more than many other states many policy details aren t yet known and thus are difficult to predict but here are some of the possible ripple effects of closing the border how large is arizona s economic connection with mexico it s big mexico is arizona s largest trading partner the state sends 30 percent of all its exports to one country mexico that amounts to 682 million in exports over a recent three month period according to research by the eller college of management at the university of arizona mexico

table grapes from mexico is expected through june would a border shutdown affect retail trade and local tax collections yes mexicans regularly cross the border to go shopping especially in the southern part of arizona before returning home border communities such as nogales arizona depend on sales taxes paid by mexican shoppers as a key source of revenue they often are the first to feel the impact of a decline in retail trade and also feel it more heavily that other areas of the state retailers in the u s border cities know how critical mexican residents who cross the border and shop for food clothing auto parts and other retail items on the american side are for their business revenues wrote vera pavlakovich kochi an associate professor of geography at the university of arizona in a february update city and county governments on the border are also cognizant of the contribution of mexican shoppers to their sales tax revenues she added how would travel tourism be affected a true shutdown would imply nobody could traverse the border by car bus or on foot heading either north or south arizona businesses such as hotels restaurants and various stores could feel the pinch from a drop off of foreign tourists americans seeking to hit the beach in rocky point or other mexican vacation destinations also might need to adjust their itineraries and perhaps more troublesome how would americans currently vacationing in mexico return home and vice versa holy week is probably the biggest annual travel holiday for mexican visitors and shoppers this year s holy week falls april 14 21 so the timing of a border closure or any change that creates lengthy delays could have big consequences for businesses all the way north to tucson including hotels shops and restaurants who see a noticeable boon during this period especially on easter weekend a border shutdown implies land transportation would be impacted but could it also be extended to airline travel even if trump allowed airline flights to continue the directive could push up the price of airline tickets as flying would be the only realistic way to move from one country to the other what other fallout might a border shutdown have the mexican peso might drop relative to the dollar given the much larger importance the u s exerts on mexico s economy rather than the other way around ironically a shift in currency values could worsen america s trade deficit with mexico by making items made in mexico cheaper to american buyers assuming importers could find a way to get them across a closed border a border shutdown also could push down u s stock prices and otherwise rattle financial markets which have been skittish when trade disputes percolate to the surface that could affect 401 k retirement accounts and other investments held by millions of americans above all investors businesses and consumers dislike uncertainty a shutdown might unnerve a lot of people on both sides of the border and prod them to put commercial and personal plans on hold the business community thought north american trade had been ironed out when negotiations representing the u s mexico and canada agreed to replace nafta with a new trade pact now it could be back on the front burner reach the reporters at russ wiles arizonarepublic com or 602 444 8616 or rafael carranza arizonarepublic com

associated press president donald trump s latest pick to help lead the federal reserve has received a rocky reception with top economists raising several red flags about whether stephen moore is qualified to be a governor of the world s most influential central bank moore is a former trump campaign adviser who helped design the 2017 tax cuts and the co authored trumponomics the economists say moore poses the distinct risk of injecting politics into an institution that strives to remain free of political influence when setting short term interest rates that can determine the path of employment inflation and overall growth he s merely a propagandist as far as i can tell said menzie chinn an economist at the university of wisconsin he makes just egregious mistakes in fact and theory advertisement even a prominent republican economist criticized the choice of moore after trump s announcement last week steve is a perfectly amiable guy but he does not have the intellectual gravitas for this important job harvard university economist greg mankiw said in a blog post mankiw a former chairman of the white house council of economic advisers for president george w bush added it is time for senators sic to do their job mr moore should not be confirmed still other prominent conservative voices are rallying to moore the wall street journal for which moore was once an editorial writer has endorsed him in a new editorial asserting that he might be a useful counter to the group think among fed officials the endorsement asserted that the remarkable cascade of derision and condescension from academic economists on moore s nomination is itself evidence that he should be a fed governor moore who has been affiliated with multiple conservative groups including the heritage foundation has taken a series of controversial stances about the fed despite acknowledging that he still needs to learn about how the regulator works he previously said that the fed should be scrapped in favor of the gold standard he called on the fed to hike rates during the great recession a move that could have further crippled the united states and he recently said that fed chairman jerome powell should be fired for rate hikes last year that in his opinion undermined the gains from trump s tax cuts the controversy took on a new dimension on wednesday when it was reported that he had a lien of more than 75 000 filed against him in january 2018 for unpaid taxes moore did not respond to an interview request for this report but in an interview friday with fox news moore said he was in the middle of a dispute with the irs in which he believed the irs owed him money but that it was taking a long time to get a resolution of the matter with the agency they owe us money we don t owe them moore said moore argued that he would not be unduly influenced by trump if the senate confirms him for the fed board he said he was looking forward to discussing economic issues with powell someone he has not met i will just tell him if we get the monetary policy right on top of the tax cuts and the deregulation this economy is going to soar moore said i am going to say chairman powell you are going to be a hero if you get this right a u s official familiar with the matter said moore s background check a requirement of the nomination process was still underway his nomination has not been sent to the senate the official insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations but the president is likely to stick with moore after having been disappointed by his decision to make powell chairman said dan clifton a partner at the advisory firm strategas clifton noted that the fed has since backed off plans for rate hikes in 2019 suggesting that moore was correct in his criticism of powell in an opinion piece in the wall street journal regardless of public criticism trump supports steve and is willing to go to bat for him clifton said when has establishment criticism stopped trump before especially when it comes to someone trump personally respects moore fits a profile of trump nominees who have largely been radio and television pundits who defended the president only to then get elevated to roles as policymakers their new jobs involve nuances trade offs and tough analysis that seldom make for snappy soundbites larry kudlow for example segued from being a commentator on cnbc to director of the white house national economic council but decades of moore s public statements might now haunt him during the nomination process to be one of seven fed governors my concern with stephen is actually not so much what he knows but the fact that he claimed to know things that weren t so said george selgin director of the center for monetary and financial alternatives at the libertarian cato institute a washington think tank selgin noted that moore has suggested that the fed set rates based off changes in commodity prices mistakenly claiming that former fed chairman paul volcker was guided by this principle when fighting a wave of inflation during the early 1980s moore has at times been openly hostile to the idea of a central bank saying that the united states should return to a gold standard an idea openly dismissed by past fed leaders such as ben bernanke as inefficient and unworkable in the current global economy we have got to get rid of the federal reserve and move towards a gold standard in this country moore said at a 2015 event for the conservative group freedomworks that is available on youtube for his part moore claimed to be baffled by the criticism saying that in a radio interview for tim constantine s capitol hill show that any attacks come from a minority of economists who likely object to his loyalty to trump i can t explain why that is moore said i think some are just trump haters but the critiques from the economic community have often stemmed from his past policy statements not just his praise of the president s physique and tax cuts in 2008 moore argued for the fed to raise interest rates as the economy crumpled during the great recession saying on glenn beck s cnn show that the fed should get less dollars out in the economy the fed instead slashed rates to near zero and pumped money into the economy in order to boost spending investment and halt the worst downturn since the great depression the controversial and unprecedented move by the fed is now generally seen as helping to rescue the battered u s economy if the fed had followed moore s advice the economy would still be mired in recession and we may have dragged the global economy down with us said justin wolfers an economist at the university of michigan ___ ap economics writer martin crutsinger contributed to this report copyright

download our complete 2019 state of the industry report here it s difficult to know where to begin print promo s 2019 state of the industry report for the past two years one man has overshadowed the political stage donald j trump long before the 45th president of the u s vowed to make america great again he didn t hold back when it came to pro business stances something that resonated with executives across all segments including the printing industry we can cull through the vast amount of attention grabbing headlines during this time period or analyze the promised policies that can change with a tweet from the trump white house but what we re left with right now is a new 116th congress and a divided government with democrats having taken control of the u s house of representatives and republicans maintaining hold of the u s senate the chances of legislative gridlock or political posturing translating to substantive policy changes are slim but as warrendale pennsylvania s printing industries of america s pia center for print economics and management and government affairs and advocacy pointed out in its own 2019 state of the industry report there are bipartisan lawmaking opportunities on policy issues impacting print four of those issues include the impact of tax reform tariffs and trade issues u s postal service financial instability print and promotional products industry recruitment tax reform signed into law on dec 22 2017 h r 1 the tax cuts and jobs act brought with it great implications for the industry we asked two print association economists if they felt it succeeded in delivering the economic benefit that was hoped and their responses were mostly favorable in general the tax cuts especially the corporate tax cuts have had a very positive impact on the economy and print said dr ronnie h davis pia s senior vice president and chief economist i believe the impact on the economy has been to increase growth in gdp by around 0 5 the impact on print has been slightly less perhaps a boost of around 0 3 in printing shipments above the baseline before the cuts andrew d paparozzi chief economist for specialty graphic imaging association sgia fairfax va was more guarded in his optimism it s impossible to know precisely how any one factor affects the american economy because there s no way to hold all the other factors constant he explained but incentives matter increase the incentive to do something by increasing return and lower costs and you get more of it the reductions in personal corporate and pass through business taxes in the act increased the incentive to invest and hire it s unlikely the economy and employment would have grown as rapidly without it as for whether they believed print service providers psps took advantage of tax saving opportunities both men said the data were limited specifically in regard to labor saving machinery acquisitions i haven t tried to measure it paparozzi admitted and tax savings alone are never enough to justify a capital investment but capital investments that maximize speed and efficiency are essential in the printing industry where competition is intensifying despite ongoing consolidation anything that lowers the cost of those investments will help on the margin but again you have to be able to justify the investment based on expected return over its life not a one time tax savings davis however attributed the combination of faster economic growth increased print sales and tax advantages to a boost in investments in plants and equipment one thing is certain there is no better predictor of 2019 trends than the direction of the overall economy even in spite of heightened trade tensions and the beginning of the longest government shutdown on record the economy continues to fare well thanks to an assist from legislation such as h r 1 which is good news for print as forecasts are finalized by sgia s estimates total commercial printing industry sales all sources for 2018 increased 1 8 to 85 4 billion in line with the association s expectations paparozzi clarified that this figure was 11 0 greater than the 2011 low but still 13 2 less than the 2007 pre great recession total he forecasted growth of 1 5 to 2 5 in 2019 the industry continues to grow slowly and prices continue to firm paparozzi remarked but profitability is being squeezed by a number of factors including rising paper prices the rising cost of health care benefits rising wages and difficulty recruiting productive skilled personnel due to both exceptionally tight labor markets and print s old economy image davis proposed similar figures for 2019 with print markets growing around 2 at the present time a very healthy pace from a historical perspective he noted this makes sense considering that print does best in a mature economic recovery phase of the business cycle we have been in this phase for a decade now to provide some perspective average recoveries post world war ii last roughly six to seven years davis did warn that the risk of recession has increased since we ve entered the 10th year of recovery in fact his latest forecast put the odds of a recession in 2019 at approximately 30 from pia s 2019 state of the industry findings the downside risks that could lead to slower growth scenarios and ultimately a recession are trade restrictions barriers labor shortages coupled with immigration restrictions total number quantity and quality age bottlenecks such as transportation costs and price pressures heightened interest rates from inflation and increases in deficit other wildcard issues i am generally optimistic for print in both the short and longer run davis said in the short run as long as the economy holds up and stays out of recession print markets should continue to grow at a 2 pace tariffs and trade issues as outlined in pia s 2019 state of the industry report the section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum will continue to be a major issue for printers via the report such tariffs have been used largely as a bargaining chip for larger administration trade priorities like passage of usmca u s mexico canada agreement aka the new nafta or a deal with china pia members have felt the added cost impact of such tariffs particularly aluminum imported from the eu to make lithographic printing plates major print equipment suppliers announced that the u s department of commerce had granted exclusion allowing for retroactive refunds of such tariffs that had been assessed as 10 pass through surcharges to many pia members however such exclusions are only good for one year and not guaranteed to be renewed thus uncertainty surrounding tariffs on inputs will continue mark nuzzaco former vice president of government affairs at aptech the association for print technologies formerly npes reston va told patrick henry senior editor of printing impressions the sister publication of print promo that there are three categories of tariffs affecting the printing industry anti dumping and countervailing duties imposed by the trump administration on uncoated groundwood imported from canada the previously mentioned tariffs on imported aluminum and steel and a series of duties on chinese made machinery some of which have included printing equipment he points out that in all cases the exporters aren t the ones paying the penalties henry wrote the cost burden falls on the end users of the imported goods at press time president trump announced the country s plans to extend the deadline for reaching a trade deal with china beyond the previously set march 1 in a series of tweets dated feb 24 he wrote i am pleased to report that the u s has made substantial progress in our trade talks with china on important structural issues including intellectual property protection technology transfer agriculture services currency and many other issues as a result of these very productive talks i will be delaying the u s increase in tariffs now scheduled for march 1 assuming both sides make additional progress we will be planning a summit for president xi and myself at mar a

china download our complete 2019 state of the industry report here for our in depth conversation with paul bellantone cae president and ceo of promotional products association international ppai irving texas u s postal service the struggle is real for the usps in a recent press release the agency disclosed a 1 5 billion net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 first class mail revenue its former monopoly product declined by 81 million or 1 2 on a volume decline of 428 million pieces or 2 8 compared to the same quarter last year we continued to drive growth in our package business and expanded use of the marketing mail channel during the quarter nevertheless we face ongoing financial challenges postmaster general and ceo megan j brennan said in a statement we remain focused on aggressive management of the business legislative reform and pricing system reform all of which are necessary to put the postal service on firm financial footing our nation is best served by a financially sustainable postal service that can invest in its future and meet the evolving mailing and shipping needs of the american public a postal service reform bill that was introduced in 2017 aimed to save the usps 10 billion over 10 years but it lost key sponsorship and failed to advance then there was the 2018 postal service reform act s 2629 which aimed to solve the prefunding problem by requiring postal retirees to enroll in medicare as their primary care provider the postal service reported a 2018 net loss of 3 9 billion an increase in net loss of 1 2 billion compared to 2017 will this be the year of reform pia noted that congressional champions of postal reform have acknowledged their willingness to restart the bipartisan big tent effort to pass legislation to modernize the financial operations of the usps that failed print and promotional products industry recruitment each year the u s department of labor s dol bureau of labor statistics lists industries and jobs that become too small or concentrated to be tracked in its current employment statistics database last month the dol unit removed printer screen printer and support activities for printing naturally industry reaction was swift pia president and ceo michael makin expressed his dissatisfaction below is an excerpt from his official statement is disappointed but not surprised to learn of the bureau of labor statistics announcement that the agency would no longer track jobs related to commercial print screen printing and support activities for printing the disappointment is shared by the approximately 800 000 workers in the printing packaging and publishing industry who go to work every morning knowing that their jobs are relevant to the nation s manufacturing economy the decision certainly isn t going to help solve the print sector s age problem human resources issues e g lack of skilled personnel lack of young blood etc are almost always cited as one of the industry s biggest challenges for the printing industry the challenge isn t simply a cyclical problem the result of the lowest unemployment rate in 49 years it s also structural an old economy image that makes it difficult to recruit young talent paparozzi said we have to make the case for our industry the sgia chief economist pointed to resources created by the print and graphics scholarship foundation like graphic communications as a career and adventures in print choose your career in graphic communications posters intended to generate interest with young people to pursue a path in print and why wouldn t they consider print although it s an industry steeped in tradition print is evolving as a media with psps transitioning with a diverse and exciting mix of processes products and ancillary services as for growth markets paparozzi turned to sgia s commercial printing panel for insight among those surveyed they saw direct mail packaging signs wraps banners and displays point of purchase advertising trending upward davis agreed adding labels to the list the print sectors under considerable pressure he said are books magazines periodicals financial legal business forms stationery and loose leaf manufacturing these sectors are competing against digital substitution davis observed however there are still opportunities for sales growth even in these sectors as the number of providers decline and those that survive gain market share a new approach when psps are positioning for the future strategic thinking is critical especially in a changing environment like print and promotional products this is where diversification comes into play in fact members of sgia s commercial printing panel expect something other than printing mailing fulfillment database creation management and analysis to support customized marketing programs etc to provide on average 25 6 of their revenue by 2020 up from 20 2 today and 16 2 two years ago paparozzi shared fewer printers are limiting themselves to traditional products and markets or that s not my business thinking he said of the ongoing trend toward convergence of print sectors more are taking a tell me more approach to that new product service process market etc what s it all about it may not be a fit for my company but i want to know more that s not to say all psps will blindly invest in print s flavor of the month if these product segments don t fit their company s vision they ll take a hard pass unfortunately it s a lesson that some panel members had to learn firsthand after entering a market that wasn t a good fit or failing to understand all that s required to diversify profitably as explained in the sgia critical trends report commercial printing it s about thinking big and thinking carefully paparozzi said thinking big means thinking beyond how print is manufactured to how it powers communication particularly personalized integrated and interactive mobile communication thinking carefully means resisting the temptation to follow the crowd into that hot new market and instead thoroughly evaluate whether that market really is an opportunity given your company s resources capabilities and circumstances

2012 finished no 2 in the 2018 rankings with 505 5 million in loan volume banosian s winning total remained consistent with the 2018 market trend toward lower volumes however the 536 4 million figure was lower than cohen s top ranking totals of 579 6 million and 631 6 million in 2017 and 2016 respectively another market trend that was reflected in the 2018 rankings was the full blown shift to a home purchase market roughly three quarters of all loans in 2018 went toward home purchases according to the mortgage bankers association mba mortgage rates jumped up last year the 30 year fixed rate mortgage hovered around the 5 percent mark before falling during the final quarter of 2018 as analysts had predicted the rising rate environment took rate and term refinancing out of play for most of last year with so many borrowers in low rate mortgages it doesn t take a lot to move the market on the refi side said joel kan mba s associate vice president of industry surveys and forecasting with a 50 basis point increase in rates we saw a considerable drop in refi volume that was one main driver of the slide nationally origination volume was estimated at 1 64 trillion in 2018 compared to 1 71 trillion in 2017 a decline of 4 percent mba reported this was largely driven by a 24 percent decline in refinance activity which fell to 458 billion in 2018 the housing market also faced headwinds this past year home sales were held back by a shortage of inventory particularly for entry level homes rising rates and purchase prices also hampered affordability overall sales of existing homes in

trillion down 1 percent from 1 64 trillion in 2018 according to the mortgage bankers association mba although purchase originations are expected to increase that won t make up for a continuing decline in refinance activity said joel kan mba s associate vice president of industry surveys and forecasting with the economy humming along and unemployment being so low why has the mortgage industry been so uninspiring the purchase side kan said has been held back by tight inventory there also were concerns about the overall economic picture at the end of 2018 and early 2019 the volatility that then showed up in the stock markets shook a lot of potential homebuyers sort of scared them away kan said affordability is still a challenge in many markets too we ve had so many years where home price growth has greatly exceeded income growth that there is still an affordability challenge out there kan said it s not going away it ll just be eased in the next year or two jd joel kan is associate vice president of industry surveys and forecasting mortgage bankers association fed preaches patience with rates the federal reserve raised the baseline interest rate four times in 2018 a quarter of a percentage point every three months that s on top of raising the rate three times in 2017 also a quarter percentage point each time expect the fed to be less aggressive this year the prior increases pushed 30 year fixed rate mortgages to nearly 5 percent last year according to investment decisionmaking platform ycharts that figure has softened through the beginning of this year however still a onemonth snapshot of the 30 year rate this past january was far higher than the same time period of the previous three years fed policymakers announced earlier this year that the case for raising rates had weakened at the end of last year housing industry experts expected the fed to raise the benchmark rate two times this year although that may happen the fed is preaching patience and may raise the rate only once or not at all jd price appreciation likely to decline again u s home price growth is expected to slow once again in 2019 realtor com reports with the median price of an existing home estimated to rise by 2 2 percent compared to 2018 the slowing appreciation rate is good news for potential first time homebuyers but it may be tempered by rising mortgage rates the mortgage bankers association expects rates on a 30 year fixed loan to reach 4 8 percent by the end of 2019 realtor com expects a modest inventory increase of 7 percent although many highpriced markets

confidence reached a three year low at the end of 2018 the national association of home builders nahb reported with several major home construction companies downgrading their production forecasts for 2019 although millennials are expected to continue purchasing more homes and will account for 45 percent of mortgage originations this year more than twice the share of baby boomers younger

there will be some administrative changes initiated by fhfa and treasury around the kind of lending that fannie mae and freddie mac do cash out refinances might be curtailed there might be some pullback on the caps on multifamily lending and loans to investors there is an outside chance they might look at loan limits and guarantee fees those are the most likely changes that will occur in 2019 there is going to be a legislative effort the senate banking committee released its vision broadly of what gse reform will look like it is pretty similar to where wound up in the last congress

5 percent in fourth quarter 2019 sales prices of existing homes will increase from 259 400 to 272 900 during the same time frame mba reported economists expect the housing market to slow down but not bust this year the housing market still faces inventory problems especially with more affordable housing a decline in mortgage rates earlier this year helped the market but the tax law change passed in late 2017 may hurt the market in higher value areas such as the northeast california and florida limits on mortgage interest deductions and a cap on state and local tax deductions could hit

0 3 rate to begin the year what s more the breadth of the expansion was impressive with output higher in 18 of 20 industries the strong gdp report brightened the mood of financial markets it sent bond yields and the canadian dollar higher narrowing the inversion in the yield curve and causing investors to pare back their bets on a rate cut this year payroll employment expanded by a healthy 71k in january capping an overall healthy week for canadian data u s when the downside risks loom large hang on to your hats folks with fed speeches brexit votes and a slew of economic data this week was

though q4 q4 growth was 3 consumer spending government expenditure and business investment were all revised lower while net exports showed a smaller deficit corporate profits also stalled in q4 these

from 4 6 a month earlier it also marked 10 consecutive months of slowing growth chart 2 higher mortgage rates earlier in 2018 and the past run up in home prices dented affordability however recent declines in rates smaller price gains and rising wages should result in improved activity going forward as housing demand rebounds see report on the trade front the trade deficit narrowed sharply in january from 59 9bn to 51 1bn implying less of a drag on gdp growth from net trade in 19q1 the improvement largely reflected shifting trade with china fortunately there appears to be some progress in negotiations china is offering concessions on technology related issues which had been a major sticking point for u s negotiators trade talks continue in washington next week across the pond the brexit saga continued to unfold leaving a lingering air of uncertainty the uk s parliament failed to come to a consensus on alternatives to the withdrawal agreement on wednesday out of eight options proposed not one was able to garner the needed majority parliament voted for a third time against the deal today the day britain was originally set to leave prime minister may who offered her resignation in exchange for support continues to face an uphill battle to consolidate opinion on a deal debate on a deal is expected to continue next week lastly a parade of fed speakers made the rounds this week among them chicago fed president evans echoed sentiments expressed in last week s fed statement a rate hike for 2019 is likely not in the cards while his philadelphia counterpart patrick harker suggested one hike could be appropriate all told policy normalization at the fed is quite likely nearly complete as rising global risks leave the u s exposed to foreign shocks canada strong gdp print brightens the mood in markets after a steady diet of pessimism had permeated financial markets in recent weeks the mood was brightened to end this week the improved sentiment came courtesy of a robust january gdp report showing that the economy started 2019 on a much stronger footing than analysts had expected the upside surprise on gdp sent the yield on the 10 year benchmark bond up over 1 6 the strong print also caused investors to significantly pare back their bets on a rate cut this year as of writing the yield curve remains inverted the three month yield sits at about 1 67 but the gap narrowed by 5 basis points relative to where it was on monday at this juncture we remind readers that as a recession predictor the yield curve has been fairly reliable for the u s economy however it is by no means perfect see report in canada its track record is perhaps even less impressive having sent a false signal a few times chart 1 indeed when reading the recession tea leaves investors are better served by examining a range of indicators on that front january employment data from the seph released this week sent a decidedly non recessionary albeit backward looking signal indeed payroll employment expanded by a solid 71k in january the strongest gain since early 2017 and confirming the strength in the more timely lfs data that is used in calculating the unemployment rate while other aspects of the report were softer the solid jobs print had marginally positive implications for our q1 tracking elsewhere on the data front january international trade data was notably less positive for q1 growth prospects the 0 9 gain in export volumes only partially offset december s drop and was swamped by the 1 5 rise in imports while the seph and international trade data whet the appetites of analysts january s gdp report was undoubtedly the main course as noted above the report blew away expectations with the economy expanding at a healthy 0 3 pace in january the breadth of the expansion was impressive with a full 18 of 20 sectors seeing higher output in the month chart 2 the construction sector led the way where output expanded by 1 9 breaking a string of seven straight monthly declines notable gains were also recorded in manufacturing wholesale trade and utilities output amid nearly wall to wall strength the only real fly in the ointment was the mining quarrying oil and gas sector where production curtailments in alberta helped send output lower the upside surprise on gdp pushed our q1 tracking all the way up to 1 1 saar roughly in line with the bank of canada s last read in january still this below trend pace of growth is unlikely to stir any fundamental inflation pressures or require action on rates from the bank of canada in our

the broad decline in stocks the utilities sector was the only one to eke out a gain what s really giving investors concern today is this weak global economic data here in the u s and in europe said jeff kravetz regional investment director for u s bank wealth management the market s skid runs counter to what has been a strong start to the year on wall street as stocks rebounded from a steep slide at the end of 2018 the bull market for u s stocks recently marked its 10th anniversary and is now the longest ever the fear that gripped investors friday was fueled by a steadily dimming outlook

production in the euro currency alliance has fallen at its steepest rate in about six years in germany europe s largest economy a survey of purchasing manager manufacturers posted its sharpest

2019 which still counts as a blockbuster start to a year key bond yields fell this week to their lowest levels in more than a year after the federal reserve said it was seeing slower growth in the economy and no longer expected to raise interest rates this year the yield on the benchmark 10 year treasury note which is used to set rates on mortgages and many other kinds of loans is now sharply lower from its recent high of 3 23 percent in early october the prospects of slowing global economic growth has motivated investors to rebalance their holdings as they digest the new reality said marina severinovsky investment strategist at schroders we re sort of coming back to earth central banks have been positioning themselves to deal with the slowdown she said and that includes the federal reserve s expectations for no rate increases this year earlier this month the european central bank said it would push back the earliest date for interest rate increases it also said it would offer ultra cheap loans to banks supporting their ability to keep lending it s very positive that not just the fed but other policy makers have acknowledged the situation is kind of dangerous on the global slowdown and are taking action severinovsky said the decline in bond yields threatened the profitability of banks because it forces them to charge lower interest rates on loans bank of america

stephen moore president trump s choice for federal reserve governor called for raising rates and tightening monetary policy even as the economy entered the worst recession since the great depression in 2008 i happen to believe we should be raising rates not cutting them moore said at a july 2008 appearance at the libertarian freedomfest in las vegas at the time the economy had already been in a recession for half a year the national bureau of economic research would later say the labor market was hemorrhaging hundreds of thousands of jobs a month inflation then near the fed s 2 percent target was about to drop precipitously but moore then a member of the wall street journal s editorial board told the audience that he was worried about the opposite prospect a return to the soaring inflation of the 1970s when you have a tripling in the price of gold over seven years ladies and gentlemen that s a sign of two things a declining currency and high inflation to come moore said in his presentation so this is a big worry it looks just like the 1970s at the time the fed had set its short term interest target to 2 percent after lowering it through the early part of the year it wouldn t lower rates again however until october after the collapse of lehman brothers ben bernanke then the fed s chairman would later write in his memoir that it was certainly a mistake that the central bank failed to lower rates before lehman s collapse and allowed economy wide spending to dive in the late spring and early summer of 2008 a few members of the fed s monetary policy committee resisted lower interest rates on the grounds that inflation was still near the fed s target none though called for higher rates through the fall and into 2009 however moore continued to advocate tighter money as gross domestic product and employment fell rapidly a stance that put him at odds even with the members of the fed most skeptical of low rates as a member of the fed s board of governors moore would have a vote on all the fed s interest rate decisions in an appearance on cnn with the conservative host glenn beck in october of 2008 moore warned that we re really much in a 1970s styles economy where the unemployment rate goes up so they print more money to put more people to work that causes more inflation later in a piece published in the american spectator in january of 2009 moore called for the fed to push up the value of the dollar which would have entailed tightening monetary policy eak dollar policies make americans poorer just as tax hikes do he wrote but undercut purchasing power the dollar would rise about 20 percent between the summer of 2008 and the spring of 2009 as the economy shed millions of jobs moore advocated for years for a stronger dollar and the monetary policy to go along with it in recent weeks however he has called on the fed to lower rates aligning himself with president trump who s criticized the fed s efforts to normalize rates under chairman jerome powell in a wall street journal op ed published earlier in march moore criticized the powell fed for pursuing a deflationary monetary policy and slowing growth he called for tying monetary policy to commodity prices in interviews since trump s announcement of his selection for the fed moore has called for the fed to lower its rate target none of the members of the fed who vote on monetary policy favor lowering rates according to projections they released after their meeting in washington earlier this month

les nemethy concludes his three part series looking at the arguments for investing in gold let me start this article with a quote by ludwig von mises famous economist of the austrian school of economics on the subjects of credit expansion and economic cycles an economic boom cannot continue indefinitely there are two alternatives either the banks continue the credit expansion without restriction and thus cause constantly mounting price increases and an ever growing orgy of speculation as in all other cases of unlimited inflation ends in a crack up boom and in a collapse of the money and credit system or the banks stop before this point is reached voluntarily renounce further credit expansion and thus bring about the crisis a depression follows in both instances we have had enormous credit expansion over the past decade see my earlier column have we learned the lessons of 2008 in addition we have had enormous monetary expansion with central banks all over the world printing vast amounts of fiat currency quantitative easing being one of the creative techniques used all over the world to dig us out of the 2008 crisis keynesians would argue that in times of economic boom fiscal policies should be tightened we are into the longest economic expansion in modern history yet in december 2017 the u s government significantly cut taxes further fueling the economic boom the punch bowl attempts by the u s fed to raise interest rates do not seem to have the support of the executive branch no politician wants the economy to collapse under his or her watch the fed fully realizes that raising interest rates would take away the punch bowl that keeps the party going hence without political backing seems unwilling to administer the tough medicine basically what von mises is saying is this the longer we take to remove the economic stimuli the more pronounced the downward adjustment will be given that global debt levels are considerably higher than those that triggered the 2008 recession as since then there has been a huge dose of quantitative easing there is a risk that the next recession might be more severe than the last it may even result in a significant loss of confidence in fiat currencies i am not saying this is a probability any time soon i am saying this is a possibility at some point in the future that should be reckoned with forecasting the next recession or depression is like forecasting the next earthquake on the san andreas fault we know tectonic forces are building both geologically and economically but neither geology nor economics are in my opinion precise enough sciences to predict timing of such cataclysmic events the next question is if there is a significant loss of confidence in fiat currencies what takes its place my best guess would be gold golden assignation imagine you have an assignation in new york the economist wrote on february 23 you have not been told where you should meet the other person and she has not been told where to meet you you have no understanding of where to find her or where she might usually be found she is as ignorant of you you cannot communicate you must somehow guess how to find each other and make those guesses coincide where should you go and at what time of day a good answer is grand central station at noon now imagine the world economy goes into a tailspin there is a panic selling of risky assets where should you seek safety cash is the most liquid asset but which kind the dollar is a natural focal point yet america s fiscal indiscipline and its sizeable current account deficit might give pause other currencies have their faults too there is one other destination you might consider if only because others are starting to think the same way and that is gold warren buffet eloquently expresses the case for utter disutility of gold gold gets dug out of the ground in africa or someplace then we melt it down dig another hole bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it it has no utility anyone watching from mars would be scratching their heads much as i respect buffet gold has acted as a grand central station since at least roman times in my own family s history my uncle who was posthumously awarded the yad vashem prize for helping dozens of jews escape world war ii hungary on his first visit to new york in the early 1970s was amazed at how super wealthy one of the assisted families had become they attributed their head start to a small bag of gold coin they had taken with them to quote buffet again yes an investment in gold amounts to going long on fear but then again there is much to be fearful about in the world today see my first article on gold in this trilogy and then again if one believes risk is underpriced in the world today why not invest in gold even buffet was invested in 130 million ounces of silver for many years disclosure les nemethy is long on gold coin gold miners and gold royalties he is the author of this article which expresses his own opinion he is not receiving compensation for this article other than from seeking alpha a crowd sourced content service for financial markets and has no business relationship with any company marketing or selling gold this article should not be construed as investment advice les nemethy is ceo of euro phoenix www europhoenix com a central

executive officer leblanc asked the finance minister about eight things and not once did he mention the middle class the trudeau government and the business community keep talking past each other the latter should recognize that the federal government s coddling of the middle class isn t entirely about electioneering and trudeau and morneau should be wary of taking the leaders of the country s

hodlx guest post submit your post people buy bitcoin because of value and values people buy bitcoin because it is a system of money that corresponds to how humanity has exchanged value for most of our history technologically this system is based on mathematical formulae and a straight forward verification and record system the implications are spectacular you can now trust exchanging value with another person or institution directly even if you don t know them in terms of values the crypto system is profoundly natural a very human invention based on the concepts of freedom and fairness it is the most authentic form of money humanity has had since value was based on memory it is characterized as set out below based only on pv money i e value that exists today not tied to any required future value creation allows value to be exchanged directly between two parties without any bank middlemen almost instantaneously and at extremely low cost a better description than the term cryptocurrencies is honest money this money system is about more than just exchanging value it is also about our values the crypto system is digital technology to banking and paper money s analogue technology the potential the combination of value and values that this new old really system unlocks for humanity is hard to overstate the fractional reserve banking system is intrinsically dishonest bankers will tell you that your money is both safely in the bank and at the same time they are lending it out to others they will tell you that it is your money while legally it belongs to the bank and they can do what they want with it the core philosophy of fractional reserve banking is based on dishonesty the bank tells depositors that it is their money sitting in their account and they can have it back at any time at the same time the bank lends most of the money to borrowers or uses it themselves including as an input to their own credit money creation the fundamental premise of fractional reserve banking is built on a lie this lie is then propagated by the banks enablers in society and enforced by the state these banks create their own money today which has current purchasing power and which they give to borrowers the value of this money however is dependent on future cashflows if these future cashflows do not materialize recursive credit money destruction causes economic crises and means that the bank may not have enough reserves to cover the lie that they told depositors that they could have their money back the risk structure of fractional reserve banking an inverted house of cards even a small change in g the growth number used in the valuation formula for future cashflows has a significant impact on the calculation of banks asset values that is the reason why most banks don t lend much again during after a recession regardless of the price of money set by the central bank the money price part of their cost of funds is a component of asset value but is much less important than the g estimate why is bitcoin superior to other currencies bitcoin is a superior product to nation state currency and the fractional reserve banking system for two simple reasons fixed supply greater alignment with our better human values the crypto system is digital technology traditional banking payments is analogue technology that cannot be upgraded the entire architecture is antiquated 1970s technology cobbled together in a fit of absent mindedness why is limited supply important for a currency a currency that does not have limited supply is subject to inflation inflation is simply a way of measuring a reduction in your purchasing power it is better called a theft index and is essentially a transfer of value from holders of nation state currencies to debtors usually this happens just a little bit at a time so you don t notice the missing money and don t freak out debtors benefit from inflation because it means that they have to repay less value in real terms here is a chart of the purchasing power of the us dollar since the inception of the federal reserve to the end of 2017 if you hold any nation state currency that doesn t have a fixed supply it is guaranteed that you will lose value the us dollar has lost 95 of its value since the establishment of the federal reserve system in the us which happened regardless of whether the country was on the gold standard or not what can bitcoin do for society cryptocurrencies allow low income people to access a financial system in the future low income people everywhere will do their banking using the crypto system the fractional reserve banking system has completely failed low income people of course most poor people are not even accepted by these banks the crypto system has significantly lower fixed costs than the traditional banking system and consequently allows everyone to benefit from financial inclusion the poor will be able to make transfers at extremely low cost emerging crypto banks will allow them the benefits of the savings function giving them the first opportunity ever to climb out of poverty the effects for poor communities globally will be transformational here is a typical example of how banks treat those poor people who are fortunate enough even to have bank accounts bank of america will charge low income customers 12 per month for their checking accounts unless they have a 1 500 account balance laura_nelson twitter 2018 finally a bank with some fresh ideas on how to make poor people poorer kashanacauley twitter 2018 here is how blockchain is helping refugees the un s world food programme uses blockchain technology to provide identity and has distributed millions of dollars in food vouchers to tens of thousands of syrian refugees in jordan since may 2017 the major benefit to the food program so far is a large drop in payments to financial services firms the usual middlemen for transactions such fees have dropped significantly according to houman haddad says the wfp executive leading the project note the major benefit the major benefit to the food program so far is a large drop in payments to financial services firms and what do banks think about bitcoin a scam used for buying drugs imagine them telling the truth well people use it to make the lives of refugees better worse it reduces the profits we make getting money to these refugee camps so it is really terrible asking a banker or central banker or their enablers what they think of bitcoin is like asking a taxi driver what he thinks about uber people like jamie dimon or warren buffett one of the largest shareholders in bank of america mentioned above maybe you don t like the show of greed and all of the dodgy characters who tried to use cryptocurrencies to raise money mostly for stupid projects in 2018 no one does but you need to look beyond them to what bitcoin and blockchain can do for society in the future you will have to decide do i stand with a community of people who want to make a better world or do i stand with the 1 and their system of money and banking robert sharratt robert is part canadian part british somewhat autistic and lives in geneva he is going to link the crypto system to the real economy and create a better banking model or die trying his interests include mountain climbing chess piano programming

by geopolitical monitor by wilder alejandro sanchez trade between kazakhstan and india in 2018 reached usd 1 2 billion according to the kazakhstani authorities while this amount is not particularly large when compared to kazakhstan s trade with china or russia it is nevertheless an important milestone as it demonstrates astana s now known as nur sultan success when it comes to expanding its pool of trade partners and investors well past its central asian neighborhood as kazakhstan aims to become one of the top 30 developed economies by 2050 it is imperative for the nation to continue to appear as an attractive trade partner and a destination for extra regional investors growth of extra regional trade there have been a number of announcements regarding achievements in commerce between kazakhstan and extra regional states in recent months as previously mentioned kazakhstani indian reached usd 1 2 billion in 2018 which represent a 26 5 percent increase compared to a year earlier according to the economic times meanwhile trade between kazakhstan with pakistan in 2017 amounted to us 28 42 million which was 12 more than for the similar period of 2016 us 25 6 million trade turnover between the two states in january august of 2018 amounted to us 21 7 million explained the kazakhstani ambassador to pakistan barlybay sadykov as for other trade partners transactions between kazakhstan and azerbaijan reached 258 million in 2018 exports from kazakhstan for 211 9 million of the bilateral trade while imports from azerbaijan made 46 3 million according to azernews similarly trade between kazakhstan and egypt reached 80 million in 2018 which represents an increase of 29 percent when compared to 2017 meanwhile japanese foreign direct investment in kazakhstan amounted to 357 million in 2017 while kazakhstani exports to japan reached 125 million which a focus on ferroalloy crude oil and petroleum radioactive elements nonferrous metals according to the japanese ministry of foreign affairs as for trade between kazakhstan and the european union a market of 28 nations the total was 28 6 billion during the period january september 2018 kazakhstan is also negotiating free trade agreements with various extra regional partners under the umbrella of the eurasian economic union eaeu for example israel is close to signing an fta with the bloc according to the times of israel astana is also negotiating free trade agreements with egypt india serbia and singapore kazakhstan maintains a strong pro free trade attitude as senior officials repeatedly compliment these agreements in 2015 we signed a free trade agreement with vietnam and in 2018 with iran which enables us to export our goods to the markets with a population of more than 180 million people said former minister of national economy timur suleimenov bringing in trade and investment kazakhstan s neighbors have limited trading potential particularly kyrgyzstan and tajikistan given their small populations six and nine million respectively limited development and small markets meanwhile turkmenistan continues its isolationist policies while trade with afghanistan is complicated due to the well known security situation there positive relations between astana and tashkent mean that trade between the two is improving 2 billion in 2017 according to reports however this is not enough to help kazakhstan become a global economy the lack of limited intra regional trade in central asia has been widely discussed most recently at the february 27 forum intra regional trade and cooperation in central asia organized by the central asia caucasus institute in washington dc as for trade with kazakhstan s two largest neighbors china and russia they have been similarly well analyzed hence we will just provide a quick overview kazakhstan is the buckle in china s belt and road initiative and beijing has invested heavily in improving its transportation system in order to ferry chinese goods across central asia the crown jewel of this strategy is the khorgos gateway dry port meanwhile bilateral commerce with russia was estimated at around 19 billion in 2018 unsurprisingly moscow remains astana s main trading partner the issue here is not whether kazakhstan is attempting to replace trade ties with beijing or moscow with other partners but rather how given the limited opportunities to develop stronger trade with and attract investment from its central asian neighbors astana is eagerly looking past its neighborhood the milestone in trade ties with india is an example of this policy finally in order to attract extra regional interest astana continues to promote its products which include reserves of oil natural gas uranium a plethora of minerals rich deposits of ores of various metals rare earth elements and combustible and non metallic minerals the central asian nation is already well known as a global producer of uranium and zinc and now the government is pushing for diversification with a focus on its agro industrial complex moreover kazakhstan has two entities whose objectives are to attract foreign investors one of them is the astana international financial centre aifc a conglomerate of different financial entities which include the international arbitration centre the astana international exchange the aifc court which provides a common law court system for the first time in eurasia and other administrative bodies the goal of the aifc is to attract new investors and commercial partners to kazakhstan as well making the country a regional investment and arbitration hub the other entity to keep in mind is kazakh invest which acts as a single coordination centre for special economic zones kazakhstan reportedly has 11 as well as being the primary negotiator that represents astana s interests to foreign trade partners the goal is to streamline investment initiatives and avoid unwanted bureaucratic delays according to by kazakh invest as of january 2019 the company s monitoring system included 157 projects with a combined worth of usd 39 6 billion kazakh invest has also participated in business forums in with representatives from egypt and poland in the first months of 2019 companies from these nations may be convinced to invest in kazakhstan in the near future due to the country s resources and industries and also its trade friendly laws for example when goods are sold in one of the country s special economic zones they are exempt from customs duties and vat on imports and also exempt from import customs duties final thoughts as a landlocked state with ambitious goals kazakhstan is in a complicated geographical location the country trades heavily with china and russia but its fellow central asian nations with the exception of uzbekistan have small markets that will not help the kazakhstan become one of the 30 most developed nations by 2050 hence astana is supporting the development of its agro industrial sector so it decreases its reliance on its still profitable mining industry moreover trade relations with extra regional partners are increasing as trade with india has surpassed one billion dollars while agencies like the aifc and kazakh invest have been established to make the central asian nation as both a target for investments as well as a potential regional hub for arbitration and stock trading kazakhstan maintained pro free trade and pro investment attitude during the nazarbayev era and it will be important to monitor what will be the trade policies of interim president kassym jomart tokayev in the coming months in order for kazakhstan to join the exclusive club of the most developed global economies investment and trade with partners geographically close and distant is

twitter to vent about stephen harper s austerity or justin trudeau s taxing of the rich still the good times rolled a little slower last year that s partly because the housing bubbles in toronto and vancouver started to deflate but it s also because a group of wealth creators on which the country has relied since the great recession had a tough time in 2018 statistics canada diced household wealth into five income segments it also divided the aggregate data into five regions there wasn t a lot of change in distribution nationally the richest 20 per cent of households controlled about 49 per cent of total wealth roughly the same as 2010 one shift stood out however inequality and fragile growth may be two sides of the same coin in the prairie provinces the richest quintile s share of total household net worth in alberta saskatchewan and manitoba dropped to about 56 per cent compared with about 57 per cent in 2017 and almost 64 per cent in 2015 the share of prairie wealth held by

and paul martin s quest to eliminate the deficit and stephen harper s attack on excessively high corporate taxes there are good economic reasons to focus on inequality unfortunately the tendency of trudeau and his ministers to justify everything they do as necessary to help the middle class has made it difficult for thinking people to take them seriously team trudeau always looks like it s shopping for votes even when it might not be some wealth disparity is necessary to ensure dynamism even left wing economists accept that economies work better when entrepreneurs and other ambitious types are allowed to satisfy their greed but over the past decade the economics profession has concluded that big gaps between the richest and the rest could be a cause of all sorts of chronic problems high levels of income inequality correlate with corruption and regulatory capture as the wealthiest outspend others to ensure the playing field tilts in their favour societal and political

purpose i look at the high frequency weekly indicators because while they can be very noisy they provide a good nowcast of the economy and will telegraph the maintenance or change in the economy well before monthly or quarterly data is available they are also an excellent way to mark your beliefs to market in general i go in order of long leading indicators then short leading indicators then coincident indicators a note on methodology data is presented in a just the facts ma am format with a minimum of commentary so that bias is minimized where relevant i include 12 month highs and lows in the data in parentheses to the right all data taken from st louis fred unless otherwise linked a few items e g financial conditions indexes regional fed indexes stock prices the yield curve have their own metrics based on long term studies of their behavior where data is seasonally adjusted generally it is scored positively if it is within the top 1 3 of that range negative in the bottom 1 3 and neutral in between where it is not seasonally adjusted and there are seasonal issues waiting for the yoy change to change sign will lag the turning point thus i make use of a convention data is scored neutral if it is less than 1 2 as positive negative as at its 12 month extreme with long leading indicators which by definition turn at least 12 months before a turning point in the economy as a whole there is an additional rule data is automatically negative if during an expansion it has not made a new peak in the past year with the sole exception that it is scored neutral if it is moving in the right direction and is close to making a new high recap of monthly reports february data included a big increase in new home sales and an increase in starts while permits declined house prices continued to increase but at a decelerating pace personal income increased slightly two measures of consumer sentiment moved in opposite directions meanwhile in january personal spending rose and in the rear view mirror corporate profits in q4 last year declined slightly long leading indicators interest rates and credit spreads as of 3 p m friday rates baa corporate bond index 4 66 down 16 w w 1

between corporate bonds and treasuries however is still above 2 10 and so remains negative for consistency because i have been using the same metric at all times the yield curve is also neutral although one week ago several other decisive measures inverted note that i will not change treasury ratings to positive unless they fall below 4 25 but now that mortgage rates have fallen below 4 2

has oscillated between negative and positive for the last two months this week once again it was negative bank lending rates 0 222 ted spread up 0 029 w w 2 500 libor up 0 014 w w both ted and libor rose in 2016 to the point where both were usually negatives with lots of fluctuation of importance is that ted was above 0 50 before both the 2001 and 2008 recessions the ted spread was generally increasingly positive in 2017 while libor was increasingly negative early last year the ted spread has whipsawed between being positive or negative but more recently was very positive it has risen

generally improved from weak to moderate or strong positives during 2017 and remained positive all last year the retail economist measure decelerated in the past few months and for the third time in

oscillating improved to new multi year highs earlier in 2018 but recently enough to rate negative this week it has rebounded enough to be neutral bdi traced a similar trajectory and made 3 year highs near the end of 2017 and at midyear 2018 hit multi year highs since then it declined all the way to negative it has now rebounded enough to score neutral i am wary of reading too much into price

tax withholding steel and the ted spread are positive harpex and consumer spending as measured by the retail economist are neutral libor the baltic dry index and rail are negative because of these changes the long term forecast improved from neutral to positive based on a major decline in long term interest rates despite q4 corporate profits being reported down the short term forecast also

new york it s been a fabulous start to the year for investors as long as you ignore all those simmering worries about a possible recession the s p 500 on friday closed out its best quarter in nearly a decade having jumped 13 1 per cent through the first three months of 2019 and many other investments from junk bonds to foreign stocks have also bounced back from their dismal end to 2018 but the returns would have been even better if not for concerns that slowing growth around the world may drag down the u s economy the quarter s twists are just the latest for the markets which have yo yoed from record heights to fear induced sell offs for more than a year the big swings have left stock and bonds looking fairly valued said frances donald head of macroeconomics strategy at manulife asset management she s optimistic markets can keep climbing this year but she anticipates more swings along the way when she talks with big institutional investors the mood is usually one of nervousness she says the 2020 recession calls whether they re right or wrong have permeated all individual investor mentalities she said the fed was again one of the market s main drivers and it flipped to hero from antagonist in the eyes of many investors as last year was closing investors were worried that the federal reserve would raise interest rates too quickly and choke off the economy the central bank raised short term rates in december for the seventh time in two years and the s p 500 fell more than 19 per cent from late september through dec 24 nearly taking down the longest bull market for u s stocks on record but on jan 4 fed chairman jerome powell told a conference for economists that the central bank would be flexible in deciding when to raise rates it was an immediate balm for investors and the s p 500 leaped 3 4 per cent that day it kept climbing until hitting a peak on march 21 the day after the fed said that it may not raise rates at all this year all the while companies were turning in yet another round of blockbuster profit reports aided by lower taxes earnings per share for s p 500 companies surged 13 per cent during the last three months of 2018 from a year earlier led by big gains for energy and communications companies but the momentum for stocks stalled last week when a surprisingly weak report on the european economy and other worries triggered concerns about the global economy investors sought the safety of bonds and that in turn triggered the alarm on one of the market s more reliable recession indicators investors drove the yield for the 10 year treasury lower than for the three month treasury bill for the first time since a little before the great recession such an inverted yield curve does not have a perfect track record as a recession predictor but it has preceded each of the last seven by a year or two here s a look at some of the moves that shaped the last quarter for investments stock funds soared during the fourth quarter swoon the s p 500 fell as much as 19 8 per cent from its all time high set sept 20 the fed s pledge for patience helped the index rally back to within 2 6 per cent of the peak this quarter technology stocks again did much of the work but the gains were widespread funds specializing in small stocks or large energy companies or real estate all logged gains the spdr s p 500 etf retuned 13 6 per cent for the quarter including dividends for its best return since the third quarter of 2009 when the economy was first crawling out of the great recession stock funds that focus on high growth companies such as tech again easily bested their counterparts that look for low priced stocks called value funds value stock funds trailed partly because they often have lots of banks and other financial stocks which lagged during the quarter on worries that lower interest rates and slower economy will hurt their profits bond funds climbed as yields fell inflation is still low the fed is holding the line on interest rates and worries are rising about the strength of the economy all those help push up prices for bonds and pull yields down and bond funds of all types powered to gains during the quarter the ishares core u s aggregate bond etf returned 2 9 per cent for its best performance in three years it tracks an index of investment grade bonds and it benefited from a drop in the yield on the 10 year treasury to 2 41 per cent from 2 68 per cent at the end of the last quarter what s ahead like the global economy growth is also slowing for u s corporate earnings analysts say first quarter profits likely fell nearly 4 per cent from a year earlier according to factset if they re right it would be the first decline in nearly three years that s setting the stage for some potentially disappointing reports when the next quarter opens on april 1 so investors may want to ready themselves for even more turbulence in the coming quarter besides earnings reports they ll also be getting more clues about the strength of the global economy and whether the united states and china can make progress on their trade dispute to help the global outlook stan choe the associated press
washington ap president donald trump said friday that he will nominate stephen moore a conservative economic analyst and frequent critic of the federal reserve to fill a vacancy on the fed s seven member board moore a well known and often polarizing figure in washington political circles served as an adviser to trump during the 2016 campaign in that role he helped draft trump s tax cut plan trump has been harshly critical of the fed s rate increases even after the central bank announced this week that it foresees no hikes this year moore formerly chief economist for the conservative heritage foundation has also been critical of the policies of chairman jerome powell a fervent advocate of tax cuts moore is close to larry kudlow head of the white house national economic council the two collaborated in shaping the tax overhaul that trump signed into law at the end of 2017 leading to changes that largely favored tax cuts for corporations and wealthier individuals with the idea of spurring investment and growth moore interviewed friday on bloomberg television after trump s announcement said his criticism of the fed including his suggestion that powell should perhaps be fired were probably written in a time of anger i think everyone would now acknowledge moore added that what they did in december with the rate increase was a very substantial mistake and the fed has thank god reversed that and changed directions president donald trump talks with reporters before boarding marine one on the south lawn of the white house friday march 22 2019 in washington ap photo evan vucci asked whether trump might want him on the fed s board to check powell s influence and protect the administration s economic policies moore said the only thing trump told me was pursue policies that are good for the american workers he didn t really mention anything about differing with chairman powell one way or the other moore s nomination which the senate must confirm drew sharp criticism from some economists and historians it s unprecedented in the modern era particularly because he lacks expertise in areas under the fed s supervision like banking and monetary policy said gary richardson a historian of the fed and a professor at the university of california at irvine scott sumner the chair of monetary policy at george mason university s mercatus center said his concern is that moore accused the fed of providing too much aid after the 2008 financial crisis when the economy depended on help from the central bank moore has since urged the fed to be more generous in supporting the economy even though growth has strengthened in the past two years and less help is needed his policies appear to be going the wrong way sumner said given his sharply partisan reputation moore could spark opposition among democrats in the senate but trump can score points with his core supporters and with the majority republicans in the senate by embracing a conservative activist for a fed role that would make him a watchdog over the economy freedomworks is proud to see president trump offer such a prestigious position to one of our own said adam brandon president of that conservative advocacy group i have no doubt that stephen moore would make an excellent member of the federal reserve board trump in his first two years in office has been able to reshape the central bank he nominated four of the current five members and he tapped powell who had been chosen for the fed board by president barack obama to succeed janet yellen as chairman if confirmed by the senate moore would fill one of two vacancies on the board the selection of moore marks a deviation from trump s previous choices for the board toward a more public figure who has long pushed conservative economic and political ideology in a march editorial in the wall street journal moore estimated that fed rate policies had reduced inflation adjusted economic growth by as much as 1 5 percentage points in the past six months moore proposed that the fed set short term rates with an eye toward stabilizing commodity prices rather than solely on overall inflation this approach moore has argued would have prevented the fed from raising rates as much as it has and he contended that this approach if adopted would help accelerate economic growth above 3 percent compared with the longer run average of 1 9 percent that fed officials have forecast moore has often embraced a confrontational tone in his commentary on the fed in a 2012 wall street journal column he suggested that the chairman at the time ben bernanke had kept rates near zero and arranged for the fed to buy bonds in order to help barack obama win re election rather than help the economy recover from the financial crisis and great recession moore had earlier predicted in 2010 that the fed s low rates would ignite inflation and he advised investors to buy gold he pressed his case in 2011 warning on fox news we re starting to see that specter of inflation his warnings of runaway inflation proved off base the average inflation rate would fall from 3 1 percent in 2011 to near zero in 2015 with trump as president moore became a sharp critic of fed policies to shrink its balance sheet and return rates to what the central bank sees as a neutral level neither stimulating nor hindering growth he went so far as to suggest that trump might consider trying to fire powell for the rate hikes under his watch what the law says i believe is trump can replace the federal reserve chairman for cause moore said during a december radio interview and you know i would say well the cause is that he s wrecking our economy moore has frequently praised the administration on television and he co wrote the 2018 book trumponomics his partner on that book was art laffer who pioneered the republican doctrine that lower tax rates would accelerate economic growth in ways that could minimize debt but federal debt has jumped since trump s overhaul to the tax code surging nearly 77 percent through the first four months of fiscal 2019 compared with the previous year ___ ap staff writers deb riechman and marcy gordon

cairo egypt s president abdel fattah el sissi today announced that he has raised the minimum wage to 2 000 egyptian pounds 115 74 per month from 1 200 69 27 a 67 percent increase the move came ahead of a possible national referendum on constitutional amendments that would potentially allow him to remain in power until 2034 egypt s parliament which is packed with el sissi supporters overwhelmingly approved a package of constitutional changes last month that would further enshrine the military s role in politics the supposed referendum is expected to be held in the coming weeks el sissi said in televised comments the raise will be applied to all egyptian workers the move was part of a package of measures including a raise in pensions and bonuses intended to ease the burdens of egyptians hurt by painful austerity measures in recent years the austerity measures were part of an ambitious economic reform program intended to revive the country s economy mauled by years of political turmoil and violence the reforms included floating the currency substantial cuts in state subsidies on basic goods and introducing a wide range of new taxes the measures led to a significant rise in prices and services something critics say has hurt the poor and middle class the hardest the reforms were agreed on with the international monetary fund in exchange for a 12 billion loan el sissi thanked egyptians especially women for enduring the harsh measures another path would have led to the collapse of the state he said in a ceremony honoring egyptian women removing state subsidies is something that el sissi s predecessors could not do because of fears of unrest the late president anwar sadat attempted in 1977 to remove subsidies on bread a main staple for egyptians sparking deadly street riots he backed down in comparison el sissi s reforms fueled popular discontent but never boiled over onto the streets demonstrations are virtually banned in egypt under a 2013 law with offenders facing up to five years in prison if convicted the economic reform program has won el sissi lavish praise from egypt s western backers and bankers his policies however have made more difficult the plight of a majority of egyptians who are now forced to cope with steep hikes in the price of everything from utilities and fuel to food and transportation

send this page to someone via email amid the continued efforts of the trudeau government to negotiate a free trade deal with china a recent report suggests that a free trade agreement with the world s most powerful economic force should be a non starter for canada right now the report released thursday by the macdonald laurier institute examines china s previous trade deals to depict how they re often designed in favour of the asian manufacturing giant furthermore the report highlights the ideological differences that could become obstacles to achieving true free trade between canada and china given the chinese government s command power over its economy its persistent violations of world trade organization wto rules and underhanded actions against the interests of its existing free trade agreement fta partners canada should not rush headlong into fta negotiations with china she continues story continues below advertisement china s history with free trade agreements sets a negative precedent thus far china has signed 14 free trade agreements and is currently negotiating eight others of these agreements signed six of them were with developed countries australia iceland new zealand singapore south korea and switzerland historically countries who engage in free trade with china have not obtained the access to the chinese market that they d hoped for but were instead saddled with decades of tariffs and other non tariff conditions that prevented them from engaging in true free trade with the superpower charles burton a senior fellow at the institute s centre for advancing canada s interests abroad told global news in an interview that cases such as switzerland s 2013 deal and australia s 2005 deal should give canadian officials pause the swiss government agreed to immediate access for chinese goods and services tariff free in switzerland but the access of swiss goods and services in china would be on a phased in basis and would still maintain blacklist areas that don t allow the swiss goods and services to get a level playing field in that market burton explained story continues below advertisement a report from the centre for international governance innovation cigi from 2017 corroborates this stating that in many cases the time periods for phasing in tariff eliminations are quite long from 10 to 20 years the swiss agreement for example calls for almost 100 per cent of tariffs on swiss imports of goods from china and the elimination of tariffs on 84 per cent chinese imports of swiss goods the email you need for the day s top news stories from canada and around the world in addition while tariffs on the majority of goods exported from switzerland were set to be reduced year after year for a period of 15 years tariffs on goods exported from china to switzerland were immediately dropped when the agreement came into effect what s more burton explained that the might of china s economy makes it difficult for nations to push back story continues below advertisement i think the main message for canada is that time and time again the chinese government is able to not fulfill their negotiated agreements in an honest way and the advanced industrial nation really has no effective recourse against this because of the asymmetrical power relationship between the two countries burton explained conservative party of canada leader andrew scheer has made similar claims about why under a tory government canada would not pursue a free trade agreement with china when you re dealing with a country like china with state owned enterprises without the same commitment to the rule of law with all kinds of things like non tariff barriers i don t believe we re ready for that scheer said during a q a session in mid march canada and china have incompatible political and economic ideologies the report highlights what burton describes as the fundamental incompatibility between our two systems primarily the findings state that china is a systematic violator of world trade organization wto rules which compel the government to inform the wto of subsidies and support for state owned enterprises some of what china has failed to disclose to the wto include the regime s growing assistance of state owned enterprises over the years subsidies to industries in the advanced technology automotive and fishing space strict price controls and general considerable involvement in the economy story continues below advertisement furthermore china s punishing import duties serve to block foreign manufacturing for the purpose of protecting the domestic manufacturing industry the report also notes that the trade deficit between canada and china has been growing steadily since 2010 canada s annual trade deficit with china exceeded cad 44 billion as of 2017 an amount greater than canada s overall trade deficit of 42 billion i think arguably the reason for canada s very large trade imbalance with china is because china has not been abiding by its commitment to the wto burton said because there are so many sectors that are blocked off so many non tariff barriers and so many difficulties for canadian companies to maintain their intellectual property and proprietary manufacturing processes in china scheer has also expressed his concerns about china s approach to the international economy story continues below advertisement we have to also recognize that the government in china has a much different worldview than we do there is not the same dedication the democratic institutions or principles that we have scheer said during the same q a they play by a different set of rules chen notes in her writing that canada and china are two worlds apart in terms of their economic systems and value systems and that giving china greater access to the canadian market would amount to a national security threat former canadian prime minister stephen harper said in an interview with fox news this past december that an example of this threat can be seen in one of canada s existing partnerships with the chinese telecom firm huawei if we don t take on this problem now in the long term this is going to get worse and frankly we ll get to a point in the long term where china cannot be taken on and it is determining the rules of the global system in arbitrary ways that simply suit its own interest harper said at the time story continues below advertisement harper went on to say that western allies need to address chinese rule breaking which have allowed the chinese to frankly exploit a trade relationship free trade with china could alienate canada and the u s as tensions between canada and the united states have continued to heat up since president donald trump took office there has been much talk about engaging in trade talks with other countries to reduce canada s trade dependency on the united states edward greenspon co chair of publicly policy forum told global news after the new usmca agreement had been signed that trade with china is an available and obvious path to achieving this goal if you want to diversify and if you want to create jobs and opportunities and higher incomes for canadians you can t do it unless you re trading with nations that are growing faster than you and are large in scale and that brings you to china greenspon explained at the time however clause 32 of the agreement requires all signatories to inform each other should they engage in free trade talks with a non market economy which is interpreted as referring to china should this take place each party has the right to withdraw from the agreement story continues below advertisement if canada before the u s china trade matter was resolved did negotiate a free trade agreement with china it could have a serious impact impact on our relationship with north america particularly in the united states burton explained furthermore canada has to be compliant with that clause that we after all did agree with now none of this should be taken to mean that canada shouldn t engage in trade with china at all burton the macdonald laurier institute report and both the former and current conservative leaders agree that canada s relationship with china should be nurtured stopping short of a free trade deal china should be wanting to engage in trade with canada because it s in china s interest and certainly we do benefit from the chinese goods and services that we receive burton explained tweet this click to share quote on twitter china should be wanting to engage in trade with canada because it s in china s interest and certainly we do benefit from the chinese goods and services that we receive burton explained i think there is certainly a lot of potential for high quality canadian products in the minerals and agricultural sectors that we could be selling more to china if we were more aggressive in that market he continued he added however that canada should in partnership with its wto allies work to encourage china to engage in free fair honest international trade
i have this quaint notion that the constitution guarantees economic liberty by limiting the power of washington needless to say parental leave is not one of the enumerated powers in article 1 section 8 sadly many people including the chief justice of the supreme court don t share my view so let s set aside that objection and focus on the policy implications of a new entitlement program i ve already explained why the federal government shouldn t have a policy on parental leave but the topic isn t going away so let s look at the issue again the first thing to realize is that the fight over parental leave involves several competing options here are the four alternatives a conservative plan to allow new parents to finance time off by tapping into the bankrupt social security system a plan from the left to make parental leave an entitlement financed by payroll taxes a plan from the left to mandate that employers provide paid leave the libertarian notion that it s none of the government s business let s address option 1 writing for national review alexandra desanctis argues for an expansion of government s role joni ernst of iowa and mike lee of utah recently introduced the child rearing and development leave empowerment cradle act the latest conservative effort to develop a paid leave policy that enables parents to stay home with their newborns it would amend the social security act to allow parents to take up to three months off from work by drawing on their retirement benefits early in exchange for delaying their benefits after retiring you can read my concerns about this approach in this column from last march so i don t want to reinvent the wheel but ms desanctis makes some new arguments that cry out for rebuttal starting with the notion that we should be ashamed that we re not copying europe s decrepit welfare states the united states is the only country in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd an intergovernmental economic alliance of 36 member countries that doesn t have a national paid leave program wow i never expected to see this type of argument in national review william f buckley must be spinning in his grave heck i made that argument a punchline in my recent collection of anti bernie sanders satire she also wants to water down the definition of conservatism so that it means whatever is convenient for certain politicians the conservative argument against the proposal is intriguing as a matter of principle but it is worth noting that the republican politicians offering these paid family leave bills in recent years are also some of the most conservative policymakers in the senate this new proposal is an effort not to expand the government but to protect and cultivate family life which ought to be the chief goal of any country that cares about its future as the right grapples with populist arguments for greater government prioritization of the needs of working class americans negatively affected by globalization conservatives should embrace efforts to incentivize family growth and offer parents more flexibility in caring for their newborns i m also less than impressed by her argument that congress should cultivate family life indeed it s precisely because strong families are good that washington shouldn t be involved which is why i prefer what rachel greszler wrote for the heritage foundation here are some excerpts a new national entitlement could expand as other federal entitlements have potentially costing hundreds of billions of dollars per year the role for the federal government is to remain neutral with regard to parents decisions to stay home or work outside the home the government can however make it easier and less costly for workers to take family leave by reducing marginal tax rates so that workers have larger paychecks supporting instead of impeding flexible work arrangements between employees and employers and cutting costly regulations so that businesses can afford to provide paid leave and i definitely like articles that make the principled case against more government for instance here are excerpts from a column by veronique de rugy even if we pretend that it doesn t change the size of government because the increased spending in the beginning will perfectly offset a few decades later with delayed benefit payments and increases in revenue i e parents delay retirement and hence continue to send taxes to uncle sam the plan increases the scope of the government immediately you can t wish away the fact that it drags the government into an area where it played no role before and george leef writing for forbes has similar concerns the notion that the government should help cover the costs of having a child springs naturally from the progressive mindset that government should be there to provide in case anyone needs or merely prefers assistance it also dovetails with the liberal political mentality that many votes are to be won by giving people stuff but the big problem with this idea is not the dollars and cents one rather it is the way it perpetuates and spreads the idea that the purpose of the federal government is to provide for our needs kindly old uncle sam will be there to help when you need it this is the sort of thing thomas jefferson had in mind when he warned against wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them what about other ways to address the issue regarding option 2 an entitlement funded by payroll taxes vanessa brown calder s article in national review is must reading on the issue government supported paid leave is costly paid leave proposals such as the family act would result in new payroll taxes on all current workers whether or not they intend to use benefits realistic assumptions based on the national use of the federal unpaid fmla program suggest the family act would result in costs of around 450 per year in taxes for the average worker the program is likely to expand as similar programs have in other oecd countries for example the average length of paid maternity parental and home care leave available to mothers in oecd 30 countries in 1970 was 17 2 weeks in 2016 that number had tripled to an average of 52 5 weeks or over a year in benefits large expansions of programs are accompanied by large expansions in program costs for example norway expanded leave from 18 to 35 weeks between 1987 and 1992 which nearly doubled the cost to taxpayers from 12 354 to 24 022 per eligible birth imposing taxes to finance that much new spending isn t very popular even in left wing states for instance the new york times reports that politicians in california want to impose a paid leave mandate but they are having a hard time figuring out how to make the numbers work the united states has long been the only industrialized country not to offer paid leave to new parents instead of waiting for the federal government the incoming governor of california intends to change that what s unclear is how california would pay for it the proposal which the governor elect gavin newsom is expected to include with his budget after he is sworn in on monday would be the most generous state policy in the nation at a time when federal paid leave proposals have stalled yet it does not include a plan to finance it california s existing paid leave program is financed by a 1 percent payroll tax increasing that tax would require the approval of two thirds of the legislature not assured despite democratic control interestingly folks on the left are making the same argument that ms desanctis used in national review we re falling behind our economic competitors said heather boushey the executive director of the washington center for equitable growth who advised hillary clinton on economic issues during her 2016 presidential campaign i ll merely add that we re falling behind only in the race to impose more government we re way ahead in the race for more prosperity i also found this passage to be laughable california has a history of fervent opposition to taxes democrats now have supermajorities in both the senate and the house but many of them have embraced fiscally conservative policies you almost have to assume that the reporter who wrote this piece never visited the state california has the nation s most onerous state income tax and it ranks very low in measures of fiscal policy yes there is a supermajority requirement to raise taxes but politicians in sacramento have been very successful in overcoming that barrier let s shift to option 3 mandating the employers provide leave vanessa brown calder authored a comprehensive study on parental leave last year she included a section on how this approach would harm female workers economist lawrence summers studied the effects of mandating government benefits and concluded that women s wages would be reduced to reflect the cost summers states that if wages could freely adjust these differences in expected costs would be offset by differences in wages if not there will be efficiency consequences as employers seek to hire workers with lower benefit costs economist jonathan gruber studied maternity benefit mandates in illinois new york and new jersey and his findings consistently suggest women s wages were reduced to reflect the cost of benefits the estimated reduction in wages was around 100 percent of the cost of benefits government mandated leave has similar effects internationally a study of 16 european countries over a period of around 20 years found that parental leave is associated with reductions in relative wages at extended durations other researchers have noted that work family policies have also contributed to lower wage levels for women relative to men this data is especially noteworthy since there is additional evidence that women get hurt when government intervenes on their behalf to conclude let s look at how her research supports option 4 no interference from washington here are her main findings ample data show that the private market provides paid leave at rates about 30 to 50 percentage points higher than proponents claim private paid leave provision has grown three or fourfold over 50 years and continues to grow this trend indicates industry is responsive to employee demands government intervention is also unlikely to correct gender or labor market inequality in ways proponents desire for example families may respond to the policy by increasing women s household work contributions relative to men s redistributive effects of government intervention are likely to harm workers this chart shows how markets are naturally responsive when the government doesn t intervene and this chart from her study shows that women do better in the united states than in other nations in other words benign neglect is the policy that produces the best outcomes sadly this is one of the many issues where the trump administration is on the wrong side the bottom line is that option 4 is the only choice that is good for freedom good for women and good for the economy option 1 is not as bad as options 2 and 3 but it is still a step in the wrong direction as i noted last year supporters are proposing to do the wrong thing in the best possible way this article is republished with

egypt president abdel fattah el sissi says he has raised the minimum wage to 2 000 egyptian pounds 115 74 per month from 1 200 69 27 he says in televised comments saturday that the raise is intended to ease the burdens on egyptians hurt by painful austerity measures in recent years the measures were part of an ambitious economic reform program intended to revive the country s economy mauled by years of political turmoil and violence the reforms included floating the currency substantial cuts in state subsidies and introducing a wide range of new taxes the reforms were agreed on with the international monetary fund in exchange for a 12 billion loan the measures led to a significant rise in prices and services something critics say has hurt the poor and middle class the hardest
president trump and his top economic adviser criticized the federal reserve s recent interest rate increases again on friday blaming the central bank for hindering economic growth while denying any suggestion of a looming slowdown just one day after the commerce department said the economy slowed more sharply at the end of last year than previously reported mr trump blamed the fed for mistakenly raising rates last year had the fed not mistakenly raised interest rates especially since there is very little inflation and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening mr trump wrote on twitter on friday the 3 0 gdp stock market would have both been much higher world markets would be in a better place larry kudlow the director of the white house s national economic council told cnbc on friday that mr trump would like to see the fed cut rates by half a percentage point
the quick read about turkish local elections what happened this week turkish president recep tayyip erdogan braces for municipal elections on sunday march 31 it s the first time turks head to the polls since erdogan s ak party won parliamentary elections last june securing him the executive presidency he established to remain in power going on 17 years now these are the first elections to be held since turkey fell into recession for the first time in nearly a decade things do not look promising for erdogan or his supporters advertisement advertisement why it matters turkish elections always matter given the country s geostrategic location between europe and the middle east but this is the first time that turkish local elections matter this much part of that has to do with the fact that erdogan continues to frame these local elections as a referendum about his leadership he keeps saying on the campaign trail these elections are about the survival of the turkish state and given the raft of populist measures he s introduced in the run up to the vote upping the minimum wage offering loans at below market rates through state banks selling rationed amounts of fruits and vegetables among others he seems to genuinely believe that even though the turkish economy is sputtering and can t really afford these types of government handouts but erdogan is desperate as well he should be because for years erdogan s rule has coincided with the growth of the turkish economy which he eagerly took credit for but now that same turkish economy has begun to falter in part because of the global economic slowdown and in part because of continued interventions by erdogan into the economy that have scared off foreign investors late last week turkey s currency took a nosedive dropping 6 5 against the us dollar in a single day and continued stumbling this week as the government has tried to staunch the bleeding all told the turkish lira has lost 36 percent of its value against the dollar over the last year erdogan blamed foreign speculators for causing a run on the currency and ordered an investigation into jpmorgan chase which had written negatively about the future prospects of the turkish lira it s unlikely that the investigation will amount to much it was seemingly intended as a signal to foreign investors not to publicly disparage turkey or its economy unfortunately for erdogan it signaled to investors that investing in turkey is increasingly becoming a political decision rather than just a financial one turkey was once held up as the poster child for successfully transitioning an emerging economy into a developed market which provided erdogan with plenty of political capital in the first decade of his rule as that shield has started to crumble alongside the turkish economy erdogan has begun taking much more provocative geopolitical decisions to play to his nationalist base like ordering s 400 missile systems from russia in open defiance of the us and nato to which turkey ostensibly belongs he s also leaned into identity politics much more overtly just last week he aired footage of the christchurch shooting at a campaign rally to capitalize on the sense of muslim persecution a poor showing in this weekend s municipal elections may make him even more erratic advertisement advertisement what happens next erdogan doesn t face a direct threat to his hold on power in these elections but it s looking like his ak party is set to suffer its worst electoral defeat in more than a decade it remains unlikely for now that the party loses the mayoralty in istanbul it may very well do so in a host of other cities including the capital of ankara but no matter the result of the elections for the ak party it s unlikely that erdogan will take the necessary and politically unpopular austerity steps needed to bring the country back to real financial health if the ak party does better than expected erdogan will take it as proof that his populist interventions into the economy paid off if the ak party loses big he will be even less likely to take the politically costly steps of cutting back on government spending what s more erdogan may renew his criticism of the central bank and start opining again on monetary policy to deflect blame from his recent political loss making foreign investors even more skittish about investing in turkey and an economic situation that continues to deteriorate makes him more likely to take risks abroad if he thinks it will buy him more political capital back home the key statistics that explains it 13 5 percent earlier this month the country announced it was officially in recession following two quarters of contracting economic growth the first time that has happened in a decade even worse the number of turks that are currently unemployed is at 13 5 percent the highest it s been since 2010 that helps explain why the ruling ak party is bracing for some ugly results advertisement advertisement the one thing to read about it erdogan was a very different type of politician when he first came to power nearly two decades ago this piece in the new york times gives you a good overview of how he got to this point the one major misconception about it that erdogan is starting to lose it the man is still capable of being pragmatic even if he does the pragmatic thing a bit late he s capable of reversing course as he did with the release of the american pastor andrew bunson or issuing an apology to russian president vladimir putin after a russian jet was shot down in syria in 2015 when it comes to the economy it s still possible for him to call in the imf even though he has repeatedly vowed not to do so the real question is how much damage will be done in the interim advertisement advertisement the one thing to avoid saying about it strongman check friendly with russia check if erdogan had played his cards right he could have gotten trump to campaign for him like bibi managed to do
new york it s been a fabulous start to the year for investors as long as you ignore all those simmering worries about a possible recession the s p 500 on friday closed out its best quarter in nearly a decade having jumped 13 1 per cent through the first three months of 2019 and many other investments from junk bonds to foreign stocks have also bounced back from their dismal end to 2018 but the

president erdogan and his ak party in bid to retain control of turkey s major cities amid sharp economic downturn istanbul turkey millions of turkish voters on sunday cast their ballots in critical local elections after a heated campaign dominated by discussions over the country s economy and security voting ended in turkey s eastern provinces at 4pm 13 00 gmt and in western provinces at 14 00 gmt the polls pose a major challenge for turkish president recep tayyip erdogan and his justice and development ak party given a backdrop of high inflation and rising unemployment sparked by a major currency crisis last year according to taha akyol a turkish political analyst and columnist the vote is the hardest faced by erdogan s party since coming to power in 2002 the party is trying hard to stay away from discussing actual economic issues he said ayse kara a 40 year old voter in istanbul said she cast her ballot taking into account the stability of the country i considered the economy and terror as the main issues while casting my vote i believe everything will get more stable after the elections kara who works in manufacturing told al jazeera ilke beltinge a 25 year old student said she did not like the country s current direction i cast my vote for more freedoms a better economy and a better educational system and i hope that we will see change following these polls she told al jazeera at an istanbul polling station two people were killed in the eastern province of malatya and dozens of others were wounded in various provinces of turkey in fights that broke out in the voting process state media reported turkey s economy has been hit hard since the lira lost as much as 40 percent of its value against the us dollar last year the currency crisis triggered in august after a bitter diplomatic spat with washington raised investor concerns over the independence of the central bank and highlighted wider worries over the performance of the economy the polls took place just weeks after official statistics showed that in the last two quarters of 2018 the turkish economy slipped into its first recession in a decade as inflation and interest rates soared due to the currency meltdown in february inflation stood at just under 20 percent while the central bank s main interest rate is currently 24 percent as part of an initiative to tackle rising inflation turkey s government set up these discounted food stalls pic twitter com 5zaiy2lvgc al jazeera english ajenglish march 30 2019 the lira on thursday resumed its slide following the return of liquidity at a key london exchange market after an earlier decision by authorities to hold it back in a move aimed at keeping the plunging currency steady and thwarting short sellers traders who bet against the lira erdogan has often blamed foreign powers and speculators for the currency fluctuations and other economic woes faced by turkey a message he repeated this week attempts by a range of western countries most importantly the us to put pressure on ankara were behind the august 2018 manipulations in the turkish currency market erdogan told reporters we must discipline the speculators in the market he said in another address rival coalitions with control of turkey s major cities up for grabs erdogan s ak party entered the election race with its ally in the last two polls the far right nationalist movement party mhp under the people s alliance the bloc s biggest rival is the nation s alliance which was formed by the centre left main opposition republican people s party chp and the right wing good iyi party 190327190617999 both blocs have fielded dozens of joint candidates in the country s provinces districts and towns the pro kurdish people s democracy party hdp the fifth party represented in parliament has not put forward any mayoral candidates for turkey s six largest provinces istanbul ankara izmir bursa antalya and adana opting instead to back candidates running against erdogan s alliance in recent years hdp has seen scores of its mayors removed and replaced with trustees due to terror charges under an emergency rule that was put in place after a failed coup in 2016 the emergency measure ended in july 2018 nationalistic rhetoric in the lead up to sunday s vote the people s alliance has sought to link the local polls to internal and external risks threatening the country s security the bloc s leaders have accused the parties in the nation alliance of being in cooperation with the outlawed kurdistan workers party pkk which has fought the turkish state for more than 30 years for its autonomy 190328135247320 erdogan himself has cited the fact that the pro kurdish hdp is not competing in major cities but supports his opponents as proof of that cooperation they do not talk about the dirty negotiations to carry the extensions of the pkk to municipalities through the candidate s list erdogan said in a recent rally the government argues that the hdp has organic links to the pkk a claim that has been denied by the political party separately the parties that make up the nation alliance have repeatedly dismissed the claims that they are cooperating with the hdp galip dalay a visiting fellow at the university of oxford said that erdogan s bloc used a high pitch nationalist rhetoric during the campaign with state security at its heart they used the concept of terror and terrorism very generously in almost all policy areas they link basic issues to terror and security dalay who is also a non resident fellow at brookings institution in doha told al jazeera the bloc also linked the economic situation of turkey and other problems the country is going through to conspiracies carried out by internal and external actors he said opposition campaign for its part the main opposition alliance has focused its campaign on the economic situation and its effect on citizens 190330051827609 it also used turkish flags in their campaigns rather than party banners in an apparent bid to attract voters from different backgrounds chp leader kemal kilicdaroglu has accused chronic economic mismanagement by the ak party and erdogan for the staggering unemployment high costs of living and the lira s weakening there are serious problems but they fail to explain how they will address these problems kilicdaroglu told supporters earlier this week arguing that the people s alliance was raising artificial security issues to distract voters from real problems how is the work of a mayor or a municipal council member related to state security or threats against turkey he asked according to dalay the nation alliance has carried out a low profile strategy without promoting the political identities of the chp and iyi party the parties comprising the bloc instead of putting forward identities of the two parties they put the spotlight on their candidates and the problems average citizens go through because of the economic crisis dalay said they try to bring up actual problems turkey is currently facing to attract such as inflation and unemployment he said follow umut uras on twitter um_uras

cent from a year earlier according to factset if they re right it would be the first decline in nearly three years that s setting the stage for some potentially disappointing reports when the next quarter opens on april 1 so investors may want to ready themselves for even more turbulence in the coming quarter besides earnings reports they ll also be getting more clues about the strength of the global economy and whether the united states and china can make progress on their trade dispute to help the global outlook
i last wrote on junior renewable energy utility polaris infrastructure tsx pif in early october 2018 since then it has lost 2 trailing behind its larger industry peers such as brookfield renewable partners which gained 7 over that period while there is a range of risks associated with polaris s operations its long term outlook remains positive and this decline in value has created an opportunity for risk tolerant investors recent acquisition diversifies its portfolio polaris owns and operates the san jacinto geothermal power plant located in nicaragua which has net installed capacity of 72 megawatts mw in late 2018 the utility completed the acquisition of union energy group which added that company s hydro assets to polaris s portfolio these assets were the five mw canchayllo hydro plant which has been in operation since 2015 as well as the generación andina and karpa projects upon completion they will boost polaris s installed capacity by 48 mw the generación andina development is forecast to be completed by the end of 2019 whereas in the case of karpa construction has yet to commence that deal reduced polaris s dependence on its nicaraguan business thereby mitigating some of the risk associated with its operations high degree of geopolitical risk the significant geopolitical risk connected to operating in nicaragua has been weighing on the company s stock the stock has been roughly handled by the market and is down by 37 over the last year nicaragua has been deeply embroiled in a political crisis which was sparked in april 2018 by government attempts at pension reform and led to protests that saw over 325 people lose their lives this has tipped the latin american nation into recession economists believe that nicaragua s gross domestic product gdp will contract by around 2 during 2019 and then the economy will return to growth in 2020 with it expected to expand by around 1 that recession coupled with heightened political risk is the key reason for polaris losing 37 over the last year aside from the obvious political risks the contraction of the economy will lead to lower demand for electricity because there is a direct correlation between gdp growth and consumption of energy growing earnings for 2018 polaris reported solid financial results including a 15 year over year increase in adjusted ebitda to us 57 8 million and net income grew sevenfold to us 12 million that notable increase in earnings was driven by an 11 year over year increase in average electricity generation the completion of the acquisition of union energy will give polaris s earnings a further lift during 2018 because of the addition of the operational five mw canchayllo hydro plant that growth will continue into 2020 as the generación andina plants are completed and brought online by the end of this year this along with rising demand for electricity in peru where the economy is forecast by the international monetary fund to expand by over 4 in 2019 and 2020 bodes well for further earnings growth robust balance sheet polaris possesses a solid balance sheet the company finished 2018 with almost us 38 million in cash and net debt of us 173 million which is a very manageable three times its annual adjusted ebitda this means polaris is well positioned to continue funding the construction of the generación andina assets and to evaluate whether it will progress development of the karpa operation is it time to buy polaris despite possessing many positive attributes polaris is a risky investment the risk has been magnified by recent events in its core market of nicaragua it is likely that its stock will remain under pressure until there are signs that the political and economic crisis in the latin american nation is easing there are however as discussed a range of positive catalysts that will lift earnings and ultimately polaris s market value while investors wait for that to occur they will be rewarded by the utility s regular quarterly dividend yielding a very tasty 7 that dividend which for 2018 had a payout ratio of 78 appears sustainable especially when it is considered that polaris s earnings will continue to grow at a healthy clip
there are roughly 100 billion neurons in the human brain these microscopic cells transmit and process information we receive from the outside world and turn our thoughts into action they are responsible for how we talk how we move and how we think neurons are in many ways what make us us strokes kill neurons by starving them of the blood that carries glucose and oxygen strokes trigger a biochemical cascade that destroys neurons in vast numbers ischemic strokes the most common form caused by a blocked blood vessel kill an average of 1 9 million neurons for every minute the patient is untreated those dead neurons add up and in 10 hours stroke patients can lose as many neurons as they would in 36 years of normal aging advertisement roughly 15 million men women and children suffer strokes every year and about half of them are fatal stroke is the second leading killer globally after its close cousin heart disease and far more deadly than cancer and the most life threatening communicable diseases like aids and malaria global rank cause deaths millions of total deaths 1 ischemic heart disease 9 43 16 6 2 stroke 5 78 10 2 3 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 3 04 5 3 4

pouring billions of dollars into the pursuit of drugs to protect neurons after strokes without success most drug companies abandoned the field by the mid 2000s advertisement today fewer than 5 of all stroke victims worldwide receive any treatment beyond basic palliative care and the lack of effective stroke drugs remains one of the most glaring unmet needs in medicine stroke is a maddeningly complex problem the intricacy of the brain the need for immediate action and the variability of both strokes and the people who have them make designing and testing drugs an enormous challenge but the medical establishment has failed stroke patients not just because the research is hard but because of misaligned incentives the financial pressures of an industrial drug development model and sloppy science stroke nihilism time is brain is a longtime cliche among stroke professionals but it s largely true death follows when a stroke causes the brain to swell starving it of oxygen or because the stroke destroys the body s ability to regulate breathing or blood flow others die from complications like pneumonia which can affect up to one third of all stroke patients stroke weakens the immune system making it harder for the body to fight lung infections that can occur when stroke victims who can no longer swallow properly wind up with food water or saliva in their lungs advertisement for most of history health workers had no way to help stroke victims once a stroke was identified the patient was made comfortable and family members were given the bad news stroke was viewed as a dead end for patients for researchers and for neurologists looking for solutions and stroke nihilism still permeates the medical establishment the bulk of progress in reducing stroke deaths has come from prevention particularly the introduction of medicines to lower high blood pressure a leading cause of stroke the first and to date only medical breakthrough for stroke treatment came when a drug called tissue plasminogen activator tpa sold globally under the brand names activase and actilyse was approved by the us food and drug administration fda in 1996 the goal of tpa is reperfusion the act of returning blood flow to the injured part of the brain while neurons in the immediate vicinity of the stroke can t be saved there s a larger zone called the ischemic penumbra that can be rescued if blood flow can be restored the longer the penumbra is deprived of blood the less brain there is to save advertisement with tpa emergency room doctors at last had a way to treat patients but as with most things in the world of stroke there were complications in this case the issue was that there are two kinds of stroke while the majority about 85 in the us are ischemic and caused by a blockage that can potentially be treated with tpa the rest are hemorrhagic caused by a ruptured blood vessel and tpa can be be fatal in these strokes because it prevents the blood from clotting for that reason the drug is also not given to patients on blood thinners or who have other complications as many as 65 ischemic stroke patients are not eligible for tpa doctors can t administer tpa without determining the nature of the stroke and that can only be done by examining the brain with a ct scan or some other advanced brain imaging device there are less than 4 5 hours after the onset of stroke for doctors to administer the drug in many cases not nearly enough time for a patient to get scanned for patients over 80 or those who had a previous stroke the window is only three hours read more with the pharma industry s repeated failures to develop stroke treatments stroke doctors have turned to mechanical devices that can clear blocked blood vessels in the brain advertisement further tpa is expensive the drug developed by genentech has no generic competition and a 100 milligram vial used in a typical treatment can cost more than 8 300 it also needs to be refrigerated a challenge for clinics in some parts of the world as a result the use of tpa is limited to affluent nations with sophisticated healthcare systems and even then it is only rarely administered since its introduction tpa has also been plagued by doubts about its safety stemming from long standing criticisms of its initial clinical trials as a result some doctors won t prescribe it even in eligible patients fewer than 5 of patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke in the us received the drug according to a 2014 study in poorer parts of the world the number is closer to zero despite tpa s limited reach it s enormously profitable estimated to make 1 5 billion pdf in revenue this year for roche the swiss pharma giant that owns genentech the lesson they learned is that they should pursue something else given tpa s limitations and the enormous potential market researchers have focused on finding a drug that preserves neurons until the brain is reperfused these drugs called neuroprotective agents could either save the brain cells in the penumbra until the brain heals or extend the window of time to preserve neurons in stroke patients until a clot is dissolved by tpa or removed with a mechanical device in theory a neuroprotective drug that could be given safely to the 15 million victims of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke each year and that could be administered without scanning them first could generate many times tpa s revenues advertisement jeffrey saver a university of california la neurologist at the forefront of stroke research for decades calls neuroprotection the holy grail of stroke treatment and like that sacred relic its pursuit has been an epic tale of frustration and failure according to one landmark study 1 026 potential neuroprotective drugs were tested between 1957 and 2003 in 8 516 separate experiments researchers experimented with aged garlic extracts uric acid and compounds engineered from pigs brains their trials have alluring names built out of complicated acronyms that suggest important science is taking place venus action saint none worked those failures cost billions of dollars and wasted the productive years of thousands of scientists worse they salted the ground for future research ushering in what one researcher called the nuclear winter for neuroprotection research the pharma industry saw more lucrative opportunities elsewhere and moved on advertisement sadly the lesson they learned is that they should pursue something else says myron ginsberg a neurologist at the university of miami who has studied the industry s failures but not all scientists accepted that conclusion on the fringes of industrial medicine one neurosurgeon has spent the last two decades doggedly developing a neuroprotective agent the great white north of neuroscience the best hope for stroke patients may come not from the giant research labs of industrial pharma or the biotech hotbeds of boston or san francisco but from the relative backwater of toronto ontario michael tymianski now 55 has been working on his drug called na 1 since the late 1990s when researchers were still infused with optimism about developing a stroke treatment a tall balding man with a furious work ethic tymianski poured himself into developing na 1 while holding down his day job as a neurosurgeon at a toronto hospital his plan was always to develop the drug to the point where it could be tested in humans then sell it to a pharma company but no buyers materialized and eventually tymianski stopped looking advertisement instead in 2003 tymianski founded his tiny biotech startup fueled by confidence in the drug based on his critical insight into brain chemistry following a stroke neurons become flooded with calcium which generates free radicals unstable molecules with an unpaired electron like nitric oxide or no which causes havoc in neurons but tymianski and his team identified a drug that prevents a protein called psd 95 from binding within neurons enabling them to resist that lethal accumulation of no he called the drug na 1 and in a nod to the chemical action named the biotech nono inc tymianski speaks carefully and precisely with a self deprecation that doesn t quite mask his underlying self confidence it s clear in our interviews he relishes playing the david to big pharma s goliath and is consciously trying to make medical history more than once he began a sentence when the book of nono is written advertisement what was i supposed to do put this in a desk drawer and forget about it he never set out to become a pharmaceutical executive but with the pharma industry out of the stroke business tymianski was forced to go it alone bootstrapping funding from friends and neighbors i was completely unqualified to do it he says but what was i supposed to do put this in a desk drawer and forget about it i saw this as a natural extension of my obligation as a physician in the 15 years since founding nono tymianski has raised more than c 120 million approximately 90 4 million from about 100 investors and nono is now testing its neuroprotective drug in two ambitious phase iii trials in humans na 1 isn t the first neuroprotective drug to advance to phase iii trials and there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about its chances for success as german stroke researcher ulrich dirnagl notes neuroprotection has never been proven to work in humans advertisement an advocate of more rigorous statistical analysis of stroke research dirnagl informally handicaps the odds of various trials for stroke treatments in an email he gave his prediction for na 1 my guess is somewhere between 10 and 20 which is the highest rating i have for any running neuroprotection trial tymianski understands the doubts but nono has learned from the failures of the pharma industry and has constructed its clinical trials to improve the odds of winning regulatory approval and launching na 1 into the market the road to success is uncharted because everyone before us has failed tymianski says we don t necessarily know what to do to succeed but we do know what not to do from chinese food to failure the history of neuroprotection research begins strangely enough with chinese food the flavor additive monosodium glutamate commonly known as msg was first identified in japan in 1908 by chemist kikunae ikeda who was intrigued by the origins of the umami taste in seaweed through products like ajinomoto a flavor enhancer msg became a staple of asian cooking advertisement chinese restaurants in the us used msg widely and it was eventually adopted by western food manufacturers like campbell s soup and sold in american supermarkets most commonly under the brand name accent flavor enhancer used for decades without incident msg began drawing the attention of the medical community in 1968 when the new england journal of medicine published a letter to the editor describing symptoms of numbness and palpitations that the writer robert ho man kwok attributed to eating at chinese restaurants kwok himself a recent chinese immigrant identified msg as a possible culprit the nejm dubbed the symptoms chinese restaurant syndrome and ignited a long racially tinged debate over the health effects of msg the next year john olney a neurologist at washington university in st louis published a paper in science demonstrating that in mice dosed with msg neurons died leading to brain lesions olney became a crusader against msg and enlisted ralph nader in a campaign to have the fda ban the additive in later years however olney s conclusions were questioned the mice in his experiment were injected with not fed msg and in much higher amounts relative to body size than humans ever ingested the fears over msg he helped stoke have been largely discredited but olney who died in 2015 had widened understanding of brain chemistry and how glutamate can kill neurons advertisement glutamate is an amino acid found widely in the brain and central nervous system it lives in the axons the tendrils at the end of neurons and plays a critical role in sending messages between those neurons once its host neuron sends out the right signal the glutamate is released and crosses the synapse the divide between two neurons on the other side of the synapse the glutamate binds to the receptor of another neuron too little glutamate results in a weak signal between neurons and too much as olney discovered in the 1970s can excite neurons to death by flooding them with calcium in a process he called excitotoxicity excitotoxicity is believed to be a culprit in a range of neurological diseases such as epilepsy parkinson s als and stroke some people thought they would get a nobel prize during a stroke the loss of blood causes neurons to release glutamate into the spaces between cells the pooled glutamate over excites the cell receptors causing them to open gateways which allow calcium to flow into the neurons an overload of calcium inside the cells generates free radicals which can damage parts of the cell like dna and lipids eventually killing the neuron in the 1980s steven rothman then a neurologist at washington university showed in lab experiments this process could be blocked saving neurons during this period research in germany into the effects of blood deprivation in the brain suggested that neurons could survive and be revived after reperfusion advertisement stroke doctors were convinced a major new treatment for stroke was just around the corner says dirnagl there was huge enthusiasm many scientists moved into the field and industry got very excited some people thought they would get a nobel prize mike tymianski was one of the young researchers swept up in the enthusiasm that was indeed a golden time he says now tymianski graduated medical school from the university of toronto in 1987 and began training to be a surgeon but he interrupted his studies to earn a phd so he could pursue research while practicing surgery neurology offered a particular appeal what drove me was curiosity and the greatest unknowns in the biological sciences were in neuroscience he says his curiosity has led to some unusual decisions in his life both professional and personal like choosing to install his own walk in wine cellar in his toronto home he spent months erecting drywall and installing wiring for lighting often working between midnight and 3 am as he juggled his other jobs if i hire someone to do something i won t learn how to do it next time he says i would never have learned how to hang drywall and run electricity in his extremely limited spare time he s now building a st lawrence skiff a 20 ft wooden boat to use at the summer home he and his wife dawn own on lake ontario s thousand islands it is the second marriage for both and they each brought children into what dawn who is ceo of the nurse practitioner s association of ontario calls a brady bunch marriage their combined four children are all now grown advertisement through his work as a surgeon researcher and now the ceo of one of the few and one of the most promising biotech startups in canada tymianski has achieved a place of prominence in the nation s establishment he was appointed to the order of canada in 2017 among its highest civilian honors and wears its lapel pin proudly but he was born in israel and is a dual citizen israel left a powerful impression even though tymianski moved away while still a boy israel is a high intensity country he says i lived through two wars by the time i was 10 it s hard to forget that growing up during war time may have infused him with a greater sense of urgency he now speculates tymianski s father marek was a polish refugee who fled the nazis first to belarus then uzbekistan before arriving in israel in 1950 where he met tymianski s mother rosemary also from poland most of their extended family was murdered in the concentration camps marek studied to be an engineer and worked in an israeli military factory rosemary later worked as a lab technician in canada advertisement in 1974 the family left israel and migrated to france living for a year first in nice then paris before moving to ontario where they had relatives tymianski didn t speak english when he arrived but spoke enough french to survive in bilingual canada he gravitated towards science in school and studied math and physics at the university of toronto with an eye toward med school i didn t go into medicine with a mission related to my life he says it s not that i had a sick sibling or a parent i just thought it would be a really interesting area to have as a launching pad for future things after med school as a phd student in the 1990s tymianski was inspired by the new wave of literature exploring the mechanisms behind excitotoxicity and cell death he began to investigate the role of calcium in neuron death calcium is the gas pedal in cells driving many cellular actions he says cells regulate calcium but sometimes they fail and an overload of calcium can be fatal through his research tymianski found the story was more complicated at least when it came to brain cells advertisement when calcium entered through a particular gateway linked to glutamate called an nmda receptor the calcium was toxic he found but if it came through another route the calcium was harmless tymianski believed that a protein called psd 95 discovered only a few years earlier was responsible for rendering calcium toxic but proving it took years of laborious lab experiments it was a frustrating process and tymianski nearly quit before his graduate student rita sattler now a professor of neurobiology at the barrow neurological institute in phoenix urged him to persevere eventually they proved psd 95 in nmda receptors was the key to explaining why glutamate flooded cells with toxic calcium when psd 95 was eliminated the calcium didn t create nitric oxide the free radical lethal to neurons the results of the experiment were published in science in 1999 by 2002 tymianski s lab had developed na 1 a drug that links to psd 95 preventing the protein from binding with the nmda receptor and eliminating its toxic effects at least that s what he found in lab animals advertisement tymianski and his team published these findings in science in 2002 and in theory the pharmaceutical industry should have been lining up outside his door ready to buy the rights to na 1 and prove that what worked in lab animals also worked in humans but much had changed in the decade since he began his work and neuroprotection research once full of promise was now shunned by the pharmaceutical industry as tymianski describes it stroke research had become a pariah a most challenging disease traditionally stroke has been viewed as a disease of the developed world where fatty diets and tobacco two leading causes of the condition are prevalent and where populations are more likely to live into old age but because of advances in prevention and improvements in basic hospital care stroke fatalities have leveled off or declined in affluent nations in recent decades meanwhile as tobacco use and meat consumption have risen in poorer parts of the world stroke incidence has more than doubled since 1970 advertisement stroke is now turning into a tropical disease says derek lowe a former pharma scientist who blogs about drug discovery for science magazine malaria and dengue have gone without treatments for decades because their victims are often poor people in poor countries and pharma saw little opportunity for profit stroke now might suffer the same fate though thousands of compounds could potentially act as neuroprotectants unless a pharma company holds the patent it has no incentive to pursue them the us national institutes of health the federal medical science research agency can t afford to sponsor thousands of trials it really has to be run by industry and the industry really has to see a profit motive ginsberg says there are myriad other reasons that make developing drugs for stroke so difficult for one the brain is a particularly challenging organ to work with unlike say the heart which is mostly made of uniform cardiac muscle the brain is a collection of hundreds of little villages most of which have limited connection with each other says steven cramer a stroke researcher at the university of california irvine it s really lots of different organs that kind of grew up together over the last 100 million years advertisement that means strokes can have different impacts depending on where they take place on the size of the blood vessel that is blocked or ruptured and on the strength of the flow of the collateral circulation system the network of smaller vessels that can reroute the flow of blood when a major artery is blocked time is brain but time is not the same for everyone and depending on the wiring of the vessels a severe stroke in one patient may not have the same impact in another the diversity of human brains and the wildly varying types of strokes that can affect them mean identical treatments may produce very different outcomes in clinical trials depending on the mix of patients a trial may indicate a drug is more effective than it actually is or could be unfairly labeled a failure advertisement meanwhile patient recruitment is a vexing problem for stroke researchers a stroke is less like cancer or diabetes where treatment can be planned over months and patients can evaluate their options than it is like a car crash where treatment can t wait there is little or no time to explain the potential risks of joining a clinical trial or to secure consent in any case patients suffering brain injuries often don t have the ability to understand what they are being asked to sign by the time relatives can be found to sign off on enrollment it may be too late to administer the treatment another reason the pharma industry has struggled with stroke is that outcomes are imprecise diseases like cancer lend themselves to definitive answers such as how long a drug can extend a patient s life but stroke treatments are often intended to improve the condition of patients from severely disabled to less severely disabled a fuzzy standard that is hard to replicate across all the patients in a clinical trial the problem is ideas advertisement there are also enormous differences in the quality of rehabilitation available to stroke patients in different parts of the world and in different socioeconomic situations particularly in the us where access to healthcare follows income poor patients may receive inadequate rehabilitation and therefore won t show the same improvement as a wealthy patient it means the results of clinical trials can be warped by factors as unpredictable as the patient s health insurance and access to rehabilitation facilities there are financial obstacles to r d as well increasingly large pharma companies have outsourced innovation to small nimble biotech startups founded on the strength of one or two bright ideas the venture capital firms that bankroll those startups only make investments where they think there will be a lucrative exit usually in the form of an acquisition and so only place bets on drugs that target an in demand therapy area says bernard munos a fellow at the milken institute who once worked for eli lilly co and now consults for the pharma industry as stroke research failures multiplied and the pharma industry walked away vcs noticed vcs are very sensitive to what diseases are hot because they re thinking about the exits munos says no one is saying invest in stroke research but ultimately it s the want of a great idea not market incentives that has been the biggest barrier lowe says advertisement more money would probably help a little bit but the problem is ideas he says there is a ton of money an unbelievable amount of money just sitting there for anyone who can do anything about alzheimer s have we done anything about alzheimer s we have not rodents and primates after the initial waves of discovery into the role of glutamate in neuron death researchers began experimenting with compounds that targeted the nmda receptors that controlled the flow of glutamate into the cell many drugs showed promise in lab animals only to fail in human studies occasionally causing serious side effects often the drugs would effectively disrupt the nmda glutamate receptors but would cause havoc throughout the rest of the nervous system in retrospect there were serious flaws with the animal trials says ashfaq shuaib a professor of neurology at the university of alberta to save money laboratories would use smaller mammals like rodents cats or dogs instead of primates whose brains more closely resemble those of humans but which are significantly more expensive the rodents were often inbred so they were genetically similar and young and healthy researchers induced strokes in the animals by injecting a clot into the middle cerebral artery of their brains so each animal suffered the same size and type of stroke this systematic approach made the results more uniform and the data cleaner but it didn t really resemble the variety of stroke in humans the animal models presented researchers with unrealistically strong signals shuaib says further the animals were given large doses of the drugs much larger than what would be given to human patients it was quite naive he says now advertisement as failures in neuroprotection drug trials began to mount academic and industry researchers convened in march of 1999 to examine their errors and adopt best practices for future trials the stroke treatment academic industry roundtable or stair produced a number of guidelines for researchers pdf such as avoiding the use of mice and gerbils in animal trials and ensuring experiments were successfully replicated in two or more laboratories before advancing to human patients but while the stair guidelines added rigor they still couldn t control for human error the sad story of saint in the mid 1990s astrazeneca the uk pharma giant struck a deal with centaur pharmaceutical a biotech startup for the rights to develop cerovive a neuroprotective drug candidate the drug also known as nxy 059 showed promise in animal and early stage human trials and by the early 2000s enthusiasm was high even as the rest of the industry was shunning neuroprotection in a complex undertaking between may 2003 and november 2004 astrazeneca enrolled 1 722 patients across 158 hospitals in 24 countries in a trial for cerovive called saint the trial adhered to the stair criteria patients could be given the drug up to six hours after their stroke but each hospital was required to maintain an average of four hours the six hour limit was picked out of convenience rather than evidence to get as many patients as quickly as possible as fast as possible says shuaib who was one of the authors of the study it was a mistake advertisement the push from pharma was get the study completed quickly so unfortunately what that meant was you put it into all kinds of patients he says the results of saint published in february 2006 showed a modest benefit for patients who were given cerovive still in the world of neuroprotection even a small sign of success was considered significant investors and the financial press took notice and stroke researchers celebrated the results in retrospect researchers should have been more skeptical about the saint results according to shuaib there was a positive sign but it was just on the margins shuaib says it met the criteria set out by the statisticians so it was good enough for all of us to satisfy the fda s requirements for two completed phase iii trials astrazeneca had simultaneously launched an even bigger trial saint ii which was planned to include 1 700 patients but because of the inconclusive results of sant i astrazeneca doubled the size of saint ii enrolling 3 306 patients from 362 hospitals in 31 countries advertisement on oct 26 2006 astrazeneca released a press release that stunned the medical and financial worlds based on the results of saint ii cerovive was a failure astrazeneca s stock fell 7 7 shares of renovis a biotech that bought centaur in 2002 plunged 76 and it laid off nearly half its workforce the following year by 2009 renovis was no more the blow to stroke research was longer lasting john patterson astrazeneca s head of drug development declared defeat not just for cerovive but for the entire class of drugs to which it belonged we don t think there is any mileage in a neuroprotectant approach he told reporters in a conference call the day the failure was announced reuters reported we ll not look to acquire any projects in the stroke area in this particular field we think we ve done the definitive study here advertisement astrazeneca declined to discuss its experience with cerovive it was an embarrassment while the saint trials may have been the most spectacular failure throughout the history of neuroprotection investigation researchers let their optimism get in the way of sound science says ucla s jeff saver scientists didn t rigorously blind and randomize animal subjects and they didn t declare their metrics for success before the trial instead cherry picking the results that made the best case for the drug s effectiveness saver calls the history of neuroprotection chastening there were no villains he says and plenty of blame to go around it was an embarrassment but not a scandal he says everyone was trying to do right but we weren t smart enough to recognize it advertisement nono for an answer tymianski now the ceo of his own drug company is philosophical about the failings of the pharmaceutical industry it s easy to find mistakes in hindsight he says it s harder for me to judge what happened now that i m walking in their shoes still there s no question in retrospect you can spot the errors he says he remains astonished that cerovive could proceed as far as it did with no real evidence it worked one reason tymianski chose to form nono and develop the drug himself he says is i didn t trust to do the right thing scientifically but even if he was a fan of the drug industry it s not like pharma had any interest in na 1 after the publication of the 2002 science paper introducing the drug there was no stampede to buy na 1 as tymianski considered future directions he reached out to potential mentors including john evans a cardiologist who had chaired allelix biopharmaceuticals one of canada s first biotechs he said there s no such thing as a nice drug company and stay away from vcs for as long as you can tymianski recalls advertisement tymianski began approaching investors starting with friends and family he was his usual blunt self the pitch was kiss your money goodbye there s no exit strategy and you ll probably never see it again but if we win our patients will win and you will do fine he says to his surprise most of the potential investors he asked have signed on kiss your money goodbye one early supporter was josh josephson the owner of a chain of canadian optician offices and tymianski s neighbor others followed including ron kimel a toronto real estate mogul and kevin o leary a canadian entrepreneur better known to americans as mr wonderful from his appearances on the tv show shark tank not all of nono s investors are wealthy tymianski says and they all have his mobile number tymianski interrupted one of our conversations to take a call from an investor advertisement most of his initial investors have stood by him tymianski says and he s just completed a seventh round of angel investing nono has also secured c 20 million in grants including more than c 6 million from the brain canada foundation to fund phase iii testing tymianski calls himself a silver backed gorilla when it comes to winning grants because nono has made it this far without venture capital or corporate investment tymianski has the freedom to develop na 1 as he sees fit without pursuing the shortcuts that proved the downfall of other neuroprotection candidates for example na 1 was tested by independent researchers in multiple centers to ward against biased findings from tymianski s lab in addition after it was found to work in rats na 1 was given to long tailed macaques a monkey species chosen because of its anatomical similarities to humans tymianski also developed an innovative approach to the core challenge that pharma had encountered in human trials patient recruitment he did it bypassing stroke patients altogether in his phase ii trial advertisement in his day job as a neurosurgeon tymianski often treats brain aneurysms which are caused by a weak area in blood vessels bulging or ballooning in the course of repairing these aneurysms with mechanical devices small ischemic strokes can be caused by dislodged cholesterol and blood clots blocking minute arteries these small strokes aren t life threatening and are predictable and visible through mri scanning so tymianski reasoned that he would have a better chance of proving na 1 penetrated brain cells in a population of aneurysm repair patients than trying it in a much more diverse group of ischemic stroke patients who arrived in emergency rooms over two and a half years na 1 or a placebo was administered to 185 patients undergoing brain aneurysm repair surgery at 14 hospitals in the us and canada in a phase ii trial called enact the results published in the lancet neurology in 2012 showed patients treated with na 1 had fewer strokes and a subset of the aneurysm patients that suffered hemorrhagic strokes showed improved neurological functions compared to the placebo group after 30 days enact frontier and escape na 1 in the small world of stroke research tymianski s work has drawn attention because of the creativity of his approach and the promise of his results it was developed in a thoughtful way says ginsberg based on the success of enact na 1 is now being tested in two phase iii trials with the first results expected in early 2020 if they are successful pending regulatory approval stroke doctors may at last have a drug that can save brain cells one trial called frontier is administering na 1 to stroke victims in ambulances so it gets into patients as quickly as possible so far more than 300 patients have received na 1 or the placebo in a median time of 59 minutes after their stroke advertisement another trial called escape na 1 is an effort to see if na 1 can help ischemic stroke patients who have been reperfused with mechanical devices the trial is being conducted at nearly 50 stroke centers around the world why not be a good guy together tymianski says the trials are an attempt to replicate the conditions where he knows na 1 works in lab monkeys given the drug soon after strokes are induced and where blood is restored to the penumbra unlike in the trials for cerovive and other experimental neuroprotectants where the drug went from the carefully controlled environment of the lab to the chaotic emergency rooms of stroke care na 1 is being tested in humans in situations designed to give it the best chance of showing results and winning regulatory approval advertisement if successful tymianski will need to decide what to do with na 1 options include an outright sale of nono to a pharma company licensing the drug or forming a partnership or nono could try to commercialize the drug itself perhaps by filing an ipo we will do what s best for the company and for the people that it serves tymianski says maintaining control of na 1 would give nono some say in its pricing and availability in the developing world where it could potentially be the first stroke treatment of any kind because na 1 doesn t operate in blood vessels like tpa the hope is that it can be safely administered to victims of both hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes obviating the need to ct scan patients first the drug could therefore be given to stroke patients in rural settings or poor countries where the medical infrastructure required to administer tpa is unavailable tymianski says he d like to be able to offer na 1 at cost in countries where most people couldn t afford even a modest price there is no profit to be made from people who have no money he says why not be a good guy advertisement the high cost of failure prescription drug prices in the us have risen dramatically in recent decades 57 from 2006 to 2014 the pharma industry blames the growing list prices on the costs of developing a successful drug and drug discovery is certainly expensive a recent study places the cost at 2 6 billion for a single approved medicine that s a lot for a pharma company to make up in the 20 years of a drug s patent protected life but that price tag doesn t just include the cost of originating a successful drug it also folds in the r d costs of the many more unsuccessful attempts drug companies can t endlessly absorb those losses so they are passed along to consumers in higher overall drug prices failure is part of science it s build into the most basic concept of trial and error that underpins the scientific method we need to tolerate failure and pay for it in order to benefit from the successes but the expectation is that failure is the result of honest attempts based on the best information available using the most rigorous and sophisticated methodology when the drug industry wastes billions of dollars because of sloppy science we are quite literally paying for its mistakes advertisement the fact that the prognosis of millions of future stroke patients may rest on the part time job of a canadian surgeon speaks to how badly broken stroke research has become at the institutional level stroke is an unwanted step child a disease of both the blood system and the brain it falls between the cracks of cardiology and neurology embraced by neither discipline the neglect is apparent in the funding while research into lung disease and alzheimer s each received almost 2 billion in federal funding from the national institutes of health in the 2018 fiscal year stroke research was given just 349 million stroke has few advocates its victims are often already old and infirm and its survivors are ill equipped to hold rallies and lobby their legislators there is no ice bucket challenge for stroke advertisement many of the approximately 25 million survivors of stroke living around the world today have serious impairments some permanent that tax resources for families and healthcare systems stroke costs the planet 113 million disability adjusted life years annually a metric that includes the impact of early deaths and total years lived with disability in the us alone stroke cost 34 billion in medical expenses and lost economic activity in 2013 the most recent year for which data are available despite the pharma industry s abdication neuroprotection is a big enough problem and represents a big enough jackpot for the researcher that solves it that tymianski isn t alone in trying treatments in clinical trials include a drug that increases the supply of oxygen to the ischemic penumbra and a stem cell therapy that promotes healing in damaged cells other studies are experimenting with nitroglycerin patches to control blood pressure in stroke patients and drugs to reduce brain swelling in a world where very little is known to work very little can be ruled out there is a long tradition of medical research advancing through blunders and happenstance alexander fleming famously discovered penicillin by accident it may be that stroke s best hope is a result of the industry ignoring tymianski when he first discovered na 1 allowing him to develop it free of their meddling as a global society we tackle diseases not in the order of greatest need but according to the priorities of the pharmaceutical industry their decisions are shaped by the potential return on investment and a distorted regulatory structure that can make a treatment for a rare disease more profitable than one for a massive killer advertisement on occasion the needs of the drug industry and society line up and we have a bounty of new cancer drugs as a result but when the research is hard and the patients are poor the market fails we can hope for people like mike tymianski to provide cures but we shouldn t have to count on it
central bank of kenya governor patrick njoroge kenya is in no rush to secure a new standby credit facility with the international monetary fund as its economy continues to show strength central bank governor patrick njoroge said on thursday the previous 989 8 million arrangement expired in september after the government failed to meet the imf s conditions for an extension including the repeal of a cap on commercial lending njoroge told reporters kenya was talking the imf about a new standby facility but was not desperate for a deal it s not that we are on the ropes that the economy is on the ropes and we need the imf to come and sort us out he added njoroge offered no timeline for when an agreement might be reached but said conversations would continue during the imf s spring meetings in april the government is preparing to issue a 2 5 billion eurobond and analysts have said it could secure a better interest rate if the standby arrangement with the imf was in place but njoroge said the two things were different some of us are so fixated about these two that they are aligned that s maybe why we at times feel that we are under pressure we will do it when we need to he said there is no rush he was speaking a day after the central bank kept its benchmark lending rate at 9 0 percent saying inflation expectations remain within the target range njoroge said the kenyan economy was still on course for 6 3 percent economic growth this year driven by agriculture services and a further recovery in industry even though the external outlook is weakening the central bank estimates 2018 growth at 6 1 percent china s slowdown and trade dispute with the united states and continued uncertainty over britain s exit from the european union are all dragging on the global economy while kenya will see a continuation of existing trade arrangements with britain brexit may affect foreign direct investment into the uk so which way forward well go figure njoroge said on brexit those external elements will continue to push down the expectations and outcomes in the global economy and that obviously has implications for us on wednesday the central bank restated its view that the cap on commercial lending rates set at 4 percentage points above the benchmark by lawmakers in late 2016 constrains its ability to conduct monetary policy effectively a kenyan court ruled in march that the cap was unconstitutional but judges suspended the decision for 12 months to allow parliament to re examine the law private sector credit grew by 3 4 percent in the 12 months to february compared to 3 0 percent in january the central bank said on wednesday it forecast the current account deficit would narrow to 4 8 percent of gdp in 2019 from an estimated 4 9 percent in 2018 we expect our current account deficit to remain around 5 percent in the medium term njoroge said
serhiy kaplin is running for president but he knows his chances of winning aren t high rather the two term lawmaker says he is running to offer ukrainians an alternative to the current triangle of frontrunners incumbent president petro poroshenko former prime minister yulia tymoshenko and the surprise favorite comedian volodymyr zelenskiy he terms them respectively he she and it kaplin is a charismatic speaker known to deploy a humorous turn of phrase but his campaign and political plans are dead serious he says the lawmaker advances a populist platform of helping ordinary ukrainians and he s also running as the leader of a new party despite last being elected to the verkhovna rada in 2014 for the bloc of petro poroshenko he is now the leader of the social democratic party our job is to tear up this vicious triangle and offer an ideological european economically and historically sound alternative he says in my opinion it s the national idea known as social democracy kaplin adds i m doing almost exactly the same as senator bernie sanders or alexandra in america he means alexandria ocasio cortez the 29 year old democratic socialist firebrand recently elected from new york city to the u s house of representatives in both the united states and britain socialism is gaining popularity among young people disaffected with the low wages shrinking benefits and limited social mobility they see as inherent as in the capitalist system millions of ukrainians face more a extreme version of these problems in a country where the average monthly wage is just over 300 socialism should presumably have a strong base here but in ukraine socialist candidates at the campaign s peak there were three running for president remain distinctly unpopular in the 2019 presidential race bogged down by ukraine s communist history and economic populism across the political spectrum these politicians struggle to stand out despite an ostensible demand for economic justice in ukraine burden of history despite their limited popularity today left wing candidates have long played a central role in ukrainian politics both of the country s first two presidents leonid kravchuk and leonid kuchma emerged from the soviet communist party and the communist and socialist parties made up a significant portion of the verkhovna rada in the 1990s and early 2000s during the country s 1999 presidential election kuchma faced a series of left wing challengers and his victory was far from guaranteed several polls during the campaign showed that kuchma s three leftist competitors oleksandr moroz of the socialist party petro symonenko of the communist party and natalia vitrenko of the progressive socialist party enjoyed a slight lead over the incumbent others showed moroz as his strongest challenger polling by the democratic initiatives foundation even showed vitrenko with a significant lead over kuchma at several points during the campaign however disunity also harmed left wing candidates vitrenko a marxist leninist hardliner known for her pro russian views had broken from moroz s socialist party over its more moderate stance on market reforms and cultural issues in august 1999 moroz would attempt to form a coalition with three smaller left wing candidates in the town of kaniv despite their promise to unite behind the strongest candidate only one of the kaniv four exited the race there was also a significant amount of foul play some believed kuchma was financing vitrenko in an attempt to take votes away from moroz who had until recently been speaker of the rada and was perceived as a strong candidate most shockingly vitrenko and over 30 supporters were injured in a grenade attack on the candidate in october 1999 one of the key suspects was reportedly a low level election employee of the socialist party pro kuchma media accused moroz who denied any involvement in the attack of turning to terrorism later kuchma s former bodyguard would implicate the president in ordering the attack on vitrenko and instructing the country s sbu security agency to make one of the suspects testify against moroz ultimately support for moroz in the 1999 election would disappoint kuchma would take first place followed by communist symonenko a pro russian back to the ussr candidate in the second round kuchma would handily defeat his opponent with 56 25 percent of the vote mixed prospects after the 1999 election leftists continued to play a role in ukrainian politics albeit a less significant one but the euromaidan revolution which drove pro russian president viktor yanukovych from power in february 2014 delivered a serious blow to these politicians and russia s annexation of crimea and invasion of ukraine s eastern donbas would largely discredit pro russian politics in 2015 ukraine banned the communist party effectively knocking symonenko out of mainstream politics meanwhile the stridently pro russian vitrenko is more known today for political commentary published on youtube than for her actual participation in politics still social democracy and socialism remain popular ideologies in ukraine to this day according to a 2018 survey by the friedrich ebert foundation around 41 percent of ukrainians relate positively to social democracy while about 35 percent are positive about socialism however the survey also found that many ukrainians are not greatly informed about different political ideologies and struggle to identify their own leftists today today s left wing candidates are further removed from the soviet legacy they say they want to build a social democratic and european ukraine but not all their positions are obvious steps in that direction serhiy kaplin says he wants ukraine to have a strong president something he views as necessary for the country s rapid development and calls for the elimination of the post of prime minister that seemingly contradicts the lessons of the country s two revolutions as well as most expert opinion one of kaplin s biggest promises the subject of the main campaign ad on his site is to make natural gas four times cheaper for household consumers he has driven this promise home by trolling tymoshenko who promises to cut gas prices in half on social media after a photo appeared online of tymoshenko eating a hot dog kaplin posted a photo of himself with four hot dogs kaplin has also promised to raise the minimum wage to hr 10 000 around 372 from the current hr 4 173 155 to raise the minimum pension to hr 5 000 186 and to create 5 million new jobs he cites his experiences in the politics of gas producing poltava oblast as a former entrepreneur and as the deputy chair of the rada s committee on social policy as the source of his insight into these issues in ukraine workers salaries make up only around 8 percent of the cost of production in europe it s 30 to 60 percent and in the united states it s around 50 percent kaplin told the kyiv post over there you re a partner here you re a slave he says that absolutely does not suit me populist leftist kaplin is not the only socialist candidate running with such a message another is illia kyva an interior ministry colonel and ex advisor to interior minister arsen avakov a former member of the far right right sector party kyva took formal control of the socialist party a move that kaplin tried to fight in court in his official platform kyva proposes creating a unified database of citizens in order to provide social payments to people not earning enough to get by and raising the minimum pension to the official subsistence level he also wants to end ukraine s cooperation with the international monetary fund his fiery rhetoric easily resembles that of both socialist and non socialist populist candidates the state is thinking up newer and newer means to destroy the nation subsidies miserly salaries and pensions debt collectors he said in a statement on his party s website criminality this is ukraine s state power however kyva has also attracted attention for sexism during an interview on the 112 ua television channel kyva said his former boss ex national police chief khatia dekanoidze was pretty and that made an impression but it was difficult for me to accept a female leader he then attempted to justify his sexism saying jesus was sexist the third and final socialist presidential candidate in 2019 was a familiar face until he exited the race on march 27 oleksandr moroz the two time rada speaker and founder of the socialist party now however he was representing the aptly named socialist party of oleksandr moroz it was the veteran politician s fifth presidential campaign while he announced he was withdrawing his candidacy it was too late to technically do it so he will nevertheless appear on the ballot moroz has undeniably played an important role in ukrainian politics for many years representing the country s democratic left constituency in 2000 he publicly accused kuchma of involvement in the murder of journalist georgy gongadze based upon testimony of the president s former bodyguard and moroz actively took part in the orange revolution against voter fraud in the 2004 presidential election however he had largely been out of politics since 2007 he said he was running again because he believes the country is being intentionally destroyed in contrast to kaplin moroz had a different plan the elimination of the office of the president in its current form he told the kyiv post he also wants to eliminate the state administration which he said promoted corruption and reform tax legislation to empower municipal government according to the constitution the people are the source of power but this source only exists for a few minutes when they are voting moroz told the kyiv post this shows us that the authorities are far from the people not under their control and do not meet the standards of the constitution but there were also distinct issues with moroz s candidacy the veteran politician is highly negative on the euromaidan revolution which he characterizes as simply a conflict between two different sets of political actors he also repeatedly asserted that ukraine s government is being controlled from the outside and that the election results will be determined by the global government moroz may also be tainted by previous political associations during a televised debate in which he took part political scientist oleksiy haran both praised and criticized the politician you truly did a lot for ukrainian parliamentarianism but in 2006 you sold yourself to yanukovych for the position of rada speaker haran said you formed a coalition with yanukovych and symonenko and as a result yanukovych became the prime minister new left why is the ukrainian left so weak today in reality the problems go beyond the discrediting of the soviet model and several prominent leftist politicians pro russian orientations one of main reasons is that much of the post 1991 left actually is not truly left says political scientist mykhailo minakov he believes the country has two right wing political groups one that is ethno nationalist and the other that is neo soviet the communist party and the progressive socialist party were actually soviet conservative minakov says certain lines between left and right have also become blurred in ukraine minakov notes that far right parties are increasingly pushing traditionally leftist ideas like de oligarchization and nationalizing parts of the economy there is a demand for equality and social justice in ukraine it s huge and it s part of the culture minakov says but at the same time we are traumatized by the soviet experience that does not transfer the demand into supply but there is another left in the country one that is progressive and european in its political orientation minakov says the respublica party operates out of a small apartment in an ordinary housing complex in central kyiv unlike other socialist parties it is not fielding a candidate in the presidential election and it very clearly lacks both political and financial resources however the young and youth oriented party has a clear political ideology and big plans for the future pavlo viknyansky who leads respublica has dreams of a democratic political coalition that includes everyone from workers and coal miners to the lgbt community for years the party struggled to officially register facing repeated rejections by the justice ministry viknyansky says only after euromaidan did it manage to formalize its status viknyansky says the ukrainian oligarchy is trying to discredit left wing ideas and the pseudo leftist candidates running for president only help achieve that moreover viknyansky believes that ukraine s just war against russia is being used to strengthen rule by oligarchs and political groups under their control and it is happening at the expense of the vast majority of ukrainians he says we want to break this vicious cycle that turns us into a country on the periphery viknyansky told the kyiv post our path is one of progress of the development of science education inclusive culture the rights of absolutely all language ethnic and religious groups respublica supports ukraine s integration and cooperation with europe and particularly the implementation of european standards within the country however it opposes the dictates of european bureaucrats the phrasing in its official platform viknyansky stresses that he wants ukraine to become a link between the countries of the european union and a future democratic russia which he distinguishes from the crypto fascist putin regime he says respublica s views are far from mainstream and it shows in its small office the party publishes an old fashioned ukrainian political newspaper new republic it has a stable but limited social media presence it has run candidates for the mayor of three regional capitals and in local elections across ukraine but has not had any success the party has also attracted criticism for its opposition to nationalism which viknyansky calls flirtation with the archaic and openness to continued horizontal ties with the people of russia separate from the russian government viknyansky says his party must constantly worry about whether its events will be attacked by far right titushki a term referring to hired political thugs but in one way respublica is like the other socialist parties it is thinking big and looking to the future it aims to enter the october 2019 parliamentary election with a left democratic front that will be a real alternative to the regime united by values one that is ready to take responsibility for the highest positions and seriously state offices both in the center and locally kaplin takes a similar view asked about his party s plans after the presidential election he also didn t hold back we must offer the country the elite and the people a new social political idea kaplin said

the announcement that the president will name stephen moore to the federal reserve board has drawn the condescension of that sturdy breed the mainstream economist textbook magnate greg mankiw for example mankiw urged the senate not to confirm moore much on the basis moore s approvingly quoting president trump that after the tax cut of late 2017 we could see growth rates at three or four five or even six percent mankiw wrote disapprovingly that moore and his trumponomics co author arthur b laffer seem to believe that growth will follow ineluctably from the lower taxes and deregulation that lie at the heart of the trump agenda associated press mankiw s critique first presented last year in foreign affairs recapitulates a standard view within economics models and rigor show that we can expect about 2 growth in this country per year with tax regulatory and presumably other changes upping that at most minimally it is an idée fixe in economics these days we cannot grow very much anymore maybe maybe with some kind of breakout in our educational system among a small set of other unlikely options we could aspire to more but in any practical view the upper bound to growth today is not much more than what we are achieving it appears however that the models behind this consensus are given to several weaknesses several areas of complacency there are in particular three questions about the lowness of the upper limit of economic growth in the united states today that the economics models appear to have difficulty with or fail to recognize as important the first is the labor force participation rate much as economics discusses this datum the number of people at work as a proportion of the population has gone down substantially since 2000 by 5 percentage points at the 2015 nadir representing millions of persons controlling for baby boomer retirement a questionable move in the first place since 70 is the new 60 and since the slow growth gave us a baby bust still leaves the rate down among those 25 54 especially among males the standard growth model revered in economics for decades is the robert solow model of the 1950s that emphasizes the working age population a key ingredient of growth s potential upper bound since the economy has idled all sorts of people in the 2000s much of it via government policy incidentally as in casey mulligan s stunning redistribution recession of 2012 should not the received growth models indicate that the upper bound of growth is substantially higher than the current rate to say that opioids or lack of education skills is at the heart of the droupout rate is no answer but an explanation of the causes of the problem the question that stands does not solow s model imply that growth could be considerably higher than it is a second question concerns economics touting of the model showing that financial crises are followed by long periods of slow growth carmen reinhart and kenneth rogoff s 2009 this time is different one of the post 2008 crisis bestsellers encapsulates this view a curiosity about this time is different is that it barely mentions the stagflation crisis of the 1970s and early 1980s in its section on inflationary eras it offers a minimum 20 inflation rate as the threshold of a crisis inflation was chronic at only 10 14 in the stagflation era so the u s recovery in the 1980s did not count in this reading as a recovery from a financial crisis that thing per the book that foretells long term slow growth yet if the stagflation era was not a financial crisis we all have to eat our hat the dollar lost 67 against goods and services from 1966 82 and 90 plus against oil and gold while the stock market lost 75 in real terms the financial sector experienced a bizarre whipsaw in which some firms failed as enormous opportunities arose as the nation s money holders scrambled to rearrange their portfolios to stave off inflation and un inflation indexed tax rates this was not a financial crisis it certainly cannot be for the argument to be sustained that financial crises bring about slow long term growth a tremendous permanent non inflationary boom began suddenly in late 1982 with growth at 6 over the first two years the argument that financial crises lead to extended sluggishness appears to be an artifact a coding error of you will of not classifying the stagflation period as a financial crisis hence the question does not the recovery in the 1980s show that there can be an immediate and sustained rebound from a financial crisis a third question concerns the great alternative to the solow model that emerged in the field in the 1980s and 1990s the new growth theory of paul romer who won the nobel prize in economics a few months ago for the effort the nub of the theory is that in advanced economies specifically growth rates naturally increase at a faster and faster rate in the language romer employed where we used to expect that mature economies must slow down with growth following a convex pattern they actually are primed to accelerate following a concave pattern this is so for all sorts of reasons including ever lower resource use per unit of marginal output and the increase of head over hand work in the most sophisticated economies the question has not the new growth theory internal to economics required the field to posit a higher upper bound for this economy s potential growth solow s model should say we have higher growth the financial crisis slow growth dataset is incomplete the natural concave growth pattern for advanced economies has been demonstrated what are the answers to these questions the literature naturally has anticipated them to a degree alan blinder s insistence for example that the stagflation crisis was not financial but keynesian right but the further point is that in such a large field should there not be a range of answers such that it could posit a range of potential upper bounds for this economy s growth a range including numbers like 4 5 and 6 presumably the floor would have to be above 2 indeed 3 since that happened in calendar 2018 economics may well have been playing ball with the secular stagnation new normal argument which somehow we barely heard in the george w bush years his slow growth was his fault but came on like a hurricane with the slow growth barack obama years that the american economy cannot grow consistently at major rates is an idea that by rights is guilty until proven innocent

a dispute with the canadian government was a big headache for wheaton here s how it played out wheaton precious metals nyse wpm is one of the largest gold and silver streaming companies in the world it generated nearly 800 million in revenue in 2018 a figure dwarfed by the 1 billion in back taxes and penalties that canada the country the company calls home was trying to recover from wheaton no wonder investors were pleased when the two sides in this tax dispute finally reached an agreement back in december and more recently wheaton s latest quarterly report shed more light on what the impact of the agreement is likely to be going forward here s a little more about what happened what wheaton investors should be looking for in the future and why it s also likely to be good news for peers like franco nevada fnv 2 99 what s been going on taxes are a complicated affair as anyone who has ever done their own can easily appreciate they get a lot more complicated when you are dealing with a corporate entity and even more complicated when that entity happens to have investments spread across north central and south america and europe there are a lot of governments to answer to and estimates and best guesses must be made with the end goal of doing what s right without overpaying on the tax front it s a pretty complex issue but wheaton was paying canadian taxes based on what it believed was an appropriate method transfer pricing the canadian tax authority disagreed and started to review the company s historical tax payments the government was claiming that wheaton owed 399 million canadian dollars in back taxes and fines for the years between 2005 and 2010 that however was just the tip of the iceberg since the company has used the same transfer pricing method all the way up to the present wheaton estimates that the total liability here could have been as high as 1 billion u s a bill that large would have wiped out all of the company s revenue in 2018 and then some if that expense were to be funded with debt wheaton s 1 26 billion in long term debt would increase to around 2 26 billion although that s just a hypothetical scenario it would represent a nearly 80 rise in long term debt this was a big issue and understandably an overhang on the streamer s stock price but it also cast a cloud over peers since the tax case against wheaton was quite possibly just the first step in a broader tax push for canada with regard to precious metals companies with foreign assets check out the latest earnings call transcripts for wheaton precious metals and other companies we cover thank goodness that s over luckily for wheaton and likely precious metals peers the two sides came to terms on an agreement in late 2018 without getting too deep into the woods on a very complicated topic wheaton will change how it interacts with its foreign subsidiary in such a way that the fee income it generates from the relationship will increase that in turn will result in higher taxable income in canada far from a loss for wheaton this is actually a huge win the change will have no impact on the 2005 to 2010 tax years and will lead to an increase in tax payments of around 10 million for the years between 2011 and 2017 that s much better than the worst case scenario wheaton was looking at but more importantly it puts this issue behind the company and means that wheaton and canada are now on the same page tax wise there shouldn t with any luck be any tax surprises from here however investors in wheaton do need to brace themselves for ongoing higher costs using back of the envelope math wheaton s taxes could rise by as much as 1 4 million per year it will probably less than that assuming there are penalties involved but it makes conservative sense to err on the side of caution here that would represent a roughly 9 increase compared to 2018 taxes a significant figure and one that will need to be kept in mind as wheaton incorporates the change into its financial results just as important as the fact that the dispute is behind wheaton however is the fact that it can now focus all of its attention on its core streaming business without this outside distraction and since investors don t need to worry about a big tax bill for which wheaton hadn t put any money aside the stock rose over 10 on the settlement news that said there are bigger implications for the streaming industry here peer franco nevada for example also calls canada home in fact the canadian government is examining franco nevada s tax returns right now the country s tax authority is looking to get paid more for revenues franco nevada generated in mexico the company disagrees and is fighting it although there s no way to tell how things will fall out and the dollar amounts involved are much smaller franco nevada noted in its fourth quarter 2018 conference call that the wheaton settlement had set a precedent in other words there s a template that all streaming companies can use to remain in compliance now that wheaton has been put through the tax wringer so not only is it a weight off of wheaton it s really a weight off the company s peers as well clear skies ahead getting the canadian tax issue behind it was a major success for wheaton and that the impact was so small relative to the risks was a big win for the company and its shareholders the changes wheaton is making meanwhile are likely to ripple through to other streamers doing business in canada and clear up a dark cloud that was hanging over some of the big names in the sector often volatile commodity prices are still be the driving force here but at least now wheaton and its peers have a better understanding of the tax rules under which they are playing in canada the streamer s ongoing costs are likely to rise a bit because of this settlement but if this billion dollar issue was keeping you on the sidelines regarding investing in wheaton you might want to revisit the streamer today

wheaton precious metals nyse wpm is one of the largest gold and silver streaming companies in the world it generated nearly 800 million in revenue in 2018 a figure dwarfed by the 1 billion in back taxes and penalties that canada the country the company calls home was trying to recover from wheaton no wonder investors were pleased when the two sides in this tax dispute finally reached an agreement back in december and more recently wheaton s latest quarterly report shed more light on what the impact of the agreement is likely to be going forward here s a little more about what happened what wheaton investors should be looking for in the future and why it s also likely to be good news for peers like franco nevada nyse fnv what s been going on taxes are a complicated affair as anyone who has ever done their own can easily appreciate they get a lot more complicated when you are dealing with a corporate entity and even more complicated when that entity happens to have investments spread across north central and south america and europe there are a lot of governments to answer to and estimates and best guesses must be made with the end goal of doing what s right without overpaying on the tax front a hand holding up a gold nugget image source getty images it s a pretty complex issue but wheaton was paying canadian taxes based on what it believed was an appropriate method transfer pricing the canadian tax authority disagreed and started to review the company s historical tax payments the government was claiming that wheaton owed 399 million canadian dollars in back taxes and fines for the years between 2005 and 2010 that however was just the tip of the iceberg since the company has used the same transfer pricing method all the way up to the present wheaton estimates that the total liability here could have been as high as 1 billion u s a bill that large would have wiped out all of the company s revenue in 2018 and then some if that expense were to be funded with debt wheaton s 1 26 billion in long term debt would increase to around 2 26 billion although that s just a hypothetical scenario it would represent a nearly 80 rise in long term debt this was a big issue and understandably an overhang on the streamer s stock price but it also cast a cloud over peers since the tax case against wheaton was quite possibly just the first step in a broader tax push for canada with regard to precious metals companies with foreign assets thank goodness that s over luckily for wheaton and likely precious metals peers the two sides came to terms on an agreement in late 2018 without getting too deep into the woods on a very complicated topic wheaton will change how it interacts with its foreign subsidiary in such a way that the fee income it generates from the relationship will increase that in turn will result in higher taxable income in canada far from a loss for wheaton this is actually a huge win the change will have no impact on the 2005 to 2010 tax years and will lead to an increase in tax payments of around 10 million for the years between 2011 and 2017 that s much better than the worst case scenario wheaton was looking at but more importantly it puts this issue behind the company and means that wheaton and canada are now on the same page tax wise there shouldn t with any luck be any tax surprises from here however investors in wheaton do need to brace themselves for ongoing higher costs using back of the envelope math wheaton s taxes could rise by as much as 1 4 million per year it will probably less than that assuming there are penalties involved but it makes conservative sense to err on the side of caution here that would represent a roughly 9 increase compared to 2018 taxes a significant figure and one that will need to be kept in mind as wheaton incorporates the change into its financial results just as important as the fact that the dispute is behind wheaton however is the fact that it can now focus all of its attention on its core streaming business without this outside distraction and since investors don t need to worry about a big tax bill for which wheaton hadn t put any money aside the stock rose over 10 on the settlement news wpm chart wpm data by ycharts that said there are bigger implications for the streaming industry here peer franco nevada for example also calls canada home in fact the canadian government is examining franco nevada s tax returns right now the country s tax authority is looking to get paid more for revenues franco nevada generated in mexico the

file photo a bay street sign a symbol of canada s economic markets and where main financial institutions are located is seen in toronto may 1 2013 reuters mark blinch by fergal smith toronto reuters investors trying to work out whether the inversion of the u s yield curve signals a looming recession may find clues but little comfort in the canadian bond market which is less distorted by central bank buying the u s curve inverted last week for the first time in more than a decade as the 10 year yield dropped below the rate on the 3 month t bill while inversion of the curve has preceded every u s recession for the last 50 years its significance this time has been dismissed by some market participants they argue that the curve has been distorted after the federal reserve bought trillions of dollars of bonds to help lower long term rates after the global financial crisis advertisement canada where the yield curve also inverted last week could be an alternative guide even though its economy is one tenth the size of the united states canada does not issue as many long dated bonds as the u s treasury leaving that part of the curve to the provinces while its market has not been directly impacted by central bank purchases its economy is so closely tied to its southern neighbor that it rarely enters a recession without a u s contraction correlations between canadian and u s bonds are high at more than 90 percent according to refinitiv eikon data that tight relationship would likely weaken if the u s market were unable to overcome distortions to provide a signal on economic prospects sign up for the yahoo finance canada morning brief newsletter i see both inversions as true warning shots that the bond market sees a recession within the next few quarters said patrick o toole vice president global fixed income at cibc asset management canada s signal is clearer than in the u s because the bank of canada has not meddled in the market canada a major oil producer that sends about 75 percent of its exports to the united states has had five recessions at least two consecutive quarters of contraction in the last 50 years with the exception of 2015 when the price of oil collapsed the recessions were accompanied by a u s downturn graphic canada u s past recessions click story continues although the 2015 recession was not preceded by an inverted curve the prior contraction in 2008 09 during the global financial crisis was the worry now is that canada s economy will falter due to trade tensions that slow global growth or due to record high levels of household debt canadian yields trade as much as 98 basis points below u s yields while money markets have shifted this month from expecting further interest rate hikes from the bank of canada to seeing about a 75 percent chance of a cut by december the central bank has tightened its benchmark rate by 125 basis points since july 2017 to a level of 1 75 percent there s no way they were going to be able to raise rates without crushing households said christian lawrence senior market strategist at rabobank i fully expect the curve to invert further an inverted curve has not always led to a recession in canada still it does tighten financial conditions by reducing the incentive for banks to lend and the motivation for investors to take on the long term projects that tend to boost economic growth people are pooh poohing the inversion but if the inversion lasts or gets worse that tightening could weigh on growth and in and of itself become self fulfilling said tom o gorman director of fixed income at franklin bissett investment management i would always be careful about thinking the bond market has it wrong reporting by fergal smith
belize city march 25 2019 belizeans are supposed to vote april 10 2019 in a referendum on the question do you agree that any legal claim of guatemala against belize relating to land and insular territories and to any maritime areas pertaining to these territories should be submitted to the international court of justice for final settlement and that it determine finally the boundaries of the respective territories and areas of the parties yes or no this is the most important decision that belizeans will make in our short history as a nation state why guatemala has or is going to claim either all of belize s territory or at least 53 of the country from the sibun river in the middle of the country to the sarstoon river in the south if a majority of belizean citizens vote yes to submit the claim to the icj according to lawyers from the international court of justice icj this is the first time in the history of the court that a neighbor has claimed all or over half of another country in fact in an article written last april 21 2018 in the economist the writer said that the icj referendum sounds liked an outrageous act of provocation to understand what is happening one has to read the special agreement signed december 8 2008 by foreign minister hon wilfred elrington of belize and hon rodas melgar foreign minister of guatemala article 2 of this treaty states that the parties request the court to determine a any and all legal claims of guatemala against belize to land and insular territories and to any maritime areas pertaining to these territories and b to declare the rights therein of both parties c to determine the boundaries between their respective territories and areas emphasis added belize as a nation state has a constitution which is regarded as the supreme law of belize section 1 2 and schedule 1 of the belize constitution sets out the land and maritime boundaries of belize only a two thirds majority in the house national assembly can change the boundaries of belize belize was supported by the vast majority of the un s members to become a sovereign independent nation state with all its territory intact in the year 1980 and several years later guatemala recognized belize as a sovereign nation state belize and guatemala have embassies in each other s country what this special agreement is proposing to do is to substitute the icj for the national assembly of belize and ask 15 foreign judges to determine the boundaries of belize and guatemala to dispense with the 1859 treaty between britain and guatemala and for your information the referendum act of belize 1999 requires that any settlement between belize and guatemala should first be put to the people of belize in a referendum and do you the people of belize know that the wording of the spanish version of article 2 of the 2008 special agreement compromis is different from the wording of the english version the government of belize seems not to trust the people of belize instead it is proposing that the people of belize give a blank cheque to the 15 judges of the icj to decide a settlement of the guatemalan claim to the entire or 53 of the current territory of belize including all those beautiful cayes wow what nerve what this whole icj referendum has caused is severe division amongst our citizens today belize is a divided country split in two not by race or color or religion no the citizens of belize are mostly divided between nationalists and cosmopolitan neo liberals and especially between the elites and the workers lower middle class between the one percent which own 70 of the assets of belize and the 99 who only own 30 the very rich don t care if guatemala gets the toledo district or half of the country why they will lose little and will export themselves to their mansions in florida new york city and the cayman islands the 99 have nowhere to go the little house the 10 acre farm their entire life will disappear before their eyes ask the people of india what the british did to them in 1947 or the people of palestine what the same british did to them if you don t know history all belizeans have seen recently the horrific news of the over 700 000 rohingya refugees in bangladesh fleeing from myanmar again the hand of the british is the cause of these problems of the rohingya people under british rule myanmar was called burma and bangladesh was part of india instead of allowing a united and extremely powerful india the imperial british divided india first into india and pakistan and in 1971 pakistan was split in order to establish bangladesh this year will make 38 years since belize obtained its independence from the imperial power great britain in fact at the time of independence the elite minority was opposed to independence over the last 37 years they have made sure that belize s independence was confined to political independence financial and economic independence have never occurred and will never occur as long as the local elites continue to control belize and work in the interest of the anglo americans politicians need money lots of money to win elections who pay for these expensive elections the local elites pay and we all know who pays governs since 2016 using the methodology of halcrow poverty was estimated at about 60 of the population of belize in the year 2002 it was 33 of the population and reached 43 in 2009 in fact in january 2016 the world bank wrote poverty levels in belize are high and substantively above the average for latin america and the caribbean over 85 000 of our employed work force 56 earn less than 700 per month or 175 per week this belizeans is a major cause of violence poverty frustration low health and hatred of the elite currently in belize with a population of some 400 000 belize can easily pay some 2 000 per month in money wages and use the power of government to create each year some 10 000 new high money wage jobs to eradicate poverty in belize in about 15 years but because we have allowed the local elites to control our economy and along with foreigners control our financial system we have allowed them to put our economy on an unsustainable foundation imagine for the year 2018 belize s trade deficit is 892 million dollars nearly as much as our entire export earnings of 910 million dollars this cannot continue soon it will destroy the exchange rate peg with the us dollar raw agriculture for export and tourism have failed us after 47 years they are breeding grounds for poverty misery and despair the majority of workers in today s belize are unskilled and mostly have a primary school education low money wages in tourism and agriculture is the future of these unfortunate citizens of belize if we like it or not only industrial manufacturing can pay workers 100 per day or 24 000 per year or more and remain economically competitive therefore if belize wishes to eradicate poverty it must become an industrial manufacturing nation state to be able to pay high money wages and along with manufacturing industries must come the high tech modernization of agriculture but we need to educate our workers up to at least a sixth form education for the new forth wave manufacturing automation artificial intelligence and robotics stop wasting time with business education the future is science and engineering our prime minister is fond of saying that his government s hallmark is infrastructure millions of foreign loan funds have been spent on lots of pretty infrastructure projects but poverty continues to grow why our decision makers forgot two main concepts first importing cement asphalt steel bulldozers and other machines does not create innovation in fact only some 20 of the money spent on the project contributes to the local economy as labor the rest 80 returns to the foreign imperial country to make themselves richer at belize s expense if the money was created in belize and we used belize s own materials and belizean made machinery all the new wealth would remain in belize to make belize and its people richer and second non challenging infrastructure does not create innovations in any economy modern high tech agriculture and fourth wave manufacturing can only work with a glue the glue is infrastructure as i wrote in my 1995 book on economics the building of new challenging infrastructure is how new methods of production are introduced into the economy to create productivity which enables high money wages to be paid without ruining an economy to illustrate an example just completed in september of last year is the hong kong zhuhai macau 55 kilometer bridge tunnel system consisting of a series of three cable stayed bridges an undersea tunnel and four artificial islands it is both the longest sea crossing and longest fixed link on earth it costed about usd 20 billion china had to invent many items including new stainless and other steel alloys for the bridges and tunnel over 1 665 patents were granted to chinese companies and over 200 chinese research institutions for the new production methods and materials invented to make this project happen and where did this money usd 20 billion come from it came from the state of china using their sovereign credit simple this belizeans is how infrastructure causes a nation state economy to innovate and be able to pay high money wages to its citizens without ruining an economy and guess what the same elites who have made sure that belize has remained poor and backward are the same people who want our citizens to vote yes in the april 10th referendum so the icj judges can give away belizean land and sea to guatemala and they are supported by the churches ngos and others remember when the church of rome brought in a foreigner to instruct the local flock and made clear to the roman catholics in belize that they are ruled from the vatican in rome not by our local bishop and the anglicans they are ruled by their head the crown the queen of england the other christians are mostly run by the american neo cons the churches in belize are mostly foreign controlled the ngos money come from the anglo americans follow the money it leads to the british and americans if i were a conspiracy theorist i would say and believe that the destruction of belize s economy didn t just happen by accident there are no accidents of this sort on planet earth this was made to happen by the friends of belize why to deliberately allow the belizean people to become so wretched that they like all lumpenproletariats all scum of the earth all shirtless ones all harangatans become so desperate that they would sell their mothers add to this the cultural destruction free hollywood tv and drug culture and the mindset of the people become like putty to be molded into committing suicide by voting yes to the icj belizeans do not ever forget that the friends of belize will never forgive belizeans for what the people of belize did with the american lawyer bethuel webster s 1968 proposals and the 1981 heads of agreement their memory is a thousand years long the british know they took advantage of the guatemalans in 1859 they even offered money 50 000 pounds sterling but the british being british like to get things for free for a mere 4 million that they are currently giving to fund the misguided yes campaign they will save themselves from paying about one half to one billion dollars which they owe guatemala rt hon george price himself told me that margaret thatcher was angry with him because he refused to exchange belizean land as a means of settling the guatemalan claim if the british can get belize to give up some land they get away free belizeans don t let the british con or trick you remember their imperial history and the americans from about the year 1830 they have maintained that the british stole the land from the sibun to sarstoon from guatemala after the british gave back nicaragua to the nicaraguans and the bay islands to honduras the americans supported the british settlement in belize ever wonder why the british waited until 1862 to declare british honduras a crown colony but after the cuban revolution and the failed bay of pigs invasion it became standard for the us state department to support guatemala s claim to belize the proof remember the webster proposals ask the us embassy in belmopan why is there a mad rush to finance the yes vote and full united states support for belize to go to the icj while they have themselves refused to comply with rulings made by the icj against them just late last year war monger neo con john r bolton had a lot of nasty things to say about the icj and the local media most are busy selling themselves to the anglo americans with a yes vote and then there are the cowards the ones who are so afraid of guatemala that they are willing to appease and give land and sea to guatemala in order to hurriedly settle an outrageous claim belizeans remember belize is an independent nation state the only solution is political no court can settle such a claim in court someone wins and someone loses as madeleine albright said at the un international disputes can only be satisfactorily settled by a win win both must get something the 1648 treaty of westphalia the interest of the other belize must defend itself if belize establishes a 9 000 defence force well trained and using the model of arm the people we can take care of ourselves but an economy with a 60 poverty rate and a trade deficit as large as the value of its exports can hardly support a 900 personnel force but if we turn our belize into a manufacturing country following the examples of alexander hamilton abe lincoln and his economist the greatest american henry charles carey franklin delano roosevelt and john f kennedy belize can not only defend itself but end poverty and make our citizens happy as men and women made in the image of our creator the yes crowd refuses to publically say that the special agreement was a clever anglo american ploy to let the judges at the icj give land and sea to guatemala read article 1 2 5 no local politician who wishes to remain alive would ever dare to give up belizean land and sea to guatemala so instead let the local elites and their hangers on give the power to the icj judges to give away belizean land and sea most likely the toledo district will become guatemalan territory belizeans from that district will become refugees ask the palestine people and the indians about being refugees toledo has much oil gold uranium and most of all rare earth the stuff that makes your smart phone and other electronics belizeans should read phil butler s recent article vladimir putin as mad max and the impending oil disaster to understand why the united states wants the toledo district so badly giving it to guatemala is really giving it to the multi national us oil majors and natural resources corporations our destiny is to be the new jerusalem in the heart of the caribbean basin only the people can save the people vote no april 10th belize is for belizeans in fact a no vote to the icj will enable local politicians to finally stand up to the elites and put belize on the track to becoming a great industrial power long live a free prosperous intact belize

unfortunately that hasn t translated into higher returns for german stockholders the s p 500 has returned 11 2 percent a year since co determination became law in germany including dividends while the germany index returned 9 5 percent but that s no fault of german companies remember that inflation was higher in the u s in real terms the s p 500 beat the german index by just 0 3 percentage points a year and that difference can be attributed more to sentiment than reality u s stocks cost more today than they did in 1976 as measured by 12 month trailing price to earnings ratios while german stocks cost less when sentiment changes as it always does that gap is likely to reverse

laura davison bloomberg democrats are busy finding new ways to tax the rich the most straightforward way to do that an annual tax on household wealth is an idea with deep roots in europe that several 2020 hopefuls are hoping to import to the u s yet of the 15 european countries that tried a wealth tax in recent years only four still employ it most of those governments ultimately were underwhelmed by the amount of revenue raised and overwhelmed by the difficulty in collecting an accurate tax nevertheless the idea is gaining steam among democrats trying to unseat president donald trump in 2020 sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts was the first to come out with a detailed wealth tax proposal and former texas congressman beto o rourke has expressed support for the concept warren wants to impose a 2 percent annual tax on a family s wealth over 50 million with an additional surcharge of 1 percent on wealth above 1 billion she says her plan would raise 2 75 trillion over 10 years as long as there is a desire to tax there s a chance a wealth tax could happen here said veronique de rugy a senior fellow at the conservative mercatus center but we can t assume we can do things better than other countries who have tried democrats seizing on the argument that the 2017 republican tax overhaul favored the wealthy are staking out positions that will require upper income filers to pay more in addition to wealth tax proposals several contenders have floated ideas to increase the number of filers eligible for the estate tax some 15 countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development a group of economically advanced nations had wealth taxes in 1995 now only four do switzerland belgium norway and spain of the wealth taxes that remain switzerland s is the most prominent its tax is levied by the canton or state government and at the city level each local government sets is own rates and includes most assets property securities vehicles and valuables such as jewelry others are less vigorous spain briefly halted the tax during the financial crisis in 2008 then reinstated it in 2011 and increased the thresholds at which it applies similarly norway increased taxes elsewhere to generate more revenue and its wealth tax now only comprises 0 8 percent of its tax base germany sweden the netherlands and austria have all abandoned the policy citing the high cost of implementation and the small revenue it generated in france the most recent country to back away from the idea the wealth tax was estimated to bring in about 3 6 billion euros annually and cost the country about 7 billion euros annually from fraud as well as an eroded tax base caused by taxpayers leaving the country according to research by eric pichet a professor at the kedge business school in france in the first 10 years the tax was in effect pichet estimates that about 200 billion euros of capital left france or was never invested because entrepreneurs opted to put their money in lower tax jurisdictions wealth taxes have also faced problems when they don t tax all assets equally in germany the wealthy shifted their investments out of stocks and bonds and pumped more money into property which is taxed based on official values that are far below market rate once the wealth tax was repealed investments moved back into securities both spain s and norway s taxes have some exemptions for the value of primary homes which gave wealthy taxpayers a way around part of the wealth tax according to greg leiserson director of tax policy at the left leaning washington center for equitable growth that can artificially inflate the prices of the housing market as well as make markets less liquid belgium could soon find that its citizens also prefer pricey houses over investing in marketable securities it became the lone european country to implement a wealth tax last year a 0 15 percent levy on financial accounts above 500 000 euros about 563 000 for belgian taxpayers living domestically and abroad because it relies on assets that are easy to value belgium s plan will be much easier to police than one that includes all assets but it will also generate much less revenue belgians could choose to hold their wealth in real estate or diamonds rather than in stocks or bonds legally reducing their tax liability but none of the existing european plans would go as far as warren s proposal if she is right that her tax would raise 2 75 trillion over a decade that would mean it would account for about 8 percent of u s tax revenue comparatively the swiss wealth tax generates 3 3 percent of that country s tax revenue tax administration experts say the only way to make a wealth tax work well is to have it apply to all assets otherwise as many european countries have found it s too easy for rich individuals to organize their assets in a way that they minimize their taxes or escape the levy entirely it doesn t make sense to put in the administrative structure for a small wealth tax dean baker center for economic and policy research said this isn t something that can be done halfway a wealth tax would require scores of new auditors and valuation experts at the u s internal revenue service to ensure compliance similar to how other countries have had to step up collection and enforcement efforts after enacting a wealth levy the irs already processes about 4 000 estate tax returns annually which require the agency to verify the worth of lots of hard to value assets including closely held businesses art work and land this would require the irs to hire hundreds of new employees who would be responsible for processing and auditing about 75 000 wealth tax returns a year according to estimates from warren s plan an increase of 1 775 percent from the current work load implementing this tax would be a big deal for the irs leiserson said it can be hard to put a firm value on rare art even harder if it s stored offshore in switzerland where the tax relies heavily on self reporting researchers have found that a 1 percent wealth tax lowers reported assets by 23 percent to 34 percent a comprehensive tax will also face a fight from the housing retirement financial services and art industries warren s plan relies on no class of assets getting exemptions to raise the promised 2 75 trillion yet groups representing home buyers investors and collectors will push to have those assets excluded a wealth tax could also be mired in legal battles the central question would be whether it s even constitutional the constitution prohibits federal taxes on assets several democratic presidential candidates including vermont sen bernie sanders and california sen kamala harris favor an expansion of the estate tax critics say it will also push people to give up their u s citizenship in an attempt to avoid the tax one problem that prompted france to repeal its wealth tax but those fears could be slightly overblown said david shakow a tax law professor emeritus at the university of pennsylvania it s a threat people make and it s possible that people leave shakow said but not many end up doing so purely for tax reasons but something as big as a warren style wealth tax could be the thing to convince the mega billionaires to find a new country to call home baker said clearly this would be be a big debate before congress he said wealthy people would see that happening and before the tax becomes law say i m outta here foreseeing that possibility warren s plan would place a 40 percent exit tax on any u s taxpayer worth at least 50 million who renounces citizenship the growth of wealth inequality in the developed world has led to talk about wealth taxes but few countries are implementing them researchers from the massachusetts institute of technology and two swiss universities found in a 2016 paper in fact oecd nations have been moving in the opposite direction over the past decade with most nations abandoning annual wealth taxation the paper said

key recession indicators and gold do you want to protect your capital against recession great just like us and millions of other people the key questions is thus how to predict that the danger is coming we invite you to read our today s article and find out what are key recession indicators and their relationship with the price of gold do you want to protect your capital against recession great just like us and millions of other people the key questions is thus how to predict that the danger is coming we have already showed that nber s indicators do not signal upcoming economic problems yet neither the unemployment rate nor the yield curve but there are much more potentially useful recession gauges let s analyze them now many people for example track jobless claims which show the number of initial filings for state jobless claims nationwide as it is very intuitive and the rise in them usually heralds declining employment and rising unemployment however there is a lot of noise in that weekly data series another problem is that the initial jobless claims are used to forecast changes in the employment and unemployment so why should we not monitor the unemployment rate directly but if somebody would like to use jobless claims anyway to predict recession here you are as one can see in the chart below the jobless claims are still in downward trend with the latest bottom reached in january 2019 so this data series does not indicate the upcoming recession we would expect a bottom much earlier and then the start of an upward trend as it was the case prior to the last two recessions chart 1 initial jobless claims from january 1998 to february 2019 index when december 2007 100 let s look further some analyst say that consumer and business sentiment are important recessionary indicators it s clear that sentiment deteriorates during downturns but it s not so obvious whether it can actually predict a recession the chart below displays us consumer and business sentiment indices as one can see both measures started to decline a few months before the last two recessions began chart 2 university of michigan consumer sentiment index red line business tendency surveys for manufacturing blue line from january 1998 to december 2018 however both data series are quite volatile with many false positives for example consumer sentiment dropped in august 2011 while business sentiment turned negative at the end of 2015 putting these doubts aside for a moment let s note that consumer sentiment is now quite elevated and does not signal the imminent recession sorry gold bulls what else is used as a recession indicator auto sales and housing permits for example the rationale is simple when there is a recession people buy fewer cars while constructors build fewer houses we paint both data series in the chart below as one can see they declined significantly during the great recession chart 3 total vehicle sales red line and new private housing units authorized by building permits blue line from january 1998 to january 2019 index when december 2007 100 actually the housing permits entered the downward trend much earlier heralding the upcoming storm but nobody wanted to listen however now they remain in an upward trend the vehicle sales dropped in january 2019 but it s too early to indicate recession data does not lie mr gold the us economy remains solid but let s not give up what about credit and money supply after all according to many economists especially from the austrian school but also from the bank of international settlements the business cycle is a monetary phenomenon bernanke may not agree but hayek and friedman definitely would and possibly greenspan would also agree recession is an abrupt end of the boom when the monetary policy is easy while the credit is plentiful indeed as the chart below shows prior to the great recession the credit to gdp rose to a very high level which was clearly unsustainable chart 4 credit to gdp and m2 money supply to gdp from q1 1998 to q2 2018 however the credit to gdp ratio has declined after the great recession and stabilized at more normal level we do not see any danger here at least not for now and when it comes to the ratio of the m2 money supply to gdp it reached a trough before the last two recessions as one can see in the chart above but recently it has reached a peak rather than the bottom again the monetary analysis does not authorize us to call for an alarm it might be bad news for the gold market but it does not have to be it might be the case that we are looking for a recession not where we should be all analysts focus on the us economy but well this time the thunder may strike china first and gold may also shine without recession we do not expect recession this year but we believe that 2019 will be better for the yellow metal than 2018 anyway because of less hawkish monetary policy and less accommodative fiscal policy and thus weaker us dollar the bullish case may not play out until the second half of the year though thank you if you enjoyed the above analysis and would you like to know more about the gold etfs and their

impact of the agreement is likely to be going forward here s a little more about what happened what wheaton investors should be looking for in the future and why it s also likely to be good news for peers like franco nevada fnv 2 99 what s been going on taxes are a complicated affair as anyone who has ever done their own can easily appreciate they get a lot more complicated when you are dealing with a corporate entity and even more complicated when that entity happens to have investments spread across north central and south america and europe there are a lot of governments to answer to and estimates and best guesses must be made with the end goal of doing what s right without overpaying on the tax front it s a pretty complex issue but wheaton was paying canadian taxes based on what it believed was an appropriate method transfer pricing the canadian tax authority disagreed and started to review the company s historical tax payments the government was claiming that wheaton owed 399 million canadian dollars in back taxes and fines for the years between 2005 and 2010 that however was just the tip of the iceberg since the company has used the same transfer pricing method all the way up to the present wheaton estimates that the total liability here could have been as high as 1 billion u s a bill that large would have wiped out all of the company s revenue in 2018 and then some if that expense were to be funded with debt wheaton s 1 26 billion in long term debt would increase to around 2 26 billion although that s just a hypothetical scenario it would represent a nearly 80 rise in long term debt this was a big issue and understandably an overhang on the streamer s stock price but it also cast a cloud over peers since the tax case against wheaton was quite possibly just the first step in a broader tax push for canada with regard to precious metals companies with foreign assets check out the latest earnings call transcripts for wheaton precious metals and other companies we cover thank goodness that s over luckily for wheaton and likely precious metals peers the two sides came to terms on an agreement in late 2018 without getting too deep into the woods on a very complicated topic wheaton will change how it interacts with its foreign subsidiary in such a way that the fee income it generates from the relationship will increase that in turn will result in higher taxable income in canada far from a loss for wheaton this is actually a huge win the change will have no impact on the 2005 to 2010 tax years and will lead to an increase in tax payments of around 10 million for the years between 2011 and 2017 that s much better than the worst case scenario wheaton was looking at but more importantly it puts this issue behind the company and means that wheaton and canada are now on the same page tax wise there shouldn t with any luck be any tax surprises from here however investors in wheaton do need to brace themselves for ongoing higher costs using back of the envelope math wheaton s taxes could rise by as much as 1 4 million per year it will probably less than that assuming there are penalties involved but it makes conservative sense to err on the side of caution here that would represent a roughly 9 increase compared to 2018 taxes a significant figure and one that will need to be kept in mind as wheaton incorporates the change into its financial results just as important as the fact that the dispute is behind wheaton however is the fact that it can now focus all of its attention on its core streaming business without this outside distraction and since investors don t need to worry about a big tax bill for which wheaton hadn t put any money aside the stock rose over 10 on the settlement news that said there are bigger implications for the streaming industry here peer franco nevada for example also calls canada home in fact the canadian government is examining franco nevada s tax returns right now the country s tax authority is looking to get paid more for revenues franco nevada generated in mexico the company disagrees and is fighting it although there s no way to tell how things will fall out and the dollar amounts involved are much smaller franco nevada noted in its fourth quarter 2018 conference call that the wheaton settlement had set a precedent in other words there s a template that all streaming companies can use to remain in compliance now that wheaton has been put through the tax wringer so not only is it a weight off of wheaton it s really a weight off the company s peers as well clear skies ahead getting the canadian tax issue behind it was a major success for wheaton and that the impact was so small relative to the risks was a big win for the company and its shareholders the changes wheaton is making meanwhile are likely to ripple through to other streamers doing business in canada and clear up a dark cloud that was hanging over some of the big names in the sector often volatile commodity prices are still be the driving force here but at least now wheaton and its peers have a better understanding of the tax rules under which they are playing in canada the streamer s ongoing costs are likely to rise a bit because of this settlement but if this billion dollar issue was keeping you on the sidelines regarding investing in wheaton you might want to revisit the streamer today
