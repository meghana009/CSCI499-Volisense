the lessons of bretton woods talking points the 75th anniversary of the bretton woods conference was at the end of july and the concerns that bretton woods tried to address back in 1944 are reasserting themselves as significant threats to the global economy in 2019 as lessons from bretton woods are forgotten the us china trade war represents a true existential threat to the post world war ii international trade order and in turn the globalized economy that has grown out of the ashes of history the us dollar may be facing a long term structural disadvantage as the rise of china and other major economies in asia at a time when western economies are struggling calls to end us dollar hegemony as the world reserve currency will only grow louder looking for longer term forecasts on gold and silver prices check out the dailyfx trading guides 75 years ago this july policymakers from around the world gathered in a quaint new hampshire town called bretton woods with the global economy at a nadir thanks to the devastating impact of world war ii policymakers were keen to take advantage of the crisis a significant turning point in human history a new framework could be developed that would prevent another conflict on the scale of world war i or world war ii from ever taking place again given the state of affairs for the global economy particularly the rise of protectionism vis à vis tariffs it s a good time to remember why the bretton woods system was agreed upon in the first place and why the lessons of the two world wars may have been forgotten in turn the consequences for the us dollar and the global economy over the next several years could be extremely destructive bretton woods has its roots in the world wars world war i saw a significant collapse in international trade as budding trade liberalization came to a sudden halt major stock exchanges across the world shuttered starting in 1914 as wartime trade protection measures are unwound as the great war ends in november 1918 the league of nations comes into existence in 1920 in 1920 soon after the league of nations is created a brief global economic recession hits giving pause to efforts by the league of nations to foster greater trade liberalization in 1927 the league of nations organizes the first world economic conference to outline a multilateral trade agreement 1920s and 1930s great depression tariffs fascism in 1930 the great depression begins efforts taken by the league of nations in 1927 prove meaningless in the face of global economic uncertainty nationalism begins to rise again after staying quelled during the 1920s major economics begin raising tariffs to try and maintain favorable balance of payments and stable fiscal situations the smoot hawley act of 1930 was a precursor to world war ii just as the tariff of abominations of 1828 was a precursor to the us civil war this was the last time that america embraced a protectionist policy under president herbert hoover levying taxes of up to 50 on imported goods it was widely considered to be a blundering mistake that crippled global economic activity and helped accelerate the decline in the great depression the global trade freeze only ended when congress passed the reciprocal trade act of 1934 which gave the president then fdr the power to negotiate bilateral trade deals with other countries without congressional approval however by that time that global economy had been broken for long enough to give rise to ethnic nationalist populism in europe from 1939 to 1945 world war ii produces another catastrophic collapse in international trade but the cost is not just borne by trade balances human and physical capital is obliterated in europe a brief history of trade wars 1900 1950 resolving the nation state globalization conflict from a certain perspective there is an argument to be made that both world wars were rooted in globalization as the world economy became globalized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the world s largest economies found themselves needing to assert military dominance in order to secure economic security requiring more resources from outside their national borders to fund economic growth the world s major economies situated in europe at the time faced little choice but to engage in conflict when forced confront a zero sum economic system an understanding soon began to emerge that the lack of an effective international framework for cooperation facilitated conflict between major economies the world needed something with more teeth than the league of nations if a third world war was going to be avoided 1944 bretton woods new hampshire in the waning days of world war ii when it becomes clear that the tides of fascism will be beaten back from europe s shores policymakers across the world begin to discuss ways to ensure cooperation among the world s largest economies in order to avoid another cataclysmic conflict descending on the mount washington hotel in bretton woods new hampshire officials from the united states canada western europe australia the soviet union and china agreed to a framework of monetary policy management as well as establish rules for commercial and financial relations the bretton woods agreement important groundwork was being laid to integrate post war germany japan and italy into the new global economic order there were two key pillars that the bretton woods system was based on the first was political the ussr agreed to allow western european countries return to american stylized capitalism after world war ii this pillar was cemented when stalinists in france and italy supported pro capitalist governments in the immediate aftermath of world war ii the second pillar was economic the global economy would be remade in the united states image which at the time was that of a manufacturing behemoth accounting for 50 of global manufacturing in 1945 the bretton woods system agreed upon in july 1944 attempted to resolve the conflict between the nation state and an increasingly globalized economy by instilling a framework of cooperation that reduced the need for the world s major economies to assert military dominance in order to achieve their desired economic goals bretton woods institutions include the world bank and the international monetary fund whose initial efforts were to rebuilding the post world war ii global economy and promote international economic cooperation keynes can t save british imperialism us dollar hegemony arrives the bretton woods system enshrined an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained its exchange rates within one percent by linking each country s currency to gold i e the gold standard the uk s representative at the conference famed economist john maynard keynes attempted to ensure that the british empire would remain at the center of this new system proposing a bancor international currency in an attempt to preserve british influence somewhat ironically the calls for cooperation around an international currency failed and the us dollar was thus enshrined as the de facto world reserve currency when the gold standard established that gold would be priced at 35 oz and could be exchanged for us dollars at any point in time the greenback was as good as gold gold price historical chart monthly timeframe 1971 to 2019 1971 nixon takes us off the gold standard by the late 1960s the bretton woods system was under pressure as the rapidly expanding post world war ii european economy strained relations with the united states flush with excess capital vis à vis higher taxes revenues european governments were recycling their us dollars back into gold provoking a massive drawdown in us gold reserves in a sense under bretton woods global growth was being financed at the united states expense on august 15 1971 us president richard nixon announced that the us would no longer honor accept us dollar conversion to gold ending us participation in the gold standard in doing so us president nixon was attempting to maintain american influence over the global economy as history shows the removal of the gold standard was terrible for the us dollar with the dxy index losing 23 of its value in the immediate two years following the decision it hastened the decline of the us dollar as the centerpiece of the global financial system read more the history of forex us dollar dxy index historical chart weekly timeframe 1967 to 1976 but as other countries adopted american stylized capitalism in the post world war ii years the united states lost its perch as the preeminent manufacturing economy of the global economy after peaking at 50 in 1945 the us share of global manufacturing output is now around 18 seeds of us china trade war are planted in 2019 both the chinese and european shares of global manufacturing output are greater than that of the united states approximately 20 each much of the us china trade war is predicated around the belief that china has unfairly take advantage of the us led international trade order in a sense the seeds of the us china trade war were planted when the bretton woods system of international cooperation began to erode starting with the us departure from gold standard in 1971 2019 lessons of bretton woods are forgotten with the us china trade war raging it s clear that the lessons of the gathering in bretton woods new hampshire 75 years ago have been forgotten as us president donald trump rages against the united states largest trading partners for unfair trade practices he continually lampoons china and the european union for competitive currency valuations versus the us dollar the use of tariffs by the us as a protectionist measure harkens the demise of the us led international order but for western economies the collapse of the bretton woods system of international cooperation may be a harbinger of things to come the bretton woods order as we know it has reached its limits french finance minister bruno le maire recently said unless we are able to reinvent bretton woods the new silk roads might become the new world order us dollar dxy index historical chart monthly timeframe 1967 to 2019 who benefits if us dollar loses hegemony the bretton woods system much to the chagrin of john maynard keynes enshrined the us dollar as the world s reserve currency taking the mantle from the british pound this is why keynes wanted the bancor currency having the power of the global unit of account all oil contracts are settled in us dollars hence the petrodollar for example the us dollar and thus the us economy is afforded a level of privilege that few others enjoy but the underpinning of this privilege has been the fact that the us economy has maintained at least a 25 share of global gdp in the post world war ii era that countries in asia and africa are growing faster than their western counterparts means that there will be an inevitable shift of power over the coming decades if the bretton woods institutions fails to evolve in a manner that allows for greater cooperation among emerging market economies it s likely that china s one belt one road initiative becomes a new standard for global cooperation the us china trade war is yet another episode in the history of the global economy where the old power is struggling to contain a rapidly growing new power perhaps the united states will be as helpless in preserving the us dollar s role at the center of the global financial system as john maynard keynes and the british were in 1944 but it shouldn t be understated or undersold the us china trade war is a threat to us dollar hegemony indeed it is a threat to entire post world war ii order

misconduct at the heart of their impeachment push but more ominously for trump s reelection prospects several conservative economists now say the law which turns two years old sunday so far has fallen short of its central promise to spread prosperity broadly i was certainly expecting to see something different alan viard an economist with the right leaning american enterprise institute says of a business investment boom that hasn t materialized really you would have expected if there s an effect taking place here you would have seen it boosters of the package predicted it would set off a virtuous trickle down effect the cuts they said would compel businesses to invest in their own operations in theory that would boost their productivity ultimately yielding higher wages for workers here s how the right leaning tax foundation envisioned the process playing out in 2018 instead the first step in that daisy chain largely hasn t come to pass business investment has contracted over the past two quarters falling 3 percent over the three month period that ended in september the steepest such drop since 2015 economists surveyed by the wall street journal named the development as a top disappointment this year advertisement defenders of the tax cut say trump s trade war cast a pall of uncertainty over the economy spooking business leaders into shelving any big spending plans they may have been contemplating that these economists say makes it impossible to draw firm conclusions about how the tax cut would have performed without the fear unleashed by the trade war some argue the falloff in business investment would have been even worse and that it could still recover if trump winds down the trade hostilities next year or that it needs more time to play out at some point however the numbers speak for themselves we haven t seen a huge investment boom that was validating for a lot of folks on the center left says garrett watson of the tax foundation that s just an accurate description of where we are some conservatives say the partisan process that yielded the tax cuts and their underperformance and poor public polling since have helped embolden aspiring democratic leaders to propose dramatic tax hikes nicole kaeding vice president of policy promotion at right leaning national taxpayers union foundation recently tweeted that when trump signed the law two years ago she did not fully appreciate just how far left it would push the 2020 tax debate in the primaries advertisement watson said trump officials hyperbolic claims about the boom times the tax cuts would unleash also hurt their own cause the tax foundation for example projected the measure could juice economic growth to 2 7 percent but white house officials publicly touted a pace nearly twice as brisk we ve been clear that should not have been expected and it does not do proponents of tax reform any favors he said but economists critical of the law say the results make clear that theory behind the tax cuts was fundamentally broken from the start there s just no shortage of business capital you can see that by looking at interest rates says edward kleinbard a former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation now a professor at the university of southern california gould school of law in a world where we are awash in capital to say we now have a tax environment that s friendlier to business investment is no more convincing than pushing on a string whatever the combination of reasons polls show the tax cuts have remained broadly unpopular with voters and the package does not appear to be improving with age advertisement a new report by the left leaning institute on taxation and economic policy found 91 corporations in the fortune 500 paid no federal taxes last year and about 400 of the largest firms paid an average tax rate of 11 percent half the burden prescribed by the tax law many companies said a big drop in corporate tax rates would allow them to invest more in capital and equipment but the uptick in new investment appears to have been short lived my colleagues jeff stein and christopher ingraham wrote recently much of the

what to expect in our next recession depression over the last several years numerous highly respected money managers and other economic writers have been warning investors about a coming recession or depression however few have been willing to describe as to what we may actually experience going through such an economic period of course it seems a daunting task to foresee the future to predict how technology may change our lives years from now is admittedly impossible because such change seems to be taking place at an exponential rate and we have little past experience as to how modern technology changes society life style or culture in a reliable way projecting how we might live ten years in the future from an economic perspective is not that challenging particularly since this rate of change is relatively slow and such events have been experienced in numerous countries over hundreds of years as a result it is not impossible or even particularly difficult to foresee many of the important changes that we could expect to see from the onset of the next recession depression since the founding of the federal reserve system in 1913 our economy has been increasingly managed by its monetary policies government s fiscal policy management has also evolved with application of new or modern economic theories and collection of economic statistics government sets down a list of targets and levels for achievement and then charges agencies to manage for the attainment of such goals when government agencies intervene to manage manipulation may be the more accurate description of the form of management but manipulation is a form of management economists define a recession as two consecutive quarters where growth in the economy as measured by gdp is negative a depression is more severe than a recession although its severity doesn t have to increase but it definitely lasts for a far longer time period these statistically based definitions may not be that helpful to non economists who do not follow economic statistics besides such determinations can only be ascertained with certainty months after the fact as all economic statistics are collected and analyzed with a significant time lag a simpler more helpful and meaningful definition would be to say that recession depression both are simply periods when the government s desired policies for economic growth and civilian wellbeing are failing at such a time government agencies as the treasury department the federal reserve bank financial stability oversight council plunge protection team are not able to manipulate that economy or financial markets to their desired goals and the populace experiences job income debt repayment retirement and other financial difficulties since the breton woods conference in 1944 setting the dollar as global reserve currency there have been ten business cycles wherein the average recession has lasted ten months if one were fortunate enough to have a job during a recession not having been laid off that person may go through recession without even realizing that he was in one it is only those unfortunate people who have lost their job and income who experience the real tragedy of a recession it is not so with a depression depression may last for years and the economic contraction is far more severe affecting a large percentage of the population in the one acknowledged depression of the last century in the 1930s unemployment rates at times exceeded 30 and although the depression lasted for about a decade it took over thirty years for the nominal stock market prices to rise to their pre depression levels means to peek into the future to prognosticate our economic future first we need to identify what are the present goals of our government and its agencies from a monetary fiscal and geopolitical policy perspective then we need to identify and understand what would be the consequences on us of government failing to manipulate the economy towards its stated goals so what exactly have been some of the well advertised or recognized economic goals of our government and its agencies over the last several years to keep interest rates low in order to maintain the cost of servicing our national debt low and sustainable to weaken the dollar such that it promotes increased exports and reduces the real cost of our national debt to accelerate product price increases to at least 2 such that our economy as measured by gdp can be seen to be growing adequately to keep unemployment low such that citizens can be kept off unemployment benefits welfare and have income to pay federal income taxes keep stock bond and derivative markets from declining or crashing in order to promote a faulty trickle down economic theory which increases income disparity to keep the price of gold depressed a rising price undermines belief in the soundness of our fiat dollar currency maintain global economic and geopolitical control or leadership elites will oppose any challengers as they believe it to be singularly our manifest destiny low interest rates interest rates have been declining since the early 1980s for over thirty years such rates were near zero five years ago when the fed in 2016 started to raise them this brought about market instability and criticism from our president such that the small periodic interest rate rises by the fed have now been arrested and are being reversed starting mid year 2019 interest on our national debt for the 2020 fiscal year is budgeted at 479 billion a normalization of interest rates to historic levels would raise the interest cost of servicing that debt more than double and likely exceed 1 trillion this would be very negative for the economy and it would increase future budget deficits requiring increasing debt which decreases the purchasing value of our fiat currency in a future recession depression the historical management of low interest rates by the federal reserve bank would fail that is interest rates would rise the fed would not be able to control interest rates which would seek a higher level based on global risk assessment perhaps high enough to foreclose further corporate economic growth or development in a significantly higher interest rate scenario a multitude of industries would be adversely affected including building trades housing and all capital intensive industries individuals and families would not be able to obtain debt or credit and find it increasingly difficult to service existing indebtedness leading to possible financial default government would also find raising debt levels problematic weakening the dollar president trump has criticized chairman powell of the fed that our dollar is too strong relative to other foreign currencies a higher valued currency makes it more expensive for foreigners to buy american made products contrariwise if the dollar is weaker or cheaper when compared to other currencies our exports rise improving our international trade account unfortunately improving export results by weakening one s currency is known by all nations and as a result all nations are competing from time to time by weakening their own currencies in this sequential weakening of foreign currencies no one wins in the long term but it creates what has been called a race to the bottom where all currencies are weakened since our dollar is the reserve currency of the world it is the choice currency for international investors in which to seek refuge when various economic headwinds threaten their currencies as a result global threats make the dollar stronger however domestic policy failures in addition to foreigners gradually decreasing their preference for u s currency due to devaluation risk will ultimately lead the dollar to become weaker that is far weaker than our policy makers prefer it is that time when the risk of continued dollar weakening would create a loss of confidence in the dollar which in turn could precipitate major reduction in the purchasing value of our currency in a future recession depression a major weakening of the dollar would make all goods far more expensive to consumers particularly imported goods accordingly weaker dollars will not be able to help support the consumer driven economy and already fragile economic growth would be further diminished accelerate price increases the manipulators of our economy would like to see product prices increased by at least 2 per year that is an unsuspectingly a high rate of inflation as one dollar s purchasing value declines to just twelve cents over one s lifetime of 72 years however a 2 rate of price inflation would improve an important statistical measurement that of gdp rising nominally by 2 or more this price increase has been a stated goal of the fed one which they have failed so far to achieve in the last half dozen years the economic definition of inflation is that of an increase in our money supply in this regard the fed has far exceeded the 2 target but it has not resulted in commensurate price increases the reason for this failure is that the fed has purposefully kept this increase in the money supply contained and restricted to that of the nation s banks which in turn have funneled it to the investment markets or deposited with the federal reserve bank rather than general bank funds lent to individuals or business therefore financial markets are booming while consumer prices have remained constrained in a recession depression it is likely that prices may actually initially decline further because a slowing economy may reduce jobs and incomes such that aggregate consumer purchasing power is reduced prompting business to reduce prices as a means to increase sales however attempts to stimulate consumers with additional money printing will eventually devalue the money and increase prices by unexpectedly and uncontrollably large amounts thus as our economic managers initially fail to increase prices they will take actions which will amplify both inflation and price increases by dramatic amounts in our coming recession depression the value of our money will decrease and prices of products will accelerate to troublesome levels hence consumers will be negatively affected by price increases and income of those employed will purchase fewer goods slowing overall economic growth keep unemployment low our president has taken great pride in the fact that the overall rate of unemployment is low and that its individual racial and ethnic components are historically low when the rate of unemployment starts to rise and the number of new jobs decline that will be the signal that managers of our economy are failing they will not be able to keep unemployment low regardless of monetary or fiscal policy initiatives thus when the next recession depression is upon us the rate of unemployment will rise to uncomfortable levels impacting severely those who were previously working but are now unemployed they will have lost their jobs incomes livelihood and become dependent on government which itself is losing the ability to help our high technology economy with modern and efficient production facilities increased robotics and use of artificial intelligence already produces all the goods and agricultural products that advanced societies need with a four day work week no not the four day ten hour day version but simply a four eight hour work week that is the way to keep everyone employed and maintain their skills presently that work week plan is not being considered by our capitalist corporatists as it does not seem to squeeze enough out of people s labor when compared to desired corporate profits this view is very shortsighted and an important reason why capitalism is failing while socialism is in ascendancy in our future recession depression as the confluence of high interest rates reduced value of our fiat currency rapidly increasing prices of goods and services and rising unemployment reinforce each other the results on the nation and its individual citizens will be pronounced and terrible unfortunately when this cycle gains momentum it will remain dominant for a number of years financial markets arguably even as the most advanced economy of the world america has had a great and rising income disparity between the rich and poor now for over five decades the wealthy own stocks and bonds while the middle and working class and the rest have an overabundance of debt loans and constricting credit the servicing and repayment of which reduces their ability to save which ultimately goes as income or capital gains to that 0 1 of the population our financial markets do not reflect and have not been reflecting the actual dynamics of our economy but rather the pre announced actions of the fed s monetary policy fundamental indicators of the status of our economy have been upstaged by bank bailouts plunge protection team actions of the open market committee of the fed declining interest rates quantitative easing repo markets access forward guidance and other false market stimulants all financial markets stocks bonds financial futures have been manipulated to extraordinary bubbles such that they will burst with a vengeance and will destroy with equanimity all fiat based financial fortunes and modest savings alike multi year market declines together with a long recovery period may easily span more than a decade we are at the precipice of such a decline which will continue to be fought off by all the awesome power available to oligarchs who control corporate america bankers who control actions of the fed and elites in politics and government who control fiscal policy as well as their counterparts in the developed world given global similarities in central bank policies and their close interconnectedness their common demise is essentially guaranteed that looks to be more serious than a global recession in their view the financial market bubble must be maintained at all costs because its bursting will unleash multi year pain and suffering to the citizenry of such magnitude that it will open floodgates of anger hate and revulsion of those in control to cause them fear for their own lives market bubbles will either burst or deflate significantly one important element of people s wellbeing has not been taken into account here because it has not been expressed through government or central banking as a goal the middle and lower class have various forms of government mandated or corporate retirement programs which are invested in our financial markets their present funding is inadequate and a market decline would destroy these pensions see market decline will lead to pension collapse usd devaluation and nwo in a recession depression this universally acknowledged financial mega bubble will burst or deflate dramatically but it will not just deflate to the norm but rather its momentum will reduce prices far below the norm before it tends to readjust to a justifiable valuation this period and its pricing will be long and painful to all depressing the price of gold coal miners used to take canaries down into coal mining shafts to test for the presence of carbon monoxide a deadly gas to humans such poisoned air killed the canary early but saved many coal miner s lives durable indestructible gold is the canary of a poisoned economic system when the price of gold rises in terms of fiat currency it is a signal that the systemic manipulations in currency and economy are becoming poisoned this is the important reason why the price of gold has been and will continue to be suppressed for as long as it is possible by the systemic manipulators the illusion must be maintained that our currency is not poisoned and the system stable for those interested in finding supporting information on this suppression activity can easily find it with a few clicks on their computer search engines suffice it to say here that banks have paid criminal fines some traders have been convicted but the suppression of gold s price is so critical to our fiat currency creation system that it will continue until the system blows up or government itself reprices gold as it did in 1933 and 1971 as a result earnest calls by traders that gold is ready to break out should always be tempered with the knowledge that banks and government are active in its price suppression gold is the antidote to our poisoned economic environment central banks have disparaged gold for decades yet they themselves are now buying it as it is the ultimate bank reserve asset foreign countries are buying large quantities of gold and taking direct possession of it rather than entrusting it to some foreign single storage facility in a future recession depression the amount of fiat paper or digital currency will have expanded multiple times the value of it and its ability to purchase goods or services will necessarily decline by inverse proportion some ownership of gold or silver by individuals for their financial wellbeing is about as important as it is for a person allergic to bee stings to have an epinephrine auto injector or to have an antidote for poisonous snake bites in their medicine cabinet their actual use may be infrequent but their immediate availability invaluable and possibly life saving maintain global economic and political hegemony after wwii the united states was acknowledged as having the most powerful military and the strongest economy in the world because of its strong stand against communism and socialism it also was admired for its moral righteousness in defending self determination and liberty steadfast around the globe it would covertly replace socialist foreign leaders not to its liking ultimately military wars in countries such as vietnam afghanistan iraq kosovo serbia and syria as well as financial or political confrontations in in countries such as egypt libya chile nicaragua ukraine venezuela and bolivia came to represent more than just replacing suspected leftist leaders it came to represent that america had abandoned america s founding principles of non intervention and instead embraced a later faulty principle of manifest destiny smaller countries did not want to be vassal states to the u s but sovereign and independent in action thus over the last several decades this increasing resistance to america s hegemony is being increasingly challenged by coalescing countries around the globe they seek freedom from u s control and dollar dominance in the next recession depression america s grip on global hegemony will be visibly slipping with a multipolar global decision making process ascending the dollar s dominance as the global reserve currency will continue to recede the consequence of which will be a much weaker dollar increased loss of purchasing value and growing and national debt issues coherent picture of our near term future having considered some important goals of our leaders and their institutions their implementation and success or lack thereof we can now consider their combined effect on our collective near term future we can see the future high interest rates depreciation of the currency increasing product prices increasing unemployment dramatically declining financial markets increase in the price of gold and america s further displacement from its economic and political unipolar hegemonic position is in our near term future manipulation of monetary policy has been going for decades which has turned increasingly strident in the last twenty years in the last several years this destruction has been abetted by fiscal policy that is running large and increasing budget deficits as a means to manipulate business activity these budget deficits have and will continue to rapidly increase our national debt increase its servicing costs require additional money expansion by the fed which will more rapidly debauch the currency now that monetary and fiscal policies both are firing their heavy artillery the question of whether we are to expect a recession or a depression is also answered the difference between recession and depression can be distinguished by severity and duration a short and mild period of preceding economic manipulation and distortion leads to a recession which similarly requires a relatively short period for recovery contrariwise a long and persistent period of manipulative money expansion credit escalation interest rate suppression income disparity decade long national debt bloating and decline in the purchasing power of the dollar all lead to the longer and more severe alternative so this is where we are and where we are heading avoiding bias in predictions when one makes severe predictions of recession or depression it is extremely important to not be influenced or blinded by some bias we all have bias and blind spots for example those in the hundreds of millions asset class and beyond can only conclude that all things economic are great for that is their experience medical professionals who have reliable good paying but demanding jobs are likely to see our economy as ok millions of clerical employees whose earnings are not keeping track with mounting expenditures likely see their lives as challenging persons struggling with their auto loan taken out to pay for the used car needed to get to work at a gas station or grocery store understand that their job is always at risk of termination and life is a continuing struggle for they do not have enough money to pay for their next unexpected expenditure or medical emergency those who have not had an income producing job for a while are dependent with diminishing hope of a better future to avoid or at least reduce the risk of bias we must revert to the impersonal statistical data collected by government and other agencies established for that purpose while the government and media will crow the positive economic and business news we can reduce our own bias by asking a number of questions 1 is it true that interest rates are at or near historic lows which deprive savers from earning interest 2 is it true that the purchasing value of our dollar has declined substantially remember that a 1971 dollar has the purchasing power of just 0 12 today 3 is it true that social security and pension funds are substantially underfunded which will not be able to deliver on their promises 4 is it true that an income disparity has suppressed common worker earnings now for almost five decades 5 is it true that financial markets by any rational measure are drastically overpriced and risk major value reappraisal 6 is it true that despite claims about a strong market and economy the fed has been using persistent stopgap financial measures and practicing crisis monetary policy over the last decade 7 is it not true that the fed just announced a one half trillion dollar liquidity injection program for banks to be implemented over the next month to avert what they define as a potential year end repo problem 8 is it true that national economies in europe are nearing recession while china s india s and other emerging country growth are rapidly decelerating 9 is it true that our global economic banking and trading system today is more interconnected than ever 10 is it true that foreign countries are reducing their dependence on the dollar currency seeking new trade alliances and creating new payment systems 11 is it true that america s global hegemony is being challenged by counties seeking their independent course of action rather than simply being dictated to by the u s if the above premises are true then our personal economic bias is low and our prediction objective while there are many other cogent questions to ask which will affect our economy and our financial markets over the next several years the preceding questions suffice to inform the already long trended path which we have been on which will lead us to experience the future that our leaders by their past actions have laid out for us in trying to evaluate our future without bias it is also important also to keep in mind by what rules our political leaders operate in a moment of truth during the eurozone debt crisis mr jean claude juncker the european commission president stated when it becomes serious you have to lie it is precisely because many of our real economic financial debt and societal changes have been in place for a

what to expect in our next recession depression over the last several years numerous highly respected money managers and other economic writers have been warning investors about a coming recession or depression however few have been willing to describe as to what we may actually experience going through such an economic period of course it seems a daunting task to foresee the future to predict how technology may change our lives years from now is admittedly impossible because such change seems to be taking place at an exponential rate and we have little past experience as to how modern technology changes society life style or culture in a reliable way projecting how we might live ten years in the future from an economic perspective is not that challenging particularly since this rate of change is relatively slow and such events have been experienced in numerous countries over hundreds of years as a result it is not impossible or even particularly difficult to foresee many of the important changes that we could expect to see from the onset of the next recession depression since the founding of the federal reserve system in 1913 our economy has been increasingly managed by its monetary policies government s fiscal policy management has also evolved with application of new or modern economic theories and collection of economic statistics government sets down a list of targets and levels for achievement and then charges agencies to manage for the attainment of such goals when government agencies intervene to manage manipulation may be the more accurate description of the form of management but manipulation is a form of management economists define a recession as two consecutive quarters where growth in the economy as measured by gdp is negative a depression is more severe than a recession although its severity doesn t have to increase but it definitely lasts for a far longer time period these statistically based definitions may not be that helpful to non economists who do not follow economic statistics besides such determinations can only be ascertained with certainty months after the fact as all economic statistics are collected and analyzed with a significant time lag a simpler more helpful and meaningful definition would be to say that recession depression both are simply periods when the government s desired policies for economic growth and civilian wellbeing are failing at such a time government agencies as the treasury department the federal reserve bank financial stability oversight council plunge protection team are not able to manipulate that economy or financial markets to their desired goals and the populace experiences job income debt repayment retirement and other financial difficulties since the breton woods conference in 1944 setting the dollar as global reserve currency there have been ten business cycles wherein the average recession has lasted ten months if one were fortunate enough to have a job during a recession not having been laid off that person may go through recession without even realizing that he was in one it is only those unfortunate people who have lost their job and income who experience the real tragedy of a recession it is not so with a depression depression may last for years and the economic contraction is far more severe affecting a large percentage of the population in the one acknowledged depression of the last century in the 1930s unemployment rates at times exceeded 30 and although the depression lasted for about a decade it took over thirty years for the nominal stock market prices to rise to their pre depression levels means to peek into the future to prognosticate our economic future first we need to identify what are the present goals of our government and its agencies from a monetary fiscal and geopolitical policy perspective then we need to identify and understand what would be the consequences on us of government failing to manipulate the economy towards its stated goals so what exactly have been some of the well advertised or recognized economic goals of our government and its agencies over the last several years to keep interest rates low in order to maintain the cost of servicing our national debt low and sustainable to weaken the dollar such that it promotes increased exports and reduces the real cost of our national debt to accelerate product price increases to at least 2 such that our economy as measured by gdp can be seen to be growing adequately to keep unemployment low such that citizens can be kept off unemployment benefits welfare and have income to pay federal income taxes keep stock bond and derivative markets from declining or crashing in order to promote a faulty trickle down economic theory which increases income disparity to keep the price of gold depressed a rising price undermines belief in the soundness of our fiat dollar currency maintain global economic and geopolitical control or leadership elites will oppose any challengers as they believe it to be singularly our manifest destiny low interest rates interest rates have been declining since the early 1980s for over thirty years such rates were near zero five years ago when the fed in 2016 started to raise them this brought about market instability and criticism from our president such that the small periodic interest rate rises by the fed have now been arrested and are being reversed starting mid year 2019 interest on our national debt for the 2020 fiscal year is budgeted at 479 billion a normalization of interest rates to historic levels would raise the interest cost of servicing that debt more than double and likely exceed 1 trillion this would be very negative for the economy and it would increase future budget deficits requiring increasing debt which decreases the purchasing value of our fiat currency in a future recession depression the historical management of low interest rates by the federal reserve bank would fail that is interest rates would rise the fed would not be able to control interest rates which would seek a higher level based on global risk assessment perhaps high enough to foreclose further corporate economic growth or development in a significantly higher interest rate scenario a multitude of industries would be adversely affected including building trades housing and all capital intensive industries individuals and families would not be able to obtain debt or credit and find it increasingly difficult to service existing indebtedness leading to possible financial default government would also find raising debt levels problematic weakening the dollar president trump has criticized chairman powell of the fed that our dollar is too strong relative to other foreign currencies a higher valued currency makes it more expensive for foreigners to buy american made products contrariwise if the dollar is weaker or cheaper when compared to other currencies our exports rise improving our international trade account unfortunately improving export results by weakening one s currency is known by all nations and as a result all nations are competing from time to time by weakening their own currencies in this sequential weakening of foreign currencies no one wins in the long term but it creates what has been called a race to the bottom where all currencies are weakened since our dollar is the reserve currency of the world it is the choice currency for international investors in which to seek refuge when various economic headwinds threaten their currencies as a result global threats make the dollar stronger however domestic policy failures in addition to foreigners gradually decreasing their preference for u s currency due to devaluation risk will ultimately lead the dollar to become weaker that is far weaker than our policy makers prefer it is that time when the risk of continued dollar weakening would create a loss of confidence in the dollar which in turn could precipitate major reduction in the purchasing value of our currency in a future recession depression a major weakening of the dollar would make all goods far more expensive to consumers particularly imported goods accordingly weaker dollars will not be able to help support the consumer driven economy and already fragile economic growth would be further diminished accelerate price increases the manipulators of our economy would like to see product prices increased by at least 2 per year that is an unsuspectingly a high rate of inflation as one dollar s purchasing value declines to just twelve cents over one s lifetime of 72 years however a 2 rate of price inflation would improve an important statistical measurement that of gdp rising nominally by 2 or more this price increase has been a stated goal of the fed one which they have failed so far to achieve in the last half dozen years the economic definition of inflation is that of an increase in our money supply in this regard the fed has far exceeded the 2 target but it has not resulted in commensurate price increases the reason for this failure is that the fed has purposefully kept this increase in the money supply contained and restricted to that of the nation s banks which in turn have funneled it to the investment markets or deposited with the federal reserve bank rather than general bank funds lent to individuals or business therefore financial markets are booming while consumer prices have remained constrained in a recession depression it is likely that prices may actually initially decline further because a slowing economy may reduce jobs and incomes such that aggregate consumer purchasing power is reduced prompting business to reduce prices as a means to increase sales however attempts to stimulate consumers with additional money printing will eventually devalue the money and increase prices by unexpectedly and uncontrollably large amounts thus as our economic managers initially fail to increase prices they will take actions which will amplify both inflation and price increases by dramatic amounts in our coming recession depression the value of our money will decrease and prices of products will accelerate to troublesome levels hence consumers will be negatively affected by price increases and income of those employed will purchase fewer goods slowing overall economic growth keep unemployment low our president has taken great pride in the fact that the overall rate of unemployment is low and that its individual racial and ethnic components are historically low when the rate of unemployment starts to rise and the number of new jobs decline that will be the signal that managers of our economy are failing they will not be able to keep unemployment low regardless of monetary or fiscal policy initiatives thus when the next recession depression is upon us the rate of unemployment will rise to uncomfortable levels impacting severely those who were previously working but are now unemployed they will have lost their jobs incomes livelihood and become dependent on government which itself is losing the ability to help our high technology economy with modern and efficient production facilities increased robotics and use of artificial intelligence already produces all the goods and agricultural products that advanced societies need with a four day work week no not the four day ten hour day version but simply a four eight hour work week that is the way to keep everyone employed and maintain their skills presently that work week plan is not being considered by our capitalist corporatists as it does not seem to squeeze enough out of people s labor when compared to desired corporate profits this view is very shortsighted and an important reason why capitalism is failing while socialism is in ascendancy in our future recession depression as the confluence of high interest rates reduced value of our fiat currency rapidly increasing prices of goods and services and rising unemployment reinforce each other the results on the nation and its individual citizens will be pronounced and terrible unfortunately when this cycle gains momentum it will remain dominant for a number of years financial markets arguably even as the most advanced economy of the world america has had a great and rising income disparity between the rich and poor now for over five decades the wealthy own stocks and bonds while the middle and working class and the rest have an overabundance of debt loans and constricting credit the servicing and repayment of which reduces their ability to save which ultimately goes as income or capital gains to that 0 1 of the population our financial markets do not reflect and have not been reflecting the actual dynamics of our economy but rather the pre announced actions of the fed s monetary policy fundamental indicators of the status of our economy have been upstaged by bank bailouts plunge protection team actions of the open market committee of the fed declining interest rates quantitative easing repo markets access forward guidance and other false market stimulants all financial markets stocks bonds financial futures have been manipulated to extraordinary bubbles such that they will burst with a vengeance and will destroy with equanimity all fiat based financial fortunes and modest savings alike multi year market declines together with a long recovery period may easily span more than a decade we are at the precipice of such a decline which will continue to be fought off by all the awesome power available to oligarchs who control corporate america bankers who control actions of the fed and elites in politics and government who control fiscal policy as well as their counterparts in the developed world given global similarities in central bank policies and their close interconnectedness their common demise is essentially guaranteed that looks to be more serious than a global recession in their view the financial market bubble must be maintained at all costs because its bursting will unleash multi year pain and suffering to the citizenry of such magnitude that it will open floodgates of anger hate and revulsion of those in control to cause them fear for their own lives market bubbles will either burst or deflate significantly one important element of people s wellbeing has not been taken into account here because it has not been expressed through government or central banking as a goal the middle and lower class have various forms of government mandated or corporate retirement programs which are invested in our financial markets their present funding is inadequate and a market decline would destroy these pensions see market decline will lead to pension collapse usd devaluation and nwo in a recession depression this universally acknowledged financial mega bubble will burst or deflate dramatically but it will not just deflate to the norm but rather its momentum will reduce prices far below the norm before it tends to readjust to a justifiable valuation this period and its pricing will be long and painful to all depressing the price of gold coal miners used to take canaries down into coal mining shafts to test for the presence of carbon monoxide a deadly gas to humans such poisoned air killed the canary early but saved many coal miner s lives durable indestructible gold is the canary of a poisoned economic system when the price of gold rises in terms of fiat currency it is a signal that the systemic manipulations in currency and economy are becoming poisoned this is the important reason why the price of gold has been and will continue to be suppressed for as long as it is possible by the systemic manipulators the illusion must be maintained that our currency is not poisoned and the system stable for those interested in finding supporting information on this suppression activity can easily find it with a few clicks on their computer search engines suffice it to say here that banks have paid criminal fines some traders have been convicted but the suppression of gold s price is so critical to our fiat currency creation system that it will continue until the system blows up or government itself reprices gold as it did in 1933 and 1971 as a result earnest calls by traders that gold is ready to break out should always be tempered with the knowledge that banks and government are active in its price suppression gold is the antidote to our poisoned economic environment central banks have disparaged gold for decades yet they themselves are now buying it as it is the ultimate bank reserve asset foreign countries are buying large quantities of gold and taking direct possession of it rather than entrusting it to some foreign single storage facility in a future recession depression the amount of fiat paper or digital currency will have expanded multiple times the value of it and its ability to purchase goods or services will necessarily decline by inverse proportion some ownership of gold or silver by individuals for their financial wellbeing is about as important as it is for a person allergic to bee stings to have an epinephrine auto injector or to have an antidote for poisonous snake bites in their medicine cabinet their actual use may be infrequent but their immediate availability invaluable and possibly life saving maintain global economic and political hegemony after wwii the united states was acknowledged as having the most powerful military and the strongest economy in the world because of its strong stand against communism and socialism it also was admired for its moral righteousness in defending self determination and liberty steadfast around the globe it would covertly replace socialist foreign leaders not to its liking ultimately military wars in countries such as vietnam afghanistan iraq kosovo serbia and syria as well as financial or political confrontations in in countries such as egypt libya chile nicaragua ukraine venezuela and bolivia came to represent more than just replacing suspected leftist leaders it came to represent that america had abandoned america s founding principles of non intervention and instead embraced a later faulty principle of manifest destiny smaller countries did not want to be vassal states to the u s but sovereign and independent in action thus over the last several decades this increasing resistance to america s hegemony is being increasingly challenged by coalescing countries around the globe they seek freedom from u s control and dollar dominance in the next recession depression america s grip on global hegemony will be visibly slipping with a multipolar global decision making process ascending the dollar s dominance as the global reserve currency will continue to recede the consequence of which will be a much weaker dollar increased loss of purchasing value and growing and national debt issues coherent picture of our near term future having considered some important goals of our leaders and their institutions their implementation and success or lack thereof we can now consider their combined effect on our collective near term future we can see the future high interest rates depreciation of the currency increasing product prices increasing unemployment dramatically declining financial markets increase in the price of gold and america s further displacement from its economic and political unipolar hegemonic position is in our near term future manipulation of monetary policy has been going for decades which has turned increasingly strident in the last twenty years in the last several years this destruction has been abetted by fiscal policy that is running large and increasing budget deficits as a means to manipulate business activity these budget deficits have and will continue to rapidly increase our national debt increase its servicing costs require additional money expansion by the fed which will more rapidly debauch the currency now that monetary and fiscal policies both are firing their heavy artillery the question of whether we are to expect a recession or a depression is also answered the difference between recession and depression can be distinguished by severity and duration a short and mild period of preceding economic manipulation and distortion leads to a recession which similarly requires a relatively short period for recovery contrariwise a long and persistent period of manipulative money expansion credit escalation interest rate suppression income disparity decade long national debt bloating and decline in the purchasing power of the dollar all lead to the longer and more severe alternative so this is where we are and where we are heading avoiding bias in predictions when one makes severe predictions of recession or depression it is extremely important to not be influenced or blinded by some bias we all have bias and

credit suisse forecasts the global economy will grow at a moderate rate of 2 5 per cent suggesting recession is unlikely amid softer growth credit suisse expects modest single digit returns in the equity markets a polarised us presidential campaign margin pressure high corporate debt and fewer interest rate cuts by major central banks not to mention unexpected political developments are likely to test investor nerves in 2020 credit suisse said even if the us china trade war eases and brexit uncertainty diminishes investing throughout 2020 will require portfolio diversification tilted towards areas of extra return credit suisse expects moderate economic growth accommodative liquidity conditions and easing geopolitical tensions as the us china trade war subsides business sentiment should improve lifting growth oriented sectors and stocks it predicted ray farris chief investment officer south asia at credit suisse said we believe that the global economy and markets will continue to show considerable resilience in the face of challenges in the asia pacific the outlook for the more advanced countries of north asia remains subdued due to weakness in chinese trade with growth of just over 2 per cent the outlook for hong kong will depend strongly on local political developments economic growth remains far stronger in much of southeast asia which has more catch up potential and is less integrated into china based supply chains some countries most prominently vietnam stand to benefit as production continues to shift in their direction in thailand we think the baht should soften to 30 50 over the next several months as relaxation of foreign exchange controls works to generate new outflows from the country for equities we have a neutral view as weak growth environment is being offset by low interest rates the outlook for the major economies and currencies united states credit suisse expects slower gdp growth for the us economy in 2020 at 1 8 per cent accompanied by rising core inflation the us dollar should remain supported but weaken in the course of the year as its interest rate advantage over most g10 currencies wanes euro zone monetary policy is unlikely to ease further but resilient credit growth should support ongoing economic expansion with gdp growth forecast at 1 per cent fiscal stimulus and diminishing brexit uncertainty should support the eu asia a us china trade deal would likely push the yuan higher and exert some upward pressure on other asian currencies asia is likely to benefit from an improvement in global industrial growth momentum in early 2020 and keep full year growth of 5 3 per cent close to 2019 s 5 4 per cent we expect the current industrial production slump to bottom in december and begin to recover in the first quarter of 2020 this should work to boost regional exports improve some countries trade balances and encourage capital flows into the region thailand the surge in thailand s current account surplus to 9 1 billion in the third quarter of this year from 3 8 billion in last year s third quarter is the core source of the baht s strength and looks likely to continue however credit suisse expects the bank of thailand s liberalisation of its foreign exchange controls to offset much of this by creating new thai outflows into foreign currencies the key risk credit suisse sees to its forecasts is that thailand s current account surplus remains large and these measures do not spur significant new outflows outlook for financial markets equities outlook equities continue to offer an attractive return advantage over low yielding bonds on a sector level it is preferred as one of the few high growth sectors financials are also attractive as the expected improvement in the cyclical outlook will likely trigger a further rotation into that sector in the first half of 2020 credit suisse said we believe that a turnaround in the performance of asian equities is likely in the coming months we prefer north asian markets in particular china over south asian ones to take exposure to potential cyclical recovery credit suisse said thailand earnings for the third quarter contracted 14 per cent year on year pushing the numbers for the first nine months to 20 per cent below 2018 for the same period the main factor behind disappointing results has been the lagging economy although the government implemented a mini stimulus package in august september the amounts involved were modest and headwinds from the external sector remained intense credit suisse said we believe there is further downside risk to market s expectations of 8 7 per cent eps growth for 2020 though valuation is not cheap either with 2020 p e at 15 2 times ample domestic liquidity and dividend yield of 3 per cent could provide support on the downside fixed income we expect asian high yield corporates to be supported by more accommodative policies monetary policy is also likely to remain accommodative the greater than 7 per cent yield of asian high yield bonds remains attractive relative to developed markets and is not expensive compared to its 10 year average we forecast asia high yield to deliver 6 per cent total return in the next 12 months credit suisse said commodities outlook commodities have been on diverging paths this past year with the industrial production slowdown weighing on cyclical commodities in particular going forward this divergence is expected to diminish while gold prices are likely to consolidate oil prices may face a period of weakness before recovering eventually credit suisse said alternative investments in alternative investments most real estate investments should continue to deliver moderately positive returns direct real estate is favoured as lower interest rates do not yet appear to be fully reflected in the price credit suisse said john woods chief investment officer for asia pacfic at credit suisse said in an environment of lower for longer yields a multi asset framework allows investors to take advantage of pockets of value in low risk markets while increasing expected returns by investing in equities and seeking out less conventional fixed income investments we believe such an approach will prove rewarding in 2020

pakistan s economic stabilization and reform program is on track strong ownership by the authorities and steadfast reform implementation are critical to entrench macroeconomic stability and support robust and balanced growth imf pakistan imf_pakistan december 20 2019 the international monetary fund imf on thursday approved the second tranche of 452 5 million of the 6 billion package after islamabad managed to meet all targets set for the first review of the programme by bringing the country s economic wheel to a grinding halt the imf has once again supported the tight monetary policy stance besides emphasising upon the need to timely and regularly increase the electricity tariffs the two issues that have invited a lot of criticism in pakistan from independent policy experts and economists the executive board of the imf met in washington and approved the first review of the programme for july september period of fiscal year 2019 20 in november pakistan and the imf had reached a staff level agreement on completion of the first review of the 6 billion programme the completion of the review will allow authorities to draw sdr 328 million about us 452 4 million bringing total disbursements to sdr 1 044 million or about 1 44 billion according to a statement issued by the imf after the board meeting pakistan s programme is on track and has started to bear fruit however risks remain elevated strong ownership and steadfast reform implementation are critical to entrench macroeconomic stability and support robust and balanced growth the imf once again emphasised upon faster progress to improve the aml cft framework and said that swift adoption of all the necessary measures was needed to exit the fatf s list of jurisdictions with aml cft deficiencies the imf statement came about a month before joint review group of the asia pacific group will review progress on the fatf action plan implementation pakistan met the conditions on net international reserves reduction in net foreign currency swaps reduction in primary deficit zero borrowing from the central bank and cap on issuance of new sovereign guarantees however the targets have been achieved by paying a price in shape of low economic growth and increase in poverty and unemployment in the country in order to meet the imf targets on net international reserves and curbing the demand the state bank of pakistan kept the interest rates artificially high at 13 25 but the imf said the current monetary stance is appropriately tight and should only be eased once disinflation is firmly entrenched strengthening the state bank of pakistan s autonomy and governance will support these efforts it added the government and the sbp also believe that curbing the domestic demand was critical for bringing economic stability the ministry of finance did not release the budgetary allocations for development spending and the provinces also saved rs202 billion cash surpluses in order to meet the imf targets all this choked the economic activities in the country the flexible market determined exchange rate remains essential to cushion the economy against external shocks and rebuild reserve buffers according to the imf handout the imf said that pakistani authorities had adopted a comprehensive plan to address the accumulation of arrears in the power sector timely and regular adjustment of energy tariffs would bring the sector in line with cost recovery said the imf its full implementation is key to improving collection reducing losses and enhancing governance the power division could not meet the circular debt reduction target for the first quarter and the government had to increase electricity prices the current account deficit shrank 4 9 billion or 73 to 1 8 billion during first five months of this fiscal year according to the sbp there is consensus among the independent economists that the demand curb measures that the sbp and the finance ministry took were more than the requirements the imf s second tranche is expected to push the gross official foreign currency reserves over 11 billion during the week ending december 13 2019 the sbp reserves increased 1 7 billion to 10 9 billion this increase is attributed to multilateral and other official inflows including proceeds of 1 3 billion received from the asian development bank the imf hoped in november that inflation pressures were expected to recede soon reflecting an appropriate monetary stance it has urged pakistan to maintain fiscal prudence including carefully executing the fiscal year 2019 20 budget to reduce fiscal vulnerabilities the imf said that pakistani authorities were committed to sustaining the progress on fiscal adjustment to place debt on a downward path the planned reforms include strengthening tax revenue mobilisation including the elimination of tax exemptions and loopholes and prudent expenditure policies preparations for a comprehensive tax policy reform should start early to ensure timely implementation enhanced social safety nets would help alleviate social costs and build support for reforms it also said that efforts are ongoing to further improve the business environment strengthen governance and foster private sector investment reform of the state owned enterprise sector will help put pakistan s public finances on a sustainable path and have positive spillovers by levelling the playing field and improving the provision of services according to the handout
trade between china and the us has grown exponentially since china s accession to the wto in 2001 multiplying by 4 5 and reaching a total of 737 billion in 2018 the us runs a very large bilateral merchandise trade deficit of 420 billion with china and a small 40 billion surplus in services total chinese exports to the united states are now over 3 times larger than us exports to china while goods exports are over 5 times larger the bilateral imbalance is viewed by the trump administration as unacceptable and is at the heart of the dispute aggravated by the growing geopolitical rivalry between the world s two largest economies inherently the united states believes as do its european and japanese allies that china s state driven system is the source of unfair advantages for chinese firms that distort world trade these concerns relate especially to emerging competition in sectors where the united states enjoys a comparative advantage notably in high technology this is exemplified by measures taken to isolate huawei china s most successful firm operating in the technology sector following a brief honeymoon after president trump was elected in november 2016 the united states relations with china which were always problematic became tumultuous in march 2018 the united states imposed an across the board 25 tariff on steel and a 10 tariff on aluminium on the grounds of national security china retaliated with tariffs on us exports valued at 2 4 billion commensurate with china s exports of steel and aluminium to the united states subsequently the us targeted china specifically invoking unreasonable or discriminatory actions under the rarely used section 301 of the trade act of 1974 as a first instalment the us declared 25 tariffs on 1 333 chinese products valued at 46 2 billion in a second instalment the us declared a 10 tariff on 200 billion of chinese products these tariffs were raised to 25 in may of this year after an aborted negotiation to defuse tensions trump announced additional tariffs of 10 in august on all remaining chinese imports about 300 billion to be imposed in stages in september and december this final stage has been stopped by the tentative deal since chinese merchandise imports from the united states amount only to about a fifth of chinese exports to the united states china s retaliation affected only a small part of us exports however as the targeted us exports are mainly agriculture and specifically soybeans china s retaliation is politically very costly for trump as farmers constitute an important part of his base in swing states devaluation of the chinese renmimbi earlier this year was also widely seen as a chinese response to the tariffs the phase 1 deal a hard hitting set of us demands on china contained in a memorandum prepared at the outset of negotiations includes reduction of the bilateral trade deficit by 200 billion in 2 years however american negotiators stressed from the start that their more important demands were structural reforms in china required to level the playing field for us companies these demands included improved protection of intellectual property removal of technology transfer requirements to operate in china removal of regulations that impede us service exports market access for us investment in china and improved investment protection reduction of chinese tariffs removal of several non tariff barriers and improved access for us agricultural exports to china as far as we can tell china s main negotiating objective was a return to the status quo ante i e removal of all us tariffs imposed under section 301 removal of the threat to impose new tariffs and normalization of treatment for huawei the deal fails to meet china s objectives by a wide margin while tariffs on 160 billion chinese goods due in december will not come into force and those introduced in september on 112 billion will be halved from 15 to 7 5 all other tariffs will remain as they are the us insisted that tariffs remain to ensure that china lives up to the deal and to retain leverage for the second phase of negotiations although the details are patchy american negotiating objectives appear to have been fulfilled on the bilateral trade front since according to a ustr fact sheet but not confirmed by china china has committed to increasing the purchase of us exports by 200 billion in two years which would see us exports to china almost double included are increased purchases of us agricultural products by 32 billion over the same time period however the deal as described fails to meet the united states objectives relating to structural reforms in china china has committed to increasing legal protection for patents as well as ip more generally in line with its interest to make progress on this agenda as china becomes a leading innovation pole china also commits to following through on long standing pledges to end demands on us investors operating in china to transfer technology china will also further open its financial markets to us firms encompassing a wide range of financial activities but this too is in line with previously announced reforms they further pledged to avoid using currency devaluation as a competitive tool a practice ended long ago specific provisions were included designed to resolve disputes within 90 days there appears to be nothing in the deal relating to subsidization through state owned enterprises industrial policy such as the made in china 2025 program and market access commitments in investment appear limited to the financial sector interpreting the deal as in the case of the mini deal with japan the overriding motivation on the us side is the reelection of the president in this regard the deal works as it eases investor concerns and helps the stock market reduces the likelihood of a recession in an election year could even provide a small stimulus to the us economy should it slow from its current full employment path and most importantly provides compensation for farmers despite bipartisan support for a tough stance on china regarding structural issues as well as on the trade deficit electoral considerations dominate and have taken priority these electoral preoccupations help explain why the deal is more favourable to china than many had anticipated since china obtained some tariff reductions that the us had adamantly resisted while only making only modest commitments to structural reforms but the famously long time horizon of chinese decision makers and short term american electoral concerns provide only a part of the explanation for china s ability to hold out under us pressure china has deep pockets its foreign exchange reserves are 3 1 trillion and its official government gross debt not counting the debt of state owned enterprises stands at around 50 of gdp enabling it to alleviate pain of its exporters to some degree as the us whose government debt stands at over 100 of gdp has done with its ad hoc subsidies to us farmers despite the fact that the us economy helped by looser fed policy has held up better than china s and chinese exports to the us have declined the chinese have shown that they can bear the pain with the help of monetary chiefly the devaluation of the renminbi and fiscal stimulus and a modest deceleration from china s 6 growth rate is less painful than a modest deceleration from the us 2 growth rate the phase 1 deal also demonstrates that even when it is willing to exert extreme pressure the united states ability to force china to engage in deep reforms it does not want to do or it may be inclined to do but which are resisted internally by hawkish factions is limited china s economy is now larger than that of the united states at ppp exchange rates and china s exports of goods and services are about 6 larger than those of the united states china s decision makers at the helm of a rising world power cannot afford to be seen to buckle under foreign pressure public opinion counts in china as well and so does the way the country is perceived by the global community the record of trump s muscular approach to foreign relations is short yet already full of examples where far smaller nations than china such as mexico north korea and turkey have defied his ultimatums when their interests as they perceived them demanded it the china us dispute is far from over and many negotiating rounds can be expected before things settle if they do but in the phase 1 exchanges china has shown that it will engage only in those structural reforms it believes are in its own interest and only at a measured pace sadly the deal also shows that wto disciplines are easily cast aside by both the world s largest trading nations this follows the example of the united states mini deal with japan which showed that the united states was willing to ignore article 24 of the gatt wto substantially all trade and to induce japan to do the same in the china us deal tariffs were imposed by both sides in contravention of wto rules and the agreement by china to purchase additional us goods clearly violates the principle of non discrimination mfn treatment of all its trading partners it is difficult to imagine that the 100 billion a year of additional us purchases equal to the gdp of a medium sized economy such as morocco will divert solely chinese domestic production instead brazilian soybean exporters will suffer as will japanese and european manufacturers that compete with american firms american tactics in phase 1 which amount to managed trade also help explain the determination of us trade representative lighthizer to neutralize the appellate body at the wto as in the case of the japan deal the us congress which technically has ultimate authority over trade policy and retains the power to ratify will play no part in the phase 1 deal a hugely significant international trade negotiation in the same week that the phase 1 deal was announced the congress reached an agreement to ratify the usmca tacitly acquiescing in this state of affairs the ongoing and accelerating power shift in trade policy from the legislature to the executive will enable trump and other protectionist presidents in the future to restrict or liberalize us trade more easily than in the past and use it as an instrument to promote the president s political agenda in the us a hawkish faction has become established that has deplored the phase 1 deal as a cave in to china since china is unlikely to satisfy us demands that it radically overhaul its system this hawkish faction and the broad bipartisan consensus in favour of a tough stance virtually guarantee a resumption of the trade war should trump be reelected if he is not the election of a centrist democrat a democrat of the left such as elizabeth warren or bernie sanders both trade sceptics is unlikely to meet the bar will likely imply a lowering of tensions with china this may culminate eventually in an agreement to roll back tariffs on both sides over time while china engages in selective structural reforms at its own pace for example in areas such as foreign investment services liberalization and intellectual property president trump s tactics may have resulted in some progress on accelerating structural reforms that china had already embarked upon but only at considerable cost for american consumers and exporters and increased uncertainty that has depressed investment and slowed global economic growth ironically his efforts to reduce the bilateral trade deficit which are touted as a big success are far more likely to distort and divert trade than to result in an improved external balance as economists have long argued it is not possible to reduce america s current account deficit without either increasing the economy s productive potential or reducing aggregate spending the president s tariffs and the china us deal do neither it is no surprise that the united states current account deficit over the last twelve months has increased compared to the same twelve months a year ago
19 12 2019 listen i have argued that in sub sahara africa most demonstrations protests and mass citizens actions are deeply attributed to rant seeking political corruption marginalization mismanagement malfeasances pronounced deprivation of wellbeing and unequal distribution of resources on the part of the political leaderships of the continent these several of menaces have harnessed and continue to midwife civil conflicts in most part of africa here i would build a comparative analysis between liberia and rwanda given the conspicuous similarities of both countries gloomy historical past like liberia rwanda experienced a dreadful historic genocide that owned the lives of about 1 million rwandans including women and children of the tutsi minority tribe and moderate hutus this happened as a result of what i have mentioned above the rwandan nation was completely paralyzed and failed world bank then referred to the country as nonviable the war had obliterated virtually everything most competent bureaucrats had been killed or fled and looters had stripped government offices down to the last piece of paper all government institutions were looted and vandalized when the post conflict government of national unity had taken charge in july 1994 the country had no running water and little electricity the new president kagame had no idea either did his colleagues have much expertise or institutional knowledge to draw on in reconsolidating the broken fabrics of the rwandan society before the genocide the country had about eight hundred judges but fewer had survived the mass slaughter as mentioned today rwanda s case is completely different as the country has buckled its belt for governance and human capital investment it has transitioned from hopelessness to hopefulness and is now considered as the singapore of africa within twenty five years less than what was projected for rwanda to re establish itself as a sovereign country and positive member of the comity of nations this synonymously depicts the liberian nation a country that was once seen as an epicenter of the fourteen years of civil conflicts from late 1989 to 2003 had embraced peace through the intervention of the then american president george w bush and other world leaders mainly the circle of the united nations it is estimated that about two hundred fifty thousand people were killed during the civil conflict like rwanda the liberian civil conflict had its historical root embedded in the class system orchestrated by the freed slaves after the rebellions in the americas and were migrated and settled in liberia the powerful elites congou though a very small population had ruled the country for almost 133 years the natives who account for the country s highest population had been politically and socially excluded and soon revenged against the ruling class when the opportunity for redemption availed itself this resulted in a military coup d état in april 1980 and resulted to master sgt samuel k doe and his men in arms murdering president william r tolbert at his executive mansion office this caused a prolonged period of anarchy characterized by ethnicity and plunder sadly the ringleader of the coup due to similar reasons he president samuel k doe was in 1990 slaughtered by then leader of the independent national patriotic front and now a member of the liberian senate sen prince y johnson these historical circumstances breaded the liberian civil war which led to massive atrocities and agony following the cessation of hostilities by various parties in 2003 the national transitional government of liberia ntgl headed by the late charles gyude bryant took charge as the country s interim government from 2003 to 2006 this interim arrangement took the country to its first postwar democratic elections that subsequently brought the first elected female president on the continent of africa mrs ellen j sirleaf even after the interim leadership state capacity was limitedly weak to enhance governance and set the pace for national development almost every sector of the country was broken and needed to be rebuilt poverty and diseases had ransacked the country and its people liberia was considered a failed state backed by indebtedness during the administration of the former president mrs ellen j sirleaf liberia graduated from the heavily indebted poor country hipc from the rankings of the international monetary fund imf and the world bank interestingly and despite the similar historical circumstances that beclouded the two countries liberia is yet to regain its full capabilities in governance rule of law and inclusive sustainable development currently reconciliation and political division are increasing challenges to national unity and development unlike rwanda the lessons of the civil conflict have not resonated with the country s government and people there are visibly vices that are considered conflict triggers corruption inequality and social discrimination rwanda s rebirth is accredited to the country s progressive leadership championed by h e president paul kagame whose immaculate leadership has led his country to rapid economic and human capital development can protests and demonstrations hold in rwanda this is hypothetical considering the progress that the country is making with the full participation of about 12 million rwandans who have embraced peace and harmony and involved in the rebuilding efforts of their great country there seems to be zero iotas of citizens actions or any act of political instability because the country has spectacularly positioned itself to achieve economic and social development of its people and onward ensure sustainable livelihoods the reasons i have not seen nor heard about demonstrations and protests in rwanda or even attempting to coin a campaign for kagame step down is that governance in rwanda is participatory the leadership ensures the country s economic development like agricultural employment empowerment job creations regional trades digital economy and infrastructural development etc is done collectively with inclusivity being the hallmark rwanda runs a private sector driven economy through the privatization of major parastastals and public private partnerships to ensure rural dwellers involvement in economic activities the government with supports from development partners has invested millions of dollars in the agricultural sector which ensures food security and job creations for farmers across the country while the private sector is reducing unemployment in the youthful population skilled and unskilled youths are being employed in rwandan firms and industries and as well as foreign investments now drawing from this economic approach would you think that rwandans will stand up for protests and frequent demonstrations a strong economic framework can birth social and political stability which keeps the people actively engaged and developmental for liberia our case is totally different and highly punctuated with a question mark those vices that orchestrated our civil conflict are empirically vivid in present day liberian society they have not abated at all we have not fully reconciled as a country neither have we learned the lessons of the past we have failed to win the war against political corruption marginalization unemployment and systemic mismanagement of our natural endowments these menaces have kept us dependent and undermined liberia s economic prosperity for decades this aspect has given reasons for mass based citizens actions in demand for transformative leadership good governance approach and transparency in the management of the country s resources opposition parties are of course ensuring that the government is greatly accountable to the governed drawing on its manifestos development framework which keeps the opposition parties reminded on checks and balances in government in both governments sirleaf and weah there have been calls to terminate the tenures of the regimes in the names of ellen step down and weah step down campaigns by citizens and politicians based on extreme poverty and lack of sustained economic development of the people the sirleaf chronicles former president ellen j sirleaf is remembered for ensuring efficient and effective performance of the ministries departments and agencies which set governance on the pace for performance through competent experienced and skilled administrators most liberian youths in her government were given opportunities for capacity development and scholarship opportunities were afforded to many liberian students desired for foreign education which propelled them to contribute to nation building efforts in both private and public sectors as mentioned sirleaf ensured that liberia graduated from the heavily indebted poor country hipc from the rankings of the international monetary fund imf and the world bank her accomplishments are enormous as she built roads that connected liberia s capital monrovia to connecting counties her efforts on infrastructural development are conspicuous according to economists her supports to road connectivity have created externalities for rural dwellers who are involved in farming activities yet her 12 years of leadership was expected to have created the country s development framework on the foundation of radical economic development that will guarantee employment of liberian youths who account for nearly 60 of our population considering her strong relationship with washington and aids received from donor countries and institutions this was not achieved and opportunities to achieve them were squandered due to classic corruption malfeasance rant seeking and the mismanagement of the country s resources madam sirleaf s policy on salaries of some heads of government was astronomically high while civil servants were working poor like many others the former maritime boss hon binyal kesselly was alleged to have received a monthly salary of usd 25 000 amidst rampant corruption extreme poverty massive unemployment declining economy infant and maternal mortalities extreme crime rates and fragile healthcare delivery services across liberia while heads of soes and autonomous agencies liberia petroleum refinery corporation national oil company of liberia national port authority liberia telecommunications authority and liberia revenue authority amongst others allegedly received 15 to 20 usd as monthly salaries this happened when healthcare workers were frequently on go slow actions in demand for increment and incentives while lecturers at the state run university and other public colleges were similarly abandoning classes due to low budgetary allotments at the same time the unemployed youths were regularly seen agitating for sustained jobs and skills that will make them potential citizens as a result of fiscal indiscipline in her government state coffers were depleted and our resources were gang raped and bastardized dating to sirleaf s administration i argue that her legacy is marked by systemic controversy some done some na done while i appreciate significant progress reforms in governance and public bureaucracy but at the average our people were robbed of their dignity and condemned to extreme poverty weah s conundrums is gbekugbeh learning from his predecessor well one would not conclude president george m weah s success or failure as he has gone nearly 2 years of his 6 years term however what seems to be vivid is the incompetence of the bureaucrats who supposedly run the day to day activities of the executive branch of government his early approach to governance was highly unorthodox positions were rewarded to his loyalists and partisans based on political reciprocity not competence as it has termed to be nevertheless mr weah has got a spectacular history to learn from mrs sirleaf vices that were ingrained in sirleaf s administration are unearthing in his government wearing reflective jackets his government is accused of massive corruption and siphoning of the state coffers for personal initiatives with a practical example of his duplexes and the jamaica resort property this accusation has triggered numerous protests in demand of accountability in the case involving the 16 billion liberian dollars that were allegedly confiscated and unaccounted and as well calls for the ministry of finance and central bank of liberia to provide findings on the expenditure of the 25 million dollars meant to mob up the economy sadly the president has remained tightlipped on these multiple accusations and the economic prosperity of his people remains a fantasy this has certainly rejuvenated the campaign to oust him from the presidency through a protest designed weah stepdown under the canopy of counsel of patriots conventional wisdom dictates that poverty and hunger cannot be compromised when the people are excessively hungry they result in demanding radical solutions to instantaneous change this has led to forceful removal heads of governments in africa and elsewhere the question of how we change the narrative remains a task to ponder there are diverse views as to how the former can be changed and the country s economic development is secured some argue that a lack of political will on the part of our leaders has increased the existing problems while others believe that liberia s problems are tied to its historical foundation and the behavioral issues mentality of the people towards the country remains structurally undeveloped as for pundits and academics they argue that the quality of leadership sets the country for progress and sustainable development the above is true for instance economic hardships are common and prevalent in weak and developing countries in asia and sub sahara africa which are caused as a result of policy failures implementation gaps and state capacity gaps however the latter can be solved and the solutions are considered sustainable when applied first the liberian government should consider effective and efficient political leadership will that enables our leaders to be deeply committed to radical economic reforms in practical terms and advance working solutions to our existing problems second the government must increase supports to public projects that will in turn attract investments and create avenues for employment and favorable policies that attract foreign investments and boom local economies third most likely the government is advised to invest in the agricultural sector which is the bedrock for economic growth and development it is the ladder used by advanced and developing economies to support economic development and macroeconomic stability lastly rule of law which drives citizens and investors confidence in the state should be uncompromised people must have trust in the system to seek redress at all time and impartial judgment is served regardless who is involved this will further ensure judicial independence to end hunger and poverty as part of sdgs 1 2 developing economy like liberia must prioritize agriculture development as a major frontier for economic development which will support human and infrastructural developments job creation for both unskilled and skilled laborers food security contribution to national income pre requisite for raw materials and as well earn valuable foreign exchange through export of our agricultural products are major advantages of the sector conclusion peace and development are intrinsically intertwined for a lasting and reliable peace to be attained it is significantly fundamental for the government to consider economic systems that can generate sustained economic growth guarantee for the mass of the people s economic prosperity and development depression or prolonged deprivation by itself is a conduit for social conflict and as well as routine protests and demonstrations against political leadership this aspect was not vividly recognized by ex liberian president mrs ellen j sirleaf critics argue that she received impressively global recognitions and accolades which did not translate practically to reconciliation and economic development of her country and people drawing from rwanda s experience in peace conflict management and prevention it s imperative that the current leadership of the country models its development framework as rwanda given that both countries share similar historical experiences in terms of conflict triggers a lesson that has resonated greatly with governance in east africa in the aspect of the presidency it s essential for the president to surround himself with a team of experts local and international comprising persons of diverse backgrounds technicians technocrats architects experienced administrators legal pundits diplomats public policy experts to review analyze evaluate and advise the president on social economic political and foreign policy issues of the country these experts will also review critically void of political maneuvering all policy issues arising from the legislature and the judiciary and well as ministries departments and agencies for the president to have an informed decision on the state of affairs doing this will restore public confidence and get the nation on track to progressive nation building we want peace about the author amara quardu mohamed

briefing highlights bank of canada must be gentle stocks canadian dollar oil at a glance sweden ends negative rates era what analysts are saying today required reading when rates eventually rise the bank of canada will need to watch how fast it raises interest rates given the higher sensitivity among borrowers and how consumer insolvencies have spiked not that the bank of canada is looking at an increase at this point the central bank is leaving itself more open to a cut in its benchmark overnight rate rather than a hike but that key rate now at 1 75 per cent is going to rise again at some point and that canadian imperial bank of commerce warns could lead to overkill benjamin tal cibc s deputy chief economist and his colleague chief economist avery shenfeld took a deeper look at the recent wave of consumer insolvencies which spiked even as the jobs market remained solid indeed as the globe and mail s matt lundy reports the latest numbers showed consumer insolvencies shooting up 13 4 per cent in october from a year earlier to their highest in 10 years insolvency and delinquency rates three quarters moving average insolvency rate left delinquency rate 90 days plus right 14 1 7

insolvencies come in two forms one is traditional bankruptcy and the other what is known as a proposal where a troubled consumer negotiates new debt terms proposals in particular are on the upswing and noted mr tal and mr shenfeld the issue is why are households struggling with payments in the absence of a material weakening in the national labour market mr tal and mr shenfeld said in their report the answer lies in looking at precisely which credit products are experiencing rising write off rates they added citing credit products that saw their rates reset higher after the bank of canada boosted its benchmark in 2018 in turn pushing up prime cases in point include unsecured and secured lines of credit but there s no trend among credit cards whose rates don t move in lockstep with central bank policy the problem lies not with mortgages but rather these other credit types where delinquencies are rising adding it all up there has been a clear trend to increases in the share of balances that are delinquent coming from interest rate sensitive products and much of that climb took place after rate hikes by the bank of canada pushed up prime rates mr tal and mr shenfeld said their findings add to questions over how bank of canada policy will affect consumers elevated debt levels are a big concern for the central bank which will obviously think twice before cutting rates lest it fuel a credit binge next as mr tal and mr shenfeld have shown it will have to be mindful of how past hikes sparked insolvencies if raising the overnight rate to only 1 75 per cent could set off a climb in insolvencies before any major job losses have been seen it s clear that taking rates to anywhere near what was historically neutral or even where some models might currently put neutral could prove to be overkill they said monetary policy will have to look a bit dovish to be only neutral for the economy as a result the point the cibc economists are making mr tal said later is that canadians are more sensitive to higher interest rates than they were before any big wave in delinquencies though would come if unemployment spikes he added the bank of canada had a year ago believed the neutral rate was about 3 per cent mr shenfeld added later but that estimate has been reduced these data on the interest sensitivity of insolvency rates are just one more reason to think that the neutral rate under current household debt levels could be below 2 5 per cent and that the central bank needs to be careful about how quickly we get there he said just as an aside here the growth in home equity lines of credit or helocs has been slowing markedly bank of nova scotia said in a report this week indeed the year over year rise in such credit slowed to 3 per cent in october continuing lower growth for an 11th straight month this came as housing markets perked up said scotiabank deputy chief economist brett house and senior research analyst alena bystrova bank heloc lending took off near the end of 2016 and accompanied an overall decline in housing unit sales as inventories tightened in major markets they said in their report affordability was more challenging then and canadians appear to have opted to continue to borrow to renovate and upgrade existing homes rather than move they added but as housing markets have picked up again in 2019 canadians have reduced their recourse to helocs and instead moved back into mortgage borrowing for new homes read more markets at a glance read more regulatory ban a majority of canada s provincial securities regulators are moving to ban

since the great financial crisis started in 2006 global debt has more than doubled from 125 trillion to 260 trillion the more money that has been printed the lower interest rates have gone in 2006 us short term rates were 5 and between 2008 and 2015 they were zero today they are at 1 5 but at the same time almost 13 trillion global debt stands at negative rates so the world has manufactured 135 trillion debt with the push of a few buttons and at zero cost since 2006 this means that more than 2x annual global gdp has been created at no cost and with no service or goods produced instead fake money has been printed which corresponds to two years global production but no one has done a day s work or manufactured a single product so this money has been created out of thin air hocus pocus creates 1 trillion man days global working population is estimated at 3 billion let s assume on a conservative basis that on average a person works 200 days per year that would make 1 2 trillion man days for two years so central banks and governments can with some hocus pocus do the work of over 1 trillion man days well that certainly beats working and is in line with mmt modern monetary theory which states that countries can print themselves to prosperity well this seems to have worked quite well since the fed was created in 1913 and even more so since 1971 when the debt explosion started in earnest for the ones who have forgotten 1971 was when nixon closed the gold window which allowed central banks to create unlimited money and debt with ai and mmt people are not needed the world is today in the wonderful position that with mmt or modern money trickery we can now replace work with money printing in coming years this could then be taken to its extreme with no one working and no one producing anything except for a number of robots for all the world s needs unlimited money is printed this is the real shangri la and ultimate paradise but is it really because the robots will then take over and get rid of mankind since we will just be superfluous parasites this scenario might be the ultimate outcome of ai artificial intelligence combined with mmt as well as decadence and irresponsible adherence to false economic theories but it is fortunately unlikely to happen in my lifetime the third collapse this century will shock the world here we are at the end of the second decade of this century in the last twenty years we have seen the collapse of a tech bubble and we have experienced the implosion of fake debt aka also known as the sub prime debt collapse central banks have skilfully but deceitfully navigated between scylla and charybdis as in homer s odyssey and managed to avoid the total and final collapse of the system but i doubt they will be third time lucky this time printing unlimited free money will be recognised for what it is namely modern money trickery or wizardry that can t fool the world a third time in the 2000s the effect of that will be that buying the dips will fail this time because stocks will soon start their journey to the bottom which is likely to be at least a 75 fall but more probably a 95 fall in real terms so now as the world discovers that the last 100 years have been an illusion with fake money fake assets and fake debt we are all in for the biggest shock in the financial history of the world half a century of working life i have been fortunate in my working life to experience half of the most remarkable period in the world economy since the fed was created in 1913 2019 has for me personally signified the anniversary of a 50 year working life it is quite an interesting phenomenon that many of the people i meet in my professional life were not even born when i started working i am obviously extremely fortunate to both have the health and the brain which is functioning although there might be some doubters who would dispute that it is obviously incredibly stimulating to work with people who are almost without exception younger than yourself i was born at the end of wwii and have been extremely lucky to not have been involved in any war or not even a depression the 1950s and 1960s were decades with a very high quality of life both morally and ethically as well as economically those were times when economic growth was achieved through hard work high moral standards and without excessive debt financing or money printing in europe there was law and order and no concern about crime or violence only the chinese saw the beginning of the end in 1971 but 15th of august 1971 was going to change everything even though nobody except for the chinese understood it at the time the people s daily in china said in august 1971 these unpopular measures reflect the seriousness of the us economic crisis and the decay and decline of the entire capitalist system the paper went on mark the collapse of capitalist monetary system with the us dollar as its prop nixon s new economic policy cannot extricate the us from financial and economic crisis we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the policy is meant to fleece the american working people and to shift the worsening of the us financial and monetary economic crisis onto other countries it is quite remarkable that the chinese were so clearsighted already back in 1971 but chinese wisdom has stood the test of time in spite of economic and political upheaval they saw what was coming already back then the official chinese gold holdings are just under 2 000 tonnes but according to my sources who have close links with china that figure probably is not more than 1 10th of the actual chinese gold holdings a lot of the chinese gold was stolen by the japanese during the 1930s and wwii but there was still major quantities left in china today china is the largest gold producer in the world by a big margin their annual production is around 450 tonnes it is generally assumed that the total chinese production has been kept by the government for decades china is estimated to have 20 000 tonnes and usa less than half of 8 000t there are rumours in the market that china is planning to announce a gold backed yuan supported by gold holdings in excess of 20 000 tonnes if that were true this would be very supportive for the gold price and also extremely negative for the us dollar the us supposedly has 8 000 tonnes of gold but they have not had a physical audit since the 1950s when eisenhower was president many market experts doubt that the us still has 8 000 tonnes a major part has been leased to bullion banks and is now in china all that the us government has is an iou from a bullion bank that could never return the physical gold some of the us gold has also been sold covertly if china announces a gold backed yuan supported by 20 000 tonnes of gold or more the us will be at pains to prove that they actually hold 8 000 tonnes of gold bull market soon to end the secular bull market has been kept alive with massive money printing combined with financial as well as verbal manipulation of markets it is not easy to kill a secular bull which has survived for centuries fundamentally and technically we are now at the end of the end of this incredible bull market it is ending with a bang and does not have far to go the market could top at any time between the second half of december and first half of january we are not just talking about the us market topping but all stock markets globally even the uk market which is now in a short term euphoria due to the boris johnson election victory there are a number of technical signals both long and short term pointing to this coming top it is the end not only of a multi decade bull market but most probably also a multi century top many historians will write about this in coming years and decades the coming secular bear market will be both spectacular and frightening very few investors are prepared and when it all starts most people will believe that they will be saved by central bank money printing so we will see a lot of bottom fishing in the stock market which will turn out to be many fathoms from the actual bottom anyone buying the dips will end up in tears this time and exacerbate the losses that stock investors will suffer the world will soon experience the start of the most dramatic bear market in history it could start slowly but is more likely to quickly accelerate to ever lower lows with the normal fake out rallies that will suck investors in before the next leg down gold ready to surge when stocks turn down precious metals will surge gold is already up 15 20 in 2019 depending on the currency also gold has made new highs this year in most currencies except for in dollars and swiss francs in 2020 gold will also make new highs in these two currencies gold appreciated rapidly to early september and has since seen a normal correction this correction will soon finish at the latest in early january technically gold could reach 1 425 before it turns up but although possible it seems less likely once the metals turn up silver will be gold on steroids the gold silver ratio will start crashing from 87 currently down to 30 initially where it was in 2011 this means that silver will go up three times as fast as gold but remember that silver is extremely volatile and the corrections will be vicious thus for anyone who intends to buy silver do it now with the gold silver ratio at an extreme your risk will obviously increase significantly when the ratio falls to for example 60 or 50 in the gold and silver markets the combination of strong demand very limited supply a paper market that will blow up and china potentially declaring a gold backed yuan will lead to spectacular gains for the precious metals the worst global depression in history is next so 2020 seems to be the very early beginnings of the worst global depression that the world has ever experienced it will be devastating for everybody we can all prepare financially by holding some physical gold and silver which is the best insurance anyone can buy against what is coming the world is now at the end of a decaying era of free money due to unlimited printing and credit expansion combined with no cost of money but none of this has reached ordinary people but only the wealthy normal people have just ended up with a massive debt both public and private that will never be repaid the world will soon learn that the emperor has no clothes not only is the era of free money over but sadly there will be many unemployed with no benefits no pensions and little protection from the government until now most governments have got out of trouble by printing false and worthless money the difference this time is that a little boy will shout out that the emperor has no clothes and the world will realise that the next round of unlimited money printing will be worthless and have zero value but although the world is now approaching very difficult times there are many more free things than fake money and these things are our best non financial protection against what is coming i am

the brief was revised on jan 13 2020 to remove an outdated return forecast overview state and local public employee retirement systems in the united states manage over 4 3 trillion in public pension fund investments with returns on these assets accounting for more than 60 cents of every dollar available to pay promised benefits about three quarters of these assets are held in what are often called risky assets stocks and alternative investments including private equities hedge funds real estate and commodities 1 these investments offer potentially higher long term returns but their values fluctuate with ups and downs in financial markets in the short term and the broader economy over the long run financial analysts now expect public pension fund returns over the next two decades to be more than a full percentage point lower than those of the past based on forecasts for lower than historical interest rates and economic growth research by the pew charitable trusts shows that since the great recession which started in late 2007 and officially ended in mid 2009 public pension plans have lowered return targets in response to changes in the long term outlook for financial markets see figure 1 pew s database includes the 73 largest state sponsored pension funds which collectively manage 95 percent of all investments for state retirement systems the average assumed return for these funds was 7 3 percent in 2017 down from over 7 5 percent in 2016 and 8 percent in 2007 just before the downturn began more than half of the funds in pew s database lowered their assumed rates of return in 2017 following the steep swings during the recession and in the years immediately afterward these changes reflect a new normal in which forward looking projections of expected economic growth and yields on bonds are lower than those that state pension funds have historically enjoyed reducing the assumed rate of return leads to increases in reported plan liabilities on fund balance sheets which in turn increases the actuarially required employer contributions still making such changes can ultimately strengthen plans financial sustainability by reducing the risk of earnings shortfalls and thus limiting unexpected costs recently many plans have worked to mitigate the higher required contributions that have been prompted by increased liabilities linked to more conservative investment assumptions the present value of future liabilities is typically calculated using the assumed rate of return as the discount rate which is used to express future liabilities in today s dollars lower return assumptions yield higher calculated liabilities some state pension funds have phased in discount rate reductions effectively altering how they compute future liabilities that allows them to spread out increases in contributions over time for example in 2016 the california public employees retirement system calpers the nation s largest public pension plan announced it would decrease its assumed rate of return incrementally from 7 5 percent in 2017 to 7 percent by 2021 2 even such an incremental change can have a significant impact over time a 1 percentage point drop in the discount rate would increase reported liabilities across u s plans by over 500 billion a 12 percent rise as assumed returns have gone down asset mixes have remained largely unchanged for example average allocations to stocks and alternative investments which can provide higher yields but with greater risk complexity and cost have remained relatively stable in recent years at around 50 percent and 25 percent of assets respectively this indicates that most fund managers and policymakers are adjusting their assumed rates of return in response to external economic and market forecasts not based on shifts in internal investment policies this brief updates research published by pew in 2017 and 2018 that provided data on asset allocation performance and reporting practices for funds in all 50 states it explores the impact of continued slow economic growth on investment performance as well as potential management and policy responses to lower returns finally the brief highlights policies and solutions employed by well funded plans including the adoption of lower return assumptions that have helped insulate the plans from economic volatility key terms and concepts assumed rate of return the assumed or expected rate of return is the return target that a pension fund estimates its investments will deliver based on forecasts of economic growth inflation and interest rates the median state pension fund had an assumed rate of return of 7 42 percent in 2017 and the average was 7 33 percent discount rate the discount rate is used to express future pension liabilities in today s dollars most state pension funds determine their discount rate based on their assumed rate of return decreasing a plan s discount rate leads to higher calculated liabilities and higher required annual contribution payments the median state pension fund had a discount rate of 7 25 percent in 2017 and the average was 7 11 percent investment fees investment fees or expenses include any fees that a pension fund pays to professionals to allocate its assets these can be administrative or money management fees and would include any payments for performance or profit sharing arrangements if reported real and nominal returns the real return is the return an investor receives after the rate of inflation is subtracted from the nominal rate real return nominal return inflation risky assets the federal reserve defines safe assets as fixed income investments cash and other cash equivalents e g certificates of deposit risky assets include other investments such as equities stocks private equities hedge funds real estate and commodities that are expected to generate higher returns but expose funds to greater market volatility state pension fund and state pension plan states often sponsor more than one pension plan for participating workers and retirees individual plans within a state are usually divided by the employing government agency plans are tasked with administering pension benefits while state pension funds manage the investment of plan assets slow economic growth projected for the next decade forecasts of lower than historical economic growth and bond yields over the next 10 to 20 years drive the growing consensus among government and industry economists that pension funds will see lower long term investment returns and suggest a new normal for public fund investments for example the u s experienced annual gross domestic product gdp growth of more than 5 5 percent from 1988 through 2007 while the congressional budget office cbo now projects only 4 percent annual growth for the next decade see figure 2 and as economic growth is expected to perform more modestly the long term outlook for stocks and other investments that pension funds hold will be similar returns on bonds which make up about 25 percent of pension fund assets are also projected to be lower than historical averages investment grade bond yields between 1988 and 2007 averaged about 6 5 percent a year but the cbo projects an average of just 3 7 percent annually through the next decade 3 given these trends market experts generally agree that lower investment returns will persist going forward pew forecasts a long term median return of only 6 4 percent a year for a typical pension fund portfolio considering expected gdp growth and interest rates 4 other analysts with similar projections include voya financial advisors 6 4 percent j p morgan and wilshire both 6 5 percent 5 key trend lower assumed returns investment returns make up more than 60 percent of public pension plan revenues employer and employee contributions make up the rest so funds need accurate return assumptions to ensure fiscal sustainability a decade into the recovery states have an opportunity to recalibrate policies to the economy s new normal by adopting return assumptions in line with current projections many plans have lowered their assumed rates of return which also affects discount rates to reflect these economic realities despite the near term budget challenges they may face as contribution requirements rise with lower discount rates for example while only nine of the 73 funds in this study had an assumed rate below 7 5 percent in 2014 by the end of fiscal year 2017 about half had adopted assumed rates below that percentage forty two of the funds reduced their assumed rate in 2017 to better account for lower expected investment returns several states including georgia louisiana michigan and new jersey have followed the example of california s calpers fund by adopting multiyear strategies to ramp down assumed rates over the next several years policymakers may raise concerns about the rise in the present value of pension fund liabilities caused by lowering discount rates the resulting reduction in funded ratios the share of a plan s liabilities matched by assets and the impact of these changes on required contributions for employers and workers however the impact on liabilities reflects accounting not economics ultimately policymakers need to structure retirement systems to ensure fiscal sustainability throughout the economic cycle so members receive promised benefits although pension funds enjoyed robust investment returns in 2017 the median one year return across the 73 funds was 12 8 percent funds continue to underperform relative to their long term return targets for example in 2017 the median return over the prior 10 years was less than 5 5 percent and none of the funds in our data met their investment target over that period states acting to adopt more conservative assumptions states are addressing these concerns recent reforms in connecticut provide an example of how a reduction in discount rates can help mitigate long term risks and avoid short term spikes in contribution requirements the state reduced the discount rates for the connecticut state employees retirement system sers and teachers retirement system trs from 8 percent to 6 9 percent in 2017 and 2019 respectively concurrently policymakers adopted a funding policy that would bring down the unfunded liability and stabilize long term contribution rates 6 finally they extended the time period for the state to pay down the more than 30 billion in pension debt to 30 years and added a five year phase in of the new funding policies collectively these policies helped ensure that the impact of increased employer contributions would only gradually affect the state budget as expected connecticut s changes resulted in an increase in the state s reported pension debt the recent reduction in the discount rate for the trs raised the reported unfunded liability for that system alone from 13 billion to nearly 17 billion but the changes ultimately set the state on a path to pay down that debt in a sustainable manner that increases the state s cost predictability and insulates the pension funds from market volatility indeed rating agency analyses of connecticut s credit have taken a forward looking approach that considers future market risk and long term financial sustainability side by side with the reported funding ratio for example fitch ratings in its analysis of connecticut s 2019 trs reform proposal noted that the fund s previous assumed annual return of 8 percent was an unrealistic target for future investment returns resulting in actuarial contributions that are inadequate to support long term funding improvement thus exposing the state to severe fiscal risk the rating agency noted the change to an expected return of 6 9 percent as a factor that would lower fiscal risks 7 other states have adopted alternative approaches to increase cost predictability and create a margin of safety against inevitable market downturns in california calpers put in place a risk policy in 2015 that incrementally reduces the plan s assumed rate of return and shifts its investment mix to less risky assets each year that funded levels increase because of better than expected returns such policies help gradually reduce risk and increase cost predictability over the long term in a way that doesn t put short term pressure on the state budget 8 the wisconsin retirement system wrs takes an innovative approach to managing risk through return assumptions the wrs long term return assumption for 2017 was 7 2 percent however the plan uses a lower discount rate of 5 percent to calculate the cost of benefits for workers once they retire 9 even if investments fall short of the long term return assumption the amount set aside for each retiree should be enough to pay for the base benefit without additional contributions from taxpayers or current employees and if the returns exceed 5 percent as they now are expected to do the excess will be used to fund an annuity increase similar to a cost of living adjustment the system would not provide such a boost when returns fall below 5 percent 10 finally north carolina effectively uses two discount rates to set contribution policy the state determines a contribution floor based on the plan s investment return assumption of 7 percent as well as a ceiling using yields on u s treasury bonds as a proxy for what a risk free investment could return 11 that risk free rate reflects what a guaranteed investment could deliver state pension plans like most other investors take on risk to earn yields above that rate if the plan is fully funded under the risk free rate then employer contributions would drop to simply pay for the cost of new benefits any year in which the contribution rate is between the floor and the ceiling employers will put in an additional 35 percent of pay above the prior year s rate the policies put in place by calpers wisconsin and north carolina are designed to better ensure that adequate assets are set aside to pay for promised benefits given the fundamental uncertainty of relying on risky investments over a decades long time horizon in addition by lowering their assumed rates of return more than half of state pension funds made it more likely that they ll be able to hit their investment targets in future years as well as adjusting return targets to reflect changing economic conditions funds are looking more closely at the fees they pay investment managers according to the institutional limited partners association ilpa over 140 institutions including many state and local pension funds have moved to increase disclosure and transparency for private equity performance fees also known as carried interest 12 these fees account for approximately 6 billion or 30 percent of all fees u s state and local funds reported paying to investment managers in 2017 management fees make up the rest for state pension funds to accurately report their performance fees private equity managers need to disclose the total price tag to their clients an expectation that these fees would be disclosed only recently emerged across state pension funds although fee levels in aggregate have remained relatively constant as a percentage of assets over the last decade or more some funds have managed significant reductions for example in pennsylvania reported investment expenses as a percentage of assets have declined from 0 81 percent in 2015 to 0 74 percent in 2017 a shift that saves state pension plans more than 57 million annually in reduced fees the state continues to focus on the issue following the recommendations of its public pension management and asset investment review commission 13 lawmakers put the panel in place as part of the 2017 state pension reforms and it has recommended actions projected to offer actuarial savings between 8 billion and 10 billion over 30 years what factors drive projections of lower than historical market returns during the bull markets of the 1980s and 1990s managers of state and local pension funds commonly assumed that over the long term they would earn an average of 8 percent returns or higher on their investments assumptions that were for the most part fair given the prevailing market outlook of that time however years into the post recession recovery of today market experts project lower returns in large part because of lower than historical economic growth and interest rates economic growth is most commonly measured through changes in gdp the aggregate level of goods and services produced in a national economy over a specific time period that measure of growth in turn is reflected in market returns for stocks and the value of equity investments two key factors that spur growth are the size of the workforce and technology driven increases in productivity i e the output per worker gdp growth since the great recession is lower than growth rates experienced during previous recoveries as well as long term historical averages in large part because reduced labor force participation has persisted throughout the recovery despite an unemployment rate that has fallen to its lowest point since the 1960s i e fewer people are in the job market now than in the past 14 labor force participation is expected to decline further and remain below historical levels primarily because the population is aging and productivity increases the other key driver of gdp growth are expected to be modest absent unforeseen significant technological innovations 15 at the same time the amount of interest that government and corporate bonds pay has steadily declined over the past 30 years after the recession the u s entered an unprecedented period of low interest rates with the federal reserve keeping short term rates at or near zero from 2008 to the end of 2015 yields on the 30 year treasury note fell from 8 percent in 1990 to about 3 percent at the end of 2018 and recently have dropped even further looking ahead most experts do not expect a significant rise in interest rates in the near term for several reasons prime among them that inflation has been low the past five years and is forecast to remain below average for the long term 16 factors that typically raise inflation such as wage increases and economic development are not expected to improve rapidly or put significant upward pressure on the cost of goods and services 17 conclusion the economy is expected to grow at a modest rate over the next decade and pension fund investment returns are unlikely to return to historic levels for the foreseeable future in recognition of these trends public plans are increasingly adjusting their return assumptions to rates more in keeping with economic forecasts although reported liabilities will rise because plans are calculating the cost of pension promises using more conservative assumptions the lower assumed rates of return ultimately decrease pension funds investment risk increase pension cost predictability for taxpayers and factor positively in state credit analyses by pairing the reductions in the discount rate with policies to smooth out the cost impact or by adopting such changes as part of broader reform efforts policymakers can moderate the impact on state and local budgets states can adopt policies that provide a margin of safety for pension systems in the likely event of an eventual economic downturn california north carolina and wisconsin provide examples of alternative approaches that can reduce investment risk for public pension funds and government budgets alike appendix to examine investment practices of pension funds across the 50 states pew uses

president trump signed the revised north american trade accord in november 2018 with the then president of mexico enrique peña nieto left and canadian prime minister justin trudeau the house of representatives on thursday overwhelmingly passed the new north american trade deal voting in unusually bipartisan fashion just a day after impeaching president trump strictly on party lines approval of the trade bill which now goes to the senate for almost certain ratification did far more than help trump notch a major achievement it marked a significant change in u s economic strategy toward the rest of the world advertisement for much of the last 70 years throughout the cold war and down to more recent times washington used america s vast wealth and economic power to build friendships and alliances that bolstered national security that strategy included a fundamental commitment to free trade opening the large u s market to products from all over the world for the most part american companies and their workers had to compete against foreign businesses and labor with little or no protection from the federal government as trump has long complained that free trade policy cost millions of american jobs but leaders of both parties and economic experts considered it worth the price because it boosted american growth generating many new jobs and opened new opportunities for many u s companies to profit in a global economy at the same time it helped cement u s leadership in the world advertisement in the post world war ii era we were so much more powerful and so much richer than everybody else that we could improve the living standards at home and still give away the store on trade said clyde prestowitz a former top trade negotiator in president reagan s administration and we re now culminated at a moment in which the cost of our old policy is really hard to bear and so we re de facto changing our policy he said the march toward free global markets with lower tariffs and other barriers always had exceptions beginning in the 1970s u s companies began to complain about unfair competition dumping of textiles and steel by foreign producers subsidized by their governments for instance or the sale of below cost television sets electronics and other consumer goods advertisement reagan and his successors responded to these complaints with demands for import quotas and other measures but overall the united states remained committed to a broad strategy of free trade relying on market forces and competition to determine outcomes while republican business leaders complained about specific instances of what they saw as unfair tactics such as currency manipulation and intellectual property theft they largely remained committed to the overall free trade strategy democrats responding to their union supporters complained that american workers were paying a heavy price for a system that primarily benefited corporations and upper income americans advertisement the original north american free trade agreement which passed the house in 1993 by a margin of only 34 votes highlighted the political unease about trade the agreement however fit squarely into that strategy of using trade in part for geopolitical reasons it aimed to make mexico more prosperous and hence make the united states more secure at a time when radical leftist regimes seemed to be on the rise in latin america economically many saw it as a bulwark against rising competition from a unified europe and asian tiger economies nafta tore down tariffs and shaped north america into a powerful economic bloc three way trade in goods now reaches 1 3 trillion but it was in many ways outdated in a global economy driven much more by technology and data advertisement trump long attacked nafta calling it one of the worst trade agreements ever and promising to renegotiate it as president he has attacked the whole system of free trade undermining the world trade organization which the u s helped create in the 1990s and starting trade wars not only with china but with longtime u s allies such as europe canada and mexico he has enjoyed quiet but significant democratic support on the issue witness the large bipartisan majority for the new version of nafta renamed united states mexico canada agreement or usmca the measure won approval by the democratic majority house 385 41 a remarkable show of unity at a time of deep partisan acrimony advertisement not that there wasn t the usual jostling and one upmanship which have characterized relations between congressional democrats and trump of course we ll take credit for it because what he proposed did not fill the bill of what he described house speaker nancy pelosi said shortly before the vote referring to democrats successful pressure on the administration to amend the trade deal to strengthen enforcement of labor and environmental protections earlier wednesday night at a rally in battle creek mich trump insisted that pelosi and other democrats had no choice but to pass usmca advertisement she had a lot of pressure especially from manufacturing areas farm areas a lot

business groups rare for a trade deal under any circumstances usmca has new chapters on areas like digital trade and e commerce as well as updated rules on auto production and tougher labor enforcement advertisement but the more important parts of the agreement may be those that signal a shift away from the long standing ideology of free trade and toward an embrace of more managed trade the new agreement has quotas on auto exports for example and a provision that allows the u s to pull out of the accord if canada or mexico should cut a free trade deal with a non market economy namely china you re trying to manage the trade not only of your own country but of others it s an imperialistic form of managed trade said james bacchus a former democratic member of congress and ex chairman of the appellate body of the wto the canadians and the mexicans he said have agreed to a lot of these provisions only because they fear the alternative that president trump will pull out of nafta advertisement on the whole usmca is not the kind of sweeping game changing deal that trump often boasted he would produce indeed it was quietly negotiated over many months by just the kind of

advertisement at the same time he was concerned about trump s pull away from open trade and the multilateral trading order established under american leadership early on kantor agreed america did give up markets in order to power some countries because it served larger foreign policy interests but even then trade policy was about much more than that it was jobs economic security and also building bridges to other countries he said so you have multiple reasons for doing it and multiple reasons for going forward because it makes a difference advertisement but said prestowitz the approval of the new agreement illustrates how on both the left and right agreement has grown that the time had come to change u s trade strategy this is bigger than trump he said when american industry is relatively

in the next 24 hours the economic calendar is jam packed with market moving data but whether or not currencies respond to these events remain to be seen there will be 2 monetary policy announcements one in japan and another in the u k employment numbers are also scheduled for release from australia followed by retail sales data from the uk us existing home sales and philadelphia fed index are also on the calendar but these reports should not have much impact on the greenback instead the only currencies that could see big moves are aud gbp and nzd on wednesday the us dollar traded higher against all of the major currencies except for the comm dollars the canadian dollar was the best performer thanks to stronger than expected cpi growth usd cad dropped to its lowest level since october and the strength of today s move signals further losses unfortunately stronger eurozone and uk data failed to lift euro and sterling german businesses grew more confident in the month of december according to the ifo but eur usd rejected the 200 day sma at 1 1150 to trade back towards 1 11 sterling traders shrugged off stronger cpi and took gbp usd lower for the second day in a row while boris johnson s victory brings some relief for the bank of england his adherence to the withdrawal deal and willingness to leave the european union with a deal or not means the uncertainty remains in the last chapter of the brexit drama the eu warned that they could block johnson s brexit deal over the rights of eu citizens there are remaining problems according to guy verhofstadt their brexit coordinator and everyone presumes the european parliament will give automatically its consent to the withdrawal agreement not if the remaining problems with the citizens rights are not solved first mr verhofstadt said on wednesday citizens can never become the victims of brexit meanwhile no changes are expected from the bank of england on thursday but the central bank could hint of 2020 easing inflation is very low having fallen to 1 5 in october and holding there in november this is well short of their 2 target since the last policy meeting manufacturing services and construction sector activity weakened while wage growth slowed although it can be argued that these reports do not incorporate the possible return of business investment and pickup in activity after the uk election the fact that we re talking about no deal again means the boe cannot be complacent because the risks have not abated easing is most likely on the horizon and if the central bank emphasizes low inflation or their slow recovery in their policy statement gbp usd could extend its slide below 1 30 no changes are expected from the bank of japan either but unlike the boe their next move is expected to be a reduction in stimulus japanese policymakers have made it clear that the bar is high for additional easing and the stable yen combined with equity market strength has many economists looking for stronger growth next year tightening is still far away 2021 is more likely than 2020 but further stimulus is not on the horizon the australian dollar will also be in focus with australian labor market numbers due for release this is one of the most market moving economic reports according to the pmis job growth is slowing and if the labor market numbers confirm that they would reinforce the reserve bank s dovish bias aud usd trended lower for the fourth day in a row and according to the rba minutes released this week there s still scope for easing next year the new zealand dollar traded sharply higher on the back of stronger gdp numbers however the positive report was offset slightly by weaker than expected trade data

by don lee los angeles times washington d c the house of representatives on thursday overwhelmingly passed the new north american trade deal voting in unusually bipartisan fashion just a day after impeaching president donald trump strictly on party lines approval of the trade bill which now goes to the senate for almost certain ratification did far more than help trump notch a major achievement it marked a significant change in u s economic strategy toward the rest of the world for much of the last 70 years throughout the cold war and down to more recent times washington used america s vast wealth and economic power to build friendships and alliances that bolstered national security that strategy included a fundamental commitment to free trade opening the large u s market to products from all over the world for the most part american companies and their workers had to compete against foreign businesses and labor with little or no protection from the federal government as trump has long complained that free trade policy cost millions of american jobs but leaders of both parties and economic experts considered it worth the price because it boosted american growth generating many new jobs and opened new opportunities for many u s companies to profit in a global economy at the same time it helped cement u s leadership in the world in the post world war ii era we were so much more powerful and so much richer than everybody else that we could improve the living standards at home and still give away the store on trade said clyde prestowitz a former top trade negotiator in president ronald reagan s administration and we re now culminated at a moment in which the cost of our old policy is really hard to bear and so we re de facto changing our policy he said the march toward free global markets with lower tariffs and other barriers always had exceptions beginning in the 1970s u s companies began to complain about unfair competition dumping of textiles and steel by foreign producers subsidized by their governments for instance or the sale of below cost television sets electronics and other consumer goods reagan and his successors responded to these complaints with demands for import quotas and other measures but overall the united states remained committed to a broad strategy of free trade relying on market forces and competition to determine outcomes while republican business leaders complained about specific instances of what they saw as unfair tactics such as currency manipulation and intellectual property theft they largely remained committed to the overall free trade strategy democrats responding to their union supporters complained that american workers were paying a heavy price for a system that primarily benefited corporations and upper income americans the original north american free trade agreement which passed the house in 1993 by only 34 votes highlighted the political unease about trade the agreement however fit squarely into that strategy of using trade in part for geopolitical reasons it aimed to make mexico more prosperous and hence make the united states more secure at a time when radical leftist regimes seemed to be on the rise in latin america economically many saw it as a bulwark against rising competition from a unified europe and asian tiger economies nafta tore down tariffs and shaped north america into a powerful economic bloc three way trade in goods now reaches 1 3 trillion but it was in many ways outdated in a global economy driven much more by technology and data trump long attacked nafta calling it one of the worst trade agreements ever and promising to renegotiate it as president he has attacked the whole system of free trade undermining the world trade organization which the u s helped create in the 1990s and starting trade wars not only with china but with longtime u s allies such as europe canada and mexico he has enjoyed quiet but significant democratic support on the issue witness the large bipartisan majority for the new version of nafta renamed united states mexico canada agreement or usmca the measure won approval by the democratic majority house 385 41 a remarkable show of unity at a time of deep partisan acrimony not that there wasn t the usual jostling and one upmanship that have characterized relations between congressional democrats and trump of course we ll take credit for it because what he proposed did not fill the bill of what he described house speaker nancy pelosi said shortly before the vote referring to democrats successful pressure on the administration to amend the trade deal to strengthen enforcement of labor and environmental protections earlier wednesday night at a rally in battle creek mich trump insisted that pelosi and other democrats had no choice but to pass usmca she had a lot of pressure especially from manufacturing areas farm areas a lot of pressure to sign it i had a lot of union labor vote for me tremendous amount of labor he said the final trade agreement came with the support of organized labor s main umbrella group and most business groups rare for a trade deal under any circumstances usmca has new chapters on areas like digital trade and e commerce as well as updated rules on auto production and tougher labor enforcement but the more important parts of the agreement may be those that signal a shift away from the long standing ideology of free trade and toward an embrace of more managed trade the new agreement has quotas on auto exports for example and a provision that allows the u s to pull out of the accord if canada or mexico should cut a free trade deal with a nonmarket economy namely china you re trying to manage the trade not only of your own country but of others it s an imperialistic form of managed trade said james bacchus a former democratic member of congress and ex chairman of the appellate body of the wto the canadians and the mexicans he said have agreed to a lot of these provisions only because they fear the alternative that president trump will pull out of nafta on the whole usmca is not the kind of sweeping game changing deal that trump often boasted he would produce indeed it was quietly negotiated over many months by just the kind of professional economists and diplomats that the president often scorns and the negotiations were largely free of the seesawing white house position shifts and twitter storms that have marked trump s trade war with china analysts say trump s chief trade official robert lighthizer deserves credit for rewriting the quarter century old nafta and building a broad coalition to get it done mickey kantor the u s trade representative under president bill clinton who completed the nafta negotiations in 1993 lauded the trump administration for updating nafta and in particular strengthening enforcement at the same time he was concerned about trump s pull away from open trade and the multilateral trading order established under american leadership early on kantor agreed america did give up markets in order to power some countries because it served larger foreign policy interests but even then trade policy was about much more than that it was jobs economic security and also building bridges to other countries he said so you have multiple reasons for doing it and multiple reasons for going forward because it makes a difference but said prestowitz the approval of the new agreement illustrates how on both the left and right agreement has grown that the time had come to change u s trade strategy this is bigger than trump he said when american industry is relatively much less competitive when we ve seen a dramatic increase in the gap between the wealthy and the poor and the middle class in the u s all of that was kind of a perfect stew we re in a new era of trade
argentina s lurch to the left under new president alberto fernandez is proving a bitter pill to swallow for much of the middle class with the wallet draining christmas season in full swing fernandez was swept to power in october s elections on the wave of anti austerity sentiment in a country gripped by an 18 month economic crisis following a currency crash while his victory brought hope that has quickly turned to dismay for many taken aback by a series of taxes imposed on the us dollar the currency argentines favor for their savings on tuesday economy minister martin guzman announced a 30 percent levy on foreign currency purchases to protect highly vulnerable sectors social media is abuzz with indignation over the authoritarian measure which is already scheduled for debate in the chamber of deputies argentina s lower congressional chamber hundreds demonstrated outside congress on wednesday shouting yes we can liberal ex president mauricio macri s campaign slogan popularized by barack obama ahead of the 2008 us election on twitter critics denounced left wing policies they fear will drag argentina down the road hugo chavez took venezuela which has suffered one of the worst economic collapses outside of war in modern history alberto s going for the chavist model concentration of power political absolutism high taxes asphyxiating the middle classes and the productive sector tweeted gregorio hernandez a provincial political leader one of the most controversial moves is the return of what argentines call the tourist dollar a 30 percent tax is being applied on purchases made abroad by credit card as well as withdrawals made in foreign countries services such as netflix and spotify are also affected by the tax i booked a foreign trip many months ago this 30 percent tax makes it difficult to stick to my budget as well as not being able to use cards during the trip said kindergarten teacher nathalie goldstein 24 who saved up for a year to travel to barcelona it is not the first time an argentine government has imposed such measures vice president cristina kirchner did something similar during her second presidential term from 2011 15 before macri canceled the policy economic analyst and newspaper columnist manuel adorni accused the government of lying in a bid to convince the least affluent that the tourist dollar will only affect the richest and that it will benefit them without realizing that they will get poorer with the peso trading at 63 to the dollar the tourist rate will cost argentines around 80 pesos a year and a half ago the exchange rate was 18 to the dollar aldo elias president of argentina s chamber of tourism blasted a very bad measure he said it puts at risk the work sources of almost 5 000 tourism businesses and predicted that airlines would leave argentina if the number of tourists heading abroad dries up however ernesto oldenburg a restaurant owner in lobos a city around 70 miles 115 kilometers from buenos aires says the measure is an incentive for local based tourism he expected more holiday makers from buenos aires to head to lobos s popular lagoon he said most argentines keep their savings in dollars and much of that is held outside the country to protect from a peso that has proved highly unstable but the 30 percent tax will also be applied to savings in a bid to prevent a currency flight according to the central bank argentines are holding 43 7 billion outside the country but that s 19 billion less than last year no one trusts the peso a 51 year old housewife told afp argentina s currency has lost almost 40 percent of its value during the last year argentina s economy is expected to shrink by around 3 1 percent in 2019 as inflation hovers around 55 percent poverty near 40 percent and unemployment rising to 10 5 percent it remains to be seen how argentines will react after the government increased taxes on agricultural exports the confederation of rural argentines announced plans to protest
with china taking the global climate change lead after the trump administration formally began the year long process of pulling out of the paris agreement the country s tax policies which heavily subsidize the hydrocarbon industry might need some rethinking china s leadership role in the digital payment area is not surprising it includes establishing the world s first blockchain based central bank issued digital currency called dcep stablecoins and a mobile payment system after all china pioneered the issuance of paper money during the tang dynasty a d 618 907 which finally caught on in europe and the united states during the 17th century this still remains at the foundation of the modern economy world s first central bank issued digital currency called dcep the chairman of the china international economic exchange center huang qifan explained they have been working on dcep for five to six years now and he is fully confident it can be introduced within the next few months by the people s bank of china pboc first to seven institutions and then to the general public in 2020 dcep s partial blockchain based design will provide pboc with unprecedented oversight over money flows giving them a degree of control over the chinese economy that most central banks do not have dcep will be pegged 1 1 to the chinese national currency the renminbi rmb with the overall objective that it will eventually become a dominant global currency like the us dollar it will not be possible to mine or stake on the dcep network stablecoins despite concerns from g 7 and g 20 regulators tether recently launched an offshore renminbi rmb pegged stable coin dubbed cnht after launching a u s dollar pegged stablecoin steven mnuchin secretary of the u s treasury supports the launch of stablecoins including facebook s libra as long as u s financial rules are followed eu finance ministers on the other hand have banned the launch of stablecoins in the region until the bloc has a common approach to regulation users all over the world are able to earn stablecoins by mining blockchain based mobile payment system recently chinese president xi jinping called on the country s tech community to accelerate efforts in blockchain adoption and passed a cryptography law so far china dominates in global blockchain patents and according to a study conducted by the central committee of the political bureau of the communist party of china there are over 700 blockchain companies in china but according to the pboc the number of chinese black market blockchain companies are about 40 times higher 28 000 with 25 000 of these companies issuing their own crypto assets valued at over 110 billion yuan 15 billion crypto assets can be earned by mining even on cell phones for good and bad mobile

market with 1 5 billion users cryptoasset mining inspired by its new focus on blockchain china is committed to staying a global leader in cryptocurrency mining and keeping its massive mining farms in business the specialized computers used for the cryptocurrency mining activity which china manufactures most of in the world consume large amounts of electricity mostly fueled with coal that has been fundamental to china s paralleled economic growth china burns about half the coal used globally each year between 2000 and 2018 its annual carbon emissions nearly tripled and it now accounts for about 30 of the world s total china emerged as the world s top co2 polluter country starting in 2017 when cryptocurrencies experienced an unprecedented global bubble and continues to maintain this ranking to date china currently accounts for roughly 60 of global hashrate down from a previously estimated high of 90 in 2017 of global bitcoin mining inner mongolia home to the world s largest ordos solar power plant together with xinjiang and sichuan constitute the big three bitcoin mining bases in china all three provinces also have the worst air quality susanne ko hler and massimo pizzol at aalborg university in denmark found that coal heavy inner mongolia accounted for 12 3 of bitcoin mining but resulted in more than a quarter of the total co2 emissions which has only increased since countries signed on to the paris agreement according to the emissions gap report by the un environment program this is despite the fact that during the past 25 years china went from having virtually no solar panels to leading the world by a margin of more than 100 it surpassed germany to become the world s largest producer of photovoltaic power based on its 2011 five year plan for energy production in 2015 and in 2017 became the first country to surpass the 100 gw of installed capacity estimates from market intelligence business wood mackenzie sees china s photovoltaic panel installations hit a cumulative total of 370 gwdc by 2024 more than double the u s s capacity at that point during the past 10 years china ranked number one in terms of the sums invested in renewable energy capacity by committing 758 billion between 2010 and the first half of 2019 with chinese companies emerging as technology leaders in green transport and energy as well as digital infrastructure currently china accounts for around 24 of global investments in renewables with investment in solar and wind projects in bri countries surging from 0 45gw to 12 6 gw during 2014 to 2019 according to environmental group greenpeace according to an energy transitions commission etc report it is technically and economically feasible for china to become a fully decarbonized decentralized digitalized green economy by reaching a net zero carbon emissions by mid century solar is expected to comprise 44 of all renewable capacity additions until 2040 according to the international energy agency s iea world energy outlook report because subsidy free solar projects could be built not only in most chinese cities at a significantly cheaper price than coal hydropower nuclear and other grid fed generation sources according to a study led by researchers at sweden s mälardalen university but also in the nations covered by bri according to a study from tsinghua university and harvard university however the reality is wind and solar only accounted for 5 2 and 2 5 of china s national power generation in 2018 respectively and during may the chinese national energy administration nea announced it would stop providing subsidies for onshore renewable energy projects which must now compete directly at auction with other forms of power generation solar energy has to further compete with the thick grey chinese air pollution which dims sunlight by 13 for solar electricity generation according to studies renewable energy investment in china has already dropped by 39 in the first half of 2019 when compared to a year earlier and starting january 1 2020 the pricing of electricity will undergo a seismic change which may impact the competitiveness of renewable energy pricing by favoring coal china s space power satellites sps china is very serious about the idea of building solar energy projects in space to beam the sun s energy back to earth to fundamentally reshape the way grids receive electricity if scientists can overcome the formidable technical and economical challenges sps projects could represent a monumental leap in combating china s addiction to coal power sources which worsen air pollution and global warming pang zhihao a researcher from the china academy of space technology corporation described it as an inexhaustible source of clean energy for humans china s solar power station plans being contemplated include to launch small solar power stations in the stratosphere to generate electricity between 2021 and 2025 followed by a space based solar power station that could generate at least a megawatt of electricity in 2030 and a commercial scale solar power plant in space by 2050 a receiving station will be built in xian the regional space hub to develop the world s first sps power farm the china national space agency cnsa has been collaborating with india space research organization isro in fields like lunar and deep space exploration on jan 2 2019 china made the historic first landing on the far side of the moon the milestone marked a turning point for china s space exploration and may factor into china s sps ambitions china s tax policies china is the world s most populous country the world s largest producer of solar power the number one in co2 emissions and the highest coal consumer it is number two in the consumption of oil products and number three in natural gas consumption it taxes 8 of co2 emissions from energy use according to the imf china ranks number one in subsidies to the hydrocarbon industry at 1 4 trillion and is third in the world in terms of total coal reserves behind the u s and russia fossil subsidies are used as a tool to influence the energy mix and energy prices in china as well as in coal fueled electricity plants across bri countries it heavily lends and invests in conclusion it is undeniable that china the world s largest producer of solar energy is taking the lead in providing the world with a new blockchain based mobile payment system that is energy intensive and is being adopted globally via the bri with china taking the global climate change lead after the u s trump administration formally began the year long process of pulling out of the paris agreement the country s tax policies which heavily subsidize the hydrocarbon industry might need some rethinking references popular content

contraction if trade conditions worsen 2 u s economy expansion for those left behind the u s economy will enter 2020 decisively split powered by a resilient and confident consumer but hamstrung by a risk averse business sector that has stopped investing now that stimulus effects from the 2017 tax reform and the 2018 spending bill have faded the economic expansion will show its age losing steam in

stimulating their economies with negative interest rates and quantitative easing after three rate cuts in 2019 the u s federal reserve is holding a more conservative stance with its target rate near 1 5 china has the most room to maneuver with its short term rate just under 3 all these accommodative stances are made possible because inflation remains inexplicably low despite tightening labor markets federal reserve chair powell s role in 2020 is to keep the late stage expansion going while simultaneously preparing for the recession that will arrive sooner or later 4 u s government policy

well here we are again at the end of another year and the bond market continues to mystify economists yet it still remains an important market to watch in the effort to get a sense of what investors are looking at in december 2018 i wrote that i expected that bond market interest rates would fall in 2019 when the article was written the yield on the 10 year treasury was around 2 95 percent and the yield on the 2 year treasury was around 2 82 percent there was the real concern that the yield curve was going to go negative which it did and the economy would slow down and inflation would not rise especially since there were things going on in the oil market pointing to lower oil prices furthermore it appeared as if economic growth in the world was going to slow down and this would add further pressure for bond yields to decline further and the suggestion was to keep an eye on the bond market in 2019 to see if these factors worked out well rates did fall and although a good portion of the yield curve up through the seven year maturity was negative for a good part of the year no us recession was observed economic growth for the year averaged around 2 2 percent year over year but there was no falling off of the rate of growth during the year at the end of 2018 the federal reserve was still expected to raise its policy rate of interest throughout the year i wrote in that december article â the federal reserve intends to raise its policy rate again in december and there is some possibility that the fed will raise its rate one to three more times in 2019 â well so much for that the federal reserve actually reduced its policy rate of interest three times during 2019 my interpretation of the fedâ s action during this year the eurozone economies were doing badly enough during the year that the european central bank began to ease up again and moved its policy rate of interest down the federal reserve felt it had to cut its policy rate of interest in order to protect against the value of the us dollar getting too strong and hurting trade which would hurt economic growth last year when at this time the value of the us dollar index dxy was at 97 15 and even more importantly given it was the ecb making the interest rate moves the euro cost around 1 13 to 1 14 right now the us dollar index is at 97 39 and one euro now costs only a little over 1 11 during the year the us dollar index increased to a peak of 99 38 in september and the cost of a euro dropped to 1 09 also in september if the federal reserve had not dropped its policy rate of interest the question becomes how much stronger would the us dollar have become one other factor was also important for the us bond market in 2019 and this was the increased market uncertainty due to talks about a trade war between the us and china that took place during the year lots and lots of â risk averseâ international money flowed into safe havens around the world with the us markets being one of the largest recipients of these monies these flows reduce the whole level of interest rates the yield on the 5 year us treasury inflation protected securities tips went negative between early july and early october the yield on the 10 year tips were negative between the middle of august and early september when these flows take place the yields on the tips usually drop off while the amount of inflationary expectations built into the nominal treasury yield remains relatively constant this is what occurred during the time period being examined these flows consequently added to the decline in the general level of interest rates associated with the moves made by the fed to lower its policy rate note that if the fed had not lowered the interest rate the value of the us dollar would have been even stronger due to all the â risk averseâ monies flowing into the â safe havenâ of us markets right now the yield on the 10 year treasury note is around 1 90 percent while the yield on the 2 year note is near 1 65 percent you can note that the term structure is now quite positive the fear of a recession in the united states has lessened and the general feeling is that the us economy will grow around 2 0 percent in 2020 furthermore the unemployment rate at a fifty year low will also remain near this level concern still exists about the strength of the eurozone economies the hopes are that europe will continue to recover without further easing on the part of the ecb however this is not altogether clear especially with great britainâ s boris johnson pushing the imposition of brexit on the world several officials from the federal reserve have given speeches in recent days that they see no reason to change interest rates in the near future how much of this talk is real is the question federal reserve officials i think would not like to move interest rates down any further and so they are hoping that europeâ s economies will grow faster this year also in recent days there is hope that trade tensions have been lessened due to the agreement reached between the us and the chinese if true this should diminish some of the uncertainty that has overshadowed the financial markets recently if this is the case then yields on us treasury securities should rise in 2020 action over the past month may be just a picture of this happening the yield on the 10 year tips has remained relatively steady indicating that the foreign flow of â risk averseâ funds have stabilized while inflationary expectations built into the 10 year nominal yield have risen by 15 basis points from about 1 60 percent to 1 75 percent i donâ t see the yield on the 10 year treasury note returning to the 2 95 percent level it was at last year but i think some movement toward 2 50 percent may be in the works for the year again as i have suggested for the past several years keep an eye on the bond market a lot of investor sentiment is captured in this space and it is very important to understand what is going on here in order to better understand what is happening elsewhere in the financial markets as well as what is happening in the economy

by lance roberts a recent peter g peterson foundation poll as reported by the financial times revealed a statistic that we have suspected for quite some time to wit nearly two thirds of americans say this year s record setting wall street rally has had little or no impact on their personal finances calling into question whether one of the strongest bull markets in a decade will boost donald trump s re election chances a poll of likely voters for the financial times and the peter g peterson foundation found 61 percent of americans said stock market movements had little or no effect on their financial well being 39 percent said stock market performance had a very strong or somewhat strong impact the survey suggested most americans are not aware of market movements with just 40 percent of respondents correctly saying the stock market had increased in value in 2019 42 percent of likely voters said the market was at about the same levels as at the start of the year while 18 percent believed it had decreased another article by shawn langlois via marketwatch revealed much the same discussing a recent publication from the economic policy institute that study also revealed the increasingly inadequate retirement savings of americans as well as the dispersion of wealth among income earners as shawn penned the big gap between the mean retirement savings of 120 809 and the median retirement savings is yet another example of how the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer in this country this isn t anything new we have been reporting on this issue over the last few years and just recently dug into current details in our discussion on the savings rate to wit the calculation of disposable personal income which is income less taxes is largely a guess and very inaccurate due to the variability of income taxes paid by households more importantly the measure is heavily skewed by the top 20 of income earners and even more so by the top 5 as shown in the chart below those in the top 20 have seen substantially larger median wage growth versus the bottom 80 note all data used below is from the census bureau and the irs the reality is the majority of americans are struggling just to make ends meet which has been shown in a multitude of studies the survey found that 58 percent of respondents had less than 1 000 saved gobankingrates com such levels of financial savings are hardly sufficient to support individuals through retirement much less leave enough savings to actively participate in the booming stock market such confirms the peterson study that the longest bull market in history has largely bypassed a vast majority of americans it also confirms why after a decade long bull market that a rising trend of individuals over the age of 55remain in the workforce growing numbers of u s boomers currently 55 to 73 are working beyond the traditional retirement age going back to school and choosing to age in place in familiar neighborhoods instead of moving to senior communities for the first time in history there are multiple generations alive together for long stretches of time it s not that boomers don t want to retire it s because they can t afford to the expanding problem despite central bank s best efforts globally to stoke economic growth by pushing asset prices higher the effect has been entirely consumed by those with actual savings and discretionary income available to invest in other words the stock market has become an almost exclusive club for the elite while monetary policies increased the wealth of those that already have wealth the fed has been misguided in believing that the trickle down effect would be enough to stimulate the entire economy we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us it hasn t the sad reality is that these policies have only acted as a transfer of wealth from the middle class to the wealthy and created one of the largest wealth gaps in human history via forbes the top 10 of the wealth distribution the purple and green areas together hold a large and growing share of u s aggregate wealth while the bottom half the thin red area hold a barely visible share fed economists write in a paper outlining the new data set on inequality which is more timely than exisiting statistics the chart show that while the total net worth of u s households has more than quadrupled in nominal terms since 1989 this increase has clearly accrued more to the top of the distribution than the bottom lack of capital the current economic expansion is already the longest post wwii expansion on record of course that expansion was supported by repeated artificial interventions rather than stable organic economic growth as noted while the financial markets have soared higher in recent years it has bypassed a large portion of americans not because they were afraid to invest but because they have no capital to invest with the ability to simply maintain a certain standard of living has become problematic for many which forces them further into debt the debt surge is partly by design a byproduct of low borrowing costs the federal reserve engineered after the financial crisis to get the economy moving it has reshaped both borrowers and lenders consumers increasingly need it companies increasingly can t sell their goods without it and the economy which counts on consumer spending for more than two thirds of gdp would struggle without a plentiful supply of credit wsj i often show the gap between the standard of living and real disposable incomes beginning in 1990 incomes alone were no longer able to meet the standard of living so consumers turned to debt to fill the gap however following the financial crisis even the combined levels of income and debt no longer fill the gap currently there is almost a 2600 annual deficit that cannot be filled note this deficit accrues every year which is why consumer credit keeps hitting new records the debt to income problem keeps individuals from building wealth and government statistics obscure the basic reality we discussed this point in detail in dimon s view of economic reality is still delusional the median net worth of households in the middle 20 of income rose 4 in inflation adjusted terms to 81 900 between 1989 and 2016 the latest available data for households in the top 20 median net worth more than doubled to 811 860 and for the top 1 the increase was 178 to 11 206 000 put differently the value of assets for all u s households increased from 1989 through 2016 by an inflation adjusted 58 trillion a third of the gain 19 trillion went to the wealthiest 1 according to a journal analysis of fed data on the surface things look pretty good but if you dig a little deeper you see different subpopulations are not performing as well said cris deritis deputy chief economist at moody s analytics wsj the one problem the fed can t fix the problem with the fed s ongoing liquidity interventions is that they continue to benefit those in the top 20 of population which exacerbates the wealth gap between them and everyone else importantly the current gap between household net worth and gdp is the greatest on record and those previous gaps were filled by reversions with the most painful of outcomes while such a reversion in net worth will have the majority of its impact at the upper end of the income scale it will be the job losses through the economy that will further damage and already ill equipped population in their prime saving and retirement years compound that problem with the massive amount of corporate debt which if it begins to default will trigger further strains on the financial and credit systems of the economy the reality is that the u s is now caught in the same liquidity trap as japan with the current economic recovery already pushing the long end of the economic cycle the risk is rising that the next economic downturn is closer than not the danger is that the federal reserve is now potentially trapped with an inability to use monetary policy tools to offset the next economic decline when it occurs combine this with a decline in savings rates to extremely low levels which depletes productive investments to extremely low levels which depletes productive investments an aging demographic that is top heavy and drawing on social benefits at an advancing rate that is top heavy and drawing on social benefits at an advancing rate a heavily indebted economy with debt gdp ratios above 100 with debt gdp ratios above 100 a decline in exports due to a weak global economic environment due to a weak global economic environment slowing domestic economic growth rates an underemployed younger demographic an inelastic supply demand curve weak industrial production dependence on productivity increases to offset reduced employment while the stock market may be an exclusive club for its members currently the combined issues of debt deflation and demographics is a problem the fed can t fix it isn t a question of if it is simply a function of when the next crisis will repair the wealth gap to some degree only because 2

by marc frank havana dec 19 reuters the cuban government has ramped up moves of late to eliminate the communist run country s dual monetary system a step many analysts say may take place in 2020 what is cuba s currency system the two currencies circulating in cuba s state run economy are the peso and the convertible peso cuc pegged to the dollar the currencies are exchanged at various rates 1 to 1 for state owned businesses 24 pesos for 1 cuc for the public and others for joint ventures wages in island s special development zone and transactions between farmers and hotels cuba legalized the dollar and created the labyrinthine system as part of a package of measures to open up its economy after the collapse of former benefactor the soviet union while trying to cushion the blow to citizens and national industry while the system helped cuba get through the shock of the soviet collapse it ended up also distorting the economy and hiding the real economic situation productivity and competitiveness of state run companies and favoring imports instead of exports adios to convertible peso the government says it will eliminate the convertible peso and leave the peso as the only currency and has already taken important steps in that direction larger peso bills denominated at 200 500 and 1 000 are now in circulation previously 100 pesos was the highest denomination thousands of state run retail outlets now price items in pesos as well as cuc and cash registers and card swipers are programmed for both currencies in november cuba banned the import and export of convertible pesos and began charging travelers in tradable currencies at airports once past the gate in december the government began giving change at some stores only in pesos hello dollar cuba banned the dollar as legal tender in 2003 after the united states hiked sanctions on its use of the greenback but in october the government began opening stores that sell appliances car parts and other items for dollars though only with a bank card raising the possibility the u s currency will be used at least electronically once the convertible peso is taken out of circulation that could end the state s prior practice of importing appliances and other goods with tradable currency and selling them in local currency useless for purchasing more imports risks bringing the fixed official 1 1 and 1 24 public exchange rates more in line with each other and their true value will be difficult especially given the government s pledge that consumers will not be hurt an impossibility according to many local and foreign economists they say fixing the exchange rates will inevitably cause inflation and reveal just how unproductive and bankrupt many state run companies are leading to layoffs the government counters it will freeze prices increase wages and take other measures to insure the social dislocation common in other developing nations when they experience monetary policy failure does not occur claiming its planned economy allows for a different outcome reporting by marc frank editing by alistair bell marc frank thomsonreuters com 537 833 3145 reuters messaging marc frank thomsonreuters com reuters net the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc

target the monetary policy committee said in a summary of its decision however the mpc vote was somewhat more hawkish than expected with some economists anticipating that six of the committee s nine members would vote for a cut in interest rates up from two the last time around all told we still think that interest rates are much more likely to rise next year than to fall said samuel tombs chief uk economist at pantheon macroeconomics but as both the identity of the next governor and the willingness of the pm to sacrifice the economy to achieve brexit by his timetable are unknown the outlook for monetary policy remains exceptionally cloudy thursday s rate announcement came after the times reported that hedge funds had been eavesdropping on the central bank s press conferences before they were officially broadcast after its internal systems were hijacked according to reuters the central bank had referred the misuse of its press conference audio feed to the financial conduct authority investors were also digesting news overnight that the house of representatives voted to impeach us president donald trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of congress the process would now pass to the senate where 67 out of 100 votes are required to convict and remove trump from office it is a sign of the times when the impeachment of the president of the united states produces nothing but a shrug said neil wilson chief market analyst at markets com by becoming only the third president in history to be impeached mr trump joins a select club markets simply don t care wilson quipped that the republican controlled senate would never abandon their president the impeachment process has and remains so partisan that mr trump will not be removed from office on the trade front china

question dear amstrong thank you for all the training you have been teaching us for years even though i have gone through 3 universities and have special titles in economics and finance only after accompanying you for these 15 years i could understand a little of the true world in which we live i have two points that i would like you to please update us on one about the serious problems in emerging economies that you have been constantly warning us about and the other about the real estate market in which you anticipated it would only gain momentum after 2032 according to your cycle chart attached about the brics i am seeing the brazilian economy making a major restructuring in public spending decreasing social security spending and other measures that have improved the accounts and greatly increased confidence millions of dollars are flowing into real estate with an appetite i haven t seen in a long time what is your opinion about these flows will real estate grow vigorously or not i see that funds like blackstone etc are creating thousands of funds for real estate are we going to have now another boom in real estate in brasil and all world how does this fit in with your constant predictions and analyzes you have been predicting that the capital available to finance new homes would decrease but i see it has been growing absurdly you have repeatedly stated that low interest rates for a long time were destroying pension funds however i do not see usa popular uprising after 11 years with rates close to zero which combined with hidden inflation certainly lost more than half of purchasing power i see brazil obsessed with lowering the interest rate more and more on the grounds that it will stimulate the economy i found that this drop in rates boosted real estate sales certainly capital is seeking better rates of return in real estate than in the bank how do these apparent divergences confront your analysis and predictions thank you for your continued help please help me get out of this big conflict in my head between the real world that i am seeing and your statements sp answer there is a huge difference between lowering the interest rate in a third world economy that has risen sharply because of a lack of confidence and lowering interest rates artificially to below zero interest rates follow a bell curve they are not linear raising interest rates to stop inflation is the first part of the curve if capital loses confidence in a country then the economy turns down and interest rates rise further because of risk this is illustrated above with the divergence this was the position of brazil you are also making the presumption that the efforts in brazil will be successful simply because that is their public opinion there has been no bullish reversal elected on a monthly level in the brazilian bond markets so you are talking about anticipation central banks make all sorts of statements because they know it is a confidence game that does not mean things will unfold as they proclaim the central bank of brazil voted unanimously to trim its key selic rate by 50 bps to 4 50 during its december meeting it was the fourth consecutive rate cut bringing borrowing costs to its lowest on record this keynesian economics plan is neither negative nor experimental as the negative rates in europe and japan brazil is lowering rates because of the global economic slowdown in hopes that it will help the domestic economy recover which it has not just yet brazil is not following europe and that said any further lowering of rates will be data dependent higher rates add to inflation through the cost of financing the peak in rates was 45 back in march of 1999 and a record low of 4 50 in december of 2019 you seem to have a lot of faith in central banks being able to manipulate the economy that is your conflict you believe them too much the average person in the usa is not going to rise up because of pensions until it starts impacting more people social security covers only about 40 of the average person s retirement cost there is only about 407 billion in state local pension funds the total amount people have put into private 401 k plans is about 6 5 trillion the unfunded state and local liabilities now exceed 6 trillion up to now the bulk of the pension crisis has been in the public sector not private it has begun to spread to some large companies if you expect everyone to start rioting before it even hits them i think you are being unrealistic major companies are already freezing pensions but this is impacting unions so far for the first time you have organizations forming because of pension freezes illinois is going bankrupt because its supreme court ruled they cannot renegotiate public pensions there has been an open discussion that they should just dissolve illinois because they cannot default on the pensions calpers of california has politicians looking to usurp all private pension in california and hand them to calpers to save public pensions calpers has been lobbying in washington for such authority to seize even 401k plans of private individuals there are many starting to look at calpers they have dubbed the pension fund that ate california real estate real estate is a leveraged market in many economies each market will depend upon what extent the real estate is leveraged the problem is that real estate has is this dependency upon bank lending if banks refuse to lend long term then real estate collapses to the degree of leverage the average market remains well below the 2007 high the high end market rallied in particular areas where foreign capital was moving in to escape places elsewhere so you saw new highs in vancouver miami new york la and london just to mention a few this was not the trend outside of those cities in the regional markets so do not confuse the regional centers with the targets of foreign capital high end sectors also you better understand the leverage the critical factor is that when confidence in the long term collapses banks will not lend long term so to sell a place will require a cash buyer i just had a friend who bought a place that had been sold for 7 million in 2007 which he bought at auction for 2 6 million because there were no buyers in a regional market buying up real estate for cash in these brics is all currency based i have explained that in 1985 when the british pound fell to 1 03 the americans were buying up everything for the country was on sale like at harrods the brits thought we were crazy for paying high prices in pounds but the foreign investors were coming in with dollars this will be the same in the brics as the dollar moves even higher it is the real estate markets in usa and europe where taxes are rising and lending will become questionable not cash deals in the brics the attempts of brazil to reform are in line with the economic confidence model turn on january 18 2020 the next cycle should be one where commodities begin to rise mainly between 2022 and 2024

construction to commence the operational licence will be granted subsequent to confirmation that the plant and infrastructure have been designed in accordance with the licences the dfs is a key milestone and the company can immediately advance project finance discussions with the assistance of araujo fontes their financial advisor in brazil _________________________________________________________________________________ big river gold ltd asx brv company or big river wishes to advise that the definitive feasibility study dfs on the development of a 2 0 mtpa operation at the borborema project located in northeastern brazil has been completed by managing engineers wave international ltd borborema is 100 owned by big river through

wave international ltd wave who also undertook the process and infrastructure design with key contributions from gruppo ge21 mine design and scheduling integratio social and community aspects and testwork undertaken by als laboratories outotec and sgs the dfs built on previous studies and work completed by tetratech ausenco and others with the completion of the dfs and lom cashflow model the company is now in the position of advancing discussions with several financial institutions that have expressed interest in providing project finance and were awaiting the finalised cashflow model that will commence immediately with the assistance of araujo fontes brv s financial advisors in brazil chairman stephen copulos noted the definitive feasibility study represents an excellent outcome resulting from the work of many dedicated people and teams the reduction in operating costs and containment of capital estimates compared with previous studies provides a strong basis for profitability over the next 10 years at least the company s strategy is now to secure financing investigate opportunities that may further reduce costs and construction time and accelerate the

steps implementation the implementation schedule for the project indicates a construction period of 23 months subject to the conclusion of financing arrangements big river believes this to be conservative and the lag time between completion of the dfs and securing finance is an opportunity to investigate critical tasks that impact the execution schedule these tasks can be undertaken for relatively low cost which the company is in a position to fund and have the potential to reduce the execution schedule and costs in moving forward big river plans to appoint and relocate a project director to currais novos to oversee implementation value engineering completion of remaining contracts and construction of the project complete contracts and design for supply of waste water and power appoint general manager for borborema operations secure debt financing issue contracts for procurement and fabrication of plant commercial opportunities in terms of mica by products will continue to be investigated with metallurgical testwork and market assessment through anzaplan in germany to assess the potential for saleable quality product if proven viable potentially significant revenues could be added for relatively little cost it would require some amendments to the process design but provision has been made for that in the design funding the staged development plan aims to minimise initial capital operating expenditures and funding requirements whilst generating revenue it also provides an avenue for a rapid payback period of only 2 4 years following commencement of commissioning the project s financial economic and marketing metrics are robust with good operating margins and the reported mineral resource and ore reserve has the potential to deliver a production opportunity over at least 10 years in addition the project s location in brazil is within a mature low sovereign risk mining jurisdiction funding in the order of 118m is required to commence production and achieve the outcomes indicated in the dfs this includes capital works contingency mine pre production costs and other working capital requirements the company s board and management have a successful track record of obtaining finance for the exploration evaluation and development of mineral resource projects this includes the posse iron ore mine in brazil which the company brought into production in 2014 and operated before selling the project in 2017 more recently in june 2019 the company successfully completed an entitlement offer to raise 4 12m before costs which provided funds to complete the dfs and sold non core assets to establish a cash reserve which currently stands at approximately us 3 13m a 4 6m the company is currently assessing whether the current cash reserves may be applied to investigating aspects of the pre production costs and optimising the project development plan to reduce capital and operating costs and shorten the construction timeline it is anticipated that the finance will be sourced from a combination of equity and debt instruments from existing shareholders new equity investment and debt providers from australia and overseas the board and management believe that a debt equity ratio upwards of 70 30 is potentially achievable for the project the company s aim is to avoid dilution to existing shareholders to the greatest extent possible as previously announced the company has engaged araujo fontes as their financial advisors to source debt and equity options in brazil with the completion of the dfs their discussions with funding partners 4 can now be advanced significantly in addition the company has been approached by a number of australian and overseas banks and institutions to discuss various funding options and structures for the reasons outlined above the board believes there is a reasonable basis to assume that funding to develop the project will be available as and when required however investors should note there is no certainty that the company will be able to raise the amount of funding required to develop the project when needed it is also possible that such funding may only be available on terms that may be dilutive or otherwise affect the value of the company s shares or that the company may pursue other value realisation strategies such as a sale partial sale or

definitive feasibility study summary the borborema project overview borborema is located in the seridó area of the borborema province in north eastern brazil it is 100 owned by big river through its wholly owned subsidiary cascar and consists of three mining leases covering a total area of 29 km2 including freehold title over the main prospect area big river owns the freehold land for the area considered by the mine plant and infrastructure within the dfs the main environmental and installation permits have also been granted by the relevant government authorities which will allow construction of the project to commence subject to financing there is little or no competing land use in the region with low density cattle and goat farming as the only other commercial activities the immediate project area is not populated and there are no indigenous tribes in the area the project benefits from a favourable taxation regime existing on site facilities and excellent infrastructure

stockpile capacity of approximately 12 000 t via reclaim front end loader fel and emergency stockpile transfer conveyor to the sag mill feed conveyor the sab circuit design has been selected to produce a p80 106 μm product with a throughput rate of 254 t h the sag mill will be equipped with a variable speed drive and the ball mill with fixed speed drive the design allows for a cyclone underflow return line from the mill cyclone cluster to the sag mill feed to allow the circuit to operate as a single stage sag mill when the ball mill is unavailable the estimated throughput rate in single stage sag mode is 112 t h at the 106μm product grind size a configuration with six carbon in leach cil tanks was adopted to achieve a gold recovery of 92 5 with consistently low tails grades the tanks will be identical in size with cyanide added to the cil tanks as required the residence time will be 36 hours at 254 t h solids with 40 w w density air will be sparged to maintain an adequate dissolved oxygen level for leaching in the cil tanks a six tonne capacity split anglo elution circuit has been selected based on the feed grade and the annual ore feed and the gold extraction the anglo circuit has been selected as it offers more operational flexibility three electrowinning cells will operate with two in duty and one in standby air so2 has been selected as the cyanide destruction method after tailings slurry is introduced to a thickener where cyanide is recovered into the process water to be reused with a higher solids percent in the slurry the efficiency in the filtration system was achieved in order to obtain dry tailings to conform with brazilian regulations 12 tailings disposal the tailings dam option has been replaced with a co disposal system of tailings and waste rock the tailings will be dewatered at the plant and after detoxification will be filtered and sent to the co disposal dump sites at ne waste dump figure 3 along with waste from the

conservative estimate and wave has identified several opportunities and strategies which may reasonably be expected to reduce the cost and construction time opportunities to improve costs and construction schedule the dfs provides a conservative and robust plan to bring the gold project into production big river believes there are several areas in which opportunities to improve the project economics in terms of both construction time and capital and operating costs should be considered these include but are not limited to changing the nature of inclusion of key sections such as the crushing circuit employing contractor or boot style contracts to reduce capital expenditure and development timeline by several months direct employment of project directors as part of the

a comprehensive 2020 outlook report from cobank s knowledge exchange division finds the u s rural economy will continue to face headwinds in 2020 and is expected to underperform relative to the economy of urban america since 2014 gdp growth in rural counties has averaged almost 1 less than in urban counties that trend is likely to continue without a significant upswing in agricultural commodity prices energy exploration rural manufacturing and other industries upon which rural economic growth depend most current signals indicate the overall domestic economy is on firm footing thanks almost exclusively to the consumer said dan kowalski vice president of cobank s knowledge exchange division the cobank 2020 outlook report the year ahead forces that will shape the u s rural econoomy in 2020 examines 10 key factors that will shape agriculture and market sectors that serve and impact rural communities throughout the u s 1 global economy less trade slower growth after a year of trade tensions declining gdp and the slowest global economic growth since the depths of the financial crisis the world s leading economies hope to turn the page in 2020 the prognosis however offers little to support such optimism consumer strength the world over has prevented further slowing in the global economy however the vulnerable state of the global economy makes it susceptible to contraction if trade conditions worsen 2 u s economy expansion for those left behind the u s economy will enter 2020 decisively split powered by a resilient and confident consumer but hamstrung by a risk averse business sector that has stopped investing now that stimulus effects from the 2017 tax reform and the 2018 spending bill have faded the economic expansion will show its age losing steam in the coming year there is evidence that since 2017 more people including those in rural communities have broadly shared the benefits of economic growth despite the continual rise in wealth inequality 3

stimulating their economies with negative interest rates and quantitative easing after three rate cuts in 2019 the u s federal reserve is holding a more conservative stance with its target rate near 1 5 china has the most room to maneuver with its short term rate just under 3 all these accommodative stances are made possible because inflation remains inexplicably low despite tightening labor markets federal reserve chair powell s role in 2020 is to keep the late stage expansion going while simultaneously preparing for the recession that will arrive sooner or later 4 u s government policy and trade up in the air agricultural policy at the federal level has been wrought with uncertainty and volatility the trade environment for 2020 remains hazy as well beyond the u s china phase one

the flood of obituaries that noted the passing of paul volcker 1927 2019 last week have almost all lauded his achievement as fed chair 1979 1987 in reining in the double digit inflation that ravaged the us economy during the 1970s volcker was referred to as the former fed chairman who fought inflation here inflation tamer and a full fledged inflation warrior here and the fed chairman who waged war on inflation and led the federal reserve s brute force campaign to subdue inflation here mr volcker certainly deserves credit for curbing the great inflation of the 1970s however he also merits a lion s share of the blame for unleashing the great inflation on the us and the world economy in the first place for it was mr volcker who masterminded the program that president nixon announced on august 15 1971 which unilaterally suspended gold convertibility of us dollars held by foreign governments and central banks imposed a fascist wage price freeze on the us economy and slapped a 10 percent surcharge on foreign imports tragically by severing the last link between the dollar and gold volcker s program scuttled the last chance of restoring a genuine gold standard more than two years before nixon slammed down the gold window volcker the recently appointed undersecretary of the treasury for monetary affairs gave an oral presentation to nixon and his closest advisors on us balance of payments problems the presentation was based on a memo that the secret volcker group initiated by henry kissinger spent five months preparing among other things volcker recommended a continuation of capital controls to prop up the inflated dollar s overvalued exchange rate and a massive appreciation or revaluation of the currencies of less inflationary countries such as west germany placing the burden of adjustment to unrestrained us inflation on these countries volcker then planted the time bomb that would eventually detonate and seal the fate of the gold standard he suggested to nixon that if these measures did not work to sustain the pseudo gold standard of the bretton woods system a run on the us gold stock could only be avoided by unilaterally repudiating the postwar us pledge to convert foreign official dollar holdings into gold unfortunately the volcker group report summarily dismissed the alternative of raising possibly doubling the dollar price of gold i e devaluing the dollar which would have increased the value of the us gold stock and facilitated the restoration of a genuine gold standard only a real gold standard could have halted and reversed the slow motion collapse that the international monetary system had been undergoing since the mid 1960s due to large and persistent us payments deficits driven by profligate dollar creation volcker however hated and wanted to get rid of the last vestiges of the gold standard and replace it with a fixed exchange rate system dominated by the us fiat dollar to further enhance the power and prestige of the us in international affairs according to volcker the stability and strength of our currency was important to sustaining the broad role of the united states in the world years later volcker revealed i have never been able to shake the feeling that a strong currency is generally a good thing and that it is typically a sign of vigor and strength and competitiveness one of his biographers intimated that volcker s longstanding regret at having been rejected for military service during world war ii because of his height was at the root of his single minded determination to maintain the supremacy of the american dollar as the world s premier currency indeed volcker struggled mightily to make the dollar appear strong even while rampant money printing to finance great society welfare programs and the vietnam war inexorably weakened it but volcker bitterly opposed raising the price of gold because he feared that open devaluation of the inflated dollar would not only diminish the status and reputation of the us but also reward people and countries he detested namely speculators in gold and gold producing countries such as the soviet union and south africa he especially loathed and wanted to punish president charles de gaulle and the french for embarrassing and discrediting the us by withdrawing from nato and exposing the weakness of the dollar by insisting on converting their dollars into gold in the face of us threats to remove military protection against the soviet union to add insult to injury de gaulle had sent naval ships to retrieve french gold when a full blown run on us gold stock appeared imminent in early 1971 volcker prepared a memorandum for the new treasury secretary former texas governor and master political operative john connally the memo contained three main proposals first countries with less inflationary monetary policies and therefore balance of payments surpluses such as west germany and japan would be imposed upon to substantially appreciate the value of their currencies thereby encouraging us exports and stifling its imports while sparing the it the embarrassment of openly devaluing the dollar second volcker recommended a preemptive strike against gold in the form of a cold blooded suspension of gold convertibility volcker s final proposal was a temporary wage price freeze as one of volcker s biographers characterized his motivation e wanted america to act preemptively to avoid appearance of defeat at the hands of currency speculators emphasis added secretary connally bought into volcker s program when a severe dollar crisis struck a few months later he used all his substantial political wiles to persuade nixon of the merits of the volcker plan then fed chairman and nixon advisor arthur burns for all his erroneous monetary ideas and policy failures was convinced that gold should play at least nominally a central role in the international monetary system in fact fter nixon took office burns proposed to end the balance of payments problem by increasing the official price of gold which would have effectively devalue the dollar in burns s view this would maintain gold as the anchor of a fixed exchange rate system an outcome that volcker would have detested not surprisingly burns was troubled by volcker who he thought had given a stupid reply to nixon about raising the price of gold burns also recognized and bemoaned volcker s influence over connally somehow poor and wretched volcker never knowing where he stood on any issue had succeeded in instilling an irrational fear of gold in his tyrannical master whom he tried constantly to please by catering to his hatred of foreigners particularly the french unfortunately burns had badly underestimated volcker and had mistaken his tact and strategic compromising for vacillation and indecisiveness as his biographer noted volcker admired john connally s social skills and had learned much from the master politician he preferred to equivocate qualify and risk being branded a poor communicator rather than feign certainty in the end the wily connally volcker axis prevailed over the politically naïve burns burns s biographer clearly recognized volcker s political cunning in winning over nixon the president decided against burns paul volcker convinced him that suspension was inevitable and that delay would only create financial chaos perhaps more important nixon realized if he announced the move as part of a new economic package he would appear to be acting decisively to take charge of the crisis making as volcker put it the devaluation of the dollar into a political triumph which was no mean feat thus it was that volcker s memo was used as the basis of the new economic policy that was hammered out by nixon and his advisors including volcker at camp david and announced in nixon s fateful sunday address to the nation one obituarist listed volcker s great public accomplishments thusly he was the point man at the treasury department in 1971 who managed the dollar s untethering from gold he quelled the double digit inflation that took root in the u s in the late 1970s he helped guide the country s response to the 2008 financial crisis unfortunately this list grossly overstates volcker s public accomplishments because it does not reveal the causal connection between his vanquishing the last remnants of the gold standard and the ensuing inflation of the fiat dollar whose supply was then subject solely to the decisions of bureaucrats eagerly seeking to please their political masters
armenia is actively working to better position itself on the investment map by creating a more attractive business climate foreign investment will be crucial for maintaining the economy s so far robust growth rate armenia is no exception to the global foreign direct investment trend investment flows are struggling to recover from the heights reached before the financial crisis a wait and see attitude prevails among investors who have reacted with caution to the recent political transition the united nations conference on trade and development s unctad recent investment policy review finds after a significant hike from 184 million us dollars in 2015 to 334 million us dollars in 2016 fdi in the country stood at 250 million usd in 2017 and grew by just 1 6 per cent last year for armenia attracting investment remains a key challenge the latest edition of the world bank s doing business report ranks armenia s economy 47th in its list of 190 economies down from its historic high of 41st place in 2018 while far from welcome the drop does not signify a change in attitude towards investors far from it the country is pushing to become an attractive market on the ease of the doing business score which assesses a country s absolute level of regulatory performance armenia s score went up from 73 2 in doing business 2019 to 74 5 in doing business 2020 says sylvie bossoutrot the world bank s country manager for armenia adding that the country is indeed continuing to narrow the gap with the global regulatory frontier which is a positive and promising development why armenia according to mrs bossoutrot the country has achieved substantive improvements in the business regulatory framework of four key areas over the past year construction quality control was strengthened by the government s imposing of stricter qualification requirements and the country strengthened the protection of minority investors by requiring independent reviews immediate public disclosures of transactions as well as by increasing shareholder rights and their role in major corporate decisions in addition armenia made the payment of taxes easier by extending refunds of vat to cases of capital investment while exporting was made faster by allowing the online submission of customs declarations aside from the overall world bank ranking armenia made it into the top 10 countries globally when it comes to starting a business it also ranks higher than any other country in the commonwealth of independent states a positive signal for those seeking access to former soviet republics if you ask me why you should invest in armenia my answer will be the following investing in a small country with a global network and skilled labour force is promising claims armenia s prime minister nikol pashinyan is this the case armenia s efficiency profile is characterised by a well educated workforce strong skills heritage and competitive salary levels unctad s investment policy review says while costs related to the workforce are affordable much attention should be paid to transportation costs georgia is the only transit route for armenian goods due to embargoes from azerbaijan and turkey the unctad report claims that several industries can aim for a billion us dollars in export sales in goods and services during the next 10 20 years hi tech data science deep technology tourism textiles and garments promoting investment amid a global slowdown less than a year after armenia s velvet revolution mr pashinyan in february announced an economic revolution which amongst much else was aimed at creating a better business environment fighting corruption and protecting the rule of law all three being crucial for those wishing to invest in the country we see a strong will to reform institutions fight against corruption bolster the rule of law and improve the quality of human capital says marina stefani the director of sovereigns at us based international ratings agency fitch ratings which in may affirmed its b rating for armenia earlier this year standard poor s also affirmed the armenian economy with a stable outlook while moody s changed the country s outlook from stable to positive dimitar bogov the regional lead economist of the european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd who claims that the authorities moved towards greater transparency adds that a major tax reform programme was carried out which included cutting corporate taxes from 20 per cent to 18 per cent from next year the tax on dividends for non resident organisations will also halve to five per cent reforms need to be institutionalised in a way that does not negatively affect regular operations of the private sector the ebrd warns noting that strengthening the tax administration and further increasing the fairness and transparency of the tax framework would facilitate the private sector s ability to drive future growth if the latest projections of the international monetary fund imf prove correct armenia can be the growth champion of emerging europe in 2019 it expects the country s economy to grow by at least six per cent this year with the ebrd also projecting six per cent growth while the global economic slowdown which seems more inevitable and is likely to impact the whole of emerging europe will also impact armenia the country s growth rates will remain significant on the short term the imf has agreed to provide armenia with 248 2 million us dollars over the next three years within the framework of a precautionary stand by arrangement to support the government s efforts to strengthen armenia s economic fundamentals however as yulia ustyugova the imf s resident representative in armenia points out consumption led growth may not be entirely fortunate since it is investment that is the key building block for growth in the future so the challenge remains how to generate sustainable long term growth that is driven by investment and exports rather than consumption she concludes
wednesday was the worst day of president donald trump s presidency it came during one of the best weeks of his presidency which will fuel his argument for reelection 2020 on thursday the house with support from speaker nancy pelosi was set to pass trump s revised version of the 1994 north american free trade agreement though pelosi told fellow democrats we ate their lunch after they got labor enforcement measures added plus she allowed congress to move a defense authorization that includes giving federal workers paid family leave a bipartisan goal that sets an important example for the private sector and giving him the space force he has listed as a top defense priority they passed a funding bill to keep the federal government running until september 2020 although trump will not get new money for the border wall he has long promised they re close to repealing three unpopular tax measures related to the affordable care act even as trump tries to smother the underlying law and pelosi tries to prop it up trump also got some of the money he needs to build a border wall nearly 1 4 billion a massive concession that will reverberate for the remainder of his presidency he also got the ability to transfer money to finance the wall from some pentagon accounts although court challenges remain democrats chose mollifying trump over the concerns of progressives and the congressional hispanic caucus the action came at a price for trump who accepted a fraction of the money he originally asked for in the negotiations that triggered last year s historic government shutdown but that won t stop him from trying to take credit for what passed at year s end as we learned from the stream of consciousness letter trump sent ranting at pelosi over impeachment it included one 212 word sentence ticking off his accomplishments as president a presumable preview of his case for re election next year it s an interesting list since a good portion of it relies directly on his ability to work with pelosi and the rest she is actively fighting here s the full list reproduced below with some context about each point your party simply cannot compete with our record 7 million new jobs the lowest ever unemployment for african americans hispanic americans and asian americans trump s figure is slightly inflated while the economy has created more than 6 million jobs during the first 33 months of the trump presidency that falls short of the more than 7 million created during the last 33 months of obama s presidency according to a recent usa today review the unemployment rate for minority workers is at or near record lows according to the bureau of labor statistics though it s generally been falling since the end of the great recession a rebuilt military a completely reformed va with choice and accountability for our great veterans trump did oversee an increase in military spending he also signed a va reform law in 2018 but it expanded and modified the veterans choice program signed by president barack obama in 2014 it s not clear trump s most recent budget proposal would appropriately fund the va law more than 170 new federal judges and two supreme court justices republicans ended the filibuster for supreme court and federal judges and as a result they ve been seating them at a remarkable clip including some who don t meet the american bar association s standards that satisfies a crucial goal of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and will reshape the judiciary for a generation which will perhaps be trump s longest lasting legacy even as the house was debating trump s impeachment the senate was pushing through judicial nominations historic tax and regulation cuts the elimination of the individual mandate yes trump achieved both of these things pelosi would point out the tax law exploded federal deficits gave massive permanent tax cuts to corporations but only temporary cuts to individuals and potentially penalized blue state filers who relied on deducting high state and local taxes congress had zeroed out the so called individual mandate in the 2017 tax bill now it will remove three more tax measures that raised revenue for obamcare a tax on expensive cadillac plans fought for by unions a tax on premiums collected by insurers and a tax on medical device manufacturers but trump has yet to roll out his long awaited plan to fix the us health care system the first decline in prescription drug prices in half a century it is not at all clear that this claim is exactly true as fact checkers have shown trump has also been thwarted by courts in multiple efforts to lower drug prices through executive action suggesting he ll have to work with democrats to solve the problem the house recently passed pelosi s drug price cap bill which both trump and mcconnell have said they won t support the first new branch of the united states military since 1947 the space force this trump promise is becoming reality thanks to democrats who included it in the end of year defense spending bill strong protection of the second amendment trump has in fact repeatedly said after mass shootings most notably the 2018 school shooting in parkland florida and this past summer s in el paso texas that he will take action and signed a ban on bump stocks but trump has also repeatedly let momentum for major gun reform peter out criminal justice reform yes trump signed into law a criminal justice reform law and it is a major accomplishment of his time in office the law was passed with bipartisan support a defeated isis caliphate and the killing of the world s number one terrorist leader al baghdadi yes abu bakr al baghdadi is dead but trump has repeatedly declared isis defeated and he does so at his own peril a recent pentagon report suggested isis was reconstituting itself the replacement of the disastrous nafta trade deal with the wonderful usmca mexico and canada here s a look at what s in the long promised us mexico canada deal which is a lot like nafta pelosi as we noted above has claimed democrats put important enforcement measures in place and trump needs her to pass it a breakthrough phase one trade deal with china this one is quite disingenuous trump scuttled a trade deal president barack obama negotiated with other asian nations as he came into office promising he would have better luck negotiating a direct trade deal with beijing but after a year of back and forth tariff rounds he has dialed back expectations for a massive trade deal with china instead repackaging something narrower as a phase one deal with promises of more to follow and beijing s retaliation to the tariffs trump imposed on china slowed the global economy and hurt american farmers requiring a massive tens of billions of dollars taxpayer bailout of farmers that will never be paid back massive new trade deals with japan and south korea the trade deal with japan was limited and did not resolve disputes between japan and the us over automobiles it gave us farmers for instance the same access to japanese markets they would have gotten under the much larger obama era trade deal trump abandoned japan and 10 other countries have moved forward without the us in the meantime the south korea trade deal which was reached in march of 2018 was viewed by economists as a relatively modest update of an already existing deal withdrawal from the terrible iran nuclear deal european leaders tried to convince trump not to withdraw from this deal which forced iran to limit its nuclear capabilities trump did it anyway by ordering new sanctions on iran he did arguably help put more pressure on the government there but he also amplified the threat iran poses to the us and the us military expects some sort of retaliation however he pulled from the iran nuclear deal at the same time he was pursuing a very similar sort of nuclear deal with north korea hey wait a minute trump doesn t mention north korea or his summits with kim jong un in this list nuclear talks there are stalled after trump bailed out of a summit in hanoi so trump withdrew from an iran nuclear deal that had international approval and has failed so far to procure a north korea nuclear deal cancellation of the unfair and costly paris climate accord this is certainly something trump did but removing the us from this otherwise worldwide agreement was met with outrage from democrats and others who believe in climate science becoming the world s top energy producer the us has been the top petroleum and natural gas hydrocarbon producer since 2012 according to the government s energy information administration what changed on trump s watch is that the us became the top crude oil producer trump s vision is for an economy propelled by us oil and gas production it s certainly true that democrats want to cut down on us oil and gas consumption as they attempt to do something about the climate crisis recognition of israel s capital opening the american embassy in jerusalem and recognizing israeli sovereignty over the golan heights trump moved the us embassy to jerusalem unilaterally and with great controversy since it was perceived by palestinians as undercutting the us as an arbiter of peace in the region the embassy move was welcomed by some american jews as well as by many in trump s evangelical base but its opening in 2018 sparked deadly protests in gaza trump made the us the only country in the world to recognize israeli sovereignty in the golan heights territory seized from syria in 1967 and annexed in 1981 israel s prime minister benjamin netanyahu later named a golan heights settlement after trump a colossal reduction in illegal border crossings the ending of catch and release and the building of the southern border wall trump has arguably had a greater impact on us border policy than anything else he s separated children from parents at the border cut refugee admissions changed asylum procedures and more regarding undocumented immigrants border crossings are down since spring as judged by the number of arrests and apprehensions at the border but that s only after a huge spike earlier this year there are legal hurdles still standing in the way of trump s attempt to divert pentagon money to get a border wall built although the supreme court ruled he could use much of that money to start building during legal challenges the senate and house have both tried and failed to override trump s decision to declare a national emergency and use military construction money on the wall instead ultimately to build the full wall trump will need congress to give him much more money he didn t get that money when republicans were in charge of congress either and that brings us to the end of trump s list which he ends by saying and that is just the beginning there is so much more

package of measures to open up its economy after the collapse of former benefactor the soviet union while trying to cushion the blow to citizens and national industry while the system helped cuba get through the shock of the soviet collapse it ended up also distorting the economy and hiding the real economic situation productivity and competitiveness of state run companies and favoring imports instead of exports adios to convertible peso the government says it will eliminate the convertible peso and leave the peso as the only currency and has already taken important steps in that direction larger peso bills denominated at 200 500 and 1 000 are now in circulation previously 100 pesos was the highest denomination thousands of state run retail outlets now price items in pesos as well as cuc and cash registers and card swipers are programmed for both currencies in november cuba banned the import and export of convertible pesos and began charging travelers in tradable currencies at airports once past the gate advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content in december the government began giving change at some stores only in pesos hello dollar cuba banned the dollar as legal tender in 2003 after the united states hiked sanctions on its use of the greenback but in october the government began opening stores that sell appliances car parts and other items for dollars though only with a bank card raising the possibility the u s currency will be used at least electronically once the convertible peso is taken out of circulation that could end the state s prior practice of importing appliances and other goods with tradable currency and selling them in local currency useless for purchasing more imports risks bringing the fixed official 1 1 and 1 24 public exchange rates more in line with each other and their true value will be difficult especially given the government s pledge that consumers will not be hurt an impossibility according to many local and foreign economists they say fixing the exchange rates will inevitably cause inflation and reveal just how unproductive and bankrupt many

the us and china are the two biggest economies in the world over the decades the two countries have been opponents friends frenemies and rivals the us joined the european powers in the exploitation of china opposed the spread of communism and fought mao zedong s young nation in korea this icy relationship thawed with henry kissinger s diplomacy and richard nixon s 1972 visit to china after deng xiaoping started modernizing china s economy in the 1980s economic relations between washington and beijing deepened after deng s 1992 southern tour which reconfirmed china s commitment to economic liberalization and free market reform the economy took off exponentially it has now become the workshop of the world in recent years this has created unease in the us where the working class suffered as manufacturing moved abroad under president donald trump relations soured leading to the imposition of us tariffs on more than 360 billion worth of chinese goods and more than 110 billion of us products by china in retaliation now there is talk of a new cold war the trade war between the us and china presents major risks to the global economy a study by the un conference on trade and development found that the continuing trade war by the two biggest economies has resulted in a sharp decline in bilateral trade higher prices for consumers and trade diversion effects the study revealed that us tariffs have caused a 35 billion loss to chinese exports in the us market the international monetary fund estimates that the trade war will cause almost a percentage point loss in global growth this year the coming chinese world order read more there is also the added question about which of the two economic models is likely to prevail with its cheap gas immigrants from around the world top universities spending on research and entrepreneurial energy many take the view that the us will come back strongly others say that the chinese have the social cohesion long term planning determination and a work ethic to mount a decent if not successful challenge in this guest edition of the interview naveed ahsan talks to david petraeus a decorated general former head of the cia and the chairman of the kkr global institute about the us economy american strategic priorities and us china relations naveed ahsan with america first is the us going back to the protectionist policies of the pre world war i era david petraeus now let me qualify my answer a bit because there is a debate in the us and in some other countries as well about the benefits of international trade agreements the value of alliances and the importance of the us continuing to lead the so called rules based international order those who believe in each of these and i am among them clearly have to make a more effective case than has been put forward in recent years that the benefits of each outweigh the downsides and costs that inevitably accompany trade agreements alliance membership and global leadership additionally there has to be an acknowledgment that there are losers as well as winners from trade and other agreements and that there need to be policies and resources that take better care of those disadvantaged by new trade agreements than has often been the case in the past ahsan with low gas costs cutting edge research smart manufacturing etc is the us economy poised for another growth spurt petraeus that may be the case in some sectors but is unlikely in aggregate the us is of course in the later stages of the longest economic recovery in our history but growth in the us has begun to slow we have seen yield curve inversion and growth in the eurozone and much of the developed world as well as that in china india and many emerging market countries has slowed as well in some cases approaching a technical recession in response central banks around the world including in the us are now reducing interest rates and pursuing monetary easing as well and some governments are also engaged in fiscal stimulus policies each of those actions is intended to mitigate the risk of a recession continued consumer spending in the us which accounts for the vast majority of us gdp is sustaining growth in the us at present and some fundamentals are encouraging low inflation despite the lowest unemployment in some 50 years low energy costs recent modest increases in real wage rates and still reasonably solid earnings but i would not anticipate a us growth spurt in aggregate at least not until we weather the inevitable downturn that lies ahead though no one can predict the timing or severity of the downturn to be sure certainly some productivity enhancements being pursued will help the us economy however if the us wants to see a real boost to long term growth we will need to invest heavily in overdue infrastructure improvements that enhance productivity achieve comprehensive immigration reform providing in particular a legal pathway for unskilled workers for our agriculture construction and hospitality sectors allowing more highly skilled workers for various tech sector needs and resolving the status of the dreamers and those immigrants here without adequate legal documentation improve public education for the bottom 30 or so of our population increase resources provided for research and development and establish greater incentives and regulatory frameworks to encourage investment in new technologies such as 5g infrastructure and communications renewable energy sources smart grid etc ahsan with the rebound of american manufacturing is the chinese economy headed for a japan style showdown petraeus there are many challenges looming for manufacturing in china displacement of some manufacturing to countries with lower labor costs and because of us tariffs return from china of some manufacturing to the us where more of the work is done by machines robots and automation loss of some manufacturing jobs inside china to robots and machines no country will be affected more by the rise of the robots than will china as its workforce in manufacturing is undoubtedly the largest in the world and loss of some tech manufacturing because of growing concerns about supply chain risks associated with and us restrictions on some tech items built in china those challenges and the inevitable reduction in growth rates in china even as growth does continue as well as a variety of other factors will require very skillful responses by chinese leaders but chinese leadership has guided the country to achieve more in the four decades since deng xiaoping welcomed the world to china than any country in history has achieved in 40 years so just as warren buffett observes from time to time that it has never paid to bet against america perhaps we might offer something of the same about modern china ahsan what must washington and beijing do to avoid the thucydides trap petraeus this is one of the central questions of the day and likely will continue to be so for the decades ahead from a us perspective the us china relationship has to be far and away the top priority of america s foreign policy and we need to develop a truly coherent and comprehensive approach that employs all possible american tools together with those of our allies and partners around the world and asks what the effect on the us china relationship will be of every foreign policy initiative beyond that it is very clear that the us and china need to engage in sustained strategic dialogue so that each side understands the national interests of the other and so that differences can be resolved diplomatically before they get out of hand especially given that unlike pre world war ii situations we are now in the nuclear age the goal obviously should be a mutually beneficial relationship and the key will be determining which of china s aspirations are sufficiently legitimate that they should be accommodated and which are not and thus warrant firm pushback by the us and its partners ahsan what are the top three strategic priorities for the us petraeus reflecting on the 2017 national security strategy drafted under the direction of a long time military colleague lieutenant general h r mcmaster the four priorities identified for the us are protection of the us homeland including the american people and our way of life promotion of american prosperity preservation of peace through strength and the advance of american influence around the world ahsan what are the top three geopolitical threats to the global economy petraeus there are numerous threats at present but it seems to me that the top three are first the economic actions that have accompanied the resurgence of great power rivalries especially as previously highlighted those associated with the extraordinary rise of china second increased challenges to the trading regimes and elements of the rules based international order that despite various shortcomings has stood the world in reasonably good stead since the end of world war ii and third populism security issues corruption large scale criminal activity and other dynamics that are undermining in many countries the elements of governance rule of law and security that are generally required for substantial investment by foreign sources the views expressed in this article are the

revenue and profit are in decline and the coffers are depleted in 2018 pz cussons sharply reduced capital expenditure and did not increase the dividend for the first time in many years it kept the financial screws tightly turned in the year to may 2019 too the company s problems are both self inflicted and the result of external events it borrowed to buy brands that have been less profitable than expected in developed markets such as the uk and europe brands face increased competition on two fronts the internet where consumers have much more choice and discount retailers who have developed their own copycat products in nigeria until recently one of pz cussons biggest markets the economy has been rocked by low oil prices and internal conflict the company is profitable but contracting and last week it dispensed with its longstanding ceo it has yet to appoint a replacement that s the bad news the good news is that pz cussons is committed to restoring its fortunes by selling off weaker brands and rationalising in nigeria it is ploughing the money from disposals and the savings from efficiencies into stronger brands typicallypersonal care and beauty brands such as

rheinmetall best tanks in the world and the uk s chemring qinetiq and cobham about to delist after a successful takeover bid yet among these winners has been the mangiest of dogs in 2009 i invested at 5 per share confirmed my brilliance as it rose to 13 in 2014 then stupidly gawped as it fell to 4 50 by the middle of 2019 as management blundered around i intend to double up soon not always the smartest advice for losers but in this case i am sure that the force is with me and the company babcock international lse bab a truly global defence group with 70 of sales from overseas it builds or participates in almost everything from nuclear plants to frigates submarines aviation and systems management profits are evenly spread across its land sea air and nuclear operations the compelling numbers include a forward multiple for 2020 of a mere nine times and a 5 dividend yield debt is low and it trades at a smidgeon above its book value the order book is a robust 18bn and the relatively new chair ceo and other key appointees seem sensible there are actually four forces western governments have woken up to the often lamentable state of their armed forces so defence budgets are rising the ever nihilistic and opportunist russian government is a clear threat and china s remorseless expansion of its armed forces is another while the reliability of america as an ally is in doubt in 2019 takeover approaches were made by a private equity firm and the outsourcing group serco with a market capitalisation of only 3bn it is vulnerable if it stumbles again it will be gobbled up what s not to like stephen connolly think technology and the companies that spring most to mind are the likes of facebook amazon and google their success has attracted so many investors that they re what market commentators sometimes call crowded trades but while everyone is focused on the leaders other stocks in a sector can be overlooked if not ignored altogether and this is where opportunities can lie one area is legacy tech these are the big names of yesteryear unloved today because they have been dismissed rightly or wrongly as ex growth think intel cisco oracle and sap for example one to watch in 2020 is ibm nyse ibm it s slowly declining as companies switch to the cloud and other new technologies and it hasn t kept up but it s making up for lost ground to get back on a growth track this year to turbo charge its cloud computing presence it paid 34bn for red hat a well regarded specialist that has been growing earnings at 25 annually it s already adding profit to ibm s bottom line and it s hoped this will accelerate next year as it sells into ibm s considerable network of existing relationships in the us and internationally alongside rationalising operations and selling off non core businesses ibm is likely to appoint a new chief executive in 2020 choosing red hat s jim whitehead which would underline the group s new direction would be well received and help further revitalise investor interest it s early days but the current price earnings ratio of just ten for an established highly cash generative global tech company making a push into one of the sector s fastest growing segments is far from expensive from these levels it won t take much in the way of positive news to give the shares a significant boost as the year progresses meantime unlike most tech stocks the downside looks limited given the big dividend yield of nearly 5 providing support dominic frisby i m so convinced this is going to be a big theme not so much next year as over the next decade that i ve actually set up a holding company to invest in it cypherpunk holdings cse hodl that theme is privacy you might tell your lover something you wouldn t tell your lawyer or your doctor something you wouldn t tell your mate yet information about what we read watch say buy or sell online gets used for purposes beyond the original one as the saying goes when the internet is free you are the product that information is then used to shape behaviour and influence your decisions to determine the content you receive what you do see read or watch to sell things to you and to make decisions about you the loan the insurance or the job you are offered in the wrong hands it could be used against you in some way perhaps even to spy on you your data could be stolen only now are people starting to wake up and think about this regulators have taken steps but technology is so advanced it has often moved on before any new rules are emerge we have little idea what is being used how or by whom we have little say in how it is used we have no power to object nor any ability to amend our data we have very little control over it the default setting of the internet is zero privacy the solution is privacy technology protecting our privacy limits the scope others have to use our information beyond the purpose for which it was supplied it allows greater control over our online reputation it enables us to explore new ideas outside the mainstream without fear of being watched those that know about us have power over us protecting privacy limits that power cris sholto heaton the crisis in hong kong over the last nine months has caused long term damage to the territory s reputation its status as asia s financial capital is no longer so secure companies will consider other locations for their regional headquarters and wealthy individuals will think about stashing their assets elsewhere singapore has the most to gain from this it s a major financial centre that offers the stability its larger rival conspicuously now lacks any medium term shift out of hong kong will benefit the singapore office market where rents are already recovering from a glut of new supply in 2016 2017 so this seems a good time to look at the local commercial property real estate investment trusts reits these offer a decent long term income at a time when global interest rates are set to fall again another factor likely to help buoy their share prices over the next year i hold capitaland commercial trust singapore cct which yields around 4 5 at a price of s 1 97 this conservatively run reit is the largest in its sector with around s 11bn in assets and reasonably low gearing 35 the portfolio is mostly good quality offices in singapore with around 22 in singapore retail and hotels and 8 in germany that should deliver a steadily growing income as rents rise my suggestion last year was tkh group a dutch industrial technology firm when i picked this the price was around 41 70 and at time of writing it is 48 6 including the dividend that s a return of around 19 before costs i still like tkh s mix of businesses but half year results were soft and guidance for full year results was trimmed in november a forecast price earnings ratio for 2019 of just under 19 would be okay if all was going well but looks vulnerable to disappointment now take profits max king the uk small cap trusts i recommended for 2019 struggled for most of the year but are enjoying a year end rally they should do well in 2020 but so should equities in general leaving investors spoilt for choice after minimal progress in 2019 earnings growth should accelerate in 2020 though this is largely discounted in us valuations it may be time for the rest of the world to catch up after the persistent outperformance of growth over value value investing has made a modest comeback in recent months it s tempting to back the new trend but it has quickly turned from a contrarian to a fashionable call as dudley moore s character said to the raf recruiter in the aftermyth of war sketch in beyond the fringe please sir i would like to join the few i m sorry came the reply there are far too many the high growth us technology giants may be due a pause but that doesn t mean that more moderate growth stocks won t continue to perform well two global trusts fit the bill well they are both growth orientated but have their feet firmly on the ground the monks investment trust lse mnks and the mid wynd international investment trust lse mwy the former is the stable mate of scottish mortgage at baillie gifford the latter a former baillie gifford trust now managed by artemis performance over one three and five years is similar and excellent but mid wynd with a market value of 250m is much smaller this may enable it to be nimbler in the stockmarket should there be a need to rotate the portfolio the shares of both trade at premiums to net asset value you get what you pay for and both have low dividend yields neither will shoot the lights out but nor will they give you sleepless nights given my record in 2019 you may not need to jump in now james mckeigue think of some of the great investors calls soros shorting the pound perhaps or the hedge funds that spotted flaws in subprime they all involve identifying a market anomaly something that looks unsustainable over the long term and then betting against it continuing at present there is a 700 mile long anomaly in the andes mountain range ecuadorian mining as francisco pizarro and his fellow conquistadores could have told you almost 500 years ago the andes is crammed full of gold silver and copper that s why we ve seen large mining industries develop in chile peru bolivia and colombia but not in ecuador that wasn t because of a lack of mineral resources despite the limited exploration more gold and copper has been found in ecuador than anywhere else in the world over the last 15 years instead a combination of social and economic factors an abundance of oil poor infrastructure and political instability all played a part meant ecuador never developed a large scale modern mining industry that anomaly clearly couldn t last forever in recent years successive governments have improved conditions for international miners and in 2019 ecuador s first ever world class mine began operation but this is just the beginning of the ecuadorian mining boom twelve of the world s major mining companies have already set up offices in ecuador and several more large projects will come onstream over the next few years of course there will be hiccups on the way ecuador remains a politically volatile country prone to protests yet over the long run mining is bound to grow in ecuador it has the mineral resources and as the country s politicians slowly get used to the extra tax dollars generated by mining while increasing numbers of ecuadorians find work in the labour intensive industry it will follow its andean cousins in developing a serious mining industry in peru and chile mining accounts for between 15 to 20 of gdp if ecuadorian mining grows to even half that size it will create huge wealth for investors fortunately for us there are two companies that give us a direct way to get in early on the story one is lundin gold toronto lug which built and operates ecuador s first large goldmine while the second is london listed explorer solgold lse solg which has the country s most exciting portfolio of projects to develop john stepek this time last year i tipped what i thought was a very dull stock indeed high street clothing retailer next lse nxt i saw it as a potential recovery play amid panic over both brexit and the annual high street bloodbath headline frenzy i don t expect it to shoot the lights out i said i was wrong it s up by about 75 since the tip on 28 december i can t claim that all of my tips do that well no please don t write in to remind me of just how true that statement is but i hope you acted on this one if you did then i don t expect it to repeat the feat this year but i d hang on to it it s a retail survivor and a quality stock so what about this year sticking with retail i m tempted to take a punt on a turnaround at marks spencer lse mks unlike next m s has had a terrible year because unlike next m s is not a terribly good company the share price is down by about 7 in the past 12 months while the wider market is up about 11 m s is a perennial turnaround stock with a long history of disappointing but even if current chairman archie norman can t salvage it the fact that the political uncertainty is now lifting in the uk see page 8 makes me think that even a duffer like m s will be lifted in the rush for exposure to uk plc and in this age of activist investing there s surely a price at which a professional troublemaker decides it s time to take a pop at the venerable brand the other area where i think we ll see surprises next year is the oil sector the oil price has been noticeably subdued this year caught between the narrative of over supply too much fracking and weak demand recession scares if global demand is better than expected next year and oil cartel opec sticks to its production cuts partly with the aim of propping up the valuation of state owned oil giant saudi aramco then oil could spring a nasty surprise on markets by heading higher that in turn could be good news for energy companies which have struggled this year so on that front i m going to go for another very boring stock oil major bp lse bp which is down about 6 over the past year so roughly flat after the dividend it s currently yielding around 6 5 david stevenson many of the funds i closely follow had a good last year but two stand out as relative laggards and might therefore present some opportunity over the long term one is phoenix spree deutschland a specialist london listed residential property company focused on the problematic berlin market i will take a closer look at it early next year the idea you should concentrate on now is an unashamedly long term play for the patient growth investor its a trust called syncona lse sync which is the uk s premier quoted life sciences venture capital vc investor this is a world class outfit with an excellent track record of realisations in businesses involved in the front line of biomedical research biotech stocks have slipped over the past few months and that has been a reason why the share price of this vc fund has weakened considerably at various points its looked like it might breach the 200p level looking at the most recent results the net asset value of the fund was just under 200p a share so at the current price you re not paying too much of a premium that reasonable pricing is because recent results showed that the portfolio had lost just under 12 largely because of the share price decline of quoted companies syncona holds nasdaq listed autolus for instance many biotech and genomics businesses have seen significant deratings in the last few months that said some of the businesses in the portfolio showed significant uplifts on valuations notably blue earth diagnostics and achilles therapeutics over the next ten years syncona aims to build a portfolio of 15 20 companies the idea is to add two or three every year in its strategic areas of focus including cell and gene therapy i am sure the share price will be volatile on that ten year journey but for growth investors who aren t in a rush there is no better way of buying into private lifesciences vc mike tubbs biotechnology is a major growth area of the 21st century it is driving revolutions in new biologic drugs diagnostics crops and farm animal genetics that is why i recommended a drug discovery biotech vertex pharmaceuticals for 2018 and a picks shovels antibody company abcam for 2019 vertex is up 41 2 since my recommendation in early january 2018 while the ftse 100 has lost 5 5 abcam is up 30 3 from december 2018 compared with a 9 2 increase in the ftse 100 i am staying with biotech for my 2020 recommendation and selecting a biotech with the world s largest antibody library which it is using to generate new antibody drugs those that stimulate the immune system some are developed in partnership with big pharmaceutical companies with a royalty taken on sales while others are developed internally to retain more of the profits the company is morphosys xetra mor and it has a well stocked pipeline with over 100 distinct drugs in r d and over 70 clinical trials in progress it has 12 big pharma partners including gsk johnson johnson novartis pfizer and roche morphosys has just one drug on the market tremfya for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis it has partnered with johnson johnson in this case tremfya is in ten late stage trials for related conditions meanwhile morphosys is preparing to seek regulatory approval for its most advanced proprietary drug tafasitamab for blood cancers excluding these two drugs there are another 34 late stage clinical trials in progress including tests of an alzheimer s drug morphosys is still loss making with a net loss of 52 7m for the first nine months of 2019 on sales of 61m but its healthy cash pile of 412 4m should see it through to profit the main risk is of late stage clinical trial failures which delay profitability and require the raising of extra funds the share price is around 127 up 43 from 90 50 at the start of this year buy andrew van sickle people always vote with their feet so i was struck by last week s news that the 2 5 million strong polish diaspora is beginning to return home the number of poles based abroad dropped by 85 000 last year you can see why last year poland became the first country from the region to be ranked a developed market by index provider ftse russell a testament to its progress since the collapse of the soviet bloc it has been growing non stop for over a quarter of a century and over the past few years gdp has expanded by 3 6 a year but there should be plenty more to come like the rest of the region poland is still converging with the wealthier part of the continent its gdp per capita is still around 15 500 compared with germany s 40 000 eastern europe is dependent on the eurozone s business cycle but poland is less so than most exports comprise just 50 of gdp compared with 78 for the czech republic its large domestic market tempers the impact of a continental or global downturn poland was the only eu country to avoid a recession in 2008 2009 with unemployment at just 3 2 and household debt a mere 35 of gdp britain s is 84 there is ample scope for consumption to grow for years to come one potential problem to keep an eye on is the country s government whose authoritarian and statist instincts have unnerved investors so far however the ruling law and justice party seems to have had little impact on the population s dynamism and entrepreneurial instincts in any case the danger is arguably priced in poland is on a cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio cape of just 11 making it one of the world s cheapest stockmarkets by this measure it doesn t deserve to be that makes the msci poland ucits etf lse ipol worth tucking away

cnn wednesday was the worst day of president donald trump s presidency it came during one of the best weeks of his presidency which will fuel his argument for reelection 2020 on thursday the house with support from speaker nancy pelosi was set to pass trump s revised version of the 1994 north american free trade agreement though pelosi told fellow democrats we ate their lunch after they got labor enforcement measures added plus she allowed congress to move a defense authorization that includes giving federal workers paid family leave a bipartisan goal that sets an important example for the private sector and giving him the space force he has listed as a top defense priority they passed a funding bill to keep the federal government running until september 2020 although trump will not get new money for the border wall he has long promised they re close to repealing three unpopular tax measures related to the affordable care act even as trump tries to smother the underlying law and pelosi tries to prop it up trump also got some of the money he needs to build a border wall nearly 1 4 billion a massive concession that will reverberate for the remainder of his presidency he also got the ability to transfer money to finance the wall from some pentagon accounts although court challenges remain democrats chose mollifying trump over the concerns of progressives and the congressional hispanic caucus the action came at a price for trump who accepted a fraction of the money he originally asked for in the negotiations that triggered last year s historic government shutdown but that won t stop him from trying to take credit for what passed at year s end as we learned from the stream of consciousness letter trump sent ranting at pelosi over impeachment it included one 212 word sentence ticking off his accomplishments as president a presumable preview of his case for re election next year it s an interesting list since a good portion of it relies directly on his ability to work with pelosi and the rest she is actively fighting here s the full list reproduced below with some context about each point your party simply cannot compete with our record 7 million new jobs the lowest ever unemployment for african americans hispanic americans and asian americans trump s figure is slightly inflated while the economy has created more than 6 million jobs during the first 33 months of the trump presidency that falls short of the more than 7 million created during the last 33 months of obama s presidency according to a recent usa today review the unemployment rate for minority workers is at or near record lows according to the bureau of labor statistics though it s generally been falling since the end of the great recession a rebuilt military a completely reformed va with choice and accountability for our great veterans trump did oversee an increase in military spending he also signed a va reform law in 2018 but it expanded and modified the veterans choice program signed by president barack obama in 2014 it s not clear trump s most recent budget proposal would appropriately fund the va law more than 170 new federal judges and two supreme court justices republicans ended the filibuster for supreme court and federal judges and as a result they ve been seating them at a remarkable clip including some who don t meet the american bar association s standards that satisfies a crucial goal of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and will reshape the judiciary for a generation which will perhaps be trump s longest lasting legacy even as the house was debating trump s impeachment the senate was pushing through judicial nominations historic tax and regulation cuts the elimination of the individual mandate yes trump achieved both of these things pelosi would point out the tax law exploded federal deficits gave massive permanent tax cuts to corporations but only temporary cuts to individuals and potentially penalized blue state filers who relied on deducting high state and local taxes congress had zeroed out the so called individual mandate in the 2017 tax bill now it will remove three more tax measures that raised revenue for obamcare a tax on expensive cadillac plans fought for by unions a tax on premiums collected by insurers and a tax on medical device manufacturers but trump has yet to roll out his long awaited plan to fix the us health care system the first decline in prescription drug prices in half a century it is not at all clear that this claim is exactly true as fact checkers have shown trump has also been thwarted by courts in multiple efforts to lower drug prices through executive action suggesting he ll have to work with democrats to solve the problem the house recently passed pelosi s drug price cap bill which both trump and mcconnell have said they won t support the first new branch of the united states military since 1947 the space force this trump promise is becoming reality thanks to democrats who included it in the end of year defense spending bill strong protection of the second amendment trump has in fact repeatedly said after mass shootings most notably the 2018 school shooting in parkland florida and this past summer s in el paso texas that he will take action and signed a ban on bump stocks but trump has also repeatedly let momentum for major gun reform peter out criminal justice reform yes trump signed into law a criminal justice reform law and it is a major accomplishment of his time in office the law was passed with bipartisan support a defeated isis caliphate and the killing of the world s number one terrorist leader al baghdadi yes abu bakr al baghdadi is dead but trump has repeatedly declared isis defeated and he does so at his own peril a recent pentagon report suggested isis was reconstituting itself the replacement of the disastrous nafta trade deal with the wonderful usmca mexico and canada here s a look at what s in the long promised us mexico canada deal which is a lot like nafta pelosi as we noted above has claimed democrats put important enforcement measures in place and trump needs her to pass it a breakthrough phase one trade deal with china this one is quite disingenuous trump scuttled a trade deal president barack obama negotiated with other asian nations as he came into office promising he would have better luck negotiating a direct trade deal with beijing but after a year of back and forth tariff rounds he has dialed back expectations for a massive trade deal with china instead repackaging something narrower as a phase one deal with promises of more to follow and beijing s retaliation to the tariffs trump imposed on china slowed the global economy and hurt american farmers requiring a massive tens of billions of dollars taxpayer bailout of farmers that will never be paid back massive new trade deals with japan and south korea the trade deal with japan was limited and did not resolve disputes between japan and the us over automobiles it gave us farmers for instance the same access to japanese markets they would have gotten under the much larger obama era trade deal trump abandoned japan and 10 other countries have moved forward without the us in the meantime the south korea trade deal which was reached in march of 2018 was viewed by economists as a relatively modest update of an already existing deal withdrawal from the terrible iran nuclear deal european leaders tried to convince trump not to withdraw from this deal which forced iran to limit its nuclear capabilities trump did it anyway by ordering new sanctions on iran he did arguably help put more pressure on the government there but he also amplified the threat iran poses to the us and the us military expects some sort of retaliation however he pulled from the iran nuclear deal at the same time he was pursuing a very similar sort of nuclear deal with north korea hey wait a minute trump doesn t mention north korea or his summits with kim jong un in this list nuclear talks there are stalled after trump bailed out of a summit in hanoi so trump withdrew from an iran nuclear deal that had international approval and has failed so far to procure a north korea nuclear deal cancellation of the unfair and costly paris climate accord this is certainly something trump did but removing the us from this otherwise worldwide agreement was met with outrage from democrats and others who believe in climate science becoming the world s top energy producer the us has been the top petroleum and natural gas hydrocarbon producer since 2012 according to the government s energy information administration what changed on trump s watch is that the us became the top crude oil producer trump s vision is for an economy propelled by us oil and gas production it s certainly true that democrats want to cut down on us oil and gas consumption as they attempt to do something about the climate crisis recognition of israel s capital opening the american embassy in jerusalem and recognizing israeli sovereignty over the golan heights trump moved the us embassy to jerusalem unilaterally and with great controversy since it was perceived by palestinians as undercutting the us as an arbiter of peace in the region the embassy move was welcomed by some american jews as well as by many in trump s evangelical base but its opening in 2018 sparked deadly protests in gaza trump made the us the only country in the world to recognize israeli sovereignty in the golan heights territory seized from syria in 1967 and annexed in 1981 israel s prime minister benjamin netanyahu later named a golan heights settlement after trump a colossal reduction in illegal border crossings the ending of catch and release and the building of the southern border wall trump has arguably had a greater impact on us border policy than anything else he s separated children from parents at the border cut refugee admissions changed asylum procedures and more regarding undocumented immigrants border crossings are down since spring as judged by the number of arrests and apprehensions at the border but that s only after a huge spike earlier this year there are legal hurdles still standing in the way of trump s attempt to divert pentagon money to get a border wall built although the supreme court ruled he could use much of that money to start building during legal challenges the senate and house have both tried and failed to override trump s decision to declare a national emergency and use military construction money on the wall instead ultimately to build the full wall trump will need congress to give him much more money he didn t get that money when republicans were in charge of congress either and that brings us to the end of trump s list which he ends by saying and that is just the beginning there is so much more

washington afp advertising read more a wave of debt in emerging and developing nations has grown faster and larger than in any period of the last five decades and could end with another crisis the world bank warned thursday and if the wave breaks it could be more damaging since it would engulf private companies in addition to governments at a time when economic growth is sluggish according to a new report that covers four debt surges from 1970 2018 the size speed and breadth of the latest debt wave should concern us all world bank president david malpass said in a statement clearly it s time for course corrections he added the world bank and international monetary fund have been sounding the warning about growing global debt for years but the latest report is even more stark and turned up the volume on its calls for governments to take steps to prevent a debt crisis imf chief kristalina georgieva on thursday said developing nations in africa especially need to strike the right balance between financing development and a manageable debt level surging to 188 trillion the imf reported that total global debt rose to 188 trillion at the end of 2018 equivalent to nearly 230 percent of the world s economy the world bank report highlights the striking debt surge in emerging and developing economies which is the largest fastest and most broad based in emdes in the past 50 years after declining during the 2008 global financial crisis amid very low borrowing costs in just eight years since 2010 debt in these countries climbed to an all time high of roughly 170 percent of gdp or about 55 trillion much of the growth was incurred by china equivalent to more than 20 trillion but beijing also has become a large lender for low income countries the report warns that the current debt wave could follow the historical pattern and culminate in financial crises in these economies especially if interest rates spike or if there is a sudden global shock better debt management improved tax collection flexible exchange rates and tighter fiscal rules to manage spending could help avert a crisis and soften the blow if one occurs the world bank said towering though it may seem the latest global wave of debt can be managed malpass said but leaders need to recognize the danger and move countries into safer territory in terms of the quality and quantity of investment and debt sooner rather than later his imf counterpart georgieva in a blog post thursday repeated her concern about the massive increase in commercial borrowing in africa accounting for 70 percent of the ballooning of debt she urged governments in the region to find a balanced approach to managing debt and development africa is seeking to find the right balance between financing development and safeguarding debt sustainability between investing in people and upgrading infrastructure between long term development objectives and pressing immediate needs she said 2019 afp
it s time to start looking towards 2020 even with that in mind we emphasize that the important themes now will undoubtedly change at the start of 2019 the fed was in a hiking cycle but by year end the entire world was easing except for sweden the brexit drama took an uncountable number of turns and the us president has just been impeached ashraf reminded us here 2019 may be like 1998 when the fed did 3 mid cycle rate cuts and a us president was impeached in december of that year 1 circle november 3 one thing that s certain is that us politics will resonate into the year ahead a conviction in the senate is a remote possibility but an election on november 3 2020 is a certainty the question for the first half of the year will be who will lead the democratic party into the election biden currently leads in betting markets at about 31 followed by sanders at 21 warren at 15 buttigieg at 14 and a rematch with clinton at 10 the only prediction we re comfortable making at this point is that this will be the dirtiest most bitterly contested presidential election of our lifetimes undoubtedly america will be left more divided and that leaves the dollar more vulnerable in the long term 2 oil risks are underappreciated a second theme is turmoil in the oil market we ve highlighted the narrow range in crude this year and how narrow ranges often precede breakouts the supply side is where the intrigue lies the downside risk is that production in saudi arabia iran and or venezuela return to the market the upside is more intriguing because there s a growing risk that us shale production will disappoint there is 71 billion in us oil production debt coming due in the next 7 years and it ll be a nightmare to refinance with much of the shale industry still failing to generate profit the industry raised money on the promise of profitability at 20 barrel but it s increasingly clear there are still no profits at 55 barrel rather than 5 more years of production growth us crude volumes could peak in 2020 and leave the market undersupplied and trigger a run on energy bonds that could spread from there democratic candidates are threatening to ban fracking in another potential risk but at the very least there will be a debate about egregious flaring practices and that will drive up industry costs 3 negative thoughts on negative rates in europe and japan a debate is brewing about the wisdom of negative rates the simplified version is 1 they haven t worked out how to boost inflation and 2 the costs to banks may outweigh the benefits it would take a crafty climb down from central banks to reverse the policy but the debate is going to gather steam 4 spend the free bond market money the other debate that isn t going to go away is on the need for fiscal stimulus japan rolled out yet another package in december that abe says will boost growth by 0 5 pp to 1 4 in 2020 economists see just 0 3 gdp growth next year in the eurozone the outcome is even tougher to handicap the consensus for growth is just 1 0 and merkel and her austere grand coalition is losing its grip on power with rates so low it will be tough for european nations including the uk to resist loosening fiscal policy the question is how much pain will there have to be first 5 the place to be for global growth the beaten up antipodeans are the best gauge of global growth for 2020 with both at compelling levels aud usd continues to flirt with the 200 day moving average and industrial metals materials prices are rising from depressed levels if the truce in the trade war holds there s further value here 6 brexit blues must we mention brexit the painfully short honeymoon after boris johnson s election win is puzzling we would have expected some instinct towards policies to stimulate growth or at least some reform but instead johnson has reverted to brexit brinksmanship it s dispiriting to think that uk politicians have become so adept at playing brexit games that they ve forgotten about the job of governing do fitch and s p know something that we don t when they stated boris johnson will in fact extend the transition period
by john mauldin the federal reserve system is supposed to be independent but it s not and as much as donald trump doesn t like it the fed shouldn t follow the president s orders the fed operates under a legal mandate from congress its monetary policy role is to promote maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates so how is it doing long term rates are certainly moderate employment is historically high though wages and job quality aren t always great as for that stable prices part it depends on what you are buying cpi doesn t reflect real inflation as you see below for many goods the price is nowhere near stable unfortunately if you are in the bottom 60 70 of the income brackets these are some of the things you buy the most source sebastian sienkiewicz the fed believes that 2 annual inflation equals stable prices yet that small amount adds up over time to almost 50 in 20 years which is about where cpi lands in this 20 year chart so the fed is succeeding by that yardstick but cpi doesn t reflect real life spending for most people prices have risen dramatically more than average for some of life s basic necessities while fed officials may think they have tamed inflation their zirp and qe actually drove real world prices considerably higher than cpi or pce show it showed up mainly in asset valuations like stocks and real estate these in turn drove up other prices like housing aggregate inflation isn t higher because technology and globalization reduced manufactured goods costs and the shale revolution kept energy costs low try to look at this like an average worker your rent keeps rising your kids can t go to college without racking up debt your health insurance is astronomical and your wages while up a bit aren t keeping up with your living costs meanwhile the people who are supposed to be looking out for you keep talking about how the economy is improving thanks to their brilliant policies it s all relative my friend philippa dunne at the liscio report showed two charts demonstrating older generations read boomers are doing much better than gen xers and especially millennials source the liscio report we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us source the liscio report i understand the economic theories that gdp growth will eventually spread widely enough to ease the angst but i am not sure we can wait that long people are hurting now and they are increasingly willing to embrace radical solutions just wait for better times is not cutting it as technology eats into higher paying jobs and aggravates the stress of lower income jobs that s doubly true if the economy weakens some of the data improved a bit in recent weeks the november jobs report showed much stronger growth than we ve seen in a while that s good to see and suggests we might postpone recession past 2020 but merely avoiding recession isn t enough another year of sub 2 growth which is my base case will be another year of suffering for the millions whom this weak recovery hasn t helped and it s not clear that we can avoid a recession one third of economists surveyed by the wall street journal think we will see a recession next year and almost two thirds see a recession by 2021 angst ridden voters no one should be surprised the lower 80 of the income pyramid is anxious and depressed you would be too in their situation and there s a good chance you will be in their situation in a few years because angst ridden people can still vote economic theories aren t relevant to them they look at their own situations and want change history suggests that president trump should win re election unless recession strikes by next november but even if we avoid a recession in 2020 what happens if there is one in 2021 or 2022 democrats could gain power by 2024 if not sooner the already growing annual budget deficit will soar to over 2 trillion how do we finance that without creating more angst i can easily imagine a populist democrat winning the white house followed by higher taxes and an echo recession then even higher deficits and the national debt spinning out of control the fed will give us massive quantitative easing and zero rates but it may be in fact pushing on a string we don t have much time to get our house in order either in the us or globally we can and should take steps to protect our individual families and lives but that s not enough at the national level i m beginning to fear only an enormously stressful great reset will deliver the deep but necessary sacrifices the partisan divide inhibits compromise so nothing happens and the problems grow think about the late 1930s hopefully with just economic turmoil not kinetic war it will be hard but without the kind of motivation i really question whether we will do what it takes sigh
the debacle of arun iii has a lesson project preparation and investment for the scale of arun iii takes many years of time money and effort but it takes a few months of activism to destroy it perhaps no single development issue attracted as much attention controversy and debate in the early nineties as the arun iii hydro project located on the arun river in sankhuwasabha district this project was identified by a jica reconnaissance study in the koshi basin and screened further on the basis of energy capacity distance from the load centre accessibility and rough cost benefit analysis as one of the four attractive projects identified by jica it was subsequently studied up to the pre feasibility level in 1987 a least cost generation expansion plan lcgep was prepared with the help of canadian international water and energy consultants based on an inventory of projects studied up to the pre feasibility level the plan had concluded that the most economic generation sequence to meet the forecasted demand through 2005 would be a combination of load management thermal power and a two stage arun iii project the study had considered various options including both thermal and hydro projects ranging in size from 10 mw modi to 660 mw kaligandaki 2 and an update of lcgep in 1990 had reconfirmed that arun iii was part of the least cost plan the total generation capacity of the project was 404 mw of electricity about the project the government of nepali congress took over in mid 1991 and arun iii was already developed as an essential part of nepal s least cost energy plan for the medium term in response to the concerns about macro economic affordability this project was redesigned in 1992 as a two stage project of 201 mw each this again being reconfirmed as part of the least cost plan in 1994 unlike other projects developed and identified for the future that generated very low firm energy ranging from 15 to 60 percent of the installed capacity in lean seasons arun iii provided about 85 percent of the firm installed capacity even in the dry season of december april the total estimated cost of the project as of 1994 was us 1 08 billion of which about two thirds was committed by external agencies entirely in the form of grants and soft loans the principal donors included the ida 175 million adb 127 million germany 125 4 million japan 150 million and france switzerland and finland 46 million of the main sources the german assistance was an outright grant the japanese had committed soft loans convertible into grants and the world bank and adb loans represented soft credit payable over a period of 30 40 years at less than one percent service charge others were grant cum credit a rough calculation showed that the foreign assistance package had a seventy percent subsidy element in it and the annual power generation from the project at the prevailing power tariff at that time would yield approximately five billion rupees the debt servicing obligation and operational costs of the project would take about one fifth of this revenue leaving approximately four billion rupees as net revenue to the government for investment in other priority sectors one important component of the project was the 122 kilometre access road to be completed at the cost of 124 million the nepali congress government supported and approved the project after being satisfied with its attractiveness this was further reconfirmed after being subjected to rigorous appraisal and scrutiny at various levels from technical economic environmental social and regional considerations by national and international experts the country had already spent us 20 million for pre feasibility feasibility and the engineering designs dozens of public hearings and consultations were conducted at the national level and with local bodies user groups and other stakeholders including the inhabitants of the project affected areas the support was enthusiastic particularly from the affected areas where roads were expected to bring benefits to the local population controversy and cancellation unfortunately the project attracted unprecedented debate and controversy both within and outside the country by a powerful network of international non governmental organizations the opposition instigated by business interests and the thermal lobby was natural however the staunchest anti arun campaign was launched by international ngos and their local counterparts in various financial capitals including washington dc manila tokyo and bonn some of the lead international ngos opposing this project were uk and usa based international rivers network international technology development group the globe international greenpeace and environment defense fund and friends of the earth prominent nepali ngos which opposed the project included alliance for energy inhured international and arun concerned group the controversy took a political turn when the communist party of nepal criticized the gp koirala led nepali congress government for promoting the project without creating a national consensus and studying alternative scenarios they were also suspicious of the role of commission money behind the project the national planning commission npc became the target of much criticism for pursuing a wrong mega projects policy in the hydro sector and negotiating this expensive project in a haste to find faults in our approach facts were mixed with fiction till their distinction reached its climax when the general secretary of nepal communist party uml madhav kumar nepal wrote a letter on october 18 1994 to the world bank president expressing serious reservations about the way the project has been designed and proposed he also wrote that he would undertake a fresh review of the cost benefit and the environmental side of the project before taking any final decision if elected to form a new government in nepal the letter also questioned the mandate of the then caretaker government to make a decision on such a vital project the timing of this letter could not have been more critical as nepal was preparing for mid term elections and the world bank board was scheduled to give final approval to the project on november 3 1994 it is absurd that the letter mentioned a lack of project debate in nepal s parliament and challenged the competence of the caretaker government to take a decision both these assertions were at variance with the truth first the project was debated in the parliament based on the motion of public importance tabled by a prominent uml leader second the question of the competence of a caretaker government was not valid since the project had already been negotiated and processed by the full fledged cabinet before the announcement of the election the only formality remaining was the approval by the world bank board of directors naturally the world bank took the content of the letter seriously as it came from the leader of the major opposition party which stood a chance of winning the election consequently it deferred the final project decision on the project the mid term elections in november produced a hung parliament with no party winning majority seats the cpn uml which emerged as the single largest party and the anti arun campaign was gaining strength a new management had assumed office in the world bank and they did not share the same commitment to the project as their predecessors sensing the seriousness of this problem this author as a member of opposition tabled a motion of public importance in the house of representatives demanding the immediate government decision on the project i warned that any delay to take a decision could lead to the loss of the project on which the nation had invested so much energy resources and time the debate on the motion continued until late night with unprecedented participation all party leaders including some members of the ruling party spoke in favor of an immediate decision the response from the minister of water resources was non committal raising several questions about the design and cost of the project which he said needed to be sorted out before any decision was made subsequently the minister dashed to washington dc naively believing that he could reduce the project cost by redesigning a project which was already processed for final formal approval the project had already been subjected to thorough scrutiny from all possible angles by the best possible professionals the world bank was not convinced of the government s commitment to the project on august 3 1995 the new world bank president james wolfensohn cancelled the project in agreement with the government of nepal referring to his telephone conversation with prime minister manmohan adhikari he said priority would now be given in devising and implementing alternative strategy of meeting its needs for electric power in cancelling the project the president gave three reasons concern regarding nepal s management capability to meet the demands and long list of actions which the project of this size and complexity would involve difficulty in gaining popular support in implementing a number of measures including power tariff and prioritization of public expenditure and difficulty in mobilizing additional 30 40 million cost overrun as a result of the delay in project implementation these arguments were not very convincing the first two concerns were raised many times before and were fully addressed the inspection panel which the bank had set up to review the social and environmental questions raised by ngos found no fault in the way the project was designed the president had cancelled the project without even discussing it with the board of directors where other co financing partners would have presented their respective positions in fact some of the concerned financing partners were surprised at the world bank s decision it was particularly surprising since it had championed this project for about a decade in this way the bank had virtually led the country to a no option trap immediate fallout of the project was the joy and celebration by the anti arun ngos the world bank management had been the target of attack of this group for promoting destructive megaprojects and its new president who came from an investment banking background the president s decision pleased this group and his acceptability with them was established it is sad that even joseph woods a world bank vice president who had worked hard to promote this project fell in line with the new management s approach he said that the signal we would send out is that the bank no longer supports infrastructure projects like this ironically just a few months after this decision the world bank approved a mammoth 1450 mw ghazi barotha hydroelectric project in pakistan and a 11 km jamuna bridge in bangladesh this only indicates how a small and poor country tends to fall victim to the changing approach of mega institutions influenced by a network of interest groups allegations vs facts the first criticism was that arun iii was a huge project costing more than nepal s annual budget it was alleged that nepal did not have the management capacity to implement such big projects and only big international contractors and their local commission agents would prosper it would crowd out small scale projects and nepal would not be allowed to promote project above 10 mw after accepting arun iii therefore an alternative approach was necessary with an emphasis on small projects to be implemented by indigenous capacity second it was pointed out that this project would cost 3 800 per installed kw whereas private companies could produce power at half that price the project would make the power tariff unaffordable and the loan component of the project would impose a huge debt servicing burden on the economy third the project would have adverse effects on natural resources such as land forests fisheries and the socio cultural environment of the arun basin where 450 000 population of 10 ethnic groups lived comparisons were made with the controversial narmada project of india small vs big debate the charge that arun iii s cost was equivalent to one year s national budget did not make economic sense since the project expenditure was spread over eight years and it did not crowd out other priority development activities the allegation that the nepali congress government favored only big projects was equally invalid since one of the important policy departures made by the national planning commission in the early nineties was the emphasis given to the micro sector particularly in energy generation irrigation roads and similar development projects programs were formulated to implement small hydro and other similar schemes for districts which had no access to electricity the proponents of the alternative approach had proposed to transfer the planned arun iii funds for the construction of 10 different smaller scale projects to spread the risk this looked fine in principle but experience showed that the process of developing alternative hydropower projects is far more difficult and time consuming they take a long time for investigation feasibility detailed engineering financial mobilization and subsequently implementation many investors visited nepal with investment proposals provided the government would assure them of the required amount of energy the historical electricity sales curve also showed big sales growth in years when major hydro projects were commissioned therefore the challenge for policy makers and planners is developing projects of all sizes and from all sources private public internal and external without such an approach meeting the ever increasing electricity demand would not be possible let alone for export and making it an engine for growth debt power tariff and cost the allegation that the project would impose a huge debt burden on the economy was false as even skeptics accepted that the most attractive feature of arun iii was its financial package over half of the external assistance was in the form of grants the remaining debt portion was of a concessional nature carrying around one percent interest rate and payable over 40 years with a grace period of an additional 10 years the project would have generated a minimum of five billion rupees 100 million annual revenue at the prevailing tariff at that time at the present rate it would be about eight billion not more than 20 percent of the revenue generated by the project would have gone to service debt the rest being available for investment in other priority areas such as poverty alleviation rural development education and health out of all the investment projects supported with external credit in nepal it is only the investments in hydro power and telecommunications that has generated revenue sufficient not only to service debt but also produced large amount of social profit for government investment in fact of all the projects studied until then arun offered the cheapest firm energy that is at the rate of 5 94 cents per kw hr if one takes into account only the cost of the project to the national economy the production cost of both firm and average energy by arun iii would have been less than 2 us cent per kw hr we did not come across any firm proposal which would generate power at a cost even remotely close to this figure criticisms were made that implementation of projects such as arun could lead to concentration of wealth in a few hands as it would enrich big contractors and commission agents but it would be impractical to stop a road or irrigation or a power project simply because some contractors agents or businessman could benefit from them if there is international capital coming from agencies like the world bank or the asian development bank one has to accept international competitive bidding to the member countries for major contractual and procurement works under bilaterally funded projects contractors from the concerned donor countries will get the contract if we do not accept such conditions the recipient countries are free to choose a different type of financing model and forget about foreign assistance exaggerated environmental issues some critics abroad were bent on exaggerating the environmental and cultural damage from this project comparisons were often made with the controversial narmada dam of india without considering the fundamentally different natures of the two projects a group of western ngos said the threatened area is one of the last virgin forests in the himalayas the road would endanger a proposed national park the milke danda area as well as the hurure chilchia cloud forest three sal forests would also be at risk the dam will destroy fisheries 21 bird 42 plant and 13 fish species endangering plants mammals butterflies reptiles and so on to compare arun iii with the narmada dam which involved the construction of a huge reservoir displacing a population of about 67 000 largely indigenous tribes and submerging approximately 11 000 ha of forest land was simply ridiculous the project had the regional action plan and environmental mitigation program with a total budget of us 18 6 million to mitigate the negative impacts on the environment adequate provisions were also made for forest conservation environmental mitigation and preservation of biodiversity religious monuments artifacts and the development of micro hydro and rural roads a national loss arun iii was lost and with it the attractive financial package whose benefits included the huge social profit potential to boost the national revenue also vanished the eastern development region has been prevented from precious developmental opportunities which the multiplier effects of this project would have created the dream of the poor people of the arun valley who are forced to bear the pain of carrying bags of salt fertilizer and other essentials for several days to have a road to ease their drudgery was dashed it may be a long while before the project is brought back for implementation the internal capacity to develop the project does not exist and the possibility for availing grants and soft loan packages is extremely remote accessing concessional loans for a capital investment project of a commercial nature like electricity will be increasingly difficult in the coming days it is also estimated that about a trillion dollars will be required for financing the power sector expansion plans of low income countries during this decade as the international financial institutions are unable to meet this requirement with soft loans alternative sources including the commercial loans and private capital will have to be mobilized under harder terms and with higher repatriation of dividends and debt servicing requirements even this does not seem remotely possible under the country s present investment climate and in the absence of access road in place even in the unlikely scenario of getting the capital investment the project cost will be several times higher the naïve belief that the funds committed for arun iii could be transferred to an alternative approach did not materialize the world bank had promised to fund an alternative power generation plan but in the last eight years after the cancellation of arun not a single project of power generation was supported by this institution an umbrella project called power development fund with ida credit of us 75 million compared to 175 million committed to arun iii was recently approved with the objective of supporting private sector projects but its implementation is yet to take off thanks to the then government s foresight in promoting the kaligandaki a the country did not go dark the asian development bank and the government of japan were successfully persuaded to jointly support this project this support was irrespective and independent of arun iii and therefore there was no transfer of funds committed to arun only the funds committed to arun iii by germany was transferred to mid marshyangdi hydro project that too after a lot of persuasion one positive development in the last decade has been the development of private sector power generation but the foreign exchange implications and other unfavorable aspects in the power purchase agreement due to poor negotiations have caused a tremendous financial burden on the nea the total sales proceeds from the power procured from the private producers is less than what the nea pays as the procurement price the nea is obliged to buy all power produced from these schemes irrespective of their marketabilty particularly in the surplus season the nea loses approximately a billion rupees annually on this account the debacle of arun iii has a lesson if only we are prepared to learn it project preparation and investment for the scale of arun iii takes many years of time money and effort even when goodwill and congenial atmosphere for development assistance prevail but it takes a few months of determined activism to destroy it in this world of instant global communications opposition to such project can always be expected from the global network of organizations for ideological and other reasons but when national policy makers themselves fall prey to wrong and motivated advice the nation suffers once undone recovery cannot happen early and easily the author is former finance minister of nepal the article is an edited version of the case study of the author published by university of new mexico
we recently caught up with evan kuo ceo at ampleforth a new crypto asset protocol for developing fair and independent money kuo a mechatronics robotics and automation engineering graduate from the university of california berkeley argues that bitcoin btc the flagship cryptocurrency has the potential to transform the world s financial system however the tech entrepreneur questions whether or not bitcoin or other similar cryptocurrencies will be able to outgrow their function as an investment vehicle or eventually act as a major reserve currency held by financial institutions in an attempt to improve upon the existing bitcoin protocol ampleforth and chainlink have announced an integration that will allow the project s native ampl token which is currently tradable on bitfinex kucoin uniswap and bancor to make enhancements to fixed supply commodity monies like gold and btc you ve mentioned that ampleforth will be the first financial asset that will use chainlink oracles to aggregate off chain pricing data in a secure and timely manner for its protocol the protocol will be integrated with chainlink and includes ampleforth s market oracle volume weighted price and cpi oracle current price target you ve also noted that the oracles will be powered by nine different incoming price feeds from three different aggregators which collectively assist in adjusting ampl s outstanding supply after every 24 hour period please explain how this process works and which price feeds and aggregators are used and why evan kuo we are pleased to be the first monetary asset integrated with chainlink s service this integration helps us further decentralize our oracle by supplying price information from three independent data providers across 9 nodes creating redundancy and minimizing dependence on any single provider chainlink will also serve as an additional provider of monthly pce information from the bureau of economic analysis the pce is a statistical measure that the ampleforth protocol uses to ensure the ampl price target is unaffected by inflation you ve pointed out that by incorporating external data you can further improve what the bitcoin protocol aims to do please tell us how this would create a better or more useful form of money evan kuo from our perspective it was clear that bitcoin s creators had discovered something special the ability to engineer scarcity in a purely digital context and through this discovery bitcoin s creators succeeded in producing a digital gold a commodity money something much more like a natural resource and much less like a bank something potentially fundamental and lasting knowing that digital scarcity could be engineered the next question was clear can we create a commodity money that s better than gold we learned through our research that the great virtue of natural commodity monies like gold and silver is they are absolutely scarce and decentralized the fact that no individual can arbitrarily increase the total supply of natural commodity monies makes them immune to runaway inflation but we also learned that the great failing of natural commodity monies is supply inelasticity natural commodity monies cannot efficiently respond to changes in demand making them vulnerable to destabilizing economic shocks and runaway deflation to address this shortcoming we designed the ampl to automatically propagate price information into supply much like how thermal expansion propagates nearby kinetic energy into a material s volume in the natural world this automatic supply policy is counter cyclical and non dilutive making the ample immune to both runaway inflation and runaway deflation a reliable and decentralized source of price information is critical to this function bitcoins are produced based on a fixed supply schedule meanwhile ampls are counter cyclical and constantly seek price supply equilibria which requires detecting and reacting to market price automatically you mention that ample is a commodity money like bitcoin or gold however it has near perfect supply elasticity like fiat please explain why this is important evan kuo the ampleforth protocol proportionally increases or decreases the quantity of tokens each user holds based on the price exchange rate between the ampl and the 2019 dollar it is counter cyclical in the sense that when there s more demand than supply the protocol automatically increases the total quantity of tokens to prevent the relative price of goods from rising which left alone leads to hoarding and deflationary spiral similarly when there s less demand than supply the protocol automatically decreases the quantity of goods to prevent the relative price of goods from falling lastly because all supply adjustments affect users proportionally the protocol is non dilutive we think this is important because it addresses the only real problem with gold as a base money what are your short term and long term goals for the ampleforth project evan guo at the moment we re looking carefully at the movement pattern of the ampl token our hypothesis is that the fundamental incentives of the system will result in a movement pattern that is altogether distinct from today s digital assets and traditional assets alike this is important because we think it will cause the token to be less correlated with other assets which could be extremely important for diversification in the long run we d love to see the ampl used as reserve collateral in decentralized banks or even central banks what led you to create ampl what were you seeing with bitcoin that led you to invent this interesting protocol evan kuo brandon iles the other co founder of ampleforth and i have always shared in this fascination with building something that could live beyond our time very few things have this lasting quality people machines companies banks even governments come and go but the bitcoin protocol stood out as something that might live on from our perspective it was clear that bitcoin s creators had discovered something special the ability to engineer scarcity in a purely digital context and through this discovery bitcoin s creators succeeded in producing a digital gold a commodity money something much more like a natural resource and much less like a bank something potentially fundamental and lasting knowing that digital scarcity could be engineered the next question was clear can we create something better than gold not a bank but a commodity money we thought perhaps that too could last and what was wrong with gold anyways what else was truly special about bitcoin what made it different from gold we had so many questions and not enough answers so we sought help the journey of answering our questions that s what led us to create the ampleforth protocol so what are ampls and what problem do they solve evan kuo as explained the ampl is a commodity money like bitcoin or gold but with near perfect supply elasticity like fiat it is the first sound money with elastic supply we learned through our research that the great virtue of natural commodity monies is they are absolutely scarce and decentralized since no individual can arbitrarily increase the total supply of natural commodity monies they are immune to runaway inflation but we also learned that the great failing of natural commodity monies is their supply inelasticity they cannot efficiently respond to changes in demand making them vulnerable to economic shocks and runaway deflation this is why we transitioned into pure fiat to begin with after the industrial revolution it became possible to create paper monies that were cheap to produce but expensive to manufacture allowing for high supply elasticity for a time under the bretton woods system these paper monies were redeemable for gold but in 1971 us president richard nixon was forced to cancel the dollar s redeemability to prevent a deflationary spiral had we switched gold for bitcoin under this system we would have been no better off so we designed the ampl to be a suitable base money alternative to gold the ampl has an elastic supply policy that adjusts supply in response to demand however because the protocol s supply changes are automatic and affect everyone equally the ampl is non dilutive and can never be debased by inflation
sweden s central bank ended five years of negative interest rates on thursday when it raised benchmark borrowing costs by a quarter point to zero defying an economic slowdown and global uncertainty the increase from 0 25 per cent makes the riksbank the first of the central banks that pushed rates below zero to inch its way back to what was long considered the floor for interest rates the move has been questioned with sweden s inflation below target industrial activity at its lowest since 2012 and business confidence falling credit peter braig rates are still negative in the euro zone japan denmark switzerland and hungary and with the exception of hungary are expected to remain so for some time to come riksbank governor stefan ingves said negative rates had worked well boosting inflation and the economy
can this eagle be saved gadfly where are the best capitalistic countries a worker and his family in _______ is automatically covered by a taxpayer funded universal healthcare program equal in quality to any on planet earth twenty percent of the costs of their healthcare does not go to paperwork insurance companies doctors out of network agents haggling and denying exorbitant bills and fancy boutique buildings the young children in the family attend a highly professional and ethnically diverse public daycare center with great enrichment activities and professionalism that is almost totally subsidized by taxpayer funds there is a small payment by parents based on the worker s income the children attend k 12 schools which are rated among the best in the world if they go to college it will be tuition free if the worker and his wife have another child they will both be automatically eligible for a combined leave of almost a year the worker has unemployment insurance and annually receives up to six weeks of vacation it is a fact that almost all of the 36 developed countries belonging to the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd could put their name in the blank above except for the united states as of 2017 36 oecd countries make up 62 2 of global domestic product at 49 6 trillion it was organized to stimulate economic progress and enhance world trade over 20 north american and european countries were the original founding members and were later joined by finland japan australia and new zealand of the 36 oecd nations only the united states does not have some form of universal healthcare and many other safety net programs for the poor and the middle classes both the world health organization who and the oecd often rank the united states near the bottom in quality of healthcare and at the top of income inequality in the world write finland in the blank a must read for all 2020 voters is the article by anu portanen and trevor carson in the december 7thnew york times titled finland is a capitalist paradise although they were both successful freelance contractors in brooklyn with one child they described their lives as deeply insecure and anxious because of a bewildering array of private health insurance plans that were very complicated and expensive even the obamacare plans were expensive just last week i read of a fortune 400 company that offered a shocking 48 different health insurance plans for selection by their employees administrative costs average about 20 for these policies while medicare has a 2 rate they had plenty of other worries about the future with a child we d soon face overwhelming daycare costs never mind the bankruptcy sized bills for education ahead whether for housing in a good public school district or for private school tuition and then there d be college in other words we suffered from the same stressors that are swamping more and more of americans even the relatively privileged after considerable study the couple decided to get jobs back in helsinki finland anu s home town our great leader has described nordic countries such as finland as unsustainable and oppressive socialist nanny states socialist is the favorite derisive political word of disaster capitalistic republicans as they travel on our taxpayer owned streets roads interstates bridges and ferries fly out of our socialist airports guided by taxpayer owned systems pick up their freight at socialist ports on the atlantic pacific and gulf coasts and enjoy our national and state parks is supplying k 12 students with a free school lunch capitalistic or socialistic as north dakota trump voters trip the levers in booths probably some of them are thinking about their bank of north dakota 529 education accounts and stopping to buy dakota maid products at very important socialistic north dakota businesses when will these trumpers send their socialistic social security medicare and medicaid checks back to washington so the government is really limited reactions of the family after living in finland for more than a year the couple had been encouraged by relatives friends and even a silicon valley entrepreneur to move to finland this is what they wrote after more than a year living under democratic socialism the difference between our lives here and in the states has been tremendous but perhaps not in the way many americans might imagine what we have experienced is an increase in personal freedom our lives are just much more manageable to be sure our days are still full of challenges raising a child helping elderly parents juggling the demands of daily logistics and work compared with our life in the united states this is fantastic nevertheless to many people in america the finnish system may still conjure impressions of dysfunction and authoritarianism yet finnish citizens report extraordinarily high levels of life satisfaction the oecd ranked them highest in the world followed by norwegians danes swiss and icelanders this year the world happiness report also announced finland to be the happiest country on earth the second year in a row by the way this couple experienced the benefits described in the first two paragraphs why are norway sweden denmark and finland always at the top of every oecd and who index that measures quality of life because over a century or two each has come up with a simple formula that capitalism works better for the common good if workers get paid decent wages and according to the couple are supported by high quality democratically accountable public services that enable everyone to live healthy dignified lives and to enjoy real equality of opportunity for themselves and their children for us that has meant an increase in our personal freedoms and our political rights not the other way around reactions after the family has lived in both countries their reaction is a very powerful statement about the differences in capitalism between nordic countries and the united states capitalists in the u s have taken a different path they ve slashed taxes weakened government crushed unions and privatized essential services in the pursuit of excess profits all of this leaves workers painfully vulnerable to capitalism s dynamic disruptions even well positioned americans now struggle under debilitating pressures and a majority inhabit a treacherous wild west where poverty homelessness medical bankruptcy addiction and incarceration can be just a bit of bad luck away americans are told this is freedom and that it is the most heroic way to live it s the same message finns were fed a century ago then out came the pitchforks in all the streets of finland how can the nordic countries with their programs for the overall common good still produce dozens of billionaires because the rich pay their fair share of taxes in nordic countries most capitalists actually believe in equality of opportunity so they have learned to make investments in all people they believe that paying taxes is an easy way for capitalists to outsource to the government the work of keeping workers healthy and educated meanwhile in the united states capitalists struggle to administer complex and bewildering healthcare plans put together by greedy insurance companies while attempting to recruit educated and healthy workers nordic societies have fought long and hard for high quality public services for all citizens nordic capitalists have finally figured out this is the only way to get government to work for everybody a few u s billionaires are seeing the pitchforks coming down the streets of the highest priced zip codes but many are still too busy stashing billions in tax havens around the world to notice the pissants with pitchforks billionaire warren buffett has been saying for years he should have a higher tax rate than his secretary billionaire peter georgescu recently admitted u s capitalism is slowly committing suicide billionaire ray dalio has also concluded that capitalism basically is not working for the majority of the people the french people knew how to use pitchforks and the great french razor to overcome the plutocracy today the french pitchfork wielders are using national strikes to protect their pensions from the ravages of government i highly recommend national strikes hotel maids waiters amazon workers and airline pilots can close the country down can we fix the broken wing on the american eagle there are dozens of important issues in our polarized country that have been neglected by democratic and republican governments over decades but two of them are more important to the country in the 2020 election healthcare and economic inequality we have the worst healthcare and the worst economic inequality among oecd countries we have 55 million people with no or inadequate health insurance the one percent has grown its income a 100 times faster than the bottom 50 in the last 50 years jeff bezos of amazon bill gates of microsoft and warren buffett of berkshire hathaway collectively have more wealth than 160 million americans making up the bottom 50 of our population we have one political party led by an ignorant jerk who has conned white supremacists racial and religious bigots and angry desperate americans who have been stiffed by both political parties that s why it s pitchfork time in this country there s only one answer to our ineffective terribly expensive crazy quilt healthcare system a universal healthcare system called medicare for all there s only one answer to economic inequality having every class in america pay fair progressive taxes on all income instead of having rich people and corporations squirrel away trillions on tiny islands country tax havens and tax havens in our own country such as delaware and south dakota in modern times we have had only one generation that worked for the common good that s the one following world war ii when unions gained real strength and veterans who had been educated by the gi bill me included then in the 1980 s we had reagan and the california mafia and economic equality started to go to hell for a civilized country a civilization is defined as a condition of human society marked by an advanced stage of development in the arts and sciences and by corresponding social political and cultural complexity to my fellow democrats there are two presidential candidates who have the knowledge intelligence charisma experience and moxie to convince millions of ordinary people to go to polls in 2020 so americans can finally have universal healthcare and regain the equal opportunity prevalent from 1945 to 1975 that means dramatically lowering the present economic inequality by raising wages and progressive tax rates on the wealthy it s way over time for payback for the wealth collected by the one percent both elizabeth warren and bernie sanders understand that political and economic power has to be wrested from the plutocrats corporations and wall street and placed in the hands of the vast majority i think they should make a deal and form a team for 2020 to 2028 bernie at a young 78 can be president for four years and lead the country to medicare for all elizabeth at 70 can be vice president and have wall street and the treasury department as her portfolio then run for president in 2024 we need to fix the broken wing on the eagle
looking back at the third quarter of this year there were gains in all currencies and risk categories sterling portfolios achieved an average return across each three risk categories of 1 7 euro portfolios posted slightly higher returns ranging from 1 5 for low risk to 2 3 for high risk while us dollar low risk portfolios outperformed those in the high risk category equity weighting increased for medium and high risk mandates but in low risk mandates allocations to cash and fixed income increased at the expense of equities and alternatives optimistic indicators the us yield curve inverted in the summer often seen as a signal for economic woes and manufacturing activity as measured by the pmi came in at 47 8 the lowest level for a decade in response to the deteriorating economic outlook the fed cut rates twice broadly as expected however according to frédérique carrier head of investment strategy at rbc wealth management there are many indicators that give reason to remain positive about the us the us consumer is an area which remains robust housing prices remain firm the unemployment rate is at a 50 year low and the savings rate at a robust 7 he says in the uk there were modest gains for equities as a weaker sterling provided a boost for exporters investors favoured more defensive stocks away from financials and commodities which performed less well in politics boris johnson finally got the election he didn t want just as the conservatives were looking like they might get the working majority they need to deliver brexit daniel casali chief investment strategist at smith and williamson says the conservatives returning to government should give us reason to be optimistic we have become more constructive on uk equities over their international peers he says casali adds the conservative party is likely to follow the us lead by cutting red tape under trump the us has cut over 32 000 pages around 30 of the us federal register of regulations while in the uk the change in emphasis in the post brexit agreement with the wording around close alignment moving from the legal agreement to the political declaration gives more scope to deregulate and should lead to higher productivity making headway eurozone markets also made headway led by the defensive sector in july and august with financials making a recovery in september however economic growth remained very weak with the economy expanding by just 0 2 in q2 germany long considered the economic powerhouse of the eurozone only narrowly avoided a recession in q3 however according to casali concerns may be short lived while germany relies heavily on china to buy its goods we believe chinese consumer strength is higher than many people think we expect the effects of more credit stimulus trickling down through the chinese economy will lead to an export recovery in germany in japan the market also remains dominated by concerns over the chinese economy and trade however investors have been encouraged back into the market by more attractive valuations as carrier explains we are more positive on japan a market that has been under owned for a while and is now looking relatively cheap he says some managers are suggesting central banks will be reluctant to raise rates if inflation picks up and as a result have been focusing on companies with reliable pricing power and low cyclicality carrier explains we have recently introduced an exposure to infrastructure to our portfolios infrastructure tends to be a resilient asset class with stable cashflows and low correlation to business cycles infrastructure should also benefit from more public spending although it could take some time for the positive effects to work through the economy black swan events there have been violent clashes between protesters and police in hong kong as people take to the streets in a rejection of the imposing of control from central government according to casali however the likelihood of significant escalation remains low hong kong is a possible black swan event he says however china is unlikely to want to roll their tanks in given the precarious trade relationship with the us and the fact that chinese state owned industries rely heavily on hong kong to raise capital in the us the impeachment of donald trump continues to play out on the political stage but does not seem a concern for investors the focus is on who will take on trump in next year s election according to rbc s carrier the impact on election expectations and the economy will depend on who emerges as the democratic frontrunner a less business friendly candidate would impact market sentiment however it is too early to judge how this will play out casali echoes this sentiment elizabeth warren s progressive agenda which includes a halt to
