free trade is the modern form that imperialism takes it is a system that protects and expands inequalities of power both between and within countries free trade empowers global north multinational corporations to continue with minimal interference and tacit approval from global south governments the unequal trade they developed with the global south during colonialism further it allows global north multinationals with their junior partners global south multinationals to increase inequality around the world by pitting working class people in the global north and global south against one another another way is possible in order to build a progressive international political economy that produces material dignity and freedom for all the world s people we need to engage three distinct yet interrelated projects we can build each project piece by piece advancing all three at the same time the vision for what the three projects become can help us continue to build popular support as we advance each of the projects toward creating a transformed and democratic world economy first we need trade agreements that include strong labor environmental and antitrust regulation in all countries and agreements that end offshore tax havens for the wealthy and create fair access to markets for global south producers these agreements can allow us to rapidly address some of the worst multinational corporate abuses they can also create space for us to continue to build the other two projects especially the solidarity economy institutions that can become the base for popular progressive power that we will need in order to organize to create a transformed world economy second we need democratic international institutions that transfer technology and productive wealth from the global north to the global south so that we can begin to undo the ongoing violence of centuries of colonialism and imperialism we can also use these institutions to coordinate investment in a just transition led by indigenous people and the mostly black and brown people who are on the front lines of the climate crisis to a renewable energy economy a program that can become an international version of a green new deal third we need to build local and democratically controlled solidarity economies which can become the means for popular democratic control of the economy national and sub national democratic solidarity economies can become the building block for creating bottom up and democratic international institutions only by creating democratic control of the economy can we make the economy accountable to democratic governments as progressives in the us begin to imagine and to build this kind of international economic system we can look to movements who are leading the way on building local democratic economies that prioritize production for human need over profit including the zapatistas in mexico democratic municipalists in cities like jackson mississippi and barcelona spain and the democratic confederalists of the rojava region in syria through coordination between place based solidarity economies around the world we can build a bottom up democratic international economic system project one better trade agreements the first project for building alternatives to free trade is creating better trade agreements free trade agreements allow multinationals to invest their capital with very little restriction anywhere in the world to resist the worst multinational corporate abuses we need trade agreements through which the people of the world act together to regulate multinational corporate activity if progressives can take leadership over the democratic party negotiating better such agreements is something we can act on in the short term building on the models for better trade agreements proposed by public citizen and the institute for policy studies we can create agreements that establish an international living wage safe working and housing conditions and environmental restrictions that curb and ideally eliminate completely environmental pollution and the extraction of unrenewable and finite natural resources from the planet we can also coordinate taxing multinationals at the international level so that they cannot pit countries against one another to evade taxation improved trade agreements can also include international level antitrust regulation so that we can limit the size and power of individual multinationals and bans on financial derivatives that facilitate currency speculation which serve no economic purpose and can send national economies into crisis we can also use trade agreements to provide access to markets for global south producers as the united nations conference on trade and development unctad acknowledged in the 1960s global south producers need preferential access to buyers of their manufactured and high tech goods if they are ever to gain and equitable share of the production of such goods further trade agreements could limit the power of landlords along the lines of the zapatista s urban land reform laws which cap rent payments at 10 percent of a renter s income and could be the basis of international rent control as well as the zapatista s revolutionary agrarian law which could provide people with rights to confiscate land owned by absentee landlords though we can create better trade agreements in the relative short term trade agreements are a relatively weak tool for transforming the international political economy trade agreements regulate multinational corporate activity yet they leave multinationals in control of the world s productive capital multinationals are accountable for producing profit for their shareholders a privileged few they are not accountable to producing for human needs to create an economy that is accountable for producing for the material dignity and freedom of everyone we need to displace the corporate economy with solidarity economy institutions that are owned and controlled by everyone project two democratic international institutions and global north reparations the second project to create alternatives to free trade is to create new democratic international institutions that transfer wealth from global north multinationals to the global south we can conceive of this as part of global north reparations owed from centuries of colonialism and ongoing free trade imperialism to create these institutions we will need to also create local solidarity economies the third project discussed below today s international institutions are not democratic in the sense that they don t provide equal input for all countries let alone for all people around the world the united nations security council is controlled by the world s most powerful countries which have permanent seats voting within the international monetary fund and the world bank is proportional to the money that a country contributed which obviously favors the wealthy countries voting to create new world trade organization wto policies normally require consensus from each member government which is why powerful countries bypass the wto and create free trade agreements with multiple countries at a time that build on already existing wto policies mass trade in necessities is a key aspect of the commodification of everything and the basis for the capitalist economic system that capital owners use to render democracy ineffectual nonetheless to create an international political economy that is accountable to and produces for all people in the world we need democratic institutions to control the international political economy we can create these by creating solidarity economy institutions at the national and sub national level these institutions can then coordinate to build bottom up democratic international institutions an international version of the confederation of decentralized and local democratic institutions that the kurds are building in the rojava region of syria for instance democratic international political economy institutions that transfer wealth and technology from the global north to the global south can be based on the 1960s unctad vision these institutions should perform at least five key functions one function can be to provide grants from the global north to global south so that global south producers preferably solidarity economy institutions can develop the capacity to make the most profitable advanced goods another key function can be to transfer technical knowledge from the global north to the global south under the status quo multinationals are allowed to keep private any technological advancements this new system would facilitate use of technological advancements for the benefit of everyone a third purpose of these democratic international institutions can be to fairly coordinate access to markets colonial era international trade was the first instance in human history in which people entered into mass trade in necessities across vast distances this means that people started consuming every day necessities that were produced very far away previously international trade had only involved luxury goods consumed by elites in different parts of the world mass trade in necessities is a component of the international political economy developed by and for capital owners it is a key aspect of the commodification of everything and the basis for the capitalist economic system that capital owners use to render democracy ineffectual we need an international institution to coordinate production that is far more resource efficient and ecologically sustainable groups of producers throughout the world can use this institution to coordinate where goods will be made and sold in a way that prioritizes the consumption of goods close to their site of production a fourth function that democratic international institutions can serve is to coordinate the huge capital investment required for a just transition to an international renewable energy economy we can conceive of this kind of coordinated investment as a green new deal for the world economy this investment should be financed primarily if not exclusively by global north multinationals and governments as these global north multinationals are responsible for overwhelming percentages of humanity s historical carbon emissions coordinating this investment should be closely related to the third function of coordinating production of goods and market access across the world a fifth function is to enforce capital controls along the lines of economists john maynard keynes and e f schumacher s vision for an international clearing union and economist yanis varoufakis plan for a new international clearing union based on the keynes schumacher vision both of which i discussed in a previous truthout article the key role of this institution would be to set a narrowly allowed range of capital extraction from global south countries to tax global north countries with the largest trade surpluses and to then recirculate those taxes to people in the global south this institution would advance international economic stability more than it would advance international economic equity it would become less and less important as people throughout the world coordinate production and market access plans that prioritize local production for local consumption we can finance these institutions in multiple ways one way is through an international tax on multinationals with a higher rate for global north multinationals another way is through internationally coordinated public spending today s banks after all have privatized the public good of money production governments which possess no limits on the amount of currency they can create can directly take control of the money production system and use it to support the production of everything that everyone needs a democratic money creation system could entail public banks at the national and sub national level coordinate the amount of currency they will produce some of this money can be used to finance all of the previously mentioned institutions some though definitely not all of the above discussed functions for democratic international institutions can be created through policy in already existing international institutions in certain circumstances the wto s generalized system of preferences gsp allows global north countries to violate the free trade principle of non discrimination by allowing a limited number of imports from eligible global south countries on preferable terms lower tariffs or duties than are applied to imports from other countries the gsp could be significantly expanded to facilitate global south producers attaining more equitable market access next the wto free trade framework bans dumping the practice of a corporation often benefiting from government subsidies selling their goods abroad at lower prices than they do in their domestic market the wto framework could be reformed to allow for dumping more often by global south producers and to bar global north governments from using anti dumping measures this could facilitate global south producers gaining greater access to global north markets which the unequal terms of trade developed during colonialism have historically denied to them the wto could repeal trade related aspects of intellectual property rights which would eliminate the international intellectual property rights that global north multinationals enjoy and facilitate much more equitable sharing of technology around the world lastly the wto could reform trade related investment measures trims to allow governments to favor local producers through their own procurement practices and by creating standards that require foreign corporations producing in their country to use certain levels of locally produced inputs creating new international institutions and reforming existing international institutions will both require enormous amounts of political organizing given this it makes more sense to create new institutions that are intended to perform new functions as opposed to reforming existing institutions which were created to facilitate continued global north multinational control of the world economy with many highly technical changes similar to those described above project three solidarity economies around the world the third project to create alternatives to free trade is to build local and democratic solidarity economies in the us and around the world by working with solidarity economies throughout the world including the zapatistas in chiapas mexico the municipalists in spain and the democratic confederalists in the mostly kurdish and autonomous region of rojava in syria we can shift wealth and political power to the grassroots masses and away from multinationals and we can begin to build bottom up democratic international institutions government policy can help expand cooperatives in many ways we can pressure governments to shift their purchasing power to cooperatives and away from the small number of large corporations that currently receive most public contracts currently doing so might violate the trims agreement within the wto free trade framework governments at any level could take more aggressive measures and cease recognizing investor owned corporations which are not democratic institutions instead governments could require businesses that want the privileges that come with incorporation including limited liability protections to operate as cooperatives with rights for workers and perhaps surrounding communities to decision making and profits as explored in more depth in a previous article we can use land labor and money solidarity economy institutions to deliberately displace multinational corporate political and economic power and move toward democratic control of the world economy locally rooted solidarity economies throughout the world can work together to build the bottom up democratic international institutions through which we can finance solutions to collective problems and through which we can coordinate the production of all the goods and services that everyone needs to live dignified and free lives negotiating better trade agreements which we can work on as soon as progressives can gain leadership within the democratic party can help us resist multinational corporate power and create space to build solidarity economy institutions and bottom up democratic international institutions solidarity economy institutions which are themselves democratic and independent from traditional political institutions including political parties can become the base for popular progressive power that we will need in order to organize to create a transformed world economy before you go truthout faces a serious threat after 22

for the heads of state and corporate leaders gathering this week in davos switzerland for the world economic forum the chinese economy could be the most pressing issue even among the trade fights and political uncertainty plaguing the rest of the world previous slowdowns in china like the one in 2015 and 2016 unnerved investors and global business leaders alike setting off worries that multinational companies would lose profits from their chinese subsidiaries or that chinese companies would dump their surplus production on world markets at very low prices china will be one of the main topics of conversation at the world economic forum in davos credit bloomberg apple surprised markets this month when it warned of weaker than expected demand for its iphones in china ford motor cut output at its chongqing joint venture by 70 per cent in november in what ford says was a move to reduce inventories of unsold cars chemical industry experts said that mostly chinese owned chemical factories in jiangsu had been shutting down because of weak demand and stricter environmental enforcement the question now is to what extent nervous business leaders elsewhere will postpone investment as china slows and how many investors will dump their shareholdings the global economy and financial markets are incredibly sensitive to china s growth and currency outlook said robin brooks chief economist at the washington based institute of international finance the immediate financial linkages are relatively modest but they are swamped by sentiment channels loading to be sure further slowing in china is not the only risk the global economy faces a disorderly british exit from the european union or a financial crisis in debt ridden italy could also be unsettling in the united states the national debt is rising and the stimulus from large tax cuts may start to wear off by next year the federal reserve could keep raising interest rates to keep inflation at bay making it more expensive to borrow money though it isn t clear exactly what the american central bank will do still the big question now is to paraphrase the line about las vegas will what happens in china stay in china or will it become a global problem the world bank aptly titled its review of this year s outlook darkening prospects it warned that china s slowdown could affect countries that export a great deal to it china is the world s second largest importer after the united states but the composition of its imports is unusual alarm bells sounded when apple said growth in china was slowing credit bloomberg it is the largest market for a long list of commodity exporters from australia to uruguay thanks to its voracious appetite for iron ore food energy and other raw materials it needs to keep its economy humming china is also a large market for factory equipment made in countries like germany and japan but its imports of manufactured goods overall are few for an economy of its size that has limited the dependence of workers elsewhere particularly in the united states on the chinese economy the global impact of the chinese slowdown underway could be limited if beijing decides to borrow and spend its way into more growth already this month china has issued a series of announcements approving six municipal subway construction projects and three new intercity rail lines at a combined cost of us148 billion the weaker the data gets the more confident we get that they ll tip a lot of stimulus into keeping the economy moving said michael blythe chief economist at the commonwealth bank of australia in sydney many of the biggest new construction projects are in china s western regions said wang min chairman of xuzhou construction machinery group a state owned giant the projects have been good for his company china s largest producer of huge earth moving equipment and its orders have soared in recent months but linking together towns in sparsely populated areas of mountains and deserts is expensive it adds large sums to china s already very high levels of debt and the investment may produce scant new economic activity to pay off that extra debt previously accumulated debt lies at the heart of a one two punch that has laid china s overall economy low in recent months vice premier liu he promised at davos a year ago that china would rein in the growth of credit within three years chinese officials were confident at the time that they could head off a trade war with the united states they set about putting stringent limits on the country s extensive shadow banking networks those networks had been providing a gusher of loans to the country s small and midsize enterprises which china s big state owned banks have long neglected in favour of lending to state owned enterprises china s property sector is stuttering credit bloomberg but by the end of april as the economy started slowing chinese officials started to say that three years was not enough time as credit dried up and many private sector businesses started running low on cash top regulators expressed worry at a shanghai financial conference in june that they might have already gone too far at the same time momentum was building in beijing to extend the influence of the communist party and state owned enterprises mainly at the expense of the private sector the private sector is responsible for most job creation in china and the rhetoric from beijing further scared investors less than a month after the shanghai conference the trade war began in earnest president donald trump imposed the first of three tranches of tariffs on imports from china corporate executives say that by the time the third tranche hit in late september consumer confidence was crumbling purchases of big ticket goods especially cars fell fast business confidence slumped as well a survey of 270 importers in the united states conducted in late december and early january by panjiva a trade data service found that 71 per cent planned to change how and where they bought their goods if tariffs stayed unchanged and 87 per cent said they would do so if the trump administration raised tariffs further as companies start moving their supply chains the main beneficiaries seem to be southeast asian nations like vietnam and indonesia but to the extent that those countries buy more factory equipment from places like germany some of the negative effects overseas from weaker sales in china could be offset most economists are predicting that the first quarter of this year will be weak in china many are predicting that the second will be too but quite a few say they still have confidence in china s consistent four decade track record of pulling itself out of slumps quickly chinese officials have put new emphasis in recent weeks on rebuilding confidence and they are at least trying to reassure private companies that the government will not favour state owned enterprises over them
changes net foreign assets to foreign assets in 14th paragraph beirut jan 17 reuters financial strains in lebanon have been brought into focus by turbulence on markets where its dollar denominated sovereign bonds suffered a heavy sell off last week following comments by the finance minister about the public debt the bonds recovered this week on assurances the government is absolutely not planning to restructure the debt and is committed to paying its maturing debt and interest payments at predetermined dates but the episode has added to debate about lebanon s debt sustainability after warnings from politicians the imf and world bank over economic and financial conditions in a country that has suffered years of low economic growth lebanon s factional politics has led to years of policy paralysis and obstructed reforms needed to boost investor confidence more than eight months after an election politicians have been unable to agree a new government what are the problems lebanon has one of the world s biggest public debts compared to the size of its economy largely generated through servicing existing debt and high state spending it amounts to roughly 150 percent of gdp the world bank has estimated that financial transfers to the state owned power producer alone averaged 3 8 percent of gdp from 2008 to 2017 a public sector wage increase in 2017 and higher interest rates have added to pressures on the budget deficit lebanon also has a current account deficit because it imports far more than it exports financing these two deficits has depended on critical financial transfers from its diaspora but questions over this model have grown at the heart of concerns is the recent slowdown in remittance deposit inflows which have traditionally funded a large part if not all of lebanon s financing requirement goldman sachs said in a dec 3 analysis the world bank in an october report said lebanon was exposed to significant refinancing risks attracting sufficient capital and in particular deposits to finance significantly larger budgetary and current account deficits is proving challenging in light of slower deposit growth story continues lower oil prices have been seen by economists as a major cause of the slowdown with many lebanese working in oil producing gulf arab states political instability and lower growth in lebanon have also been cited as factors economic growth rates have fallen to between 1 and 2 percent from between 8 and 10 percent in the four years before syria s civil war began in 2011 how urgent is the situation central bank governor riad salameh said last month the banking sector was capable of financing the state s foreign and domestic debt in 2019 the central bank s foreign assets stand at around 40 billion the financial system has proven resilient through political crises assassinations and war the lebanese pound peg against the u s dollar has been stable for over two decades often in the absence of effective government the central bank has maintained stability using stimulus packages and unorthodox financial operations made possible by large diaspora deposits into the banks but since 2016 the slowdown in non resident inflows prompted the central bank to embark on financial engineering to draw more dollars to its reserves the world bank and imf have praised the central bank for a critical role but the world bank s october report noted some central bank tools were becoming less effective and that lebanon s risk profile was rising sharply confidence is critical to encouraging the inflows upon which the system rests this would be boosted if a new government was agreed and moved quickly towards making reforms of the power sector this could unlock some 11 billion in funding pledged by foreign states and institutions last year for a capital investment programme where does hezbollah figure in this the power wielded by the iran backed lebanese shi ite group hezbollah is at the heart of tension between lebanon and gulf states such as saudi arabia that once supported beirut but have turned their attention elsewhere in recent years goldman sachs noted that one cause of the slowdown in remittance and deposit growth was the perceived reduced likelihood of external support in light of heightened tensions between lebanon and the oil rich gulf countries the heavily armed group is listed as a terrorist group by the united states and fought a war with israel in 2006 we have warned for some time that if there was a fresh escalation of tensions with gulf countries or israel that could lead to another period of capital flight that puts the dollar peg under pressure jason tuvey of capital economics said the united states has tightened financial sanctions against hezbollah part of its wider effort to counter iran the lebanese banking sector has been applying these measures and anti money laundering legislation lebanon lobbied washington in 2017 to balance its tough anti hezbollah stance with the need to preserve the country s financial stability consequently sanctions were altered enough to allay fears of major economic damage the application of such measures may have weighed on some inflows to lebanon though it is difficult to know to what extent tuvey said can the next government fix the problem once prime minister designate saad al hariri manages to form a government investors will be looking for follow through on promises of reducing the budget deficit but there are concerns that politics could get in the way of reforms once again lebanese and international stakeholders agree that the budget deficit needs to narrow but a credible actionable plan for achieving this is still lacking and it remains unclear if political dynamics will allow for a concerted fiscal adjustment fitch ratings said writing by tom perry editing by pravin char
the euro is celebrating its 20th anniversary this month but they aren t popping corks across the continent except perhaps with the notable exception of delusional eurocrats such jean claude juncker president of the european commission who argued the euro has become a symbol of unity sovereignty and stability it has delivered prosperity and protection to our citizens some prosperity much of the continent is characterized by double digit unemployment rising inequality political strife and a virtual lost generation of youth who have never experienced anything remotely approaching a robust ebullient economy greed based integration is giving the eua bad name the worst thing about the eurozone as a whole is the currency union itself the euro reinforces structural inequalities between member states as well as between social groups within countries it is also worth recalling that its creation was supposed to be an intermediate step toward the inevitable formation of a united states of europe of a supranational fiscal authority i e a federal union in which a central government for the whole of europe becomes responsible for the economic stabilization and income redistribution for the whole of the eu while the allocation of resources is left in the hands of the nation state governments that is clearly along ways away given existing political tensions between the creditor nations of the germanic north and the debtor southern periphery nations to quote abraham lincoln a house divided against itself cannot stand nor can a currency union minus a real fiscal authority to go with it since the latter seems politically impossible against a backdrop of brexit yellow vest protests in france and a governing coalition in italy that openly toys with abandoning the euro a more likely outcome is the breakup of the currency union or a model of integration that isn t simultaneously an enrichment program for the investor class in an ideal world the euro s end would come via coordinated action reintroducing national currencies and immediately requiring all tax and other public contractual obligations within the nation to be denominated in that currency so as to create immediate demand for those currencies much more likely however is that the dissolution will occur via disruptive crisis that the euro has survived for 20 years is not a sign that we are moving closer to the day of an ever closer union the longstanding aspiration of the fathers of the modern day european union originally started as the six nation european coal and steel community rather it is a sign of democratic subversion a technocracy run amok that has survived by depriving elected national parliaments of control over fiscal policy taxation spending and the core economic policies of the nation state the euro has been both the method and the cause of this democratic disenfranchisement by design not by accident how you ask because by substituting national currencies with a supranational currency the euro s creation severed the link between state and money and with it the flexibility to confront economic crises of the magnitude that have been experienced throughout the euro s history especially post 2008 it has therefore becomean instrument of greedas it has facilitated a massive wealth transfer toward the top tier of european society along with an evisceration of the social welfare state national parliaments remain therefore constrained because without a national currency they lack the fiscal capacity to respond and they also faced potential bankruptcy much like an american state which is a user not an issuer of the dollar mario draghi s whatever it takes speech in july 2012 alleviated the solvency problem of the national bond markets of countries in the eurozone because the european central bank is the only entity that can create the euros needed to backstop the national bonds credibly that along with some alleviation of fiscal austerity induced a modest cyclical recovery from 2015 to 2018 but the recovery such that it was has proved ephemeral the gdp growth of the european union as a whole has flamed out and is now experiencing its lowest growth in four years the trillions of euros mobilized during successive crises have largely been devoted toward covert bank bailouts and recycling money to creditors rather than assisting the vast army of unemployed greed and while each successive crisis since the euro s inception has hitherto been enough to avert the ultimate blow up of the currency union the poor economic baseline has remained constant in fact economist michael burrage recently compared the economic performance of the 12 founder eurozone members with 10 independent countries which are comparable in terms of economic structure labor institutions and productivity surprise surprise the eurozone countries rank at the bottom it is worth reiterating that this is not a european union problem but a eurozoneproblem because high unemployment caused by austerity policyis an enduring eurozone ez characteristic consider that countries such as norway switzerland and even the uk beset by brexit woes are outperforming the ez countries especially on the unemployment metric the underlying assumption of a common currency namely that it would lead to a convergence of the member countries production employment and trade structures has been proven false other than the currency itself the only commonality in the ez has been poor economic growth in virtually the entire region a one size fits all currency union doesn t work there is a multiplicity of challenges private debt unemployment automation education worker productivity that can only be resolved via more socially inclusive i e generous national supranational development strategies but that is within the purview of fiscal policy which in turn is constrained by the existence of each country effectively borrowing in a foreign currency which is de facto what the euro is given the institutional separation between the state and the currency itself so going back to national currencies seems a necessary first step why not simply attempt to devalue the euro for one thing relying on external boosts to growth via currency devaluation depends on the willingness of other trading partners to adopt growth strategies that will accommodate the resultant increased imports highly problematic in today s increasingly protectionist environment furthermore during previous periods of relative euro weakness the biggest beneficiary by far in the eurozone has been germany as evidenced by the fact that the country has a current account surplus now a shade under 8 percent of gdp which largely comprises the bulk of the european union s external trade surpluses with the rest of the world the rest of the bloc particularly the mediterranean members are still registering subpar growth and substantially higher levels of unemployment so in the first instance a euro devaluation helps germany not the european union as a whole furthermore the common currency means a common monetary policy which has amplified the strains of the eurozone rather than mitigating them in the period leading up to the 2008 global crisis inflation rates in the mediterranean countries were higher which meant that real interest rates were lower hence cheap credit fueled asset bubbles in countries such as greece spain and portugal which in turn provided the illusion that they were converging with the northern european economies by contrast post 2008 european central bank ecb interest rates remained too high for too long for those now debt laden periphery countries and they therefore have suffered greater fall out from the financial crisis than germany the economist servaas storm has quantified the impact during the pre crisis years 1997 2007 membership of emu was beneficial for all countries except germany and italy emu membership is estimated to have increased per capita real incomes in greece portugal and spain by 8 10 things change considerably after 2008 however being part of the eurozone has depressed the real incomes in greece by 16 in italy by 8 in portugal by 4 and in spain by 8 compared to the counterfactual in contrast most northern core economies benefited from their emu membership as their actual per capita income levels are estimated to be higher than in the counterfactual scenario without eurozone membership germany stands out in this post crisis period 2008 2014 with the average german having an actual income which is about 5 higher than the estimated non emu counterfactual the ecb s monetary policy initially fomented asset bubbles in the periphery and then exacerbated debt deflation when these bubbles burst in seeking to mitigate the southern debt deflation post 2008 however the resultant low interest rates fueled a boom in germany this largely explains why berlin s actual income is higher than the estimated counterfactual which would have occurred had germany still been using the deutschmark as the ever vigilant bundesbank likely would have raised interest rates sooner and more aggressively even with a common monetary policy had the eurozone members existed in a federal union comparable to canada or the united states policy makers could have mitigated regional divergences via fiscal transfers or equalization payments and the issue of intra regional trade imbalances would also be a non issue nobody in the u s really cares for example whether new york runs a trade deficit with texas because of the overriding existence of this federal union we call the united states of america but even though there is no common fiscal union the european monetary union custodians have nonetheless imposed a fiscal austerity straitjacket as a precondition of euro membership i e the perversely named stability and growth pact which has delivered minimal growth and lots of instability so countries that earn membership in club euro get the worst of all possible worlds minimal capacity to bolster growth via aggressive fiscal policy just fiscal austerity like joining a religion that offers hell but no heaven fiscal austerity exacerbates productivity differentials less money for investment education social welfare higher unemployment etc and locks the slow growth countries into debt trap deflation and perpetual economic stagnation see greece as exhibit a and no means of inflating away the debt domestically because there is no national printing press last but not least the champions of the monetary union notably those in berlin continue to preach the destructive myth that increased competitiveness via structural reforms which usually means the ability to fire workers more easily and cut social welfare programs will somehow enable the afflicted countries to match germany s economic dynamism however as storm points out countries can t compete if the composition of exports in each country is different germany is strong in medium and high tech manufacturing and this strength shows up in a strong export performance as well as a limited vulnerability to external shocks emphasis mine the strong export performance is in part derived from the fact that high end goods are not particularly dependent on the low labor costs to compete globally by contrast the periphery countries are generally locked into low and medium tech activities many of which compete with china and are therefore much more subject to its competitive threat italy s textile industry being a classic case in point the upshot is that what s good for germany is not so for italy or france and vice versa what is required are distinct national industrial policies aiming at accommodating and diversifying the existing trade structures of the mediterranean countries in particular sadly the eurozone makes no provision for this largely because of the eurozone s deficit phobia as i have written before there is a broader philosophic problem embodied in the pact implicit in the drive to create a stability culture is the belief that public debt is invariably an evil the consequences of which must be stopped at all costs but as events of the past decade have clearly demonstrated excessive private sector debt build up notably in asia and the united states has played a far more destabilizing role in the global economy than fiscal profligacy which undercuts one of the main rationales for retaining the stability pact in its current form if we say that the government can run budget surpluses for 15 years what we are ignoring is that this means the private sector will have to run deficits for 15 years going into debt that totals trillions of dollars in order to allow the government to retire its debt again it is hard to see why households would be better off if they owed more debt just so that the government would owe them less there are very few instances of a controlled dissolution of a currency union and a concomitant re establishment of national currencies one recent example is what occurred after the breakup of the old yugoslavian federation even though the re establishment of national currencies occurred with minimal economic disruption the dissolution did not come without cost as many of the former members of the yugoslavian federation engaged in a costly civil war shorn of tito s organizing genius longstanding suppressed resentments fostered in part by fiscal transfers from the wealthier regions to the poorer ones erupted as the federation fell apart there s no question that a coordinated dissolution among 27 different countries would be considerably more challenging consider what is happening now in the united kingdom where an ostensibly friendly divorce aka brexit has been going on two years has hitherto resolved nothing and in the end may still not occur given the restrictions the uk parliament is now placing on its negotiators it is also worth remembering that the uk does not even share a common currency as it retains the pound in the eurozone itself we would likely witness these same simmering resentments from the wealthier countries which have long criticized the mediterranean scroungers imagine what happens if the next eruption occurs in italy or france with its yellow vest protests presaging trouble there greece or cyprus are child s play by comparison in any conceivable outcome benign or otherwise there will almost certainly be widespread impositions of capital controls and bank holidays to prevent runs on deposits as well as recourse to industrial protection and government controls and supports to mitigate the resultant fall out to say nothing of endless international court challenges given the widespread holding of euros by institutions across the globe but the alternative of the status quo is increasingly untenable given the huge scale of youth unemployment rising inequality and the growing numbers disenfranchised marginalized impoverished and dispossessed by this 20 year experiment in economic sadism less greed is needed for survival if national currencies are to be re established this must come with the reclamation of a nation state more committed to genuine popular sovereignty more democratic less oligarchical control over the economy full employment and a robust network of social welfare provision we ve had far too many examples of the alternatives to contemplate over the course of european history an ever closer union is a worthy aspiration but it should not be focused on one brussels based government obsessing about fiscal austerity budget discipline and focusing its priorities on safeguarding its banks at the expense of the broader population ideally a reformed european union should find its fullest manifestations via cooperative yet independentsovereign nation states grounded in the historically generous social welfare states that characterized the continent in the aftermath of world war ii the urgency reflected in mario draghi s whatever it takes speech would have been more admirable if it had focused noton saving the euro at all costs but rather on establishing a full employment economy that benefits all european citizens not just its financiers and oligarchs there is no point in preserving a currency union if it comes at a cost of sabotaging economic growth and the broad welfare of the eu s citizens likewise the power of the nation state s fiscal policy should not be restricted but freely deployed alongside of or if necessary substituting the market to ensure that equitable prosperity is achieved for the many not the few
for the heads of state and corporate leaders gathering this week in davos switzerland for the world economic forum the chinese economy could be the most pressing issue even among the trade fights and political uncertainty plaguing the rest of the world previous slowdowns in china like the one in 2015 and 2016 unnerved investors and global business leaders alike setting off worries that multinational companies would lose profits from their chinese subsidiaries or that chinese companies would dump their surplus production on world markets at very low prices china will be one of the main topics of conversation at the world economic forum in davos credit bloomberg apple surprised markets this month when it warned of weaker than expected demand for its iphones in china ford motor cut output at its chongqing joint venture by 70 per cent in november in what ford says was a move to reduce inventories of unsold cars chemical industry experts said that mostly chinese owned chemical factories in jiangsu had been shutting down because of weak demand and stricter environmental enforcement the question now is to what extent nervous business leaders elsewhere will postpone investment as china slows and how many investors will dump their shareholdings the global economy and financial markets are incredibly sensitive to china s growth and currency outlook said robin brooks chief economist at the washington based institute of international finance the immediate financial linkages are relatively modest but they are swamped by sentiment channels loading to be sure further slowing in china is not the only risk the global economy faces a disorderly british exit from the european union or a financial crisis in debt ridden italy could also be unsettling in the united states the national debt is rising and the stimulus from large tax cuts may start to wear off by next year the federal reserve could keep raising interest rates to keep inflation at bay making it more expensive to borrow money though it isn t clear exactly what the american central bank will do still the big question now is to paraphrase the line about las vegas will what happens in china stay in china or will it become a global problem the world bank aptly titled its review of this year s outlook darkening prospects it warned that china s slowdown could affect countries that export a great deal to it china is the world s second largest importer after the united states but the composition of its imports is unusual alarm bells sounded when apple said growth in china was slowing credit bloomberg it is the largest market for a long list of commodity exporters from australia to uruguay thanks to its voracious appetite for iron ore food energy and other raw materials it needs to keep its economy humming china is also a large market for factory equipment made in countries like germany and japan but its imports of manufactured goods overall are few for an economy of its size that has limited the dependence of workers elsewhere particularly in the united states on the chinese economy the global impact of the chinese slowdown underway could be limited if beijing decides to borrow and spend its way into more growth already this month china has issued a series of announcements approving six municipal subway construction projects and three new intercity rail lines at a combined cost of us148 billion the weaker the data gets the more confident we get that they ll tip a lot of stimulus into keeping the economy moving said michael blythe chief economist at the commonwealth bank of australia in sydney many of the biggest new construction projects are in china s western regions said wang min chairman of xuzhou construction machinery group a state owned giant the projects have been good for his company china s largest producer of huge earth moving equipment and its orders have soared in recent months but linking together towns in sparsely populated areas of mountains and deserts is expensive it adds large sums to china s already very high levels of debt and the investment may produce scant new economic activity to pay off that extra debt previously accumulated debt lies at the heart of a one two punch that has laid china s overall economy low in recent months vice premier liu he promised at davos a year ago that china would rein in the growth of credit within three years chinese officials were confident at the time that they could head off a trade war with the united states they set about putting stringent limits on the country s extensive shadow banking networks those networks had been providing a gusher of loans to the country s small and midsize enterprises which china s big state owned banks have long neglected in favour of lending to state owned enterprises china s property sector is stuttering credit bloomberg but by the end of april as the economy started slowing chinese officials started to say that three years was not enough time as credit dried up and many private sector businesses started running low on cash top regulators expressed worry at a shanghai financial conference in june that they might have already gone too far at the same time momentum was building in beijing to extend the influence of the communist party and state owned enterprises mainly at the expense of the private sector the private sector is responsible for most job creation in china and the rhetoric from beijing further scared investors less than a month after the shanghai conference the trade war began in earnest president donald trump imposed the first of three tranches of tariffs on imports from china corporate executives say that by the time the third tranche hit in late september consumer confidence was crumbling purchases of big ticket goods especially cars fell fast business confidence slumped as well a survey of 270 importers in the united states conducted in late december and early january by panjiva a trade data service found that 71 per cent planned to change how and where they bought their goods if tariffs stayed unchanged and 87 per cent said they would do so if the trump administration raised tariffs further as companies start moving their supply chains the main beneficiaries seem to be southeast asian nations like vietnam and indonesia but to the extent that those countries buy more factory equipment from places like germany some of the negative effects overseas from weaker sales in china could be offset most economists are predicting that the first quarter of this year will be weak in china many are predicting that the second will be too but quite a few say they still have confidence in china s consistent four decade track record of pulling itself out of slumps quickly chinese officials have put new emphasis in recent weeks on rebuilding confidence and they are at least trying to reassure private companies that the government will not favour state owned enterprises over them
why china and russia are struggling to abandon the us dollar and forge a yuan rouble deal russia and china plan to ditch the us dollar and switch to local currencies in international trade but yet another delay to a new system for yuan rouble settlements shows just how complex it is to develop an alternative to the greenback russia china and a number of other countries are aiming to cut their dependence on the us dollar as washington uses access to the dollar payment system as a weapon to punish nations and individuals for breaking us laws even outside the united states in november russian finance minister anton siluanov said that moscow and beijing were finalising a memorandum to settle more bilateral trade in the rouble and yuan the two countries were also reportedly in talks to launch a new cross border system to improve direct payments of trade invoices and for the use of china s unionpay credit card in russia and russia s mir card in china but late last month russian media quoted siluanov as saying that moscow had decided to step away from beijing s proposed plan talks would continue between the two countries central banks as well as between russia s ministry of finance and china s ministry of commerce the reports said without offering details of the plan given the growth in russia china trade and their opposition to us sanctions via the dollar payment system beijing and moscow were likely to keep working towards a system acceptable to both sides analysts said like a growing number of countries china and russia are keen to work out an alternative to protect their banks and bankrollers from the us secondary sanction power of prosecuting entities that deal with sanctioned companies or individuals from russia iran or venezuela but other nations such as india aim to enter a bilateral arrangement to cut their ballooning trade deficit with china it s no easy task though just before the deal with moscow was put on hold beijing rejected an indian proposal for a rupee yuan transaction system the setback for the new payments infrastructure shows just how difficult it is to shift away from the us dominated status quo dmitry dolgin russia chief economist at ing bank said that the memorandum between china and russia was supposed to improve financial infrastructure for settlements in those currencies the shelving of the agreement means the clearing will not become easier any time soon dolgin said the us dollar is the preferred currency for international trade because it is one of the least volatile and thus less prone to a sudden depreciation russia s rouble is a more volatile currency partly due to existing us and european sanctions and partly because its main export is energy which leaves the rouble vulnerable to changes in petroleum prices evghenia sleptsova senior emerging market economist at oxford economics said that the greater stability of the yuan over the rouble was a plus for russian exporters and a minus for chinese exporters who had no incentive to add currency risks to an already volatile commodity and while china s belt and road initiative and the eurasian economic union are forging economic ties between the two countries china is fast replacing russia as a dominant economic power in the region which might make russia reluctant to accept chinese financing and projects according to otilia dhand senior vice president at london based research firm teneo intelligence russia and china are developing cooperation in several areas and these intensifying collaboration is partially driven by their shared opposition to the us dominance in the world dhand said but the economic gains were modest with some chinese investment falling through in even the most promising areas such as the energy sector she said china has also slowed down its efforts to internationalise its currency in the last three years because of concerns about capital outflows amid slowing economic growth beijing is strictly scrutinising and controlling outbound investments by chinese individuals and businesses even though it encourages foreign investors to plough money into the country still the role of the yuan and the rouble in russia s financial and trade transactions has grown in the last few years and the strategic partnership with china will continue to deepen especially if the us remains in an adversarial position to both according to dolgin that growth has been aided by china setting up a payment versus payment pvp system for yuan rouble transactions in 2017 paving the way for china to use pvp systems for yuan transactions with other currencies along the belt and road route the pvp systems reduce settlement risk as well as the risk of transactions taking place in different time zones and improve foreign exchange market efficiency in 2014 china and russia signed 38 energy trade and finance deals and a currency swap worth 150 billion yuan us 22 billion russia had sought trade links with china after its forceful annexation of crimea soured ties with the united states and european union in bilateral trade with china about 14 per cent of payments are already done in yuan and about 7 to 8 per cent in the rouble according to russia s finance ministry the russian central bank is also buying yuan for its foreign reserves purchasing us 44 billion worth of the chinese currency in the second quarter of 2018 while selling more than us 100 billion of us dollars russia held us 67 billion in yuan as of mid 2018 15 per cent of its international reserves china s yuan has become the fourth largest component of russia s international reserves after the euro 32 per cent the us dollar 22 per cent and gold 17 per cent russia wants to see bilateral trade with china top us 200 billion by 2020

our own measure of economic growth in china the china activity proxy suggests that growth continued to slow last quarter capital economics chang liu wrote other measures of activity such as the manufacturing pmis have also pointed to a further slowdown recently we think that the official figures will be slightly weaker but actual growth was probably much lower capital economics said it did not expect growth in china to steady until the middle of the year we expect the economy to soften further in the quarters ahead domestic headwinds are likely to remain strong credit growth has weakened to the slowest pace in more than a decade due to the impact of earlier policy tightening by the people s bank of china this will continue to drag on economic activity property controls also remain tight which will probably depress housing demand this should in turn lead to a pull back in property construction activity which has been a rare area of strength recently while chinese policymakers are moving to bolster growth capital economics said a rapid turnaround is unlikely and is even more bearish our forecast is for growth to average 4 5 per cent over 2019 as a whole down from just over 5 per cent last year the official gdp data will probably show growth being higher but even on this measure economic growth is likely to slow and capital economics is not pulling any punches about what lies beyond the next decade further ahead the economy faces structural headwinds from slowing capital accumulation and a shrinking labour force with the leadership showing little appetite for the kind of market based reforms needed to raise productivity we expect trend growth in china to fall to 2 per cent by 2030 advertisement locally the focus this week will be on december

kaixin owyong said barring any sharp changes to the unemployment rate in the data next week the rba is on track for its expectation of a 5 per cent average unemployment rate in the december quarter as such the bank will likely continue to expect a gradual tightening in the labour market the key question for markets now is can the rba still afford to be patient with building risks on the global outlook and signs of softer household spending markets have already priced in around a 50 per cent chance of an rate cut by the end of 2019 further there s little sign of accelerating progress on inflation as such we believe the rba s patience will be primarily dependent on retail sales and consumer spending data over the next few months the bank needs to have confidence that consumption remains supported if it is to continue to hold and wait for further gradual progress on inflation and unemployment also ahead this week brexit british prime minister theresa may s plan b is expected

london if there is one useful conclusion that economists and investors can draw from the crazy year that has just ended indeed from the whole crazy decade since the global financial crisis of 2008 it is this as they say in hollywood nobody knows anything in the film industry the richest and most experienced studios and producers spend vast amounts of time and money on audience research but still have no idea if their latest creations will turn out to be hits or flops so why be surprised if the same is true of financial markets or for that matter of commodity prices policymaking and corporate performance why be shocked if the world s richest company admits as apple did after christmas that it has no idea how many iphones it will sell in china or if the world s best informed energy traders predict a global supply shortage that will boost oil prices above 100 just when a supply glut sends the market tumbling to 50 or if the us president does not know if he hates or loves global trade or if stock markets predict a global economic boom when bond markets predict recession and then both reverse suddenly contradicting each other in the opposite direction at this time last year economic expectations were almost universally optimistic every region of the world appeared to be simultaneously booming for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis central bankers were confident that they could safely start to withdraw their extraordinary monetary stimulus and stock market investors were almost unanimously bullish yet 2018 turned into the worst year for investors since the financial crisis forcing central bankers to begin backing away from their plans to normalise monetary policy economists to downgrade their growth forecasts and many businesses to prepare for recession in 2019 or 2020 what went wrong economic data were only slightly weaker than expected in the second half of 2018 the world bank for example has reduced its estimates of global growth in 2018 and 2019 by just 0 1 percentage points to 3 per cent and 2 9 per cent respectively since its june outlook the main cause for concern has been the behaviour of financial markets many economists saw the simultaneous plunge in long term interest rates and equity prices in december as an indicator of recession either investors know something awful that is not yet evident in the statistics or declining market sentiment would become a self fulfilling prophecy by causing businesses or consumers to cut back but before concluding that financial markets can always predict or shape the future we should recall that economic and policy changes usually move financial expectations not vice versa so what events apart from market volatility would cause a recession or severe global slowdown a popular answer is simply the passage of time the global economic expansion that began in 2009 has already lasted almost 10 years if a us recession does not occur by 2020 the country will have experienced the longest uninterrupted expansion in its history there is nothing in economic theory or historical experience to suggest that expansions die of old age or that recessions happen spontaneously but expansions do become more vulnerable to diseases of old age high interest rates rising energy prices accelerating inflation or banking crises that are triggered when unsustainably high property prices suddenly collapse and if none of these economic mishaps occurs eventually political leaders can become recklessly overconfident leading to wars trade conflicts or gross budgetary mismanagement several of these problems began to appear in 2018 rising interest rates in the us fiscal tightening in italy and much of europe an escalating tariff war between the us and china and higher energy prices around the world it is not surprising therefore that the world economy slowed in 2018 instead of accelerating as most economists including me expected but many of the forces that caused last year s slowdown are now reversing oil prices have fallen us bond yields are back to almost where they started in 2018 trade conflicts appear to be subsiding and china is easing macroeconomic policy at least to some extent and will probably move to outright stimulus if its economy weakens much further the policy changes and political events just described were clearly the main drivers of last year s market shocks for example january s stock market correction and volatility surge were clearly caused by fears of us overheating and rising bond yields once the overheating concerns subsided bond repricing turned out to be very limited equities everywhere rebounded and the dollar remained very weak dollar weakness and global equity strength reversed abruptly in may when markets were hit by a perfect storm of the three political shocks that i had considered most likely soaring oil prices in anticipation of iran sanctions the us china tariff war and the formation of a left right populist government in italy in october with political risks receding emerging markets started to outperform stock markets stabilised elsewhere even in europe the oil price returned to what looked like a stable pre sanctions range of 60 65 and the strengthening of the dollar ended in short markets seemed to move broadly in line with the changing political and macroeconomic fundamentals until everything suddenly went haywire in early december for the next three weeks until december 24 the s p 500 collapsed by 16 per cent for no apparent reason brent oil plunged from 61 to 50 the dollar again strengthened and yields on 10 year us bonds fell from 3 per cent to 2 7 per cent if all of the main fundamentals suggest that economic growth in 2019 could end up as strong or even stronger than in 2018 why did equity prices and bond yields suddenly collapse last month could it be that investors are so confused by political chaos that they have given up trying to anticipate what could happen next if so then markets instead of being predictive become increasingly reactive simply extrapolating recent events in a world where nobody knows anything investors may be no better than hollywood

venezuela s hyperinflation hits 80 000 per year in 2018 venezuela s economy has collapsed this is the result of years of socialism incompetence and corruption among other things an important element that mirrors the economy s collapse is venezuela s currency the bolivar it is not trustworthy venezuela s exchange rate regime provides no discipline it only produces instability poverty and the world s highest inflation rate for 2018 indeed venezuela s annual inflation rate at the end of 2018 was 80 000 i observed much of venezuela s economic dysfunction first hand during the 1995 96 period when i acted as president rafael caldera s adviser but it wasn t until 1999 when hugo chavez was installed as president that the socialist seeds of venezuela s current meltdown started to be planted this is not to say that venezuela had not suffered from an unstable currency and elevated inflation rates before the arrival of president chavez but with his ascendancy fiscal and monetary discipline further deteriorated and inflation ratcheted up by the time president nicolas maduro arrived in early 2013 annual inflation was in triple digits and rising venezuela entered what has become a death spiral with the acceleration of inflation the banco central de venezuela bcv became an unreliable source of inflation data indeed in december 2014 the bcv stopped reporting inflation statistics on a regular basis to remedy this problem the johns hopkins cato institute troubled currencies project which i direct began to measure venezuela s inflation back to 2013 so how do we accurately measure venezuela s inflation there is only one reliable way the most important price in an economy is the exchange rate between the local currency in this case the bolivar and the world s reserve currency the u s dollar as long as there is an active black market read free market for currency and the data are available changes in the black market exchange rate can be reliably transformed into accurate measurements of countrywide inflation rates the economic principle of purchasing power parity ppp allows for this transformation and the application of ppp to measure elevated inflation rates is rather simple beyond the theory of ppp the intuition of why ppp represents the gold standard for measuring inflation during hyperinflation episodes is clear all items in an economy that is hyperinflating are either priced in a stable foreign currency the u s dollar or a local currency the bolivar if goods are priced in terms of bolivars those prices are determined by referring to the dollar prices of goods and then converting them to local bolivar prices after checking with the spot black market exchange rate indeed when the price level is increasing rapidly and erratically on a day by day hour by hour or even minute by minute basis exchange rate quotations are the only source of information on how fast inflation is actually proceeding that is why ppp holds and why we can use high frequency daily data to calculate venezuela s inflation rate even during episodes of hyperinflation you may also like and what criteria are used to categorize an inflation as an episode of hyperinflation the following criteria should be met before any episode of elevated inflation be termed hyperinflation an episode of hyperinflation occurs when the monthly inflation rate exceeds 50 mo for 30 consecutive days the hyperinflation episode ends when the monthly inflation rate falls below 50 mo mark unless the monthly inflation should exceed 50 per month for another 30 day period within a year after the first episode is terminated in this case the second episode is not counted as a new hyperinflation episode and but is instead considered a continuation of the original episode in venezuela the monthly inflation rate exceeded 50 mo back on november 13 2016 and remained above 50 mo until december 14 2016 32 consecutive days on december 15 2016 the monthly inflation rate fell below 50 mo mark then on november 3 2017 the monthly inflation rate again exceeded 50 mo threshold before falling below the threshold on december 17 2017 for 44 consecutive days so venezuela has been engulfed in a hyperinflation episode ever since november 13 2016 with another flare up of the same episode occurring during the november december 2017 period venezuela is the only country in the world that is currently experiencing the ravages of hyperinflation as 2018 came to a close venezuela s hyperinflation which i am able to accurately measure by applying purchasing power parity ppp to high frequency reached 80 000 yr and has lasted 25 months devastating as it is 80 000 is a far cry from the international monetary fund s unbelievable end of the year inflation forecast for venezuela of 2 500 000 yr one should never forget that one can measure episodes of hyperinflation with great precision but no one can reliability forecast their durations or magnitudes a fact that has failed to penetrate the walls of the imf s insular bureaucracy as 2018 came to a close venezuela s hyperinflation which i am able to accurately measure by applying purchasing power parity ppp to high frequency reached 80 000 yr and has lasted 25 months prof steve h hanke how can venezuela pull itself out of its economic death spiral venezuela must officially dump the bolivar and adopt the greenback official dollarization is a proven elixir i know because i operated as a state counselor in montenegro when it dumped the worthless yugoslav dinar in 1999 and replaced it with the deutsche mark i also took part in the successful dollarization of ecuador in 2001 when i was operating as an adviser to the minister of economy and finance countries that are officially dollarized produce lower less variable inflation rates and higher more stable economic growth rates than comparable countries with central banks that issue domestic currencies there is a tried and true way to stabilize the economy which is a necessary condition required before the massive task of life giving reforms can begin it is dollarization stability might not be everything but everything is nothing without stability just what does the venezuelan public think of the dollarization idea to answer that question a professional survey of public opinion on the topic was conducted in march 2017 by datincorp in caracas the results are encouraging sixty two 62 of the public favored dollarization since things have considerably deteriorated since that survey my conjecture is that the proportion of venezuelans favoring dollarization has substantially increased it s time for enlightened practical politicians in venezuela to embrace the dollarization idea the fact of the matter is that the public has already spontaneously

the government increased fuel prices by more than double but what is behind the sudden price increase source reality check why has zimbabwe hiked petrol prices bbc news claim black market currency dealing and the illegal trade in fuel have contributed to zimbabwe s severe fuel shortages verdict this is correct but not the full story the conditions which have led to this are rooted in the government s introduction of a controversial local currency pegged to the united states dollar there have been widespread protests in zimbabwe s largest cities following an increase in the price of fuel prices have more than doubled making petrol and diesel the most expensive in the world so why has the government done this most expensive fuel in the world the government says the price hikes were put in place to avert fuel shortages and to crack down on the illegal trading of fuel petrol prices rose from 1 24 0 97 a litre to 3 31 with diesel up from 1 36 a litre to 3 11 president mnangagwa announced the increases and promptly left the country for a european tour and to attend the world economic forum in davos switzerland the price of fuel is set by the government and petrol stations are required to sell fuel at this price pegged to the us dollar first let s look at the shortages zimbabwe has to import all its petroleum products for this it needs hard currency and with its current deep economic problems this is in very short supply in november finance minister mthuli ncube said scarce foreign exchange had been allocated to other more pressing sectors and he mentioned the need to invest in the country s mining industries at the time the minister acknowledged the shortages and promised to find ways to finance the import of more fuel a sharp rise in demand over the past year has also contributed to the shortages this rise is perhaps surprising given the sluggish state of the economy one explanation is that this is the harvesting season for tobacco zimbabwe s most important crop which means there s a high demand for fuel to power tractors and machinery but this wouldn t explain the longer term rise in demand for fuel fuel hoarding and smuggling the government has accused people of hoarding fuel and then selling it on the black market at inflated prices and because zimbabwe s fuel has been cheaper than in neighbouring countries smuggling has also been a big problem these activities have played a large part in increasing the demand for fuel in zimbabwe and contributing to shortages unrest broke out after the fuel price hike was introduced unrest broke out after the fuel price hike was introduced zimbabwe s controversial currency arrangements have also contributed to the problem the country has a local currency officially pegged one for one to the us dollar however in reality it is being traded on the black market at far less than this value this means that if you have access to hard currency us dollars for example you can then buy the local currency on the black market and use it to buy fuel at the pegged 1 1 price the effect is that fuel has been much cheaper for those buying in this way it has also meant that there s been scope for widespread profiteering within the country or by smuggling the fuel into zimbabwe s neighbours such as south africa currency confusion so if it s causing such a problem why the pegged currency it has its roots back in 2008 when zimbabwe s economy was in a tailspin and its currency was experiencing record breaking hyperinflation the zimbabwe dollar became virtually worthless and people were forced to trade in foreign currencies the us dollar and the south african rand the following year in an effort to stabilise the economy the government declared us currency legal tender officially abandoning the worthless zimbabwe dollar when a government does this it gives up its ability to set interest rates and print local money important levers of economic control it therefore can t finance public spending by printing cash which means the government has to cut spending or find other sources of revenue the introduction of this policy in 2009 largely stabilised the economy and in 2016 the government introduced a new currency system it consisted of two parts a bond note which could be traded as cash and another which could be traded electronically zimbabwe bond notes were introduced in 2016 zimbabwe bond notes were introduced in 2016 the benefit of this arrangement was that it enabled the government to print and spend money again to support much needed development and infrastructure this was also the problem successive governments have spent beyond their means printing money to do so leading to inflation and a falling currency value dumisani sibanda an independent zimbabwean economist says this particularly increased after the military takeover in november 2017 local currency which is officially pegged to the same rate as the us dollar in practical terms is worth far less and its value is falling so hard currency becomes increasingly attractive and those who have it will tend to hold onto it because it maintains its value while the local currency depreciates bad money drives out good if you have a fixed exchange rate for one to one if one of the monies is bad it drives up the good says steve hanke professor of applied economics at the johns hopkins university in baltimore who specialises in hyperinflation how does this all affect the price of fuel the government s attempt to maintain the value of the local currency in parity with the us dollar has led to widespread incentives to buy and trade in fuel on the black market severe fuel shortages have been the result and the lack of hard currency due in part to hoarding has constrained the government s ability to import enough fuel to meet demand the decision to dramatically increase the price of fuel is designed to choke off demand and curtail black market dealings but the result has been widespread protest and demands for the decision to be reversed and across the country businesses already struggling to survive in desperate economic times are facing a huge increase in their operating costs
by cassandra garrison and gabriel burin buenos aires reuters argentina s central bank bought 190 million in foreign exchange markets over the past week to weaken its peso currency a radical change from just months ago when it was spending billions to prop it up and may be forced to intervene further after a run on the peso last year halved its value the central bank introduced a super tight monetary policy that boosted the currency but over the past week the strengthening currency has slipped outside the limits of a non intervention band agreed with the international monetary fund in part the improvement in the peso s fortunes has been due to dwindling expectations that the federal reserves will raise u s interest rates rising u s treasury yields last year drained money from emerging markets hurting the peso in addition the tighter monetary policy introduced last year to stabilize the peso has left many small and medium sized argentine companies without access to pesos president mauricio macri s government froze growth in the money supply last year as part of the 56 3 billion imf agreement as a result many companies in argentina have been forced to sell dollars in recent weeks to make payments in local currency to pay suppliers salaries and taxes the combination of domestic and international factors pushed the peso to strengthen past the limit of its band for the first time on jan 10 prompting the central bank to intervene for five days in a row over the past week on thursday the bank remained on the sidelines of the market after several days of intervention as the peso fell 0 56 percent to 37 7 per u s dollar pushing it back inside the band the moving band stood at 37 523 pesos to the dollar to 48 559 on thursday yet some economists suggested the bank may be forced to resume its dollar buying in the coming days purchases of dollars could continue as pressures on the exchange rate increase because companies and families have to sell dollars to get pesos said martin vauthier director of consultancy eco go story continues while the slump in the peso last year sowed economic chaos the strengthening in the currency isn t necessarily a good thing economists say the weaker peso helped to make argentina s products more competitive overseas raising hopes that a rebound in exports could fuel growth after a painful recession argentina needs a weaker peso further peso appreciation could halt the external adjustment that argentina needs to rebalance and narrow its current account deficit said edward glossop who covers emerging markets at capital economics in london maintaining the band for carlos de sousa a senior economist at oxford economics argentina s sky high interest rates need to fall to prevent the peso from strengthening above the upper limit of its band in the medium term as the central bank has pledged not to buy more than 50 million a day to stabilize it the central bank of argentina has made too many promises you are promising that you are not going to allow the monetary base to grow and that you are not going to intervene more than 50 million a day and not more than 2 percent of your monetary base per month that is a really big set of promises de sousa said however with elections looming in october in which business friendly president mauricio macri faces a tough battle to win a second term the peso could also come under selling pressure as political uncertainty mounts economists said if the peso strays outside the band for weeks on end it would raise questions over whether the bank should drop the policy said ilya gofshteyn of standard chartered in new york it s almost a self fulfilling prophecy the more speculation heats up the more capital inflows you get and therefore the more pressure on the bank there is to let the band go all together gofshteyn said other economists took a cautious view that the band will remain in place but could flatten as the peso stabilizes over time you hope it becomes a freely floating exchange rate but there is a case for waiting until after the election before you make the next step said dirk willer an emerging market analyst at citigroup reporting by gabriel burin and cassandra garrison editing by ross colvin and phil berlowitz
if there is one useful conclusion that economists and investors can draw from the crazy year that has just ended indeed from the whole crazy decade since the global financial crisis of 2008 it is this as they say in hollywood nobody knows anything in the film industry the richest and most experienced studios and producers spend vast amounts of time and money on audience research but still have no idea if their latest creations will turn out to be hits or flops so why be surprised if the same is true of financial markets or for that matter of commodity prices policymaking and corporate performance why be shocked if the world s richest company admits as apple did after christmas that it has no idea how many iphones it will sell in china or if the world s best informed energy traders predict a global supply shortage that will boost oil prices above 100 just when a supply glut sends the market tumbling to 50 or if the us president doesn t know if he hates or loves global trade or if stock markets predict a global economic boom when bond markets predict recession and then both reverse suddenly contradicting each other in the opposite direction at this time last year economic expectations were almost universally optimistic every region of the world appeared to be simultaneously booming for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis central bankers were confident that they could safely start to withdraw their extraordinary monetary stimulus and stock market investors were almost unanimously bullish yet 2018 turned into the worst year for investors since the financial crisis forcing central bankers to begin backing away from their plans to normalise monetary policy economists to downgrade their growth forecasts and many businesses to prepare for recession in 2019 or 2020 what went wrong economic data were only slightly weaker than expected in the second half of 2018 the world bank for example has reduced its estimates of global growth in 2018 and 2019 by just 0 1 percentage points to 3 and 2 9 respectively since its june outlook read more global gdp to fall 0 7 percent due to climate change world bank turkey to bypass recession the main cause for concern has been the behaviour of financial markets many economists saw the simultaneous plunge in long term interest rates and equity prices in december as an indicator of recession either investors know something awful that is not yet evident in the statistics or declining market sentiment would become a self fulfilling prophecy by causing businesses or consumers to cut back but before concluding that financial markets can always predict or shape the future we should recall that economic and policy changes usually move financial expectations not vice versa so what events apart from market volatility would cause a recession or severe global slowdown a popular answer is simply the passage of time the global economic expansion that began in 2009 has already lasted almost ten years if a us recession does not occur by 2020 the country will have experienced the longest uninterrupted expansion in its history there is nothing in economic theory or historical experience to suggest that expansions die of old age or that recessions happen spontaneously but expansions do become more vulnerable to diseases of old age high interest rates rising energy prices accelerating inflation or banking crises that are triggered when unsustainably high property prices suddenly collapse and if none of these economic mishaps occurs eventually political leaders can become recklessly overconfident leading to wars trade conflicts or gross budgetary mismanagement several of these problems began to appear in 2018 rising interest rates in the us fiscal tightening in italy and much of europe an escalating tariff war between the us and china and higher energy prices around the world it is not surprising therefore that the world economy slowed in 2018 instead of accelerating as most economists including me expected but many of the forces that caused last year s slowdown are now reversing oil prices have fallen us bond yields are back to almost where they started in 2018 trade conflicts appear to be subsiding and china is easing macroeconomic policy at least to some extent and will probably move to outright stimulus if its economy weakens much further the policy changes and political events just described were clearly the main drivers of last year s market shocks for example january s stock market correction and volatility surge were clearly caused by fears of us overheating and rising bond yields once the overheating concerns subsided bond repricing turned out to be very limited equities everywhere rebounded and the dollar remained very weak dollar weakness and global equity strength reversed abruptly in may when markets were hit by a perfect storm of the three political shocks that i had considered most likely soaring oil prices in anticipation of iran sanctions the us china tariff war and the formation of a left right populist government in italy in october with political risks receding emerging markets started to outperform stock markets stabilised elsewhere even in europe the oil price returned to what looked like a stable pre sanctions range of 60 65 and the strengthening of the dollar ended in short markets seemed to move broadly in line with the changing political and macroeconomic fundamentals until everything suddenly went haywire in early december for the next three weeks until december 24 the s p 500 collapsed by 16 for no apparent reason brent oil plunged from 61 to 50 the dollar again strengthened and yields on ten year us bonds fell from 3 to 2 7 if all of the main fundamentals suggest that economic growth in 2019 could end up as strong or even stronger than in 2018 why did equity prices and bond yields suddenly collapse last month could it be that investors are so confused by political chaos that they have given up trying to anticipate what could happen next if so then markets instead of being predictive become increasingly reactive simply extrapolating recent events in a world where nobody knows anything investors may be no better than hollywood moguls at predicting the future by anatole kaletsky the views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily

china set to post slowest growth in 28 years in 2018 more stimulus seen beijing china is expected to report on monday that economic growth cooled to its slowest in 28 years in 2018 amid weakening domestic demand and bruising us tariffs adding pressure on beijing to roll out more support measures to avert a sharper slowdown growing signs of weakness in china which has generated nearly a third of global growth in the past decade are stoking worries about risks to the world economy and are weighing on profits for firms ranging from apple to big carmakers chinese policymakers have pledged more support for the economy this year to reduce the risk of massive job losses but they have ruled out a flood of stimulus like that which beijing has unleashed in the past which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt analysts polled by reuters expect the world s second largest economy to have grown 6 4 per cent in the october december quarter from a year earlier slowing from the previous quarter s 6 5 per cent pace and matching levels last seen in early 2009 during the global financial crisis that could pull 2018 gross domestic product gdp growth to 6 6 per cent the lowest since 1990 and down from a revised 6 8 per cent in 2017 with stimulus measures expected to take some time to kick in most analysts believe conditions in china are likely to get worse before they get better and see a further slowdown to 6 3 percent this year some analysts believe real growth levels are already much weaker than official data suggest even if china and the united states agree on a trade deal in current talks which is a tall order analysts said it would be no panacea for the sputtering chinese economy unless beijing can galvanize weak investment and consumer demand chen xingdong chief china economist at bnp paribas said investors should not expect the latest round of stimulus to produce similar results as during the 2008 09 global crisis when beijing s huge spending package quickly boosted growth what china can really do this year is to prevent deflation prevent a recession and a hard landing in the economy chen said on a quarterly basis growth likely eased to 1 5 percent inoct dec from 1 6 percent in the preceding period china will release its fourth quarter and 2018 gdp data on monday 0200 gmt along with december factory output retailsales and fixed asset investment since china s quarterly gdp readings tend to be unusually steady most investors prefer to focus on recent trends surprising contractions in december trade data and factory activity gauges in recent weeks have suggested the economy cooled more quickly than expected at the end of 2018 leaving it on shakier footing at the start of the new year sources have told reuters that beijing was planning to lower its growth target to 6 6 5 percent this year from around6 5 percent in 2018 tepid expansion in industrial output and weaker consumer spending is squeezing companies profit margins discouraging fresh investment and raising the risk of higher job losses some factories in guangdong china s export hub have shut earlier than usual ahead of the long lunar new year holiday as the tariff war with the united states curtails orders others are suspending production lines and cutting back on workers hours if the trade war drags on some migrant workers may not have jobs to return to trade negotiators are facing an early march deadline and washington has threatened to sharply hike tariffs if there are no substantial signs of progress stimulus steps eyed so far chinese policymakers have fast tracked construction projects and cut taxes and some import duties to spur demand to free up more funds for lending particularly to more vulnerable smaller firms the central bank has cut the number of reserves that banks need to set aside as reserves rrr five times over the past year and guided borrowing costs lower further rrr reductions are expected in coming quarters but most analysts do not see a cut in benchmark interest rates just yet as policymakers wait to see if earlier steps begin to stabilise conditions more forceful easing could pressure the yuan and aggravate high debt levels with money going into less efficient or speculative investments the government may unveil more fiscal stimulus measures during the annual parliament meeting in march including bigger tax cuts and more spending on infrastructure projects analysts say some china watchers believe the government could deliver 2 trillion yuan 295 13 billion worth of cuts in taxes and fees this year and allow local governments to issue another 2 trillion yuan in special bonds largely used to fund key projects still some analysts do not expect the economy to bottom out convincingly

by ali merza is undoubtedly timely and very significant addition to the library of the iraqi economy the invaluable contribution of the book is attributed to the following factors the author dr merza

perspectives on iraqi oil international journal of contemporary iraqi studies 5 1 2011 pp 152 159 kamil mahdi ed iraq s economic predicament ithaca press uk 2002 both late abbas alnasrawi pp 343 348 and i pp 85 137 were among the contributors in the book this review falls in two parts since this important book is written in arabic and probably it is difficult to obtain it from all bookshops it is very well justifiable to provide first a brief of the book structure and its contents for the benefit of the wider readership of ijcis with or without a proficiency in arabic language and then make a few analytical remarks the book begins with an introduction and long abstract summarizing its chapters and a few main conclusions the first chapter pp 27 42 deals with the formation of the modern contemporary iraq by addressing the societal interaction since mid thirteenth century chapter two pp 43 100 is about population and water resources here the author identified the problem of rapid population increase coupled with deficit in employment opportunities the situation he argues is aggravated by the deterioration of the agricultural sector due to shortage and wasteful use of water resources shortage of water was primarily attributed to external factors water policies in turkey iran and syria while the wasteful use of water resources is due to domestic factors traditional farming and lack of national water policy a long third chapter pp 103 213 is about oil in iraq and the impacted international variables since 1921 it begins by old concession system and its demise by the rise of national management after law 80 and the formation of iraqi national oil company inoc oil nationalization the effect of iran iraq war leading to 2003 invasion in this part the author asserts that oil dominance era and strengthening of rentier state premises began during 1952 58 when oil revenues importance to gross foreign currency revenues increased to 79 due to the known 50 50 profit sharing agreement with the dominated oil cartel p 115 the rest of the chapter addresses post 2003 oil issues divided between domestic maters specifically federal oil and gas law fogl inoc law and made comparative assessment of upstream petroleum contracts arriving at a qualified preference to the ministry of oil service contracts over the production sharing contracts pscs of the krg p 173 finally he addressed opec dilemma between market share and production setting with emphases on opec decision of november 2016 and its likely impact on iraq pp 183 213 chapter four is devoted to non oil commodity sectors and rent trap where the author first returns to and provides further insights on agriculture water population nexus and how the sector becomes incapable of meeting population needs particularly due to the dominance of the rentier state from 1958 onwards he concludes that the expansion or shrinking of agricultural production depends on availability of water which as he expects to decline in the future on one hand and the continuation or deterioration of inefficient low utilization of water on the other p 230 he then analyze the deteriorated industrialization which started modestly during the twenties of the last century reaching its peak during 1970 80 when processing industries production increased by 13 5 while gdps growth rate was 10 1 p 243 but that decade he mentions witnessed the emergence of absorptive capacity limitations that contributed to serious delay in project executing p 244 wars sanctions and post 2003 invasion pro market liberal policies had their heavy toll as well resulting in low 1 6 contribution of processing industries value added to gdp during 2006 14 compared with 5 during 1981 89 p 257 sharing oil rent is covered in chapter five pp 265 321 the author begins by conducting detailed computations for analyzing income expenditure disparity among the provinces and their consequences on local standard of living he then discusses the centralized and decentralized modalities for sharing financial resources and concludes by providing remarks on a proposal for distributing oil revenues on the entire population the author concludes that rentier state practices have led during the last four decades to trap or vicious circle of bad governance societal disputes and low standard of living that in turn strengthen oil dependency p 305 the longest chapter p 325 480 in the book is about management and economic policies in this sixth chapter the author provides excellent assessment of the planning experience in the country then discusses the involvement of imf in shaping the economic policy analyzes inflation and the effectiveness of the monetary policy and finally foreign trade and trade policies as expected the author attempts in the last chapter to look into the future and answer the fundamental question on whether it is possible and how to achieve economic structural diversification that permits iraq escaping the rent trap the book comprises extensive annexes rich in data lengthy time series and graphs using mostly quantitative approach it has two lists of consulted references in arabic and english the above brief narratives that outlining the structure and main components of the book testify the good efforts and skillful approach adopted by dr merza in authoring this important contribution to understanding the complexities of and the challenges encountering the iraqi economy however there are a few remarks that worth highlighting particularly those relating mostly to oil issues first the comparative assessment of the service contracts with the production sharing contracts pscs the author conducted elaborated assessment through making a series of assumptions and calculations between the service contracts concluded by the iraqi ministry of oil moo and a hypothetical psc based on libya s epsa iii p 154 155 and the pscs concluded by krg pp 164 180 in both cases he concludes the superiority of moo service contracts his conclusion concurs with those arrived at by many iraqi oil professionals who had conducted such comparison between the two contractual modalities but what is surprising are his views when addressing 2016 imf memo that iraq might be compelled to take measures including amending current moo oil agreement to pscs p 418 such views could indicate inconsistency with his above mentioned findings particularly those under different oil price scenarios since the realities of 2017 18 have exceeded the foreseen until 2021 thresholds of imf two variables oil prices of 50 a barrel and total oil production including krg of 4 5 million barrel per day mbd moreover his views could motivate wrong and costly policy shift towards pscs second building refineries outside iraq one of the strong and correctly so propositions that are highlighted throughout the book is the importance of structural diversification for sustainable development and to combat rent trap needless to say that for iraq structural diversification is both horizontal i e across the commodity production sectors and vertical i e along the sector s value chain but again the author proposes a complete opposite policy initiative by calling to construct refineries outside iraq for using iraqi crude oil in the consumption centers p 22 and p 472 citing kuwait and libya as examples apart from the fact that his call for such a proposal is hardly convincing and contravening his own good analysis for structural diversification his coverage of the refining sector is surprisingly very thin and insufficient p 365 and p 439 moreover such a proposal could lead again to wrong policy initiative taking into consideration that lack of domestic modern refineries is one of most serious policy failures of post 2003 iraq despite the apparent comparative advantages for such vertical diversification as highlighted forcefully and convincingly by ines due to daesh effect as discussed next iraq lost significant part of the refining capacity post june 2014 finally his reference to karbala refinery p 439 probably needs updating footnote third provincial disparities the author concludes based on value added estimation and state budgets upstream petroleum development had contributed to provincial disparities in standard of living in favor of provinces south of baghdad to basra and in kurdistan region against the upper middle provinces pp 277 280 in this regards it appears the author had overlooked important matters that had contributed to this state of disparities first security conditions due to daesh effects had impacted negatively the execution of petroleum project in the upper middle provinces e g najma and qayara in ninawa mansuriya and exploration block 8 in dayala and akash in anbar seconds daesh also destroyed oil refining and power generation facilities in these provinces and particularly baiji complex in salahuldeen province thus wiped out almost the capacity of the north refineries company nrc third up to 2014 krg used to receive its share from annual budget and keeps the revenues generated from its export of oil incidentally july september 2018 demonstrations and dramatic event in the southern oil producing provinces due to scarcity of basic services e g clean drinking water health and power and spreading unemployment question the validity of the author s above mentioned disparities he expressed such views when addressing the imf memorandum of november 2016 which is incorporated in imf iraq letter of intent memorandum of economic and financial policies and technical memorandum of understanding 15 december 2016 on the refineries in iraq see my article in this issue and the references therein council of ministers integrated national energy strategy 2013 2030 baghdad june 2013 fourth contractual provisions the author makes frequent reference to contracts governing both moo service contracts and krg pscs particularly when he makes calculation and quantitative analysis and comparison these contracts are legal governing frameworks that have to be examined thoroughly and understood accurately especially those provisions of critical fiscal importance the followings are a few remarks on contractual maters referred to throughout the book the author asserts that except gross remuneration fee amount the same conditions apply approximately to the then service contracts p 154 actually this is not the case as there are three different types of service contracts concluded by the moo with very different fiscal parameters in addition to the bid remuneration fee not gross remuneration fee these are cost recover cap from the deemed revenues the signature bonus the values of r factor annual allocation for the fund overhead charges the spread over libor and the stabilization clause regarding corporate income tax cit when the author updated a previous sensitivity analysis p 175 on the service contracts based on a 2014 he increased iocs share in the remuneration fee from 75 to 95 again this is not the case in fact at that time only two contracts were subjected to that increase obviously applying that change to the contracts is bound to shed doubt on the quantitative analysis its assumptions and its conclusion needless to say that increase in the iocs share in the remuneration fee would while reducing the state partner sp share in the remuneration fee increase the amount of cit thus the net fiscal impact would be the differential in government takes through reducing income generated by sp share and increasing cit collection in this regard and considering the mentioned remarks above the rumaila analyses and the comparative assessment between moo service contracts and krg pscs pp 164 182 are undoubtedly well articulated quantitative intellectual exercise but for practical and policy implications purposes they needs careful and cautious considerations the author considers bonuses as recoverable supplementary cost p 153 there are three remarks worth making on this matter i there are no bonuses in the moo service contracts there is only one time signature bonus ii this signature bonus is contractually non recoverable iii probably the author relied on old pre signing information on first bid round contractual terms when signature bonus had very different specifications in magnitude and status that generated at that time tense parliamentary debate known publications and even a legal case was filed before the federal supreme court all that eventually led to significant changes when contracts were signed see ieiti annual report extractive activities in iraq 2015 kpmg baghdad december 2016 the importance of the r factor was undermined though the author admits this is a flaw that should be avoided since the author thinks including r factor will not impact the comparative assessment since that would apply to all contracts covered by the comparison p 155 and p 176 it seems the author thinks r factor is the same for all types of contracts covered in his exercise they are actually not and moreover even for moo service contracts the ioc take from bid remuneration fee prior to state partner share and income tax deductions depends on the specified in the related contract value of r factor which range from 100 to 50 for one contract to 100 to 20 for a set of other group of contracts and when these fiscal values apply to billions of barrels produced over 20 years would results in billions of loss of revenues for the government of iraq to the coffers of the iocs this is an outcome that deserves considerable attention due to the fact that r factor works technically to iocs side during development phase while it works for iraqi side from the beginning of production plateau period onward until the end of the contract period and for clarity purpose r factor is a progressivity measure works similar to that applied in income tax systems not as the author considers it as escalating clause which is a form of indexation measure applies particularly in project as safeguard against cost inflation finally for comparative assessment of moo service contracts with krg pscs it is vital to remember the significant difference in the applicability base of r factor for the former it is the remuneration fee while for the latter it is the ioc fiscal revenues from profit oil and oil price matters most for profit oil but close to none for remuneration fee the book mentions natural decline of 5 on the baseline production p 153 it is important to mention that this condition applies only to the brown fields concluded under first bid round and the rate increased to 7 5 as from 1 january 2014 for rumaila oilfield only giving related iocs i e bp and cnpc further concession with significant fiscal advantages two important developments have implication on both government take and the weighted average of remuneration fee these are the relinquishments of majnoon oilfield and oxy share in zubair oilfield both cases were not addressed in the book despite their significant fiscal implications r factor is contractually as provided in rumaila oilfield contract defined as the ratio of cumulative cash receipts to cumulative expenditures in the conduct of petroleum operations as defined in article 19 5 d for further analysis and calculation of the impact of r factor on other fields see ahmed mousa jiyad remuneration fees are measured in cents not dollars mees 53 11 15 march 2010 the author claims that iraq is contractually not obliged to compensate iocs for production curtailment effects p 205 actually the signed contracts refute such claim and on the contrary provide clear modalities on how to address the consequences of such sovereign prerogative on the related iocs fifth rechecking and updating there are some information and data that need rechecking correction or updating since all of the identified items occurred prior to the book date of publication the followings are some of them and again relating to petroleum issues a reference was made to petrodollar law of 2010 and its amendment in 2014 p 141 i believe there is no such law or its amendment what there was a proposal regarding petrodollar that was incorporated in budget law 2010 onwards moreover probably the author was mixing the issue with the second amendment dated 2013 on law of provinces not organized in a region known as provinces law 21 of 2008 which prompted the government to protest the second amendment before the federal supreme court petrodollar allocations according to the second amendment on provinces law increased significantly through offering three thresholds each has 5 a barrel of oil equivalent but budget laws from 2016 onwards limit petrodollar allocations by giving the province the option to choose one threshold only the author mentions that oil production in iraq increased higher than any other opec members during 1970 79 pp 122 3 but the data in the referred to table 2 p 125 does not support that claim it is mentioned on p 141 that refinery investment law 64 of 2007 offers 1 discount on the international price of oil again that was old information the said law was amended twice by increasing the discount to 8 provided it is not less than 5 and no more than 10 a barrel needless to say the implications of these amendments are very significant and thus should be highlighted and assessed see law 19 of 2013 particularly article 44 second 8 see budget laws numbered 1 for 2016 44 for 2017 and 44 for 2018 moreover for 2017 and 2018 the allocation was changed from 5 a barrel of oil equivalent to 5 of the related revenues from one base only crude oil or refinery or natural gas produced in the related province see law 10 of 2011 for first amendment and law 35 of 2016 for second amendment both amendments are published on the official gazette for in depth assessment of the refinery law as adopted on the second reading on 30 july 2016 by the parliament see ahmed mousa jiyad remarks on the second amendment of oil refining investment law 64 of 2007 the author mentions that a psc was concluded in 1995 with lukoil and cnpc regarding the giant west qurna field p 123 that was not accurate the year was 1997 lukoil psc was related to west qurna 2 only cnpc psc had nothing to do with west qurna it was for al ahdad oilfield moreover both pscs were ratified by two separate laws published on the official gazette al waqae al iraqiya more than twenty years ago also the author mentions p 152 that exxonmobil decided to sell part of its share in west qurna 2 which it acquired in the first second bid round actually that company has only west qurna 1 oilfield and that was offered under first bid round the author mentions that state partner in rumaila oilfield contract is south oil company p 154 and p 175 not correct the state partner which is usually a contracting party within the iocs consortium the second party in rumaila contract is somo not soc is the state partner now basra oil company south oil company is the contracting first party or the employer representing the republic of iraq three provinces were not mentioned in the south provinces p 294 these are missan wasit and basrah though they are listed in table 3 p 279 the author relies on the second amendment of provinces law when discussing decentralization issue p 300 i believe the third amendment answers many of his concerns and thus it is imperative to consider this third amendment when debating decentralization issues to sum up dr merza delivered excellent meticulous book a contribution that would enhance our understanding of the complexity and predicament of the iraqi economy and due to its analytical style and wealth of data it becomes a must read by decision makers particularly with regards to the needed coherent sound planning to attain desirable structural changes and diversification the book is well received already and i think it is essential and strongly recommended reference for all interested in the development and prospect of the economy addressing the above mentioned

the outstanding volume of leveraged loans now tops 1 trillion and there are concerns it s a credit bubble that could put the economy at risk indebted borrowers increasingly take out high interest adjustable rate loans that are packaged into securities and sold to investors eager for a better rate of return everything s fine while the economy is growing but when it slows those borrowers could default causing problems to cascade through the financial system if this all sounds like the subprime housing market in the boom years before the 2008 financial crisis you re right and that s what increasingly has regulators lawmakers ratings agencies and some market watchers worried advertisement this time however the borrowers in this credit bubble aren t homeowners taking out mortgages they re hundreds of u s companies with weaker credit ratings many of them well known like uber and burger king taking out so called leveraged loans those loosely regulated loans often are used to fund corporate deal making but those deals known as leveraged buyouts can go bad because of the large debt load as happened with the demise last year of toys r us combined there is about 1 15 trillion in outstanding u s leveraged loans a record that is double the level five years ago and those loans increasingly are being made with less protection for lenders and investors any fair minded look at the leveraged loan market should cause significant alarm by anybody concerned about financial stability and the inevitable upcoming economic downturn said dennis kelleher president of better markets a group that advocates stricter financial regulation you put all these pieces together it s a witches brew the risks aren t nearly as widespread as they were during the housing bubble when the percentage of all mortgages that were subprime jumped to about 20 leveraged loans while growing rapidly account for less than 5 of the more than 42 trillion u s fixed income debt market which also includes corporate and municipal bonds advertisement still the federal reserve the office of the comptroller of the currency the bank of england the international monetary fund and the bank for international settlements a consortium of 60 central banks all have raised concerns recently about the growth of the leveraged loan market and the potential risks to the financial system in an economic slowdown former federal reserve chairwoman janet l yellen went public this fall with her worries about what she called a huge deterioration in the standards for those loans which make it easier for indebted companies to take on more debt if we have a downturn in the economy there are a lot of firms that will go bankrupt i think because of this debt she told the financial times it would probably worsen a downturn and presumed democratic presidential candidate sen elizabeth warren d mass is pressing u s regulators for answers about oversight of the market i am concerned that the large leveraged lending market exhibits many of the characteristics of the pre 2008 subprime mortgage market she wrote in a november letter to key regulatory agencies even jamie dimon chief executive of jpmorgan chase co who last week dismissed concerns that the leveraged loan market represented a potential systemic risk warned that there could be problems for some lenders outside the conventional banking system advertisement someone s going to get hurt there dimon said on a tuesday earnings call referring to leveraged loan losses if a recession hits toys r us loaded up on leveraged loan debt when it was purchased in a leveraged buyout in 2005 by private equity firms bain capital and kkr co and real estate investment trust vornado realty trust the debt burden led the toy retailer to file for bankruptcy protection in 2017 after it was unable to refinance the debt burger king used a 6 75 billion leveraged loan to help fund its 2014 purchase of tim horton s the canadian coffee and doughnut chain and uber last year raised 1 5 billion in its second leveraged loan issuance following a 1 15 billion one in 2017 according to the wall street journal leveraged loans in and of themselves aren t bad they are simply a credit instrument employed with companies that already have a lot of debt and those firms are fairly common about two thirds of u s companies have enough debt that independent credit raters have them categorized as a higher risk to repay than companies with so called investment grade ratings which makes them off limits to many institutional investors because those companies with non investment grade ratings are highly leveraged the chances are greater that they won t pay back a loan for that reason the interest rate needs to be higher to offset that risk the higher interest rate makes the loans desirable to investors seeking a greater return on their money advertisement the fed s benchmark federal funds rate is now at a range between 2 25 and 2 5 the yield on 10 year treasury bills is about 2 8 but yields on leveraged loans can be higher than 10 if an investor buys into the riskiest and most speculative segment of the market safer leveraged loans can still pay several points higher than a treasury bill in those ways leveraged loans are similar to the junk bonds that became popular in the 1980s and fueled corporate deals but there s an important difference junk bonds those rated below investment grade by ratings companies are securities that are traded under the oversight of the securities and exchange commission leveraged loans are basically private transactions between lenders and borrowers so they are not regulated by the sec however bank regulators do keep tabs on the underwriting standards and outstanding loan totals of banks to make sure if loans go sour they won t have to step in and rescue the institutions which is what happened during the financial crisis and they are starting to raise flags in its semiannual risk report issued last month the office of the comptroller of the currency which regulates national banks said it remains attentive to the heightened risks in the corporate bond and loan markets and in particular the leveraged lending market and in its financial stability report in november the fed said that although default rates for leveraged loans remained low credit standards for new leveraged loans appear to have deteriorated over the past six months advertisement the share of newly issued large loans to companies with high ratios of debt to adjusted earnings has increased in recent quarters and now exceeds previous peak levels observed in 2007 and 2014 when underwriting quality was notably poor the fed report said kelleher said the decline in lending standards was troubling you have the leveraged loan market growing at a very rapid clip at the same time the standards are dropping he said the leveraged loan market is flashing red warning lights all over the place those are warren s concerns as well she said in her november letter that federal regulators appointed by president trump appear to have backed off guidance issued in 2013 by obama appointed regulators urging banks to use tougher underwriting standards for leveraged loans federal reserve chairman jerome h powell has expressed less concern saying in september that the direct risk to banks from leveraged loans is limited because of restrictions on their lending now in place that market has evolved really significantly since before the crisis he said but it s also true that excessive risk taking in the leveraged lending markets does have channels for affecting the real economy if there s overheating and that kind of thing in those markets so we monitor that carefully however there is a concern that with regulated banks offering fewer such loans there is less oversight of the leveraged lending market in general advertisement the share of leveraged loans offered by large banks has declined from about 80 in 2010 to about 54 this year while the share of those loans offered by small banks and nonbanks has increased to about 46 this year among the lenders outside the banking system making leveraged loans are private equity firms hedge funds and insurance companies lenders package these loans into securities called collateralized loan obligations that are sold to investors freeing them up to make more loans what s more these loans increasingly are being offered with fewer restrictions on repayment making them more attractive than junk bonds as a source of corporate financing bloomberg reported this fall that total outstanding leveraged loans had overtaken junk bonds to cement their status as the go to financing source for speculative grade companies because the loan market got so attractive we ended up seeing a lot more companies going to the loan market said christina padgett head of leveraged finance research at ratings firm moody s investors service companies can borrow a bunch of money relatively affordably do what they want to do with relatively little constraints and still service their debt further fueling the growth in leveraged loans were the near zero interest rates put in place by federal reserve officials during and after the great recession to try to spur economic growth the effect of those low rates rippled through the financial system they lowered the cost of borrowing to make it more attractive to companies seeking to make acquisitions or refinance their debt even if they had to take out a leveraged loan advertisement the low rates set by the fed also made owning a piece of a leveraged loan a more attractive investment that paid a higher return than other debt instruments it also came with the promise of adjusting up when the fed began lifting its own benchmark rate investors are desperate for yield we ve seen this show before so they re not demanding a lot in terms of investor protections said sheila bair who headed the federal deposit insurance corp during the financial crisis you lower interest rates on safe assets these are the incentives you get concerns also have been raised about a ruling last year by a three judge panel of the u s court of appeals for the district of columbia that removed a regulatory restriction on collateralized loan obligations the 2010 dodd frank financial reforms sought to reduce the sale of risky investments by requiring firms that package loans into securities to retain a 5 stake in the investment the loan syndications and trading assn a leveraged lending industry group filed suit arguing the requirement could limit funding after losing in a lower court the group won a ruling from the appeals court panel in february the loan syndications and trading assn has downplayed the risks in the market the group notes that leveraged loans make up a small percentage of the u s fixed income debt market and the overall default rates on leveraged loans are low just 1 6 late last year and forecast by fitch ratings to fall to 1 5 at the end of this year advertisement but with u s economic growth slowing the dynamics could change every time the economy slows down you see a pickup in defaults bair said fed monetary policy makers estimated in december that they would enact two more small hikes in their key interest rate this year although powell said recently that they would be patient and flexible as they monitor the economy higher rates would put more pressure on the leveraged loan market but a sharp economic downturn could lead the fed to lower rates which would ease the pressure when you re this late in the business cycle you have pretty much already lent to every creditworthy borrower kelleher said the real question is how much lending do you want to give to marginal non creditworthy borrowers
in shanghai you also need a licence to run a business and many of the small vendors have been kicked out because they don t have a licence she says the couple are the face of the millions of small business owners the chinese government says it wants to help with tax cuts and other incentives to get the world s second largest economy firing on all cylinders again while official 2018 gdp data to be released on monday will show the world s second largest economy grew at more than 6 5 per cent many small business owners say they are not seeing the benefits of the country s economic miracle they are a world apart from the billionaire property and tech entrepreneurs china has become famous for for many life is better than for previous generations in the country but the promise of easy money that lured them to big cities like shanghai a decade ago has dried up the golden era of shanghai is over declares steve venturini who is leaving china after running a popular italian bistro and gelateria in shanghai s former french concession for 10 years entrepreneurs like italian born venturini whose father is from australia says business became untenable due to soaring costs taxes and tighter regulation this came at a time when the prices for luxury goods such as the pasta and ice cream his customers would queue up for were falling business is not good there are less pedestrians and less crowds than before says another stall owner che mingli grainne quinlan it s always been tough but the government doesn t care if you are making a profit or not prices dropped but rents and utility fees and taxes keep going up says venturini who is moving to japan where his wife was offered a job advertisement while beijing is promising to cut taxes for small business many small business owners say this defeats the point as many never paid tax in the first place while china s unemployment rate and economic growth is better than in many western countries including australia growth in the world s second largest economy is slowing to its lowest rate in a decade official gdp data due out monday is expected to show growth slowed to 6 4 per cent with full year growth coming in around 6 6 per cent but the official figures will mask the challenges facing many of china s small businesses which are struggling to compete with large state owned companies and the boom in online shopping and services despite this beijing s economic policymakers made it clear last week that it wants to help the millions of small business owners who make up the backbone of the world s second largest economy the golden era of shanghai is over declares steve venturini who is leaving china after running a popular italian bistro and gelateria in shanghai s former french concession for 10 years grainne quinlan i feel business is getting more difficult it is getting harder to run a business in china now says shen lihua who opened his souvenir store in shanghai s tourist hot spot yuyuan garden 14 years ago he is busy when the australian financial review arrives as locals pile in to buy lunar new year decorations but he says business is generally slow his main concern is rising rents labour costs and tougher regulation which was making it harder to make a profit many small business owners seem unaware of the tax cuts outlined by the government last week shen says tax cuts are nothing new he says his taxes were cut several years ago from 1200 yuan a month to 200 yuan a month but during the same period the rent for a 160 square metre storage warehouse rose from 40 000 yuan a year to 160 000 yuan advertisement business is not good there are less pedestrians and less crowds than before says another stall owner che mingli who is also selling lunar new year decorations new regulations mean the trestle tables laden with goods cannot be extended out onto the street like they were previously and he says this has reduced sales he blames a sluggish stockmarket for keeping people away because they are concerned about their investments and have less monty to spend people are less comfortable spending he says che opened the business 10 years ago and said business was good up until 2017 when he started to feel a slowdown his rent has almost doubled in the past two years shen lihua whose shop is along fuyou road in the old town of shanghai he says his taxes were cut several years ago from 1200 yuan a month to 200 yuan a month but during the same period the rent for a 160 square metre storage warehouse rose from 40 000 yuan a year to 160 000 yuan grainne quinlan while s china s growth still overshadows many western economies including australia the economic slowdown is causing problems for president xi jinping as he comes under pressure from the united states to give up some of the generous trade benefits that contributed to its boom the latest slew of economic data including falling car sales slowing retail sales and the country s debt pile is making investors globally anxious if china runs into trouble the world economy will feel the effects while few believe the country is heading for a recession china s ruling communist party is being forced to explore new ways to stimulate investment and growth without jeopardising efforts to reduce debt china s inflation adjusted gdp slowed to 6 5 per cent in the third quarter and economists expect this to slow to 6 4 per cent in the fourth quarter according to consensus estimates published by bloomberg and reuters china s leaders will officially release 2019 gdp forecasts in march comments by top economists in china and government officials suggest the government is preparing to lower targets for the current year to as low as 6 per cent advertisement economists in australia and globally are divided over how to accurately measure the health of the chinese economy many believe the official data in a country where the ruling communist party does not tolerate provincial governments missing targets is unreliable but others point to a long history of china bears being proved wrong and believe growth remains robust compared to almost everywhere else in the world there is little doubt growth is slowing though and the big question is how far will china s leaders go to stimulate growth and resolve its trade dispute with washington retail sales in november grew at their weakest rate in 15 years the purchasing managers index pmi was flat in november for the first time in two years and power consumption slipped 9 percentage points in 2018 china car sales fell for the first time in almost three decades in 2018 after the government cut subsidies there are already signs in the local media that beijing will lower last year s 6 5 per cent target to as low as 6 per cent property sales are falling amid reports developers are offering steep discounts to attract buyers but huw mckay bhp billiton s vice president for market analysis and economics says china s nominal gdp data which was tracking around 9 per cent last year shows the economy remains strong it is an economy which is absolutely slowing but it is not an economy which is showing major signs of weakness he says we are not facing this with incredible trepidation this is a slowdown and we really hope they get their act together on trade negotiations so we can stabilise that uncertainty mckay says housing starts are up and the government is likely to bolster infrastructure and the automotive industry he also points to strong steel production power generation excavator output and sales of airconditioners as signs that the economy remains robust supply side reform meant demand for australia s high quality iron ore and coal also remained steady as china shut down inefficient steel mills using low quality commodities demand for gas was also a bright spot in the economy advertisement dion hershan head of australian equities at yarra capital management in melbourne and a regular visitor to china is cautious on the outlook for china s growth but agrees that demand for australian commodities is stable for now over time we expect the volume and value of coal and iron ore exports to decline in part because more local scrap

policies will be in addressing the slowdown it is a very important and urgent task for chinese government to boost entrepreneurs confidence chinese government is taking measures to boost entrepreneurs

the outstanding volume of leveraged loans now tops 1 trillion and there are concerns it s a credit bubble that could put the economy at risk indebted borrowers increasingly take out high interest adjustable rate loans that are packaged into securities and sold to investors eager for a better rate of return everything s fine while the economy is growing but when it slows those borrowers could default causing problems to cascade through the financial system if this all sounds like the subprime housing market in the boom years before the 2008 financial crisis you re right and that s what increasingly has regulators lawmakers ratings agencies and some market watchers worried advertisement this time however the borrowers in this credit bubble aren t homeowners taking out mortgages they re hundreds of u s companies with weaker credit ratings many of them well known like uber and burger king taking out so called leveraged loans those loosely regulated loans often are used to fund corporate deal making but those deals known as leveraged buyouts can go bad because of the large debt load as happened with the demise last year of toys r us combined there is about 1 15 trillion in outstanding u s leveraged loans a record that is double the level five years ago and those loans increasingly are being made with less protection for lenders and investors any fair minded look at the leveraged loan market should cause significant alarm by anybody concerned about financial stability and the inevitable upcoming economic downturn said dennis kelleher president of better markets a group that advocates stricter financial regulation you put all these pieces together it s a witches brew the risks aren t nearly as widespread as they were during the housing bubble when the percentage of all mortgages that were subprime jumped to about 20 leveraged loans while growing rapidly account for less than 5 of the more than 42 trillion u s fixed income debt market which also includes corporate and municipal bonds still the federal reserve the office of the comptroller of the currency the bank of england the international monetary fund and the bank for international settlements a consortium of 60 central banks all have raised concerns recently about the growth of the leveraged loan market and the potential risks to the financial system in an economic slowdown former federal reserve chairwoman janet l yellen went public this fall with her worries about what she called a huge deterioration in the standards for those loans which make it easier for indebted companies to take on more debt if we have a downturn in the economy there are a lot of firms that will go bankrupt i think because of this debt she told the financial times it would probably worsen a downturn and presumed democratic presidential candidate sen elizabeth warren d mass is pressing u s regulators for answers about oversight of the market i am concerned that the large leveraged lending market exhibits many of the characteristics of the pre 2008 subprime mortgage market she wrote in a november letter to key regulatory agencies even jamie dimon chief executive of jpmorgan chase co who last week dismissed concerns that the leveraged loan market represented a potential systemic risk warned that there could be problems for some lenders outside the conventional banking system someone s going to get hurt there dimon said on a tuesday earnings call referring to leveraged loan losses if a recession hits toys r us loaded up on leveraged loan debt when it was purchased in a leveraged buyout in 2005 by private equity firms bain capital and kkr co and real estate investment trust vornado realty trust the debt burden led the toy retailer to file for bankruptcy protection in 2017 after it was unable to refinance the debt burger king used a 6 75 billion leveraged loan to help fund its 2014 purchase of tim horton s the canadian coffee and doughnut chain and uber last year raised 1 5 billion in its second leveraged loan issuance following a 1 15 billion one in 2017 according to the wall street journal leveraged loans in and of themselves aren t bad they are simply a credit instrument employed with companies that already have a lot of debt and those firms are fairly common about two thirds of u s companies have enough debt that independent credit raters have them categorized as a higher risk to repay than companies with so called investment grade ratings which makes them off limits to many institutional investors because those companies with non investment grade ratings are highly leveraged the chances are greater that they won t pay back a loan for that reason the interest rate needs to be higher to offset that risk the higher interest rate makes the loans desirable to investors seeking a greater return on their money the fed s benchmark federal funds rate is now at a range between 2 25 and 2 5 the yield on 10 year treasury bills is about 2 8 but yields on leveraged loans can be higher than 10 if an investor buys into the riskiest and most speculative segment of the market safer leveraged loans can still pay several points higher than a treasury bill in those ways leveraged loans are similar to the junk bonds that became popular in the 1980s and fueled corporate deals but there s an important difference junk bonds those rated below investment grade by ratings companies are securities that are traded under the oversight of the securities and exchange commission leveraged loans are basically private transactions between lenders and borrowers so they are not regulated by the sec however bank regulators do keep tabs on the underwriting standards and outstanding loan totals of banks to make sure if loans go sour they won t have to step in and rescue the institutions which is what happened during the financial crisis and they are starting to raise flags in its semiannual risk report issued last month the office of the comptroller of the currency which regulates national banks said it remains attentive to the heightened risks in the corporate bond and loan markets and in particular the leveraged lending market and in its financial stability report in november the fed said that although default rates for leveraged loans remained low credit standards for new leveraged loans appear to have deteriorated over the past six months the share of newly issued large loans to companies with high ratios of debt to adjusted earnings has increased in recent quarters and now exceeds previous peak levels observed in 2007 and 2014 when underwriting quality was notably poor the fed report said kelleher said the decline in lending standards was troubling you have the leveraged loan market growing at a very rapid clip at the same time the standards are dropping he said the leveraged loan market is flashing red warning lights all over the place those are warren s concerns as well she said in her november letter that federal regulators appointed by president trump appear to have backed off guidance issued in 2013 by obama appointed regulators urging banks to use tougher underwriting standards for leveraged loans federal reserve chairman jerome h powell has expressed less concern saying in september that the direct risk to banks from leveraged loans is limited because of restrictions on their lending now in place that market has evolved really significantly since before the crisis he said but it s also true that excessive risk taking in the leveraged lending markets does have channels for affecting the real economy if there s overheating and that kind of thing in those markets so we monitor that carefully however there is a concern that with regulated banks offering fewer such loans there is less oversight of the leveraged lending market in general the share of leveraged loans offered by large banks has declined from about 80 in 2010 to about 54 this year while the share of those loans offered by small banks and nonbanks has increased to about 46 this year among the lenders outside the banking system making leveraged loans are private equity firms hedge funds and insurance companies lenders package these loans into securities called collateralized loan obligations that are sold to investors freeing them up to make more loans what s more these loans increasingly are being offered with fewer restrictions on repayment making them more attractive than junk bonds as a source of corporate financing bloomberg reported this fall that total outstanding leveraged loans had overtaken junk bonds to cement their status as the go to financing source for speculative grade companies because the loan market got so attractive we ended up seeing a lot more companies going to the loan market said christina padgett head of leveraged finance research at ratings firm moody s investors service companies can borrow a bunch of money relatively affordably do what they want to do with relatively little constraints and still service their debt further fueling the growth in leveraged loans were the near zero interest rates put in place by federal reserve officials during and after the great recession to try to spur economic growth the effect of those low rates rippled through the financial system they lowered the cost of borrowing to make it more attractive to companies seeking to make acquisitions or refinance their debt even if they had to take out a leveraged loan the low rates set by the fed also made owning a piece of a leveraged loan a more attractive investment that paid a higher return than other debt instruments it also came with the promise of adjusting up when the fed began lifting its own benchmark rate investors are desperate for yield we ve seen this show before so they re not demanding a lot in terms of investor protections said sheila bair who headed the federal deposit insurance corp during the financial crisis you lower interest rates on safe assets these are the incentives you get concerns also have been raised about a ruling last year by a three judge panel of the u s court of appeals for the district of columbia that removed a regulatory restriction on collateralized loan obligations the 2010 dodd frank financial reforms sought to reduce the sale of risky investments by requiring firms that package loans into securities to retain a 5 stake in the investment the loan syndications and trading assn a leveraged lending industry group filed suit arguing the requirement could limit funding after losing in a lower court the group won a ruling from the appeals court panel in february the loan syndications and trading assn has downplayed the risks in the market the group notes that leveraged loans make up a small percentage of the u s fixed income debt market and the overall default rates on leveraged loans are low just 1 6 late last year and forecast by fitch ratings to fall to 1 5 at the end of this year but with u s economic growth slowing the dynamics could change every time the economy slows down you see a pickup in defaults bair said fed monetary policy makers estimated in december that they would enact two more small hikes in their key interest rate this year although powell said recently that they would be patient and flexible as they monitor the economy higher rates would put more pressure on the leveraged loan market but a sharp economic downturn could lead the fed to lower rates which would ease the pressure when you re this late in the business cycle you have pretty much already lent to every creditworthy borrower kelleher said the real question is how much lending do you want to give to marginal non creditworthy borrowers
by kevin yao beijing reuters china is expected to report on monday that economic growth cooled to its slowest in 28 years in 2018 amid weakening domestic demand and bruising u s tariffs adding pressure on beijing to roll out more support measures to avert a sharper slowdown growing signs of weakness in china which has generated nearly a third of global growth in the past decade are stoking worries about risks to the world economy and are weighing on profits for firms ranging from apple nasdaq to big carmakers chinese policymakers have pledged more support for the economy this year to reduce the risk of massive job losses but they have ruled out a flood of stimulus like that which beijing has unleashed in the past which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt analysts polled by reuters expect the world s second largest economy to have grown 6 4 percent in the october december quarter from a year earlier slowing from the previous quarter s 6 5 percent pace and matching levels last seen in early 2009 during the global financial crisis that could pull 2018 gross domestic product gdp growth to 6 6 percent the lowest since 1990 and down from a revised 6 8 percent in 2017 with stimulus measures expected to take some time to kick in most analysts believe conditions in china are likely to get worse before they get better and see a further slowdown to 6 3 percent this year some analysts believe real growth levels are already much weaker than official data suggest even if china and the united states agree on a trade deal in current talks which is a tall order analysts said it would be no panacea for the sputtering chinese economy unless beijing can galvanize weak investment and consumer demand chen xingdong chief china economist at bnp paribas pa said investors should not expect the latest round of stimulus to produce similar results as during the 2008 09 global crisis when beijing s huge spending package quickly boosted growth what china can really do this year is to prevent deflation prevent a recession and a hard landing in the economy chen said on a quarterly basis growth likely eased to 1 5 percent inoct dec from 1 6 percent in the preceding period china will release its fourth quarter and 2018 gdp data onmonday 0200 gmt along with december factory output retailsales and fixed asset investment since china s quarterly gdp readings tend to be unusually steady most investors prefer to focus on recent trends surprising contractions in december trade data and factory activity gauges in recent weeks have suggested the economy cooled more quickly than expected at the end of 2018 leaving it on shakier footing at the start of the new year sources have told reuters that beijing was planning tolower its growth target to 6 6 5 percent this year from around6 5 percent in 2018 tepid expansion in industrial output and weaker consumer spending is squeezing companies profit margins discouraging fresh investment and raising the risk of higher job losses some factories in guangdong china s export hub have shut earlier than usual ahead of the long lunar new year holiday as the tariff war with the united states curtails orders others are suspending production lines and cutting back on workers hours if the trade war drags on some migrant workers may not have jobs to return to trade negotiators are facing an early march deadline and washington has threatened to sharply hike tariffs if there are no substantial signs of progress stimulus steps eyed so far chinese policymakers have fast tracked construction projects and cut taxes and some import duties to spur demand to free up more funds for lending particularly to more vulnerable smaller firms the central bank has cut the amount of reserves that banks need to set aside as reserves rrr five times over the past year and guided borrowing costs lower further rrr reductions are expected in coming quarters but most analysts do not see a cut in benchmark interest rates just yet as policymakers wait to see if earlier steps begin to stabilize conditions more forceful easing could pressure the yuan and aggravate high debt levels with money going into less efficient or speculative investments the government may unveil more fiscal stimulus measures during the annual parliament meeting in march including bigger tax cuts and more spending on infrastructure projects analysts say some china watchers believe the government could deliver 2 trillion yuan 295 13 billion worth of cuts in taxes and fees this year and allow local governments to issue another 2 trillion yuan in special bonds largely used to fund key projects still some analysts do not expect the economy to bottom out convincingly until summer
advocates note that for the bulk of the post world war ii years labor shared in the growing productivity with workers living standards rising during the postwar boom that began to change in the 1970s despite continued economic growth and productivity wage rates flattened out advocates point out that over the last decade big american companies have dedicated 93 percent of earnings to shareholders redirecting trillions of dollars that could have gone to workers or long term investments in these corporations eighty percent of the value of stock is owned by only 10 percent of the population and half of americans own no stock at all this has accelerated the trend towards greater inequality and according to progressive economists this tunnel vision dedication to short term shareholder profits has had other consequences photo credit whowhatwhy based on data from ed wolff too much money chasing too few assets had led to asset inflation and financial volatility and too little capital invested in productive investments robert hockett a co author of the warren bill told whowhatwhy supporters of the bill view the german codetermination system as a model they point to the strong german economy where income differentials between ceos and rank and file workers are much smaller than in the us less inequality translates into a stronger middle class and more consumer purchasing power according to the bill s proponents on the other hand not surprisingly the bill has many detractors on the right they view the move to increase the power of other stakeholders such as workers consumers and communities as a step in the wrong direction companies that are well run already take into account all the potential stakeholders including employees according to black entertainment television co founder robert johnson who argued that the proposal is a solution in search of a problem that is absolutely not necessary johnson also maintained that by putting government in the middle of how corporations are run would be a slippery slope toward a socialist economy it feels to me as if she warren is looking across the ocean and sees these other models and is trying to copy and paste them onto the us weirdly detached on how these models have failed samuel hammond director of poverty and welfare policy at the niskanen center told whowhatwhy the niskanen center based in washington dc describes itself as a think tank that advocates for environmentalism immigration reform civil liberties and a national defense policy based on market principles it was named after the late william a niskanen a former economic adviser to president ronald reagan the bill s detractors argue that the legislation s requirements would make companies unable to respond to the pressures of the marketplace one example of this is when steve jobs returned to apple in 1996 jobs s decisive actions in shuttering unproductive divisions and laying off thousands of workers as well as replacing corporate directors was credited with turning the company around it s simply impossible to imagine jobs s unilateral vision succeeding in an environment of constant stakeholder management and worker negotiations hammond argued but codetermination s supporters claim that since their livelihoods depend upon it workers have just as much stake in ensuring that the company stays healthy as does management shorter hours temporary pay cuts fewer overtime hours and the more productive use of the existing workforce have all been supported by workers at different companies if it was seen as necessary to keeping them in business hockett said another objection by opponents is that it represents nothing less than the conversion of the modern private corporation into a public institution this raises the question of why we have private corporations in the first place hammond asserted codetermination supporters don t have a problem with that they argue that corporations are actually quasi public institutions beholden to a greater array of interests than just shareholders as corporate attorney robert hinkley wrote the duty of directors is to make money for shareholders but not at the expense of the environment human rights the public health and safety the communities in which the corporation operates or the dignity of its employees europe s economic record a model or a warning advocates of the warren bill cite the productivity and equality in western european and scandinavian economies as a model those nations are the ones that look the most like what senator warren is trying to bring about hockett claimed the european economies that have not done so well are primarily southern european economies and eastern european economies those are the ones that look the most like us hockett said in fact supporters note the german economy s annualized growth in real per capita gross domestic product since 1976 has been more robust than that of the us detractors claim the us is a better model for economic growth than western europe or scandinavia the united states is home to 64 percent of the world s privately held companies and a plurality of the world s billion dollar startups they are the reason america remains the engine of innovation for the entire world hammond stated critics note that in 2005 while under codetermination when the german firm volkswagen long had employee elected board members scandal struck the firm members of their supervisory board were caught exchanging favors including access to prostitutes in exchange for union member board votes opponents also argued that the volkswagen union board members were ineffective in preventing the more recent emissions scandal and protecting the public interest however it may be a tough sell to tout the public interest records of companies without codetermination and hammond cited statistics showing that over half of german employers technically eligible for codetermination don t have it the pressures of globalization are pushing companies to adopt a more american model hammond said a long history federal chartering is not a new idea the first advocate of the idea was james madison back in the 18th century twice madison advocated that congress has the authority to grant charters of incorporation in cases where the public good may require them and the authority of a single state may be incompetent in the progressive era a period of social activism and political reform in the us spanning the 1890s to the 1920s presidents william howard taft woodrow wilson and teddy roosevelt all endorsed federal chartering to rein in the power of the trusts during the 1930s wyoming sen joseph o mahoney held extensive hearings on the topic and drafted legislation that required large corporations be chartered by the federal government after agitation by many progressive groups in the mid 1970s the corporate democracy act was introduced by then congressman ben rosenthal in 1980 but with the advent of the reagan revolution this effort got little traction all four versions of federal chartering legislation reflected the concerns of the times federal chartering proposals in the progressive era and in the 1930s stressed their anti monopoly provisions the corporate democracy act of 1980 stressed making corporations more responsive to the communities they affected this may have been in response to the discovery of toxic chemical time bombs around the nation the love canal neighborhood in niagara falls ny became emblematic of environmental disaster hundreds of families exposed to toxic chemicals there eventually had to be relocated and as cited earlier warren s version highlights its impact on fighting income inequality in early 2018 a poll by civis analytics showed the general public supported by a greater than two to one margin the idea of employees at large companies electing representatives to the board of directors there was even support for the idea among many republican leaning voters in another sign of codetermination s potential popularity one of the recent demands by google strikers was that an employee representative be seated on the google board of directors jack kemp s shovel ready model warren has sometimes been compared to the late republican congressman and vice presidential candidate jack kemp as an innovator and idea leader in her party and the comparison between the two may not end there before the sweeping reagan tax cuts were passed in 1981 kemp rolled out his own tax cut proposal before congress and the public in the late 1970s kemp knew the then democratic majorities in congress would never enact his proposal but many historians believe his efforts laid the groundwork for the bill s eventual passage when reagan came to power the same strategy appears to be at work behind warren s roll out of the accountable capitalism act and other progressive proposals as well those other progressive proposals which are being field tested in the current us congress include the green new deal the stop walmart act and a 15 an hour minimum wage there appears to be some momentum on the hill for the accountable capitalism act a few weeks ago a broad coalition of democrats in the house announced their support for the measure supporters are planting the flag now with these proposals so that should the democrats sweep congress and the white house in 2020 the new bills will be shovel ready to be passed into law
hyperinflation zimbabwe s monetary death spiral president mnangagwa s pledge that zimbabwe is open for business rings hollow indeed many businesses in zimbabwe are shuttered an increase in government controlled fuel prices over the weekend has ignited simmering fury over what is in fact a currency crisis in response zimbabwe s security forces have launched a violent crackdown on protestors and opposition politicians the crackdown has been done under the cover of a social media blackout yes the internet is shuttered too in a sense the only thing new in this uprising is president mnangagwa himself recall that it was he who organized a coup that removed the long serving strongman robert mugabe from power in 2017 this was followed by what many claim was a rigged election by the mugabe mnangagwa ruling zanu pf party rigged or not the election gave mnangagwa s presidency the patina of legitimacy now a new dawn has arrived zimbabweans realize that mnangagwa is simply mugabe in a new suit and with new rhetoric the reality is one in which the economy is controlled by what in essence is an organized criminal syndicate the zimbabwe african national union patriotic front zanu pf party the same syndicate that has run zimbabwe into the ground for over 35 years zimbabweans also know through the brutal experience of two recent hyperinflations the zanu pf governments are stunningly incompetent when it comes to zimbabwe s fiscal and monetary affairs during mugabe s 37 year reign zimbabwe s economy sank but the decline was punctuated by several notable events and episodes one of these was the fast track land reform program of 2000 under which land was seized from white farmers land confiscations had been taking place since 1980 but under this particular program the farms were taken without compensation zimbabwe s supreme court declared the program unconstitutional but mugabe s government ignored that ruling this flagrant abuse of property rights and the rule of law sent the economy into a deep dive from 2000 to 2008 real g d p per capita contracted on average by 8 29 per year during this period zimbabwe ran large fiscal deficits financed by printing money and experienced the second most severe case of hyperinflation in history on november 14 2008 the annual inflation rate peaked at 89 7 sextillion percent every day making zimbabwe s 100 trillion dollar notes worthless in the end the government was forced to scrap the zimbabwean dollar because zimbabweans simply refused to use it mugabe s zanu pf government then instituted a system in which the united states dollar became the coin of the realm government accounts became denominated in united states dollars in 2009 as a result of this dollarization and the installation of a national unity government in 2009 the economy rebounded that rebound persisted during the term of the national unity government which lasted until july 2013 during this period real g d p per capita surged at an average annual rate of 11 2 the minister of finance tendai biti who was a member of the opposition understood that under a dollarized regime the country would no longer be able to print money to finance deficits consequently budget deficits were almost eliminated with the collapse of the unity government and the return of mugabe s zimbabwe african national union patriotic front party old habits resurfaced the fiscal deficits ballooned something that should not happen under dollarization rules but mugabe would break any rule to finance its ballooning deficits the government began to issue an enormous number of new zim dollars in 2013 with that zimbabwe abandoned dollarization and started to issue its own money the new monetary liabilities issued by the government come in two forms bond notes and coins and electronic real time gross settlements rtgss the chart below shows how the bond notes and coins and rtgss dominate the broad measure of zimbabwe s money supply m3 indeed the new zim dollars make up a whopping 79 65 of m3 with rtgss accounting for 74 47 of m3 and bond notes and coins accounting for 5 18 money in zimbabweprof steve hanke and erik bostrom it is important to stress that most of the financial press paints an incorrect picture of zimbabwe s monetary regime press reports often indicate that zimbabwe does not have its own money and that this is the source of zimbabwe s problems this account is incorrect zimbabwe has its own money and this is in fact the source of zimbabwe s problems this is revealed by the fact that the new zim dollars are issued at par to the u s dollar but trade at a massive discount to the dollar it didn t take long after the government started issuing new zim dollars for zimbabwe to experience its second bout of hyperinflation remember that hyperinflation occurs when the monthly inflation rate reaches 50 per month and remains above that rate for at least 30 consecutive days this initial threshold was breached on september 14 2017 and with that the 2017 episode of hyperinflation commenced the chart below shows that episode as well as the troubling recent surge in zimbabwe s inflation it is this recent surge to an annual inflation rate of 235 8 that has sparked the recent protests zimbabwe s implied annual inflation rateprof steve hanke what to do as long as zimbabwe continues to produce its own money namely bond notes and rtgss zimbabwe will continue to be in the grips of a monetary death spiral indeed the new zim dollars are malignant and must be removed if left in the monetary system gresham s law will continue to force u s dollars out of the system to be put under the mattress causing a huge artificial shortage of u s dollars remember that gresham s law which was introduced by henry dunning macleod in his elements of political economy 1858 states that bad money drives out good today gresham s law is operating on steroids in zimbabwe just how does one remove zimbabwe s monetary malignancy before it kills the patient the government must announce that it will not rob the holders of bond notes and rtgss they were issued at par to the u s dollar and they will be redeemed at par by the issuer the zimbabwean government the redemption at par will take place over a five year period during this period the government will redeem the bond notes and rtgss by accepting them as payment for taxes or any other obligations if credible the redemption policy announcement will cause the value of the bond notes and rtgss to climb towards par creating much needed liquidity as well as solvency in zimbabwe s financial system zimbabwe s monetary death spiral will come to an abrupt stop to run down the stock of new zim dollars to 2016 levels 1 billion per year should be redeemed over five years then the patient will be deemed to be in remission and a clean bill of monetary health can be issued zimbabwe will once again have a healthy superior currency the u s dollar by steve h

kuala lumpur jan 20 foreign investors were generally net buyers in the malaysian equity market pumping in rm231 21 million between monday and thursday compared with only rm25 5 million during last week s holiday shortened trading days advertisement foreign fund outflow of rm12 33 million was only registered on monday while the remaining days saw net inflow of foreign funds m a securities sdn bhd chief dealing officer r sundararajah said the benchmark fbm klci gained 9 51 points until thursday and generally it was smooth sailing with the equity market seeing regained interest among foreign buyers there was buy call for equities in this region by some foreign houses amid low stock valuation and this too had a positive effect on the fbm klci advertisement in addition the easing of the tariff dispute between the united states nd china was welcomed by equity markets in the region he told bernama sundararajah however said the latest uncertainty over united kingdom s brexit saga on tuesday which turned out to be an anti climax somewhat adversely affected the local market the decision by china central bank to inject us 83 billion to maintain liquidity in the banking system was another major news in the market this week advertisement moving forward we expect the stock market next week to hover around current levels and test the 1 690 points level barring unforseen circumstances both at home and abroad said sundararajah meanwhile bank islam malaysia bhd chief economist dr mohd afzanizam abdul rashid said from monday until thursday the participation of local institutions in the equity market was at its peak with an average rate of 49 2 per cent followed by foreign institutions at 25 6 per cent and local retail at 25 2 per cent however local institutions were net sellers between monday and thursday offloading rm278 6 million in stocks while local retail were net purchases accounting for rm47 4 million he said mohd afzanizam said this was driven by developments in the global economy which continued to grapple with heightened uncertainties the brexit issue and china s stimulus plan of cutting its value added tax rate on selected industries to avert slowdown coupled with the us government shutdown the longest in history weighed heavily on investor sentiment going forward ongoing trade discussions between the united states and china will be closely scrutinised similarly any progress on brexit will be a major breakthrough especially when prime minister teresa may survived a vote of no confidence on wednesday said mohd afzanizam echoing sundararajah s views he also expected the fbm klci to be confined within a tight range as market sentiment would continue to remain cautious meanwhile on the home front finance minister lim guan eng said goldman sachs apology in regards to the involvement of its former employee tim leissner in the 1malaysia development board 1mdb scandal was not sufficient and that the investment bank should make reparation and pay malaysia a compensation of us 7 5 billion he pointed out that the apology was necessary for malaysia and the investment bank must be accountable as the issue also involved a breach of financial duty where the banking industry had the obligation to make good the losses that the country had suffered leissner has been criminally charged by us and malaysian prosecutors with bribery and money laundering in connection with 1mdb and is scheduled to be sentenced in june in a separate development the government has appointed mizuho bank malaysia bhd hsbc bank malaysia bhd and daiwa capital markets ltd as joint lead arrangers for the 10 year 200 billion yen rm7 6 billion samurai bond lim said the appointments were made after six proposals were shortlisted from the 27 proposals received by the finance ministry during the tabling of 2019 budget in the dewan rakyat last year the finance minister said that the japanese government has offered to guarantee the 200 billion yen bonds which is expected to be issued before march this year commenting on the matter inter pacific research sdn bhd head of research pong teng siew said the news sparks the possibility that the government was ready to spend again through the awarding of new contracts in the future the government was very cautious and preoccupied on trimming its spending lowering the national debt and getting a better value for its spending but this news is likely to instill confidence and positvity among investors as this would mean more liquidity returning back into the equity market and more work in building government infrastructure said pong meanwhile the crash in crude oil prices in 2014 looks set to claim its first publicly listed victim with perisai petroleum teknologi bhd headed for removal from bursa malaysia on feb 13 the former market darling last friday failed to secure bursa securities approval for its regularisation plan and has received a notice from the regulator of its trading

just a few days ago president trump raised the import tariffs for steel and aluminium he hopes that such a measure will revive the steel and alumina industry in the usa many do not believe this is so and instead fear a global trade war in which all will lose we will see what happens below we are taking a look at what it in fact means to trade in a global market free trade is promoted and expected to benefit parties at both ends of the supply chain international agreements are made to enhance the trade between countries a free trade zone of 26 african countries including ethiopia has been agreed upon for example it is hoped that the deal will ease access to markets within the region and strengthen the bloc s bargaining power when negotiating international deals analysts say the agreement will help intra regional trade and boost growth some other examples are the north american free trade agreement nafta european union eu and asian pacific economic cooperation apec as is so often the case though there are two sides of the coin free trade creates benefits indeed but it also destroys it gives and takes away by increasing competition free trade lowers the price of imported goods and raises the demands for quality goods produced locally sales will increase and profits will rise it is clear that consumers of imported goods and producers of exported goods are benefiting but some groups are harmed as well domestic producers of goods that are imported as well are the most obvious group to loose out their market share declines and their profit falls this is when governments sometimes intervene and come to protect domestic producers by passing protectionist legislation there are several forms of such legislation like tariffs quotas and qualitative trade restrictions tariffs are taxes on goods moving across borders they can be imposed on imports exports or on goods in transit the tariff on imports is the more common one they tend to raise the price of imported goods and thereby protect domestic industries from foreign competition they also generate income for the government the foreign seller may however lower the prices to offset any tariff increase as a result the government continues to earn income from the import tariffs but there is little additional protection for the domestic producers quotas are limits on the amount of goods that can be imported into a country quota s increase prices by directly restricting trade this is a form of protection for domestic producers once the quota has been reached goods no longer enter the market even if the sellers lower their price it is the consumer now who loses most instead of imposing quotas countries also make agreements to share markets by limiting foreign export sales then there are the so called non tariff barriers which include a wide range of charges requirements and restrictions such as surcharges at border crossings licensing regulations performance requirements government subsidies health safety regulations packaging and labelling regulations and size weight requirements these kind of barriers are the most difficult as they are subject to interpretation and do they protect domestic producers or discriminate foreign producers restrictions dealing with public health and safety are certainly legitimate but the line between social well being and protection is a fine one are us automobile safety standards unfair to foreign car makers are chickens slaughtered in the us unfit for the european market because a different process is used to clean them governments also subsidise local producers which can make it very difficult to foreign producers to enter the market this happens most in the agriculture sector where west european and the us farmers receive subsidies from their governments as a side effect they dump their under priced overproduction on weaker markets making it very difficult for domestic farmers to compete against below production prices because of the harmful effects of protectionism the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt was formed in 1948 through regular trade rounds or negotiations gatt served as the major forum for the liberalization and promotion of non discriminatory international trade between participating countries in practice this resulted in bargaining among countries to lower their tariffs gatt policy was for countries to replace non tariff barriers by tariffs assuming that non tariff barriers do more harm to trade than tariffs tariffs reduce uncertainty and are clear so they are easier to negotiate during its existence gatt effectively reduced trade restrictions and minimized price distortions it also reduced qualitative trade barriers curtail dumping that is selling abroad at a cost lower than the cost of production and discouraged government subsidies gatt was replaced in 1995 by the world trade organization wto which continues to pursue tariff reductions as well as liberalization of trade in agriculture and services the wto is the global watch dog for free trade wto also faces new challenges which comprise of foreign investment policies competition and labour standards although most countries want foreign investment some still set terms of entry for foreign investors and while many countries favour labour standards such as a ban on child labour and freedom for trade unions others argue that low labour costs are the basis of most of their exports to be a member of wto will obviously be of benefit to tackle some of the barriers faced in exporting goods to become a member of wto also requires that policies and practices are conform global standards president trump took a unilateral decision against the advice of many of his own experts unilateral decisions and measure are seldom beneficial in the end he expects it will be easy to win a threatening global trade war instead it may end up in a lose lose for all to quote his own words we will see what happens ton haverkort

investment thesis royal bank of canada nyse ry has the reputation of being the gold standard in the canadian banking sector with its strong durable competitive advantages ry has a conservative business approach and operates in an oligopoly banking environment in canada in this article we will assess the financial results and valuation of the bank we will also look at the operating environment and the economic outlook in order to assess if the growth rate can continue in 2019 financial position and outlook ry is the market leader in canada with a diversified business model and a history of generating both profit and dividend growth to its shareholders this continued in 2018 and ry increased its net income to a record high 12 4 billion up 8 4 yoy and increased its dividend to 3 8 up 8 3 yoy ry also exceeded its key financial metrics by a wide margin in 2018 total dividends represented a payout ratio of 45 based on the fy eps which indicates that there is room to grow the dividend payments to shareholders ry maintained its leadership position in financial services in canada the personal commercial banking results were driven by higher spreads volume growth and higher card service revenue the bank reported higher earnings in many of its business segments in particular the wealth management business segment which grew by 23 yoy the bank was also conservatively managed with an 11 5 common equity tier 1 ratio the growth momentum in the us remained strong and ry derived 23 of its earnings from this market the bank also had a lot of tailwinds in the us with interest rate increases tax cuts and positive fundamentals in 2018 chart source quarterly slides q4 page 4 ry has a long track record of growing its earnings and net income as illustrated below ry s revenue has increased by 5 7 and net income by 8 4 on average since 2014 on a per share basis earnings increased 8 6 and dividends by 7 3 yoy source annual report 2018 overall 2018 was an excellent year for the bank but the big question is if we can expect a similar development in 2019 operating environment and outlook 2019 global markets experienced elevated volatility in the second half of 2018 particularly in december rising interest rates in canada and in the us inflationary concerns declining commodity prices and global trade tensions have triggered the recent selloff in the stock market and we have entered a turbulent start for 2019 central banks are expected to continue to increase interest rates in 2019 as the economy is projected to grow which will put additional pressure on the economy in ry s home market canada gdp is expected to grow by 2 0 for fy 18 and see a more moderate growth rate for fy 19 the slower growth rate 1 7 vs 2 0 18 is a result of lower oil prices but is expected to be offset by strong employment and business investments and exports outside the energy sector source monetary policy report january 2019 the ratio of household debt to disposable income remained at a very high level in canada despite recent quarters slowdown this will impact the growth rate for ry since it put a limit on how much the bank can grow its loan portfolio source monetary policy report october 2018 further statistics from imf also shows the high level of debt among the canadian households in relation to its gdp source international monetary fund fred in the january 19 interest rate announcement boc maintained its target for the overnight rate at 1 75 boc also provided its economic outlook and we have highlighted some of the key comments from the two latest announcements below the global economic expansion continues to moderate with growth forecast to slow to 3 4 per cent in 2019 from 3 7 per cent in 2018 in particular growth in the united states remains solid but is expected to slow to a more sustainable pace through 2019 the canadian economy as a whole grew in line with the bankâ s projection in the third quarter although data suggest less momentum going into the fourth quarter household credit and regional housing markets appear to be stabilizing following a significant slowdown in recent quarters household spending will be dampened further by slow growth in oil producing provinces governing council continues to judge that the policy interest rate will need to rise in to a neutral range to achieve the inflation target ry also communicated in their annual report about the canadian housing and indebtedness which we have highlighted below the boc continues to be on a path of gradually raising interest rates this could have materially negative credit implications for our broader consumer lending activities in the future given current levels of elevated household indebtedness it is clear that ry s earnings are significantly affected by the general business and economic conditions based on the outlook we believe that the operating environment will be more challenging going forward the economy shows signs of slowing down and high household indebtedness and rising interest rates limits the growth potential for ry current valuation the recent selloff in the stock market has impacted ry and all canadian banks despite strong annual results ry data by ycharts this has resulted in a significantly lower p e ratio for ry and its competitors ry is traded at a premium vs its competitors ry pe ratio forward data by ycharts price to book value has come down to historical levels but ry is traded at a premium vs its competitors ry price to book value data by ycharts conclusions the ratio of household debt to disposable income remained at high levels in canada this in combination with rising interest levels and slower gdp growth limits the growth potential and increases the risk of owning shares in ry

santa barbara with equities slumping exchange rate volatility increasing and political risks intensifying financial markets around the world have hit a rough patch during times like these international investors generally grow cautious and prioritise safety over returns so money flees to safe havens that can provide secure liquid investment grade assets on a sufficiently large scale but there are no obvious safe havens today for the first time in living memory investors lack a quiet port where they can find shelter from the storm historically the safe haven par excellence was the united states in the form of treasury bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the us government as one investment strategist put it back in 2012 when people are worried all road lead to treasuries the bursting of the us real estate bubble in 2007 offers a case in point no one doubted that the us was the epicentre of the global financial crisis but rather than flee the us capital actually flooded into it in the last three months of 2008 net purchases of us assets reached 500 billion three times more than that of the preceding nine months combined to be sure some of these dollar claims were due to the fact that foreign banks and institutional investors needed greenbacks to cover their funding needs after interbank and other wholesale short term markets seized up but that was hardly the only reason why portfolio managers piled into the us much of the increased demand was due to sheer fear at a time when nobody knew how bad things might get the us was widely seen as the safest bet but this was before the arrival of us president donald trump who has managed to undermine confidence in the dollar to an unprecedented degree in addition to abandoning any notion of fiscal responsibility trump has spent his first two years in office attacking international institutions and picking fights with us allies to be sure even before trump confidence in the dollar suffered a blow in 2011 when standard poor s downgraded treasury securities by one notch in response to a near shutdown of the us government that episode was triggered by a standoff between then president barack obama and congressional republicans over a routine proposal to raise the federal debt ceiling today however investors have even more reason to worry about the us government s credit rating in 2018 alone the us government was shut down three times and it remains in a partial shutdown to this day owing to trump s demand for funds to build a big beautiful wall on the border with mexico where can investors go if not the us the eurozone might seem like a logical alternative after the dollar the euro is the world s most widely used currency and taken together the capital markets of the eurozone s 19 member states are close in size to the us market but europe has troubles of its own economic growth is slowing not least in germany and the risk of a banking crisis in italy the eurozone s fourth largest economy looms on the horizon worse still is the uncertainty over brexit which could prove highly disruptive if the united kingdom crashes out of the european union without a divorce agreement needless to say britain too can be ruled out as a safe haven at least until the brexit fiasco is resolved what about the swiss franc though its attractions are obvious switzerland s financial markets are simply too small to serve as an adequate substitute for the us that leaves japan with its abundant supply of government bonds it is the biggest single market for public debt outside the us the question for portfolio managers though is whether it is really safe to invest in a country where government debt exceeds 230 per cent of gdp for comparison the public debt to gdp ratio in the us is around 88 per cent and even in troubled italy it is no more than 130 per cent admittedly the market for japanese government debt is more stable than most owing to the fact that much of it is held by domestic savers which is to say it is safely tucked under the mattress but japan is an aging country with an economy that has remained almost stagnant for a quarter century investors would be right to wonder where it will find the resources to continue servicing its massive debt overhang and then there is china with the world s third largest national market for public debt certainly the supply of assets in china is ample but the chinese market is so tightly controlled that it is essentially the opposite of a safe haven it will be a long time before global investors even consider putting much faith in chinese securities with secure ports becoming scarce investors will become increasingly jittery they will be inclined to move funds at the slightest sign of danger which will add substantially to market volatility today s rough patch is probably here to stay benjamin j cohen is professor of international political economy at the university of california santa barbara

china is leading the charge in a bid to undermine accepted concepts of human rights accountability and justice the chinese effort backed by autocrats elsewhere has turned human rights into an underrated yet crucial battleground in the shaping of a new world order china is manoeuvring against the backdrop of an unprecedented crackdown on turkic muslims in its north western province of xinjiang the accelerated rollout of restrictions elsewhere in the country and the export of key elements of its model of a 21st century orwellian surveillance state the chinese effort highlighted in human rights watch s world report 2019 is multipronged it involves proposals to alter the principles on which united nations human rights council operates in ways that would enable repressive autocratic regimes to achieve its goal china is employing its financial muscle and infrastructure and energy driven belt and road initiative to economically entice countries that are financially strapped desperate for investment and or on the defensive because of human rights abuses china is also seeking a dominant role in various countries digital infrastructure and media that would allow it to influence the flow of information and enable its allies to better control dissent china is waging its campaign at a crucial juncture of history it benefits from the rise of ethno and religious nationalism populism intolerance and widespread anti migration sentiment across the world s democracies the campaign is enabled by the emergence of presidents like donald j trump in the united states the philippines rodrigo duterte turkey s recep tayyip erdogan hungary s victor orban and brazil s jair bolsonaro who have either deemphasized human rights or gone as far as justifying abuses in addition to seeking to limit if not undermine independent media that hold them accountable the timing of the chinese effort is significant because it comes at a moment that predictions of the death of popular protest symbolized by the defeat of the initially successful 2011 popular arab revolts are being called into question mass anti government demonstrations in sudan demand the resignation of president omar al bashir anti chinese groups march in kyrgyzstan while protests in zimbabwe decry repression poor public services high unemployment widespread corruption and delays in civil servants receiving their salaries the past year has also seen widespread anti government agitation in countries like morocco and jordan the protests and what human rights watch executive director kenneth roth describes in his foreword to the group s just published 674 page world report 2019 as a resistance that keeps winning battles suggests that china s campaign may have won battles but has yet to win the war victory isn t assured but the successes of the past year suggest that the abuses of authoritarian rule are prompting a powerful human rights counterattack mr roth wrote nonetheless human rights watch s china director sophie richardson warned that people outside china don t yet seem to realize that their human rights are increasingly under threat as beijing becomes more powerful in recent years beijing has sought to extend its influence into and impose its standards and policies on key international human rights institutions weakening some of the only means of accountability and justice available to people around the world ms richardson noted that china had last year successfully pushed a non binding resolution in the un human rights council hrc that advocated promotion of human rights on the basis of the people s republic s principle of win win a principle that cynics assert means china wins twice in a sign of the times the resolution garnered significant support the united states in a twist of irony was the only council member to vote against it with countries like germany and australia abstaining china is not the only country that would like a globally accepted approach to be altered to the detriment of human rights muslim nations with saudi arabia in the lead have for example long sought to have blasphemy criminalized the resolution gutted the ideas of accountability for actual human rights violations suggesting dialogue instead it failed to specify any course of action when rights violators refuse to cooperate with un experts retaliate against rights defenders or actively reject human rights principles and it even failed to acknowledge any role for the hrc itself to address serious human rights violations when dialogue and cooperation don t produce results ms richardson said if these ideas become not just prevailing norms but also actual operating principles for the hrc victims of state sponsored abuses worldwide including in myanmar south sudan syria and yemen will face almost impossible odds in holding abusive governments accountable ms richardson cautioned in a separate interview ms richardson described the resolution as the start of a process to wither away the un human rights eco system she said human rights groups were concerned about what china will try to do next whether it will more aggressively try to change the council s mandate or nibble away at language in treaties or roll back the role of civil society china wants inter governmental cooperation instead of accountability government officials discussing among themselves with no discussion of accountability for abuses and no participation of independent groups china s efforts are both an attempt to rewrite international norms and counter sharp western criticism of its moves against christians and muslim and its crackdown in xinjiang up to one million turkic muslims have reportedly been incarcerated in re education camps that china projects as vocational training facilities to maintain its crackdown china depends on a fragile silence in the muslim world that is fraying at the edges in addition to attempting to change the operating principles of the un human rights commission lobbying un and foreign government officials to tone down criticism and invited foreign diplomats and journalists on choreographed visits to xinjiang china has at times successfully employed its economic and financial clout to buy either support or silence pakistan the host of the belt and road s us 45 billion crown jewel has curbed its initial criticism of the crackdown in xinjiang similarly china is pressuring myanmar to revive the suspended us 3 6 billion myitsone dam project which if built as previously designed would flood 600 square kilometres of forestland in northern kachin state and export 90 of the power produced to china china has reportedly offered in return for the dam to support myanmar that has been condemned by the united nations western countries and some muslim nations for its repressive campaign against the rohingya some 700 000 of which fled to bangladesh last year in a bid to pacify criticism of its xinjiang policy in central asia where anti chinese sentiment has been rising china agreed this month to allow some 2 000 ethnic kazakhs to renounce their chinese citizenship and leave the country the decision follows testimony in a kazakh court of a former employee of a re education camp detailing three facilities in which up to 7 500 kazaks and chinese nationals of kazakh descent allegedly were being held the testimony prompted sharp criticism in parliament and on social media china and the west s diametrically opposed concepts of human rights are part of a larger contest for dominance over the future of technology and global influence freedom house a washington based freedom watchdog reported last year that china was exporting to at least 18 countries sophisticated surveillance systems capable of

some experts have already started to advise global enterprises to enter the chinese market now as they see a us chinese trade deal as likely to become a reality by mid 2019 and there could be some opportunities in the chinese market to take advantage of now the point is that both sides the us and china are now under a lot of pressure to get a deal done stefan hofer of hong kong based lgt bank said i think it s perfectly okay for investors to take on china exposure now in anticipation of that such optimistic sentiments are gradually spreading across the globe as the modestly positive tone of the ongoing sino american talks might suggest both sides are indeed interested in striking a compromise agreement to alleviate tensions in bilateral ties rather than engage in a lengthy war of attrition on trade which would involve further tariffs and regulatory restrictions the china us trade tensions greatly contributed to the disruptions in international trade in the second half of 2018 a mutual exchange in tariffs national security investigations of chinese trade in the us and china s threats of retaliation have affected trade between the two countries and their third party trade partners as well now as these fears subside global trade might be in for a new era of expansion and acceleration read more economic war iran vows to continue selling oil as us sanctions take effect this comes as china has lowered its gdp growth outlook for this year to 6 percent down from the previously predicted 6 5 percent after 6 4 percent growth last year beijing appears to still price last year s trade losses into its 2019 gdp growth assessments however china s plans to stimulate its slowing economy announced at the height of trade tensions with the us last year appear to still be intact economic growth should stabilise as the chinese government releases additional stimulus including corporate tax cuts credit easing infrastructure investment and looser real estate rules in lower tier cities analysts from london based think tank ihs markit said in a note last week

wreaton666 wreaton666 17 january 2019 so trump while claiming the money would be clawed back from mexico through a new trade agreement has gone cap in hand to congress to ask for the estimated 5 7 billion needed for its construction the democrats have flatly refused claiming it is a waste of taxpayers money donald j trump realdonaldtrump 18 january 2019 this has led to the longest shutdown of the federal government in us history in the meantime nbc news reported this month that a steel prototype for trump s long promised wall had failed tests carried out by the us marine corps which discovered it could be cut through using saws repealing obamacare obamacare intended to extend health insurance coverage to the estimated 15 per cent of americans who lacked it and were not covered by other health programmes such as medicare and medicaid the law created state run marketplaces where individuals can compare prices as they shop for coverage ryan fournier ryanafournier 16 january 2019 barack obama signed the affordable care act in 2010 and most of the provisions took effect in 2014 the act has faced fierce opposition from the republican party and president trump pledged to repeal and replace what has been dubbed obamacare since the early days of his administration however all attempts to achieve that goal have so far failed in congress last year obama claimed that he had urged trump make some adjustments to the programme change the name and take credit for it infrastructure when trump was campaigning for the white house in 2016 he promised to invest billions of dollars in tired us infrastructure much of the us existing infrastructure was built between 1933 and 1970 a period which began with president franklin d roosevelt s famous new deal which involved huge public investment in projects such as the hoover dam in order to tackle the high unemployment of the great depression the us has 614 387 bridges 40 per cent of which are at least 50 years old and 56 007 are structurally deficient but still in use the brand new house democratic majority pledges a brand new infrastructure bill and let s not forget that president trump campaigned on infrastructure as the house drafts this bill these clear easy and basic principles should be kept in mind pic twitter com blzk4lwx7v taxpayers for common sense taxpayers 17 january 2019 one of the first things trump did when he arrived in the oval office was speed up environmental reviews in order to expedite his planned 1 trillion infrastructure programme so far he has failed to get the programme passed by congress but after the mid term elections in november peter defazio the democrat who was set to become head of the house of representatives committee overseeing transportation said he hoped they could approve infrastructure legislation in the first six months of 2019 that was before trump and the democrats reached a stalemate over the budget environment on the campaign trail in 2016 president trump sang the virtues of the us coal industry and was rewarded with millions of votes in mining strongholds like west virginia kentucky pennsylvania and wyoming but he has found out the reality that energy produced by coal is more expensive than that produced by fracking and few companies want to invest in it the trump administration is considering co operating with private companies to transport coal and liquefied natural gas lng through us navy bases and other federal facilities but his plans to export coal through military bases on the us west coast undermines national security and ignores environmental laws trump has also tried to push through oil pipelines despite widespread opposition from environmentalists and native americans unicorn riot ur_ninja 22 february 2017 in march 2017 the state department issued a permit for transcanada to construct the 8 billion keystone xl pipeline after trump approved it former president barack obama had previously blocked the project in 2015 the 1 179 mile pipeline would carry up to 830 000 barrels of crude oil per day from the canadian province of alberta to the us state of nebraska and down to oil refineries on the texas gulf coast but in november 2018 a federal judge in montana blocked the project again arguing the trump administration had failed to properly analyse such the environmental impact of greenhouse gases from the pipeline and the risks of oil spills one pipeline that has begun operating is the controversial dakota access pipeline hundreds of protesters were demonstrating against it at the time of trump s inauguration in january 2017 native american tribes including the standing rock sioux oppose the nearly 1 200 mile pipeline in south dakota because they claimed it threatened sacred territory and vital water resources the demonstrators camp was finally closed down by the military and the pipeline began operating in june 2017 mid terms the mid term elections in november 2018 were seen as a test of trump s popularity although in most cases they were really a test of the popularity of those running for numerous seats in the senate house of representatives and governors mansions across the country although the democrats tried to claim it was a huge victory but it was really more of a draw the democrats captured the house of representatives and soon installed the arch obstructor nancy pelosi as

president donald trump s slogan at rallies during the midterm elections was promises made promises kept at the two year mark of his presidency on sunday trump has indeed kept some of his promises but failed to deliver on others only last week trump claimed that he is doing exactly what he promised to do for decades politicians promised to secure the border fix our trade deals bring back our factories get tough on china move the embassy to jerusalem make nato pay their fair share and so much else only to do nothing or worse trump tweeted in a following tweet he concluded i am doing exactly what i pledged to do and what i was elected to do by the citizens of our great country just as i promised i am fighting for you i am doing exactly what i pledged to do and what i was elected to do by the citizens of our great country just as i promised i am fighting for you donald j trump realdonaldtrump january 14 2019 trump only mentioned the promises he has made progress on here are some of the major issues he ran on and how far he got with them border wall in his presidential announcement speech in june 2015 trump stated i would build a great wall and nobody builds walls better than me believe me and i ll build them very inexpensively i will build a great great wall on our southern border and i ll have mexico pay for that wall trump has since claimed he did not mean mexico was going to write out a check to construct it the wall in early 2017 then mexican president enrique peña nieto said his country would not pay for the wall now halfway through trump s term he is demanding 5 7 billion in funding to build the barrier democrats have refused to fund trump s wall instead offering a fraction of that amount for border security the stalemate has led to the longest government shutdown in u s history and no wall yet trade deals trump criticized the north american free trade agreement nafta as a disaster and said that the trans pacific partnership tpp is going to be worse so we will stop it in addition he promised to confront china about the trade deficit the president kept his pledge on tpp withdrawing the u s within a few days of him entering office last november he negotiated the united states mexico canada agreement usmca to replace nafta and got the countries to sign it it still needs to be approved by congress but trump s trade promise on china has yet to materialize the discussions turned into a trade war with both countries imposing tariffs on each other s goods the warring paused temporarily in december when the countries agreed to a truce of 90 days saving the coal industry trump on the campaign trail promised to bring back coal jobs we re going to put our miners back to work trump said at a rally in phoenix and that he would do so by rolling back obama era climate regulations despite two years of the trump administration trying to reinvigorate the coal industry coal consumption was projected to decline by close to 4 percent in 2018 dropping to the lowest level since 1979 the u s energy information administration announced late last year by the end of 2018 demand for coal staggered 44 percent below the peak of consumption in 2007 repealing obamacare trump vowed to repeal obamacare officially known as the affordable care act which was designed to extend healthcare to all americans who were not insured the gop tax plan passed in december 2017 eliminated the individual mandate penalty for people who did not have health insurance in 2019 republicans have also shortened the enrollment period and cut out some subsidies but a full repeal has not happened a federal judge in texas last december ruled that repealing the individual mandate part was an essential portion of the law and meant obamacare as a whole was unconstitutional but the law remains intact as an appeal goes before the supreme court tax cuts trump promised huge tax cuts for working class americans as well as a lower corporate tax rate the gop tax plan passed in december 2017 marking a promise kept by trump however the corporate tax was reduced from 35 percent to 21 percent instead of his promised 15 percent the tax plan is largely viewed as containing mostbenefits for rich americans president donald trump speaks to supporters during a rally at the southern illinois airport on october 27 in murphysboro illinois trump has kept some

their vision of ever closer commercial and political ties is under attack and the economic outlook is darkening britain s political system has been thrown into chaos as the country negotiates a messy divorce from the european union under president donald trump the united states is imposing trade sanctions on friend and foe alike and the government is paralyzed by a partial shutdown over immigration policy that forced trump and a high level u s delegation to cancel the trip to davos a year after getting a standing ovation from the elites at davos french president emmanuel macron is sinking in the polls as he contends with yellow vest protesters who have taken to the streets to call for higher wages and fairer pensions nationalist political movements are gaining strength across europe and the economic backdrop is worrying experts are downgrading their forecasts for global growth this year amid rising interest rates and tensions over trade judging by the state of the world right now 10 years on from the financial crisis and the dysfunctional state of global politics i would suggest that these annual events have achieved the sum total of diddly squat said michael hewson chief market analyst at cmc markets uk the collective worries have sent a shudder through global financial markets the dow jones industrial average is down nearly 9 percent from oct 3 david dollar a senior fellow at the brookings institute said the buckling market represents a lot of anxiety that we re seeing from the corporate elite who meet at davos how times have changed for most of the past quarter century the worldview symbolized by the world economic forum of ever freer world trade and closer ties between countries had dominated then came a backlash from americans and europeans whose jobs were threatened by low wage competition from countries like china and who felt alienated at home by wealth inequality and immigration in 2016 u s voters elected trump who advocated restricting immigration and scaling back free trade and the british chose to leave the eu the winners from globalization have had the megaphone said paul sheard a senior fellow at the mossavar rahmani center for business and government at harvard university s kennedy school the losers have been somewhat silent but now are starting to express themselves through the ballot box and through the political process the davos confab has always been vulnerable to snark hedge fund billionaires flying into davos in fuel guzzling private jets to discuss the threat of climate change millionaire ceos discussing inequality while downing cocktails endless conversations between people who describe themselves as thought leaders first among them perhaps is wef founder klaus schwab in an interview sunday he stressed the need for more global forward looking cooperation and a human centered approach to technology as populism feeds on fears of a possible economic downturn in many parts of the globe globalization produced millions of winners over the years but also has left certain people behind schwab said at the davos conference center where his teams gave pre event tours to delegations ahead of the formal start on tuesday in the age of social media you cannot afford any more to leave anyone behind he said access to the elite gathering for businesspeople anyway doesn t come cheap it requires wef membership which starts at 60 000 swiss francs 60 259 and rises up to the strategic partner level at 600 000 602 605 getting into the davos event requires an invitation and an extra fee which wef spokesman oliver cann said is 27 000 francs 27 117 per person that s just for corporate chieftains civil society non governmental groups u n leaders and governmental officials don t pay they get in free lodging during high rent davos week however is another matter although davos is seen as a redoubt for global elites populists have come too trump got a polite reception when he showed up in 2018 and he had planned to come again this year before the shutdown intervened brazil s newly installed president the populist jair bolsonaro will attend this year even with some key western leaders missing organizers say a record 300 government ministers and nearly 60 heads of state or government including german chancellor angela merkel and prime minister shinzo abe of japan will attend about 3 000 people attendees overall are expected this week davos serves as a global stage for world leaders and executives and the conference center transforms into a warren of public and private meetings executives talk possible deals government leaders either meet and greet each other or seek to iron out differences mostly quietly academics and chiefs of non governmental groups speak out in webcast panel sessions or comb corridors looking to rub elbows with decision makers they make the trek up to davos yes to drink champagne and to wheel and deal and everything else said sheard who participates in wef projects but there is sort of an attempt at purification and thinking we need to do a better job gabriel sterne head of global macro research at oxford economics argues that top economic decision makers have much to atone for in a report this month sterne noted that most major economies performed dramatically worse than expected after the 2007 2009 great recession he blames many central banks besides the u s federal reserve for not responding to sluggish growth more aggressively with easy money policies and sterne says politicians should have juiced growth with tax cuts and higher government spending there was genuine underperformance by the big institutions he said the result is a populist backlash if you don t do anything about your failings they can come back and bite you sterne worries that the populist response could trigger radical and ill conceived policies that overshoot and drive up inflation and swell government budget deficits the ride could get even bumpier the world economic forum is focusing on what it calls the fourth industrial revolution a series of rapid advances in technology and medicine expected to transform society advances in robotics and artificial intelligence could further threaten jobs and feed the populist revolt we seem to be on the cusp of an incredible new era of automation and critical breakthroughs in health sciences sheard said but how do we manage this process and how do we manage it in a way that doesn t leave millions of people behind ___ wiseman reported from washington pan pylas in london contributed to this

digital currencies a state backed token or perhaps an account held directly at the central bank could help ensure that remote and marginalized regions are included in the digital revolution and could help protect consumers without cash too much power could accrue to a small number of outsize private payment providers this is not science fiction central banks around the world are already considering these ideas including those in canada china sweden and uruguay of course challenges remain like risks to financial stability but as technology changes so must we lagarde is chair of the

a century antibiotics have made once deadly infections treatable and curable now we re losing them the rise of drug resistant bacteria is jeopardizing decades of progress threatening our ability to prevent and treat common conditions like pneumonia and urinary tract infections the causes are many including overuse and misuse of antibiotics in humans and animals but antibiotic resistance is also a market failure compared with other types of drugs antibiotics are not profitable for the pharmaceutical industry as a result there is a serious lack of promising new antibiotics in clinical development one innovative model to address that is the global antibiotic research development partnership gardp set up by the world health organization who and the drugs for neglected diseases initiative the partnership is developing new treatments on a not for profit basis through public private partnerships one new antibiotic showing promise is for drug resistant gonorrhea an infection that has failed treatment with last resort antibiotics in at least 10 countries if it works this partnership could be a model for how to increase access to and affordability of medicines which is key

saving children s lives by melinda gates perhaps the greatest achievement of the past generation is the fact that the number of children who die each year has been cut in half on my horizon in 2019 to make it possible to cut child mortality rates in half again over the past three decades the world has established a group of four organizations that have saved millions of lives you ve likely never heard of them but if you pay taxes you ve helped fund their success gavi has immunized more than 700 million children the global fund pays for hiv treatment for half the people living with the virus the global polio eradication initiative has pushed us to the brink of wiping out the disease the newest the global financing facility is focused on women s and children s health including helping women plan their families which means their children will be more likely to survive and prosper all four need new funding this year but some politicians in donor countries say they should invest less in the rest of the world will the world be able to cut child deaths in half again it depends on what they decide gates is co founder of the bill and melinda gates foundation getty images put a price on pollution for cleaner growth by justin trudeau pollution isn t free millions of people around the world are already paying its price in the form of catastrophic floods uncontrollable wildfires devastating droughts spreading disease and unprecedented forced migration we have to make a clean economy affordable for everyone and we have a moral and economic imperative to act now we are the last generation able to make sure future generations do not pay the full and incalculable cost of climate change we re also the first generation with the tools to do so pricing pollution is the single most powerful way to cut emissions while driving economic growth since putting a price on pollution in 1991 sweden has grown its economy and cut its emissions by 60 and 25 percent respectively here at home the four provinces with a price on pollution in 2017 led the country in economic growth while canada led the g7 in economic growth california hit its emissions reductions targets earlier and at a lower cost than anticipated after putting a price on pollution lower emissions cleaner air a stronger economy the science and economics behind pollution pricing are settled as of 2019 it is no longer free to pollute anywhere in canada in the international fight against climate change a national price on pollution should be the norm indeed it is already a necessity trudeau is prime minister of canada getty images teach children how to nurture the planet by jane goodall my greatest reason for hope for our future is the passion of young people when we listen to them and empower them the next generation is desperate to protect nature unfortunately so many children are unable to spend time in nature because of education systems rooted in technology and geared only to the demands of a materialistic world i began roots shoots in 1991 to provide young people of all ages with the opportunity to choose projects to benefit people animals and the environment today in some 80 countries groups are taking action to heal the harms we have inflicted they are for example planting endemic species to encourage biodiversity lobbying legislators about climate change raising money for victims of natural disasters volunteering in animal shelters it is desperately important to encourage them as they work to heal the scars we have inflicted and i urge philanthropists to invest in the education of young people to nurture the planet the challenges we face are daunting but nature is resilient the human intellect incredible so now as our youth joins forces to tackle problems we have created let us give them the support they need and help them in their fight to save the natural world on which we ourselves depend goodall is a primatologist and conservationist courtesy monsanto harness gmo crops to solve the food crisis by robert t fraley as someone who helped pioneer genetically modified crops i m proud to see how much good they have accomplished despite consumer fears the reality is gmo crops are safe and can help solve both the sustainability and food security issues our planet faces in the decades ahead by combining biotechnology with gene editing data science and digital tools it will be possible to improve all the world s crops i believe it s possible to not only double the food supply by 2050 but also to do it on less land than we farm today fraley is former

tiffany co and others say sales are down auto purchases shrank in 2018 for the first time in three decades japan and south korea report lower exports of components for smartphones and other

stock market listings after profits sank below the level required by regulators it happened due to the bad economic situation he said the ruling party promised in 2013 to support entrepreneurs who

told them to make 30 percent of new loans to private business state media reported the central bank announced a 100 billion yuan 14 billion loan fund on dec 19 for small companies exports to the united states held up through late 2018 despite president donald trump s tariff hikes but sales shrank 3 5 percent in december compared with a year earlier as those penalties started to hurt demand

lower priced models starting at 50 000 yuan 7 000 many such customers returned to their hometowns because there wasn t much work for them said the manager who asked that he and his employer not be

paul wiseman and jamey keaten associated press davos switzerland as the world s financial and political elites convene here in the swiss alps for the world economic forum their vision of ever closer commercial and political ties is under attack and the economic outlook is darkening britain s political system has been thrown into chaos as the country negotiates a messy divorce from the european union under president donald trump the united states is imposing trade sanctions on friend and foe alike and the government is paralyzed by a partial shutdown over immigration policy that forced trump and a high level u s delegation to cancel the trip to davos a year after getting a standing ovation from the elites at davos french president emmanuel macron is sinking in the polls as he contends with yellow vest protesters who have taken to the streets to call for higher wages and fairer pensions nationalist political movements are gaining strength across europe more climate combat democrats say pentagon puts troops at risk by downplaying global warming more government shutdown how it impacts what you eat from food safety to beer more donald trump to meet again with kim jong un in late february and the economic backdrop is worrying experts are downgrading their forecasts for global growth this year amid rising interest rates and tensions over trade judging by the state of the world right now 10 years on from the financial crisis and the dysfunctional state of global politics i would suggest that these annual events have achieved the sum total of diddly squat said michael hewson chief market analyst at cmc markets uk the collective worries have sent a shudder through global financial markets the dow jones industrial average is down nearly 9 percent from oct 3 david dollar a senior fellow at the brookings institute said the buckling market represents a lot of anxiety that we re seeing from the corporate elite who meet at davos how times have changed for most of the past quarter century the worldview symbolized by the world economic forum of ever freer world trade and closer ties between countries had dominated then came a backlash from americans and europeans whose jobs were threatened by low wage competition from countries like china and who felt alienated at home by wealth inequality and immigration in 2016 u s voters elected trump who advocated restricting immigration and scaling back free trade and the british chose to leave the eu the winners from globalization have had the megaphone said paul sheard a senior fellow at the mossavar rahmani center for business and government at harvard university s kennedy school the losers have been somewhat silent but now are starting to express themselves through the ballot box and through the political process the davos confab has always been vulnerable to snark hedge fund billionaires flying into davos in fuel guzzling private jets to discuss the threat of climate change millionaire ceos discussing inequality while downing cocktails endless conversations between people who describe themselves as thought leaders first among them perhaps is wef founder klaus schwab in an interview sunday he stressed the need for more global forward looking cooperation and a human centered approach to technology as populism feeds on fears of a possible economic downturn in many parts of the globe globalization produced millions of winners over the years but also has left certain people behind schwab said at the davos conference center where his teams gave pre event tours to delegations ahead of the formal start on tuesday in the age of social media you cannot afford any more to leave anyone behind he said access to the elite gathering for businesspeople anyway doesn t come cheap it requires wef membership which starts at 60 000 swiss francs 60 259 and rises up to the strategic partner level at 600 000 602 605 getting into the davos event requires an invitation and an extra fee which wef spokesman oliver cann said is 27 000 francs 27 117 per person that s just for corporate chieftains civil society non governmental groups u n leaders and governmental officials don t pay they get in free lodging during high rent davos week however is another matter although davos is seen as a redoubt for global elites populists have come too trump got a polite reception when he showed up in 2018 and he had planned to come again this year before the shutdown intervened brazil s newly installed president the populist jair bolsonaro will attend this year even with some key western leaders missing organizers say a record 300 government ministers and nearly 60 heads of state or government including german chancellor angela merkel and prime minister shinzo abe of japan will attend about 3 000 people attendees overall are expected this week davos serves as a global stage for world leaders and executives and the conference center transforms into a warren of public and private meetings executives talk possible deals government leaders either meet and greet each other or seek to iron out differences mostly quietly academics and chiefs of non governmental groups speak out in webcast panel sessions or comb corridors looking to rub elbows with decision makers they make the trek up to davos yes to drink champagne and to wheel and deal and everything else said sheard who participates in wef projects but there is sort of an attempt at purification and thinking we need to do a better job gabriel sterne head of global macro research at oxford economics argues that top economic decision makers have much to atone for in a report this month sterne noted that most major economies performed dramatically worse than expected after the 2007 2009 great recession he blames many central banks besides the u s federal reserve for not responding to sluggish growth more aggressively with easy money policies and sterne says politicians should have juiced growth with tax cuts and higher government spending there was genuine underperformance by the big institutions he said the result is a populist backlash if you don t do anything about your failings they can come back and bite you sterne worries that the populist response could trigger radical and ill conceived policies that overshoot and drive up inflation and swell government budget deficits the ride could get even bumpier the world economic forum is focusing on what it calls the fourth industrial revolution a series of rapid advances in technology and medicine expected to transform society advances in robotics and artificial intelligence could further threaten jobs and feed the populist revolt we seem to be on the cusp of an incredible new era of automation and critical breakthroughs in health sciences

how times have changed for most of the past quarter century the worldview symbolised by the world economic forum of ever freer world trade and closer ties between countries had dominated then came a backlash from americans and europeans whose jobs were threatened by low wage competition from countries like china and who felt alienated at home by wealth inequality and immigration buildings stand illuminated as dusk falls in davos the venue for the world economic forum wef in switzerland credit bloomberg in 2016 us voters elected trump who advocated restricting immigration and scaling back free trade and the british chose to leave the eu the winners from globalisation have had the megaphone said paul sheard a senior fellow at the mossavar rahmani center for business and government at harvard university s kennedy school the losers have been somewhat silent but now are starting to express themselves through the ballot box and through the political process the davos confab has always been vulnerable to snark hedge fund billionaires flying into davos in fuel guzzling private jets to discuss the threat of climate change millionaire ceos discussing inequality while downing cocktails endless conversations between people who describe themselves as thought leaders first among them perhaps is wef founder klaus schwab in an interview sunday he stressed the need for more global forward looking cooperation and a human centred approach to technology as populism feeds on fears of a possible economic downturn in many parts of the globe globalisation produced millions of winners over the years but also has left certain people behind schwab said at the davos conference centre where his teams gave pre event tours to delegations ahead of the formal start on tuesday in the age of social media you cannot afford any more to leave anyone behind he said access to the elite gathering for businesspeople anyway doesn t come cheap it requires wef membership which starts at 60 000 swiss francs 60 259 and rises up to the strategic partner level at 600 000 602 605 getting into the davos event requires an invitation and an extra fee which wef spokesman oliver cann said is 27 000 francs 27 117 per person that s just for corporate chieftains civil society non governmental groups u n leaders and governmental officials don t pay they get in free lodging during high rent davos week however is another matter although davos is seen as a redoubt for global elites populists have come too trump got a polite reception when he showed up in 2018 and he had planned to come again this year before the shutdown intervened brazil s newly installed president the populist jair bolsonaro will attend this year even with some key western leaders missing organisers say a record 300 government ministers and nearly 60 heads of state or government including german chancellor angela merkel and prime minister shinzo abe of japan will attend about 3000 people attendees overall are expected this week davos serves as a global stage for world leaders and executives and the conference centre transforms into a warren of public and private meetings executives talk possible deals government leaders either meet and greet each other or seek to iron out differences mostly quietly academics and chiefs of non governmental groups speak out in webcast panel sessions or comb corridors looking to rub elbows with decision makers they make the trek up to davos yes to drink champagne and to wheel and deal and everything else said sheard who participates in wef projects but there is sort of an attempt at purification and thinking we need to do a better job gabriel sterne head of global macro research at oxford economics argues that top economic decision makers have much to atone for in a report this month sterne noted that most major economies performed dramatically worse than expected after the 2007 2009 great recession he blames many central banks besides the us federal reserve for not responding to sluggish growth more aggressively with easy money policies and sterne says politicians should have juiced growth with tax cuts and higher government spending there was genuine underperformance by the big institutions he said the result is a populist backlash if you don t do anything about your failings they can come back and bite you sterne worries that the populist response could trigger radical and ill conceived policies that overshoot and drive up inflation and swell government budget deficits the ride could get even bumpier the world economic forum is focusing on what it calls the fourth industrial revolution a series of rapid advances in technology and medicine expected to transform society advances in robotics and artificial intelligence could further threaten jobs and feed the populist revolt
sunday marks the second anniversary of president trump s inauguration at the midpoint of his four year term trump has already delivered on some of his campaign promises such as boosting funding for the military other pledges have been all but ignored like his promise to lead a 1 trillion infrastructure push with many of trump s promises however the record is somewhere in between not exactly mission accomplished but not mission forgotten either loading don t see the graphic above click here here s a progress report on the president s first two years border wall two years into his presidency trump has not built a wall along the southern border and mexico certainly hasn t paid for it but the president continues to lobby for a wall even going so far as to shut down part of the government in an effort to win funding for a 234 mile stretch of border barrier the president has also pursued other get tough measures against both legal and illegal immigration we ve never had a president who has focused so much attention on immigration policy said andrew selee president of the migration policy institute and so uniformly in the direction of trying to reduce the number of people coming here and removing those who are here illegally trump has slashed the number of refugees entering the country tried to end obama era protections for young immigrants living in the country illegally and after a few rewrites he ultimately won supreme court approval for histravel ban trade trump has delivered on his promises to renegotiate the north american free trade agreement and to withdraw from the trans pacific partnership a big asian trade deal the new nafta which trump calls the usmca still needs approval from congress and 11 other countries in the tpp are moving ahead with their own agreement putting u s exporters at a competitive disadvantage trump stopped short of labeling china a currency manipulator as he promised but he has imposed tariffs on 250 billion in chinese exports trade talks with china are ongoing the president has also imposed steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and threatened to impose tariffs on imported cars these are all things that president trump promised to do during the campaign for better or for worse and in my view he s very much followed through with a lot of them said chad bown a senior fellow at the pro trade peterson institute for international economics trading partners including traditional allies have retaliated with tariffs of their own on a variety of u s exports the u s trade deficit which trump often complains about has widened over the last two years tax cut the gop controlled congress passed a big tax cut just over a year ago and that s contributed to a surge in economic growth the white house argues that higher growth rates will continue for the next decade but many other forecasters believe this is a short term sugar high that will fade in the next year or two there s no debate about the effect on federal revenues the tax cut has reduced government revenues and contributed to a ballooning federal deficit expected to reach 1 trillion this year we heard some people claim these tax cuts are going to pay for themselves said marc goldwein senior vice president of the committee for a responsible federal budget certainly they haven t to date and there s no evidence they will in the future energy trump promised to promote fossil fuels and last year the u s became the world s largest oil producer natural gas production is also booming thanks to the same fracking revolution while these trends began during the obama administration trump has definitely encouraged them said daniel yergin energy historian and vice chairman of ihs markit sometimes it seems that the world s no 1 natural gas salesman is donald trump yergin said trump has championed oil and gas drilling both offshore and on public lands his support has not sparked a similar boom in the coal fields however coal continues to lose market share for electricity generation in the u s partly because of competition from cheap natural gas and increasingly affordable wind and solar power affordable care act chip somodevilla getty images getty images u s capitol police arrest protesters who disrupted a senate finance committee hearing about a health care proposal to replace obamacare on capitol hill on sept 25 2017 while the president keeps chipping away at the affordable care act trump has yet to deliver on his promise to repeal and replace obamacare the core of the aca is still standing said drew altman president and ceo of the kaiser family foundation it s still there and politically the law is more popular than it has been obamacare s medicaid expansion has now been extended to 37 states including several additional red states where voters opted into the program last year enrollment in the federally run insurance marketplaces dipped less than 5 percent this year even though there s no longer a tax penalty for people who go without insurance and the administration has fostered a variety of skimpy coverage alternatives democrats made preservation of obamacare s protection for people with pre existing medical conditions a centerpiece of their midterm campaign as a result of the repeal and replace effort democrats are on offense now on health care and republicans are on defense altman said deregulation trump boasted about his efforts to cut red tape this month in a speech to the american farm bureau federation telling farmers he d delivered the biggest cuts in regulations in the history of our country and we re going further the president along with a gop congress has moved aggressively to unwind regulations including rules governing carbon emissions fuel economy water pollution and payday lending two big obama era rules on overtime and investment advice were also blocked by the courts he certainly has tried to do what he said he was going to do said peter van doren senior fellow at the libertarian cato institute van doren cautioned however that much of trump s push for deregulation could be stymied in court unless the administration can establish a factual rationale for the proposed changes you can t just say you want to change this rule because we won the election van doren said the law doesn t allow that judges chip somodevilla getty images getty images president trump applauds as supreme court associate justice neil gorsuch delivers remarks after taking the judicial oath in a ceremony at the white house rose garden in april 2017 getting a justice appointed to the court was a key campaign promise for trump with the help of a gop controlled senate trump continues to put his stamp on the federal bench seating a second supreme court justice in 2018 and bringing his total of confirmed appellate court judges to 30 more than any other president at this point in his term by contrast trump lags former presidents bill clinton and george w bush in his pace of seating district court judges as with the supreme court most of trump s appellate court picks have replaced judges who were also nominated by republicans so trump s accomplishment is not so much creating a conservative court as locking one in that was already there now obviously if you replace a 70 year old slightly to the right appellate judge with a 45 year old fire brand conservative you re not trading apples for apples said russell wheeler who tracks judicial nominees at the brookings institution wheeler suspects trump will not have as many appeals court vacancies to fill in the second half of his term but the judicial appointments he s already made will be delivering on the president s promises long after trump leaves office draining the swamp trump promised to weed out corruption in washington by establishing new limits on lobbying by former administration officials but watchdogs say in some cases the new limits are less restrictive than ones already in place i think the revolving door is operating much as it always has and maybe a little faster and more vigorously than it did prior to president trump coming in said walter shaub former director of the office of government ethics conflicts abound within the administration including many officials who now regulate the industries they used to work in what s more three of trump s cabinet officials resigned in 2018 under ethical clouds i think he s been filling the swamp with more alligators rather than draining it said shaub who s now a senior adviser for the watchdog group citizens for responsibility and

i campaigned for governor with the slogan of demand more because gov cuomo has governed as a social liberal but as an economic conservative although he touts the agenda he outlined in his january 15 state of the state and budget presentation as progressive new york progressives should not be satisfied it is still a conservative economic program progressives must demand more any agenda worthy of the label progressive in new york must include a progressive economic program it would start with three demands progressives have been pushing for years in new york that cuomo has not accepted the new york health act for a universal public healthcare program full foundation aid funding for public schools and tuition free public college for all in state cuny and suny students it would accelerate the increase in the minimum wage which despite the governor s claims is not 15 an hour in most of the state today and by the time it is it will remain a poverty wage it would have a much stronger affordable housing program it would encompass the green new deal that the green party has advocated for years not the watered down green new deal that cuomo is now promoting the green party s green new deal would guarantee the economic human rights to a job income housing health care and education and embark on a rapid rapid transition to 100 clean energy by 2030 as the economic stimulus and sustainable foundation for economic human rights progressives should not let progress on social issues obscure the economic problems so many new yorkers face every day inflation adjusted wages have been stagnant for decades today more than 2 in 5 new york families suffer through periods without food health care housing and or utilities 1 million new yorkers lack health insurance more than half of children in our cities are poor and attend segregated underfunded public schools over half of new yorkers pay a third or more of their income on rent gentrification and displacement is driving working class new yorkers out of their own neighborhoods in the cities while chronic rural depression in upstate new york is driving family farmers and small town businesses off the land yet since cuomo became governor funding for social programs has been cut by a third economic development funds have been targeted to the corporate rich as tax breaks grants and subsidies working people have paid this corporate welfare with their taxes but have seen little of it returned as new good jobs with higher wages with the democrats now in firm control of that chamber progressives should expect passage of a big backlog of progressive social reforms that were blocked for years by republican control of the senate these social reforms include abortion rights gender equality gun safety reforms voting and campaign finance reforms bail abolition speedy trials discovery reform marijuana legalization the dream act and the child victims act cuomo was never in the vanguard fighting for social reforms from gay marriage early in his administration to marijuana legalization today but he is a politician who moves in response to public opinion and the balance of power in the legislature that should give progressives hope that we can push cuomo further the progressive agenda on social issues is far from exhausted glaringly absent from the democrats agenda is a program to reverse the increasing segregation of new york s metropolitan regions new york s schools and housing are the most segregated in the nation by race and income despite recent small gestures toward controlled choice for school integration in new york city progressives have yet to push hard for a desegregation policy agenda that can move public opinion and force cuomo and other politicians to evolve on this issue too school desegregation will require the redrawing school district lines and controlled choice within them controlled choice assigns students to schools based on a combination of their preferences and making all the schools relatively balanced by family income housing integration will require stronger enforcement of fair housing laws inclusionary zoning and a public housing program that builds high quality mixed income developments in the cities and the suburbs segregation is deeply implicated in the state s economic inequality and insecurity where cuomo s economic conservatism is part of the problem not the solution new york state has the highest income inequality of any state in the nation the share of income going to the top 1 has more than tripled from 10 in 1980 to 33 in 2015 by isolating minority and low income communities from educational employment and cultural opportunities and resources segregation feeds the growing economic inequality a progressive economic agenda would go beyond cuomo s limited agenda on affordable housing his call for closing vacancy decontrol and other rent control loopholes in new york city is only a start progressives will have to push hard to win those reforms against resistance from the powerful real estate lobby a full progressive housing program would also include repeal of the state s urstadt law to re establish home rule on rent regulations extending rent control authority to local governments statewide and a public housing building program rather subsides to private developers to build affordable units public housing is the most economical way to expand affordable housing and can play a significant role in integrating housing cuomo s green new deal call for 100 renewable electric power by 2040 only addresses 20 of the state s carbon footprint we still need to see his definition of clean and a detailed plan with benchmarks we need him to be clear that natural gas is not a bridge to a clean energy future but a gangplank to climate disaster cuomo s diluted green new deal could give the concept a bad name the climate and community protection act many democratic legislators are pushing largely codifies cuomo s climate dangerous energy policies which are flooding the state with fracked gas pipelines and power plants the cppa s goal of zeroing out carbon emissions by 2050 is too late it does nothing to stop the increase in the state s carbon footprint from the fracked gas power plants cuomo is pushing from the corruption ridden competitive power ventures plant in orange county to the state sponsored environmental racism of powering state capitol buildings by the sheridan avenue plant which has poisoned of the arbor hill black community for a century progressives and climate activist should get behind with the same laser focus we pushed the fracking ban in 2014 the new york off fossil fuels act ny off will stop new fossil fuel infrastructure and build out a 100 clean energy system in new york by 2030 with provisions for a just transition to include low income and minority communities and protect communities now dependent on fossil fuel and nuclear plants for employment and tax revenues particularly conservative is the embrace by gov cuomo and senate majority andrea stewart cousins of making the 2 tax cap on local property taxes permanent the tax cap is cuomo s signature economic austerity measure a top down one size fits all imposition on local governments and school districts in the name of property tax relief in reality the tax cap means the state budget is balanced on the backs of local property taxpayers who then suffer from underfunded local governments and school districts a permanent cap will make permanent new york s high property taxes and the fiscal austerity burden on municipalities and school districts the progressive way to cut regressive property taxes and give local governments and school districts the resources they need is for the state to pay for its unfunded mandates to fully fund foundation aid and to restore state revenue sharing with local governments cuomo is fighting lawsuits for full school funding in the courts and has frozen revenue sharing to raise the revenues for these and other needed programs there are many progressive tax reforms that should be enacted for starters the income tax structure should be made more progressive by several progressively marginal tax rates for multi millionaire incomes another progressive reform would be to keep the stock transfer tax rather than rebate all of it to wall street traders the central conservative economic feature of cuomonomics that progressives must challenge is his supply side trickle down policy of subsidies grants and tax breaks for the rich and corporations the benefits have not trickled down to working people or depressed cities towns and neighborhoods it only feeds the pay to play culture of corruption where economic favors flow to big campaign contributors the progressive alternative is to revitalize the public sector with demand side bottom up economic planning aimed at raising the incomes and living standards of working people and economically depressed communities economic stagnation is an issue of insufficient demand not insufficient capital in rich people s hands to invest the state should fully fund public services and invest more in physical and social infrastructure including clean energy sustainable agriculture mass transit public housing broadband education health care and environmental protection this approach will increase effective demand and stimulate business expansion and jobs to meet the demand progressive will have good reason to celebrate the progressive social reforms we expect to achieve this year but we are not done especially on the economic issues we must demand more keep up with howie hawkins on twitter or facebook

how times have changed for most of the past quarter century the worldview symbolised by the world economic forum of ever freer world trade and closer ties between countries had dominated then came a backlash from americans and europeans whose jobs were threatened by low wage competition from countries like china and who felt alienated at home by wealth inequality and immigration buildings stand illuminated as dusk falls in davos the venue for the world economic forum wef in switzerland credit bloomberg in 2016 us voters elected trump who advocated restricting immigration and scaling back free trade and the british chose to leave the eu the winners from globalisation have had the megaphone said paul sheard a senior fellow at the mossavar rahmani center for business and government at harvard university s kennedy school the losers have been somewhat silent but now are starting to express themselves through the ballot box and through the political process the davos confab has always been vulnerable to snark hedge fund billionaires flying into davos in fuel guzzling private jets to discuss the threat of climate change millionaire ceos discussing inequality while downing cocktails endless conversations between people who describe themselves as thought leaders first among them perhaps is wef founder klaus schwab in an interview sunday he stressed the need for more global forward looking cooperation and a human centred approach to technology as populism feeds on fears of a possible economic downturn in many parts of the globe globalisation produced millions of winners over the years but also has left certain people behind schwab said at the davos conference centre where his teams gave pre event tours to delegations ahead of the formal start on tuesday in the age of social media you cannot afford any more to leave anyone behind he said access to the elite gathering for businesspeople anyway doesn t come cheap it requires wef membership which starts at 60 000 swiss francs 60 259 and rises up to the strategic partner level at 600 000 602 605 getting into the davos event requires an invitation and an extra fee which wef spokesman oliver cann said is 27 000 francs 27 117 per person that s just for corporate chieftains civil society non governmental groups u n leaders and governmental officials don t pay they get in free lodging during high rent davos week however is another matter although davos is seen as a redoubt for global elites populists have come too trump got a polite reception when he showed up in 2018 and he had planned to come again this year before the shutdown intervened brazil s newly installed president the populist jair bolsonaro will attend this year even with some key western leaders missing organisers say a record 300 government ministers and nearly 60 heads of state or government including german chancellor angela merkel and prime minister shinzo abe of japan will attend about 3000 people attendees overall are expected this week davos serves as a global stage for world leaders and executives and the conference centre transforms into a warren of public and private meetings executives talk possible deals government leaders either meet and greet each other or seek to iron out differences mostly quietly academics and chiefs of non governmental groups speak out in webcast panel sessions or comb corridors looking to rub elbows with decision makers they make the trek up to davos yes to drink champagne and to wheel and deal and everything else said sheard who participates in wef projects but there is sort of an attempt at purification and thinking we need to do a better job gabriel sterne head of global macro research at oxford economics argues that top economic decision makers have much to atone for in a report this month sterne noted that most major economies performed dramatically worse than expected after the 2007 2009 great recession he blames many central banks besides the us federal reserve for not responding to sluggish growth more aggressively with easy money policies and sterne says politicians should have juiced growth with tax cuts and higher government spending there was genuine underperformance by the big institutions he said the result is a populist backlash if you don t do anything about your failings they can come back and bite you sterne worries that the populist response could trigger radical and ill conceived policies that overshoot and drive up inflation and swell government budget deficits the ride could get even bumpier the world economic forum is focusing on what it calls the fourth industrial revolution a series of rapid advances in technology and medicine expected to transform society advances in robotics and artificial intelligence could further threaten jobs and feed the populist revolt

the sky is falling the sky is falling they cried as equities plunged in december it is signaling a recession we were told instead global equities have begun the year with a strong advance the gapped higher ahead of the weekend extending this year s rally to about 14 it has now retraced more than 50 of the decline not from the december high but from the record high in late september it has rallied for four consecutive weeks the dow jones gapped higher before the weekend and above a downtrend in place since september it also appreciated for three consecutive weeks retracing more than a third of last year s decline the posted a third weekly advance and its highest weekly close since last september sentiment can swing wildly and short term price action does not make for the basis for policy the fed has been chastened for not listening to the market as if it s not as temporally inconsistent as policymakers the fixed income market isn t better the yield reached the cyclical high in early november just shy of 3 it fell 2 36 at the start of the year which is a few basis points below the average effective fed funds rate it recovered to 2 60 ahead of the weekend while powell appears to have struck the right tone with the patience and flexibility mantra the july fed funds futures contract has gone from pricing in nearly a 50 chance of a cut to about a 40 in h1 it is not that the capital markets don t generate useful signals but the signals require a context and a judgment the us economy has clearly slowed from the surge in q2 18 and q3 18 but the recent string of data shows little sign of an economy on the verge of a recession beginning with the and to start the december data series the regional fed manufacturing surveys have been mixed and the philly fed s reported last week jumped weekly eased more than expected jumped 1 1 in december and the takeaway here is that sentiment indicators were weaker than the actual performance another important point is that divergence which we argue is a key driver for the is very much alive consider that in december us industrial output was up 4 year over year in the it was 1 7 lower year over year in november while the s was 1 5 lower s was 1 5 higher next week may push the divergence theme further the boj and ecb meet at the end of last week japan reported that december which excludes fresh food and is the measure the boj targets slowed to 0 7 from 0 9 excluding both fresh food and energy and the prices rose 0 3 year over year there is some speculation that the boj could shave its inflation forecast if it does it would be seen as dovish and perhaps trying to encourage a further unwinding of the s recent gains seemingly unrelated to macroeconomic developments japanese businesses and officials are more comfortable with the dollar above jpy110 but the bar to intervention is very high meanwhile as the yen pulls back the jgb yield may continue to recover after falling to negative five basis points at the start of the month a few hours before the the flash markit pmis will be reported economists no less than policymakers have been surprised by the weakness in europe the fell in the last four months of last year it may be difficult to see how this can happen with negative interest rates and economists look for signals of the european aggregate demand coming in the service pmi which is expected to tick up while the manufacturing sector may stay soft as trade tensions and the global economic slowdown bites the ecb s bond buying program has ended there has been no noticeable market impact much ink was spilled debating who would buy italian bonds but last week s auction was oversubscribed peripheral benchmark premiums over germany have narrowed at the start of the year the challenge has shifted from managing the huge and complicated due to the eurosystem s structure bond buying program to responding to the incoming data draghi s speech last week to the european parliament likely foretells the thrust of the press conference the ecb itself seems divided narrowly enough for the collegiate culture that this strange creature that is neither fish nor fowl risks are broadly balanced but are rising to the downside a rise in the composite pmi would work in draghi s favor but the pressure to be credible may require a stronger comment if it falls for the fifth consecutive month maybe the bet is that the german auto sector will recover before the staff shaves its forecasts in march draghi leans heavy on the strength of the labor market weakness in the coming months could have a disproportionate market impact the hawks want to wait for march and the new staff forecasts to reassess the guidance acknowledging that the balance of risks has shifted to the downside would seemingly require a response last week draghi warned even if the growth slowdown lasts longer than previously appreciated it does not necessarily mean a recession he may be pressed a bit more on the kind of conditions that would prompt the central bank to offer a new round of long term refinancing operations which we expect to be announced near mid year the brexit drama enters a new act next week and the tension builds to the next climax the following week when the house of commons will vote on the plan b that prime minister may will propose on january 21 she ruled out the idea of a remaining in the single market though the dup who is responsible for ensuring that she survived the vote of confidence would consider for limiting the backstop it is difficult to see how any alternative to the negotiated withdrawal bill would allow for an orderly exit at the end of march after may survived the vote of confidence rallied to two month highs against the and the dollar gbp0 8765 and 1 30 respectively the near term risk reward may have turned a postponement of the divorce has already helped fuel sterling s recent gains a softer rather than harder exit appears necessary to cobble a majority in some ways until the parliament s vote on plan b there is little reason to chase the sterling higher these drivers there were some ideas that meltdown in the stock market last month spurred more interest by the trump administration for a trade deal with china two stories emerged last week that fanned hopes of a favorable resolution first was the press report that there was a discussion of us tactics ahead of china s vice premier s visit to washington at the end of january to talk trade the who said what and when is less material that noting that treasury is still pushing for a more amicable approach however it seems to have consistently been outmaneuvered by the more nationalist wing second china reportedly offered a plan to eliminate its trade surplus with the us in six years by increasing its imports from the us by as much as 45 bln this year and increasing going forward reports indicated the us negotiators pushed back and wanted this achieved by 2020 a similar plan was previously rejected by trump the recovery in the stock market may remove some sense of urgency and the best deal cannot be announced after the first round of talks an increase market share conceded to us businesses must come at the expense of another country imports from the us would rise faster than overall imports at the start of the 20th century the us defend the territorial integrity of china against the old world imperialists carving it up into spheres of influence the long term interest was to encourage an open door for investment and trade in all china then it was over territories and now if some version is agreed would be over shares of china s import market the domestic us political drama about the role of russia in the 2016 election has not been a factor that influenced the capital markets however the situation appears to be escalating recent developments include what appears to be the trump campaign shared polling information with russian operative reports suggest that he told his fixer cohen to lie to congress but in an unusual move the special counsel investigator s office commented on such talk to deny it cohen will testify before congress on february 7 it will occupy an increasing amount of trump s time as the legislature s committees begin their work the administration may be pressed by the house of representatives in a way it wasn t over the past two years the government s partial shutdown is increasingly disruptive and a majority blame him rather than the democrats early march when the debt ceiling will be reached is the next key date it is not a drop dead date as the treasury has a several month workaround including more bill issuance which in turn adds upward pressure on short term rates amid concern about curve inversion some suspect that this backdrop may encourage the willingness to get wins or dramatic moves that overshadow the poor domestic news

davos switzerland ap as the world s financial and political elites convene here in the swiss alps for the world economic forum their vision of ever closer commercial and political ties is under attack and the economic outlook is darkening britain s political system has been thrown into chaos as the country negotiates a messy divorce from the european union under president donald trump the united states is imposing trade sanctions on friend and foe alike and the government is paralyzed by a partial shutdown over immigration policy that forced trump and a high level u s delegation to cancel the trip to davos a year after getting a standing ovation from the elites at davos french president emmanuel macron is sinking in the polls as he contends with yellow vest protesters who have taken to the streets to call for higher wages and fairer pensions nationalist political movements are gaining strength across europe and the economic backdrop is worrying experts are downgrading their forecasts for global growth this year amid rising interest rates and tensions over trade judging by the state of the world right now 10 years on from the financial crisis and the dysfunctional state of global politics i would suggest that these annual events have achieved the sum total of diddly squat said michael hewson chief market analyst at cmc markets uk the collective worries have sent a shudder through global financial markets the dow jones industrial average is down nearly 9 percent from oct 3 david dollar a senior fellow at the brookings institute said the buckling market represents a lot of anxiety that we re seeing from the corporate elite who meet at davos how times have changed for most of the past quarter century the worldview symbolized by the world economic forum of ever freer world trade and closer ties between countries had dominated then came a backlash from americans and europeans whose jobs were threatened by low wage competition from countries like china and who felt alienated at home by wealth inequality and immigration in 2016 u s voters elected trump who advocated restricting immigration and scaling back free trade and the british chose to leave the eu the winners from globalization have had the megaphone said paul sheard a senior fellow at the mossavar rahmani center for business and government at harvard university s kennedy school the losers have been somewhat silent but now are starting to express themselves through the ballot box and through the political process the davos confab has always been vulnerable to snark hedge fund billionaires flying into davos in fuel guzzling private jets to discuss the threat of climate change millionaire ceos discussing inequality while downing cocktails endless conversations between people who describe themselves as thought leaders first among them perhaps is wef founder klaus schwab in an interview sunday he stressed the need for more global forward looking cooperation and a human centered approach to technology as populism feeds on fears of a possible economic downturn in many parts of the globe globalization produced millions of winners over the years but also has left certain people behind schwab said at the davos conference center where his teams gave pre event tours to delegations ahead of the formal start on tuesday in the age of social media you cannot afford any more to leave anyone behind he said access to the elite gathering for businesspeople anyway doesn t come cheap it requires wef membership which starts at 60 000 swiss francs 60 259 and rises up to the strategic partner level at 600 000 602 605 getting into the davos event requires an invitation and an extra fee which wef spokesman oliver cann said is 27 000 francs 27 117 per person that s just for corporate chieftains civil society non governmental groups u n leaders and governmental officials don t pay they get in free lodging during high rent davos week however is another matter although davos is seen as a redoubt for global elites populists have come too trump got a polite reception when he showed up in 2018 and he had planned to come again this year before the shutdown intervened brazil s newly installed president the populist jair bolsonaro will attend this year even with some key western leaders missing organizers say a record 300 government ministers and nearly 60 heads of state or government including german chancellor angela merkel and prime minister shinzo abe of japan will attend about 3 000 people attendees overall are expected this week davos serves as a global stage for world leaders and executives and the conference center transforms into a warren of public and private meetings executives talk possible deals government leaders either meet and greet each other or seek to iron out differences mostly quietly academics and chiefs of non governmental groups speak out in webcast panel sessions or comb corridors looking to rub elbows with decision makers they make the trek up to davos yes to drink champagne and to wheel and deal and everything else said sheard who participates in wef projects but there is sort of an attempt at purification and thinking we need to do a better job gabriel sterne head of global macro research at oxford economics argues that top economic decision makers have much to atone for in a report this month sterne noted that most major economies performed dramatically worse than expected after the 2007 2009 great recession he blames many central banks besides the u s federal reserve for not responding to sluggish growth more aggressively with easy money policies and sterne says politicians should have juiced growth with tax cuts and higher government spending there was genuine underperformance by the big institutions he said the result is a populist backlash if you don t do anything about your failings they can come back and bite you sterne worries that the populist response could trigger radical and ill conceived policies that overshoot and drive up inflation and swell government budget deficits the ride could get even bumpier the world economic forum is focusing on what it calls the fourth industrial revolution a series of rapid advances in technology and medicine expected to transform society advances in robotics and artificial intelligence could further threaten jobs and feed the populist revolt we seem to be on the cusp of an incredible new era of automation and critical breakthroughs in health sciences sheard said but how do we manage this process and how do we manage it in a way that doesn t leave millions of people behind ___ wiseman reported from washington pan pylas in london contributed to this report
take five world markets themes for the week ahead advertisement following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the reuters stories related to them 1 should i stay or should i go another week closer to the date britain leaves the european union or are we given how crushingly prime minister theresa may s brexit divorce deal was defeated by lawmakers there is little chance her plan b to be presented in coming days will get away with just minor amendments so markets now reckon the march 29 deadline will be extended to give parliament more time to negotiate the manner of exit or even to organise a second referendum the optimism has driven sterling to two month highs against the dollar with 4 percent plus gains from jan 3 lows options markets too imply further pound strength over the three month period that encompasses the deadline of course markets glee could be misplaced if may fails to forge consensus within her party and with opposition leader jeremy corbyn and if parliament fails to agree an extension britain will crash out the eu without a deal corbyn wants a pledge from may to block no deal brexit before joining cross party talks but may describes this as impossible her plan b will be unveiled on monday and voted on by parliament on jan 29 sterling looks set for another volatile week graphic sterling options 2 mountains can t turn coming days will show whether china s run of weak economic data continues as it releases fourth quarter growth numbers as well as investment and retail sales for december but if anything markets could be surprised on the upside after shockingly bad figures on exports and factory output growth is expected to print at 6 4 percent for the fourth quarter the weakest since the global financial crisis but that would be in line with rates chinese policymakers may be targeting sources tell us some have proposed lowering growth targets to between 6 0 and 6 5 percent beijing has unveiled a series of fiscal and monetary support measures yet unlike in 2015 or during prior slowdowns the government has been careful to avoid simply throwing state money at the problem as the chinese proverb goes mountains cannot turn only rivers can be it household spending sops tax cuts infrastructure projects funded by local governments or money market operations china seems determined not to turn its back on a commitment to deleveraging and market reform and that makes it difficult to say when the economy will rebound graphic china gdp exports markets 3 draghi ing on ecb bond buying is officially over but with economic data and inflation both continuing to underwhelm the central bank has little time to relax policymakers have acknowledged the euro zone slowdown could last longer than anticipated but will be hoping nonetheless that upcoming data might bring some relief in particular they will monitor the snapshot of business activity in the bloc in the shape of flash pmis for january they are out on thursday hours before the ecb meeting and reuters polls indicate some stabilisation is likely after recent dire readings powerhouse germany which barely skirted recession in the latter part of 2018 releases its zew sentiment survey on tuesday ecb president draghi is as yet unlikely to change his assessment of the balance of risks facing the economy but that may be just a question of time after all china s economic slowdown and the u s government shutdown are weighing on global growth and the euro zone still needs to weather the fallout from brexit graphic german data disappoints png 4 shutdown slowdown last year at davos u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin sent the dollar plunging by saying a weak currency was good for the united states this year though with a government in shutdown president donald trump has cancelled mnuchin s switzerland trip trump is also economising in other ways including buying macdonalds burgers for white house visitors but anxiety is growing over how much the shutdown could hit u s growth and to what extent it will filter to already stuttering world growth so far damage looks limited jobless claims have continued to fall and the philly fed business outlook survey was above forecast but the longer it continues the worse it gets not only are 800 000 government workers going without pay a delay to tax refunds for other citizens will hit companies reliant on consumer spending the government has until early march before the debt ceiling kicks in it could then also miss some social security payments but the democrat controlled house shows no sign of agreeing trump s demands for 5 7 billion 4 4 billion to fund a border wall and a house vote to fund the government through feb 28 was postponed to the coming week mnuchin meanwhile has declined to testify to the house about how the shutdown may impact the upcoming tax filing season graphic u s government shutdowns advertisement 5 it s cold out there yes it is that time of year again movers and shakers from politics central banks industry and finance descend onto the swiss alpine town of davos to brainstorm chinwag network ski party and figure out how to deal with some of the world s most pressing problem japan s prime minister shinzo abe and german chancellor angela merkel will join irish taoiseach leo varadkar and south africa s cyril ramaphosa among others of course no davos would be complete without international monetary fund chief christine lagarde while britain s prince william will add a splash of royal glamour and then
