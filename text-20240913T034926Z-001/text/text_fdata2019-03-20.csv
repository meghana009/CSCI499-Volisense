guest post by nick giambruno it was perhaps the economist s most bizarre issue to date in january 1988 the magazine published a feature article titled get ready for a world currency the article called for countries to give up their monetary sovereignty in favor of a world central bank which would issue a new global currency it suggested the name phoenix for the currency the article recognized that most governments wouldn t participate under normal circumstances it claimed it would take a crisis the 31 year old article concluded with a prediction pencil in the phoenix for around 2018 and welcome it when it comes now 2018 has come and gone but the prospect of a global financial crisis ushering in a world central bank and a new global currency is increasingly plausible as i ll explain shortly this is bad news for the u s dollar for months i ve been telling my readers that an epic market crash is very likely before the end of trump s first term that s because the magnitude of a crisis is directly related to the amount of malinvestment getting flushed from the economy in other words the bigger the boom the bigger the bust and right now there is an unprecedented amount of malinvestment waiting to be flushed thanks to seven years of 0 interest rates and the 3 7 trillion the fed printed after the 2008 financial crisis the fed inflated the housing bubble with about two years of 1 interest rates so it s hard to fathom how much it distorted the economy with seven years of 0 interest rates the fed ended up creating not just a housing bubble or a tech bubble or a bond bubble but an everything bubble it s the biggest bubble in human history when it pops people will panic and demand that politicians do something this will be the perfect opportunity for the globalists to finalize their pet project a global central bank that issues a global currency in that sense the economist s 2018 prediction may end up close to the mark let me explain you see the economist s global central bank and the phoenix currency were code names global central bank and international currency referred to the international monetary fund imf and the international currency it issues known as the special drawing right sdr the imf describes itself as an organization of 189 countries working to foster global monetary cooperation secure financial stability facilitate international trade promote high employment and sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty around the world in short the imf is the quintessential globalist institution pretty much every country in the world is a member save for cuba north korea and a few others the sdr meanwhile is simply a basket of other leading fiat currencies the u s dollar currently makes up 42 the euro 31 the chinese renminbi 11 the japanese yen 8 and the british pound 8 in other words the sdr is a fiat currency based on other fiat currencies a floating abstraction based on other floating abstractions for decades the imf has been using crises to build the sdr into a global currency today there are about 204 billion sdrs in existence they re worth about 285 billion or about 1 39 per sdr in the past the imf hasn t created sdrs at regular intervals instead it s created several increasingly larger tranches during or just after global financial crises as you can see in the chart below the imf created sdrs in bulk in 1972 1981 and 2009 these were all periods of severe financial stress the imf increased the supply of sdrs by almost 10 times in response to the 2008 2009 financial crisis this was a huge incremental step towards establishing the imf as a global central bank and the sdr as a global currency there s a clear pattern here no doubt the imf will use the next crisis which promises to be even bigger than the last to increase its prominence and that of the sdr as you might imagine the average citizen can t use sdrs your neighbors don t have any in their wallets and that isn t going to change instead sdrs are primarily used by governments and supranational organizations like the un imf and world bank sdrs are dangerous they give the government in this case a global government more power they re a bridge to a powerful global monetary authority and eventually a global currency at some point they ll also likely be used to price major commodities like oil and gold and possibly be the reporting currency for major multinational companies airlines already use them to denominate some of their liabilities many global elites the types that gather in davos bilderberg etc are huge fans of the sdr mohamed el erian former ceo of pimco is a huge advocate of the sdr the infamous george soros is also a big fan expect to see the sdr used in more and more places as the globalists accelerate their push for it for now the u s dollar is still the world s premier reserve currency that s why people and businesses everywhere in the world take u s dollars for decades they ve had little choice about it today the biggest u s exports are dollars and government debt the u s government can create unlimited quantities of both from nothing it requires no effort to print u s dollars which can be exchanged for real things like french wine italian cars electronics from korea or chinese manufactured goods this creates an almost unlimited demand for u s dollars and that helps keep price inflation in the u s much lower than it would otherwise be it s hard to overstate how much this unique setup benefits the u s it s the bedrock of the u s financial system the french have deemed it an exorbitant privilege the sdr is bad for the u s dollar if the globalists get their way the dollar would no longer be the world s premier reserve currency the sdr would and the imf not the u s would reap the enormous benefits of the exorbitant privilege in other words the u s dollar would become merely a local currency like the canadian dollar or the mexican peso losing the exorbitant privilege and all the artificial demand it creates would mean massive price inflation for those holding u s dollars and there s pretty much nothing americans can do about it as i mentioned earlier the imf has used past financial crises to bolster its prominence and that of the sdr now we re headed for a financial crisis of historic proportions as the everything bubble blows up under trump s watch frankly the next crisis is going to be the big one and i m certain the imf and the globalists will use it to advance their agenda now there s only one way trump can fight back and you can profit no matter what happens

use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions creating collateral security packages types of collateral what types of collateral and security interests are available ecuadorian civil law recognises the validity of mortgages on real estate property and of pledge rights over goods movable assets as well as on other licence rights or concessions leaseholds buildings movable property contractual rights receivables shares securities onshore and offshore bank accounts entire enterprises after acquired property proceeds from investments and the sale of collaterals basically there are two types of pledges in ecuador possessory pledge by which the secured party is given possession of the collateral and non possessory pledge by which the grantor retains possession of the collateral collateral perfecting how is a security interest in each type of collateral perfected and how is its priority established are any fees taxes or other charges payable to perfect a security interest and if so are there lawful techniques to minimise them may a corporate entity in the capacity of agent or trustee hold collateral on behalf of the project lenders as the secured party is it necessary for the security agent and trustee to hold any licences to hold or enforce such security rights in rem are formalised by way of a public deed issued by a notary public and recorded by the land property registrar of each municipality where the real estate assets are located registration can also be required by a judicial order for enforcement measures normally notary and registration fees are reasonable making it unnecessary to search for price optimisation methods there are neither stamp duties nor other duties or fees to cover mortgages can be used to secure several separate obligations such obligations may be present or future for a specified or unspecified price or amount or for income social security and other taxes pledge rights need not be formalised by way of a public deed but must be recorded with the local mercantile registry other liens on movable assets such as company shares must be recorded in the company s stock ledger registration means that secured creditors can follow a general method for achieving third party enforcement of security rights in all types of movable assets in every case the documents have to be signed by the debtor on the other hand the most commonly used security interests in the ecuadorian financial system are stock pledges account receivable pledges and pledges on bank accounts and financial products as is the case with mortgages these security instruments must specify the contract or business from which the secured obligation derives the secured amount the duration of the obligation and the debt repayment formula a legally licensed trust management firm administradora de fondos y fideicomisos acting in the capacity of trustee is able to retain collateral on behalf of the project lenders as secured parties in the event of the trustee s bankruptcy the trust fideicomiso mercantil set up to collateralise a transaction may be transferred to another trustee and the collateral that was a part of a trust as an independent equity will remain intact the parallel debt clause concept is not explicitly recognised in ecuador however so long as it implies a private agreement among private parties it can validly be consented to even as a cross border security instrument assuring absence of liens how can a creditor assure itself as to the absence of liens with priority to the creditor s lien a creditor can assure itself as to the absence of liens with priority to the creditor s lien either with a certificate from the land property registrar office regarding real estate property or with a certificate from the mercantile registry for other goods or rights in the case of shares a certificate from the company s legal representative stating that no property liens have been registered in the company s stock ledger may be required another possibility is to obtain information on the debtor s credit status and the types of obligations with third parties that the debtor may have so as to know the rank or privilege with respect to collections that others could have labour and tax obligations usually have priority enforcing collateral rights outside the context of a bankruptcy proceeding what steps should a project lender take to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral outside the context of a bankruptcy proceeding a project lender may secure its rights by requesting judicial recognition of its credit immediate payment and compensation of collection costs the lender can record the judicial claim with the land registrar as well as with the mercantile registry if court enforcement is necessary to collect a debt the procedure leading to a public auction is simple when credit is properly documented at any time before enforcement and even prior to an auction the creditor and debtor may negotiate and agree on new terms for their transaction there are statutory notice periods for a sale that are notified by the court on a case by case basis project lenders can participate as buyers in a sale finally ecuador uses the us dollar as its legal currency which means that an auction can take place to collect in us dollars with regard to any proceedings enforcing collateral rights following bankruptcy how does a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the project company affect the ability of a project lender to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral are there any preference periods clawback rights or other preferential creditors rights eg tax debts employees claims with respect to the collateral what entities are excluded from bankruptcy proceedings and what legislation applies to them what processes other than court proceedings are available to seize the assets of the project company in an enforcement a bankruptcy proceeding affects the lender s ability to enforce its rights because it will have to compete with other creditors who could have greater priority for getting paid credits and other obligations have preference in the following order taxes employee rights mortgages ordinary debts and accessory debts the only entities excluded from bankruptcy proceedings in ecuador are state institutions and state owned corporations in ecuador procedures such as the appointment of a receiver are court proceedings and are part of the enforcement process the enforcement of foreign procedures in ecuador requires a local court order the enforcement of a foreign judgment requires an exequatur procedure similar to that needed to enforce a foreign award foreign exchange and withholding tax issues restrictions controls fees and taxes what are the restrictions controls fees taxes or other charges on foreign currency exchange as explained the us dollar is the legal currency in ecuador additionally ecuador has no restrictions on foreign currency exchange there are no rules preventing companies from holding offshore bank accounts in foreign currency in this respect ecuadorian legislation has followed the non intervention principle for the foreign exchange policy taking an open market approach the current organic monetary and financial code in force since september 2014 took on regulating and policymaking powers with respect to monetary and financial matters because it allows all authorised entities of the national financial system to negotiate foreign currencies those entities are required to comply with certain reporting duties with the central bank of ecuador investment returns what are the restrictions controls fees and taxes on remittances of investment returns or payments of principal interest or premiums on loans or bonds to parties in other jurisdictions ecuador has no restrictions on the remittance of investment returns nevertheless a 5 per cent capital outflow tax isd generally applies to payments made abroad as a general rule dividends and capital paid to foreign shareholders non resident individuals or companies are tax exempt and therefore not subject to the regular 25 per cent withholding tax wht or the 5 per cent isd provided the remittance complies with the specific tax rules for this exemption to be effective similarly payments of interest or principal are tax exempt to benefit from these exemptions foreign loans must be for a term of at least 360 days must be granted by financial

the monetary and financial policy and regulation board by way of a resolution interest on direct or indirect loans between related parties is subject to the 25 per cent wht and if the loan is not recorded at the central bank of ecuador interest will not be regarded as a deductible expense additionally if the interest beneficiary is domiciled in a tax haven or a lower tax jurisdiction it will be subject to a higher wht and the 5 per cent isd premiums on loans and bonds are subject to the 25 per cent withholding tax and to the 5 per cent isd when remitted abroad notwithstanding the foregoing public projects carried out under public private partnerships ppp are exempt from the 5 per cent isd with regard to all payments remitted abroad including import payments companies operating in special economic development zones zedes are also exempt from paying the 5 per cent isd foreign earnings must project companies repatriate foreign earnings if so must they be converted to local currency and what further restrictions exist over their use the monetary and financial policy and regulation board which is vested with macroeconomic powers may establish conditions and limits on assets held abroad by financial institutions stock and insurance entities and non financial entities that grant loans with respect to project companies however there is no specific legal provision or regulation granting such power or creating an obligation to repatriate earnings obtained from investments abroad nonetheless a presumptive capital outflow tax applies to earnings derived from export activities when such earnings have not entered the country within one year and are kept in offshore bank accounts those earnings will be subject to the 5 per cent isd may project companies establish and maintain foreign currency accounts in other jurisdictions and locally as mentioned in the answer to question 6 ecuador has no rules preventing companies from maintaining bank accounts in foreign currency abroad local financial entities may only establish bank accounts in us dollars and are required to report all negotiations in foreign currency other than us dollar to the central bank foreign investment issues investment restrictions what restrictions fees and taxes exist on foreign investment in or ownership of a project and related companies do the restrictions also apply to foreign investors or creditors in the event of foreclosure on the project and related companies are there any bilateral investment treaties with key nation states or other international treaties that may afford relief from such restrictions would such activities require registration with any government authority there are no restrictions on foreign investment in or ownership of a project and related companies the only exception to this general principle is due to national security reasons foreign individuals or corporations are banned from acquiring or holding any real estate property within border security zones or in those zones under concession contracts foreign investment and foreign loans must be recorded at the central bank of ecuador within a period of 40 and 45 calendar days respectively from disbursement registering a foreign loan or foreign investment beyond that time frame is subject to a fine ecuador had executed two dozen bilateral investment treaties however all of those treaties were denounced on constitutional grounds and the procedure for their termination has been initiated the current government has mentioned the interest of entering into new reformulated treaties to that effect insurance restrictions what restrictions fees and taxes exist on insurance policies over project assets provided or guaranteed by foreign insurance companies may such policies be payable to foreign secured creditors any insurance company offering insurance policies must be domiciled or incorporated in ecuador prior to offering or executing any reinsurance contract covering project assets foreign reinsurance companies need to be registered with the superintendency of companies securities and insurance in accordance with insurance regulations worker restrictions what restrictions exist on bringing in foreign workers technicians or executives to work on a project there are no legal restrictions to bringing in foreign workers but the employer must report their information to the ministry of labour aimed at ensuring that those employees are granted employment benefits such as enrolment with social security foreign workers technicians and executives must

customs clearing procedures are completed and tariffs and taxes are paid in due course nationalisation laws what laws exist regarding the nationalisation or expropriation of project companies and

under certain conditions fiscal treatment of foreign investment incentives what tax incentives or other incentives are provided preferentially to foreign investors or creditors what taxes apply to foreign investments loans mortgages or other security documents either for the purposes of effectiveness or registration despite the return to the 25 per cent rate on corporate income tax rate as of 2018 previously 22 per cent the ecuadorian government is determined to increase tax incentives to attract foreign investors dividends and profits paid or credited by local companies to non resident companies or individuals are tax exempt except when the non resident company or individual is domiciled in a tax haven or a lower tax jurisdiction income tax holidays all companies incorporated as a ppp are entitled to income tax exemption for 10 years as of the first year they produce operating revenue all dividends and profits payable to shareholders are also tax exempt regardless of the beneficiary s domicile companies developing digital technology enjoy income tax exemption for five years merging entities from the people s and solidarity financial sector also enjoy tax exemption for

or straight exemption from withholding taxes among the key nations are brazil belgium canada chile china south korea france germany italy mexico switzerland romania spain uruguay qatar russia and belarus furthermore ecuador has a multilateral agreement in place for this same purpose with the andean community comprising colombia ecuador peru and bolivia government authorities relevant authorities what are the relevant government agencies or departments with authority over projects in the typical project sectors what is the nature and extent of their authority what is the history of state ownership in these sectors the most relevant projects in the country s history have been carried out by government entities across almost all strategic sectors oil and gas mining chemical refining water treatment power generation and transmission transportation ports airports and telecommunications some of these activities have been delegated to the private sector presently the government is employing its efforts to demonstrate its interest in boosting private participation since may 2018 the entity in charge of public policies regarding oil and gas mining chemical refining and power generation and transmission is the ministry of energy and non renewable resources the ministry also presides the national infrastructure committee recently created to define new major infrastructure investments for the aforementioned sectors the strategic projects in all those sectors are carried out by state owned corporations subject to the ministry s oversight that have privilege for exploring producing transporting refining and commercialising natural resources while private entities foreign or local may participate only on an exceptional basis the main state owned entities belong to the hydrocarbons sector petroecuador and petroamazonas presently in a merger process in the power sector the sole public actor and project developer is celec ep and subsidiaries and in the mining sector the public enterprise enami ep which holds the state s interest in some of the largest investment and most relevant mining investment projects the ministry of transportation and public works is the policymaker regarding road port and airport concessions besides being the grantor of concessions permits and authorisations for these types of infrastructure at the national level by delegation of competence to local governments municipalities and provinces develop medium to small infrastructure projects besides being regarded as a natural resource water in ecuador is subject to a special treatment since it is deemed to be a human right and therefore is a strategic sector of the economy the state policymaker in the water sector is the water secretariat the agency in charge of water regulation and oversight is the water regulation and oversight agency in addition epa ep a state owned company is in charge of contracting design construction operation and maintenance managing and supervising the central government s water infrastructure projects local governments regional or municipal entities are responsible by delegation for contracting regional and urban projects there are specialised oversight agencies for each sector the telecommunications sector is under the direction of the ministry of telecommunications and information society and regulated by the telecommunications regulation and oversight agency regulation of natural resources titles who has title to natural resources what rights may private parties acquire to these resources and what obligations does the holder have may foreign parties acquire such rights ecuadorian civil law defines national assets as assets belonging to the entire nation as is the case of biodiversity if in addition assets can be used by all inhabitants such as in the case of streets squares bridges and roads the adjacent sea and its beaches perpetual snow capped andean mountains and areas at least 4 500 metres above sea level then the asset is called a public good when national assets cannot be used by inhabitants they are called state assets or fiscal assets the constitution declares that hydrocarbons minerals and non renewable soil resources are state assets and therefore the state s unalienable property private foreign or ecuadorian persons cannot acquire state assets as their own property in the hydrocarbons sector private foreign or local persons are entitled to be awarded a contract after having won a public bid for developing exploration and production oil fields for which the state owned petroamazonas ep does not have the technical or financial capability the contractor which is deemed to be only a specific services provider will not be regarded as the owner of the underground reserves furthermore in the mining sector the state owns manages regulates and controls every mineral and non renewable natural resource within national territory nevertheless and on an exceptional basis the state can delegate extractive activities to private persons whether foreign with legal domicile in ecuador or local by granting mining concessions for up to 25 years awarded concessionaires have exclusive rights to explore mine process and commercialise any type of minerals found within the boundaries of their concessions contractor or concessionaire rights are acquired and exercised pursuant to environmental licences granted by the ministry of the environment for every activity in each project starting with surveying up to production based on an independent environmental impact study the contractor or concessionaire will be considered the ultimately responsible party for any environmental impacts including damage in communities inside the project s area of influence the state promotes a sustainable and balanced environment in ancestral territories and grants legal security to communal lands of indigenous peoples and nations in accordance with the constitution and international collective rights treaties environmental impact studies include a referendum to be conducted for the communities inside the project s area of influence the community s rejection of a project may provide grounds for the government to discontinue the project the liability of the contractor or concessionaire also applies to damage caused by subcontractors or even third parties within the area of influence environmental damage may trigger the unilateral termination of the contract by the government unless remediation is timely conducted royalties and taxes what royalties and taxes are payable on the extraction of natural resources and are they revenue or profit based based on constitutional equality and non discrimination principles mining concessionaires and mineral industrial facilities foreign doing business in ecuador or local must declare and pay yearly royalties on a semester basis for each concession in the mining phase and for every processing plant the constitutional principle declares that the state will benefit from the use of mineral resources in at least the same percentage as that of the concessionaire applicable royalties on extraction activities are summarised below type of mining mineral tariff small scale mining metallic 3 of sales of the main mineral and secondary minerals taking as a reference international market prices on the date of sale and in the case of exports on the date of shipment non metallic 3 of mineral production costs medium scale mining to large scale mining metallic 4 of sales of the main and secondary minerals non metallic for limestone and other non metallic minerals royalties are calculated based on production costs and the scale defined in the general regulation of the mining law depending on the product and production volume large scale mining metallic gold silver and copper royalties not greater than 8 of sales of the main mineral and secondary minerals metallic other than gold silver and copper royalties not less than 5 of sales of the main mineral and secondary minerals non metallic for limestone and other non metallic minerals royalties are calculated based on production costs and the scale defined in the general regulation of the mining law depending on the product and production volume processing plants mining tailings from mineral products 3 of mineral products obtained from mining tailings when recovered for the types of mining listed above production costs include all direct and indirect costs incurred during the mineral mining phase and does not include any value as royalties export restrictions what restrictions fees or taxes exist on the export of natural resources mining concessionaires can freely market their production inside or outside the country with a licence to serve this purpose however gold from small scale mining and artisanal mining is sold directly by the central bank of ecuador or through the central bank s previously authorised public and private economic agents the exit of merchandise to or from ecuadorian territory is done only through the designated places and on the days and times authorised by the national customs service of ecuador any means of transport entering the customs territory must undergo control legal issues of general application government permission what government approvals are required for typical project finance transactions what fees and other charges apply for a transaction among private parties no specific approval is required other than as would be otherwise applicable for the specific action for instance as explained above a foreign loan must be recorded with the central bank of ecuador and withholding income tax applies to interest paid above permitted rates also remittance of funds is subject to the 5 per cent isd additionally an investment agreement may be signed by the investor to access tax stabilisation public private partnerships are specifically regulated by statute in order to benefit from the various incentives several requirements must be met registration of financing must any of the financing or project documents be registered or filed with any government authority or otherwise comply with legal formalities to be valid or enforceable financing or project documents need not to be registered or filed per se however foreign loans must be recorded with the central bank of ecuador regarding formalities should a document need to be filed with a governmental entity for whatever reason or submitted to the courts it must be translated into spanish and if issued abroad authenticated through an apostille or by the competent foreign service officer arbitration awards how are international arbitration contractual provisions and awards recognised by local courts is the jurisdiction a member of the icsid convention or other prominent dispute resolution conventions are any types of disputes not arbitrable are any types of disputes subject to automatic domestic arbitration international arbitration contractual provisions are recognised as long as one of the following conditions is met i one of the parties is domiciled outside of ecuador ii a substantial part of the obligations or the matter in dispute is located outside of ecuador or iii it refers to international trade unless it is a non arbitrable matter or national interests are affected the scope of the latter exception may still be subject to debate but could be interpreted as involving certain state prerogatives regarding the enforcement of foreign awards ecuador is a party to the new york convention enforcement needs an exequatur from the provincial court which will be granted subject to certain requirements such as authentication translation and evidence that the award is res iudicata and that due process of law was guaranteed for the parties defence if the state is involved the award must not violate the constitution or the law as a result of the 2009 denunciation of the icsid convention ecuador is no longer a member according to the arbitration and mediation law only arbitral matters that can be the object of compromise could be submitted to arbitration this provision may leave out certain rights that cannot be renounced from a valid arbitration agreement law governing agreements which jurisdiction s law typically governs project agreements which jurisdiction s law typically governs financing agreements which matters are governed by domestic law generally ecuadorian law applies to contracts regarding goods or obligations located in national territory financing agreements executed abroad with foreign lenders may be subject to foreign law and jurisdiction and the judgment issued by a court abroad may be enforced in ecuador owing to constitutional and legal constraints the argument is that the state cannot be subject to international arbitration with the exception of arbitration conducted at a latin american site prior authorisation from the attorney general of ecuador is necessary for the state to submit to international arbitration submission to foreign jurisdiction is a submission to a foreign jurisdiction and a waiver of immunity effective and enforceable the arbitration and mediation law expressly allows submission to foreign jurisdiction law for matters that are subject to international arbitration where the parties are free to agree on the substantive law applicable to the dispute a waiver of immunity would not be effective or enforceable if it goes against ecuadorian public law environmental health and safety laws applicable regulations what laws or regulations apply to typical project sectors what regulatory bodies administer those laws the national authority on environmental policies and affairs is the ministry of the environment and the national authority on labour policies and affairs is the ministry of labour despite the jurisdiction of national authorities in environmental and labour matters certain entities for each specific strategic sector have jurisdiction and are responsible for complying with the special regulations applicable to each sector furthermore they must ensure that concessionaires and contractors comply with local regulations covering but not limited to labour matters and environmental affairs in general terms though from a perspective of specialised industry practices the oil and gas hydrocarbons sector including downstream and upstream is regulated by the hydrocarbons law under the direction of the ministry of energy and non renewable resources and the oversight of the hydrocarbons regulation and oversight agency the electricity sector including generation transmission and distribution is regulated by the organic law of the public service of electrical power under the direction of the ministry of energy and non renewable resources and the oversight of the electricity regulation and oversight agency the mining sector is regulated by the mining law under the direction of the ministry of energy and non renewable resources and the oversight of the mining regulation and oversight agency the road infrastructure and transportation sector is regulated by the organic law of the national road infrastructure system of land transportation under the direction of the ministry of transportation and public works the water sector is regulated by the organic law of water resources and uses under the direction of the water secretariat and the oversight of the water regulation and oversight agency and the telecommunications sector is regulated by the organic telecommunications law under the direction of the ministry of telecommunications and information society and the oversight of the telecommunications regulation and oversight agency project companies principal business structures what are the principal business structures of project companies what are the principal sources of financing available to project companies the principal business structure for project companies is the corporation by shares this can only issue nominative shares which are recorded in the company s stock ledger and can be freely transferred any transfer of shares must be reported to the superintendency of companies hence shareholding information becomes publicly available through the superintendency s website information on foreign shareholders and their ultimate owners in the chain of ownership must be notified to the tax authorities each year the other popular type of company for small professional or family businesses is the limited liability company however this form of company imposes a significant restriction on the transfer of shares which requires the unanimous authorisation of all shareholders thus discouraging the use of this type of corporate vehicle for a complex business structure the use of a trust may be suitable the trust is a legal entity under ecuadorian law that can hold property including shares issued by corporations the trust is legally represented by specialised trust management firms that must follow instructions as agreed in the trust contract the fideicomiso mercantil has become a flexible and very useful mechanism for ensuring the assignment of cash flows and the transfer of property following contractual agreements financing in ecuador may be available through the banking system as well as in the securities market despite regulatory efforts securities markets have not yet developed as desired project companies may seek financing through multilateral organisations as well as foreign financial institutions foreign loans must be recorded and are subject to certain regulations with respect to interest rates withholding taxes and so on public private partnership legislation applicable legislation has ppp enabling legislation been enacted and if so at what level of government and is the legislation industry specific in december 2015 the ecuadorian national legislative branch enacted the organic law on incentives for public private partnerships and foreign investment which allows the private initiative to propose develop and execute by delegation of the state public private projects in alliance with central entities including state owned corporations or with local governments and affiliated entities a specialised regulation for each project may be applicable from the perspective of the sector and industry where the project is carried out a ppp project may cover the design construction improvement procurement management operation or maintenance of an existing or a new public work for the provision of a service of general interest under specific delegation by the state or for the construction and commercialisation of real estate projects and urban development works for a social interest other activities may be rated as priority by a central government interinstitutional committee according to this law each public private partnership project may define its specific method for investment and compensation ppp limitations legal limitations what if any are the practical and legal limitations on ppp transactions the limitations on developing a ppp project are based on the legal framework that defines the legal capacity of the participating public partner to act within its regular competences in a project such as the one proposed for the ppp and the financial ability and expertise that may allow the private partner to qualify as suitable for public interest in the opinion of a special committee of the executive branch authorising the endeavour other specific limitations on ppp projects are defined by the interinstitutional committee once the terms of reference for selecting a private partner are defined for the specific project the particular characteristics of the project may require specific types of experience or financial status know how and so on even though the ppp implies the presence and performance of a partially private entity acting on behalf of the state the ppp is not an exclusive licence in favour of the private entrepreneur nonetheless once the private partner executes the delegation contract under the structure of the ppp the ecuadorian state grants legal stability for the ppp in the conditions and for the time agreed tax benefits including income tax exemption apply depending on the location of the project and the investment contract ascribing tax stability ppp transactions significant transactions what have been the most significant ppp transactions completed to date in your jurisdiction since december 2015 the republic of ecuador has signed only five relevant ppp projects all of which are related to harbour facilities for all these projects the plan is for private partners to carry out the design construction enhancement procurement management operation or maintenance of existing and new harbour facilities destined to providing services under specific delegation by the state the largest of those projects could be the posorja harbour with a us 1 2 billion investment by dp world dubai which will manage the port until 2066 update trends update trends updates and trends a bill is currently in the legislative pipeline to create more incentives to attract foreign investment which includes longer tax holidays and a potential reduction in the rate of the capital outflow tax

capacity of agent or trustee hold collateral on behalf of the project lenders as the secured party is it necessary for the security agent and trustee to hold any licences to hold or enforce such security requirements and formalities necessary to perfect a security interest depend on the type of collateral pursuant to panamanian law a pledge is perfected once the secured property or title is delivered to the lender to an agent appointed by the debtor and the project lender the date of the pledge shall be evidenced in a public deed or notarised document similarly a pledge must meet the same formalities met by the main loan agreement a description of the requirements and formalities applicable to various forms of collateral follows below collateral over real estate and vessels collateral over real estate and vessels must take the form of a notarised public deed signed by the parties involved the mortgage is perfected once the public deed is registered at the public registry applicable public registry fees are us 3 for each us 1 000 worth of the value of the real estate and us 2 50 for every us 1 000 of the value of the mortgage over the vessel collateral over chattels collateral over chattels with a value of more than us 20 000 must take the form of a notarised public deed signed by the parties involved the public deed must then be registered at the public registry applicable public registry fees are us 1 for each us 1 000 for assets with a value lower than us 20 000 for assets with a value above us 20 000 the applicable fees are us 42 for the first us 20 000 of the value of the pledged assets and us 30 for every us 10 000 or fraction thereof of the total value of the pledged assets collateral over chattels worth less than us 20 000 must follow the requirements and formalities of the pledge discussed below and must comply with the same formalities as that of the main agreement collateral over securities and titles a pledge of securities and titles requires the endorsement and delivery of the title to the project lender to an agent appointed by the debtor and the project lender or to a trustee appointed to hold title on behalf of the project lender with respect to shares or quotas issued by a company in addition to the delivery of the share certificate the pledge should be recorded in the register of members assignment of receivables the assignment of receivables must take the form of an assignment agreement and must be perfected by notifying the debtors of the assignment of such receivables a lender will rank senior in right of payment to the extent of the collateral and up to the value of such collateral in cases with more than one creditor the oldest pledge will have priority over the remaining pledges and will exclude the remaining pledges in the case of execution in addition to the registration fees listed above and payable to the public registry for the registration of a pledge over certain assets there are no other charges or taxes imposed on or by virtue of the execution or delivery of the collateral in panama however a stamp tax at the rate of us 0 10 for each us 100 of the face value of the corresponding obligations may be levied in the event that a loan or security agreement is submitted before any court or administrative authority in panama a corporate entity or trust may hold collateral on behalf of the project lenders as the secured party trustee companies must be licensed by the panamanian bank superintendency corporate entities may also hold collateral and in such capacity become responsible for the proper conservation of the pledged assets trustees are required to maintain their own assets separate from assets transferred to them in trust in the event a trustee is declared bankrupt all assets assigned in trust will be excluded from the bankruptcy a parallel debt clause that requires the debtor to make equal and concurrent payments to the lender and to a security trustee creating a direct claim of the security trustee against the debtor would be recognised under panamanian law assuring absence of liens how can a creditor assure itself as to the absence of liens with priority to the creditor s lien in the case of real estate chattels or any property title that is filed with the public registry or any other registry office the absence of prior liens may be confirmed through a search or through a certificate issued by the public registry or the correspondent registry office shares or quotas may be checked by reviewing the register of members or by requesting the secretary of the company to certify that the shares are not under any type of lien other types of assets should be checked by including proper representations in the agreements to be subscribed enforcing collateral rights outside the context of a bankruptcy proceeding what steps should a project lender take to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral depending on the type of assets and guarantees secured lenders may enforce their rights within or without the court system judicial enforcement to claim real estate mortgaged collateral requires the lender to file a foreclosure action usually in civil court the same course of action is applicable in the case that the lender holds a general pledge of assets which will normally encompass personal and real estate property non judicial enforcement is available also in certain circumstances collateral secured through a pledge or mortgage of chattel may be foreclosed without the need to access the court system however so the lender may privately foreclose the security agreement must establish the method of fairly appraising the value of the assets in us dollars if the agreement does not include a valuation method the parties to the agreement must appoint three experts who will have to agree on the value of the pledged assets the lenders are not restricted from taking part in foreclosure sales and acquiring the pledged assets enforcing collateral rights following bankruptcy how does a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the project company affect the ability of a project lender to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral are there any preference periods clawback rights or other preferential creditors rights eg tax debts employees claims with respect to the collateral what entities are excluded from bankruptcy proceedings and what legislation applies to them what processes other than court proceedings are available to seize the assets of the project company in an enforcement the ability of a project lender to enforce its rights as a secured party is not affected in a bankruptcy proceeding because panamanian bankruptcy law recognises and upholds the priority a secured lender has over the collateral in the event a project company becomes insolvent and is driven to bankruptcy by its creditors secured lenders will still collect with priority over any bankruptcy creditor from collateral mortgaged or pledged to the lender by the project company if the secured assets are not enough to repay the obligation those assets were meant to secure the unsecured portion of the claim will be ranked with all other unsecured bankruptcy creditors bankruptcy provisions rank unsecured creditors at the end of the collection line after tax liabilities legal expenses of the bankruptcy and employees claims however a bankruptcy judge has the authority to review any debtor transactions and transfers taking place up to four years prior to the declaration of bankruptcy should the bankruptcy judge consider that the debtor was in a state of bankruptcy during any portion of the preceding four years the bankruptcy judge may void any transactions or transfers of property occurring within those four years governmental institutions are excluded from bankruptcy regulation and proceedings as a general rule individuals and companies are subject to the

cent of the total payment of interest commissions or other charges namely 12 5 per cent of the total payment to the foreign creditor the 12 5 per cent rate must be withheld by the local borrowing

restrictions on the use of foreign earnings may project companies establish and maintain foreign currency accounts in other jurisdictions and locally project companies may indeed maintain foreign currency accounts in other jurisdictions the law does not impose restrictions on foreign currency bank accounts rather it depends on the policies of each individual bank certain local banks allow their clients to maintain local bank accounts in euros foreign investment issues investment restrictions what restrictions fees and taxes exist on foreign investment in or ownership of a project and related companies do the restrictions also apply to foreign investors or creditors in the event of foreclosure on the project and related companies are there any bilateral investment treaties with key nation states or other international treaties that may afford relief from such restrictions would such activities require registration with any government authority there are no special restrictions fees or taxes on foreign investment in or ownership of a project company or its related companies the panamanian constitution provides for the equal treatment of foreign and local investors however the constitution also creates two exceptions pursuant to these exceptions foreign investors may not own property located within 10 kilometres of the country s borders in islands considered strategic areas that are reserved for governmental programmes or in islands that are not declared areas of special development and regulated by special laws or participate in retail business activities there are no bilateral investment treaties in force exempting the application of those restrictions on a particular nationality hence no special registration requirements apply to foreign investors insurance restrictions what restrictions fees and taxes exist on insurance policies over project assets provided or guaranteed by foreign insurance companies may such policies be payable to foreign secured creditors under panamanian law all local risks must be insured by insurance companies licensed by the insurance and reinsurance superintendency of panama however insurance companies licensed elsewhere may issue policies to cover local or panamanian risks provided that licensed panamanian insurance companies do not provide coverage for such risks and that such policy or coverage is previously authorised by the insurance and reinsurance superintendency of panama cut through clauses are not effective under panamanian law panamanian law does not have limitations for local insurance policies to be payable to a foreign secured creditor worker restrictions what restrictions exist on bringing in foreign workers technicians or executives to work on a project foreign workers must obtain an immigration visa from the national immigration department and a work permit that is issued by the ministry of labour labour law allows the foreign workforce and payroll of a local or foreign company doing business in panama to consist of up to 10 per cent of the local or panamanian workforce and payroll in the case of trusted and skilled workers or technicians the foreign worker allowance is increased to 15 per cent of the local or panamanian workforce and payroll however panama has enacted legislation that affords unlimited temporary visas and work permits to the foreign workforce and payroll of companies licensed or established pursuant to special legislation designed to promote foreign investment in panama the multinational corporate seat law mcs law allows companies that are licensed under the statute to obtain immigrant visas and work permits free of thresholds or quotas the mcs law also creates a simplified process to obtain such visas and permits likewise the panama pacific special economic area law creates a simplified process for obtaining visas and work permits project companies located in special economic and trading areas such as the colón free trade zone or export processing zones can also hire foreign workers under special immigration and labour regulations equipment restrictions what restrictions exist on the importation of project equipment there are no restrictions to import project equipment however panama s tax legislation imposes import duties and a kind of value added tax domestically known as itbms on equipment imports tariffs for imports into panama are fixed by cabinet decrees issued by the executive branch panama is a member of the world trade organization so tariffs must comply with wto standards in the case of equipment imports itbms is assessed at the rate of 7 per cent of the cif value of the equipment plus customs duties and charges at the applicable rates for the particular equipment imports if the cif value cannot be determined the tax code provides for an import assessment of fob value plus 15 per cent nationalisation laws what laws exist regarding the nationalisation or expropriation of project companies and assets are any forms of investment specially protected according to the panamanian constitution the government can expropriate private property for public or social interest purposes in exchange for proper compensation the code of civil procedure requires the executive branch of government to commence a civil court proceeding immediately after issuing the resolution to expropriate private property said proceeding is designed to fix proper compensation through a valuation of the expropriated property by three experts appointed by each party and the court and to enable creditors holding security interests in the expropriated property to pursue payment of their credits panama s civil procedure code also provides for swift expropriation in the case of war and serious public or social unrest as well as for the development of projects of urgent public and social interest in such cases court proceedings to appraise the assets and fix proper compensation must be completed in a shorter period there are no forms of investment protected from expropriation however panamanian law does require the government to provide fair compensation fiscal treatment of foreign investment incentives what tax incentives or other incentives are provided preferentially to foreign investors or creditors what taxes apply to foreign investments loans mortgages or other security documents either for the purposes of effectiveness or registration under panamanian law taxes apply equally to foreign or local investors as outlined in question 7 panama s tax system is based on a territoriality principle consequently income tax in panama is assessed over any income produced in panama by any person or corporation regardless of their citizenship residence or domicile in connection with any activity or operation executed within panamanian territory irrespective of foreign contacts instead of assigning incentives on a foreign or local investment dichotomy the benefit or incentive criteria are developed taking into account investment areas and in some cases the amount of investment as well among the areas where panama has in place special investment or tax benefits are tourism agriculture agroforestry mining hydrocarbon storage and distribution free zones telecommunications residential and commercial construction projects port and railway development and energy generation whereby investors are guaranteed tax and legal stability from the time they register with the ministry of commerce for up to 10 years in addition there are special tax treatments for energy generation

markets are also used public private partnership legislation applicable legislation has ppp enabling legislation been enacted and if so at what level of government and is the legislation industry specific the constitution allows the government to promote the creation of ppps to solve social security and public interest needs in the case of public utility ppps the constitution also requires that the majority of the capital be panamanian except where legislation expressly provides otherwise panama does not currently have comprehensive ppp legislation the absence of comprehensive ppp legislation has not hindered the development of ppps for more than a decade the central government has developed ppps by taking advantage of legislation governing direct equity investments or concession arrangements equity based ppps in 1995 and 1996 as a consequence of an effort to develop competition and private sector investment in the telecommunications sector panama enacted legislation to create a telecommunications ppp between the central government and a private investor in 1997 panama adopted additional legislation to privatise and develop competition in the electricity sector another ppp was formed between the central government and private investors that were selected to invest in four generation three hydroelectric and one thermoelectric and three distribution companies the aforementioned 1997 legislation also privatised the ports of balboa and cristobal located in the cities of panama and colón respectively the central government selected its private investment partner private investment partners in each sector were all selected through separate competitive biddings the state separated and contributed the respective sector assets to each of the new companies in the case of the telecommunications ppp the state and private investors each retained a 49 per cent equity ownership with the private investor retaining operational control of the company the employees retained 2 per cent of the equity ownership the same equity arrangement prevailed with respect to the three hydroelectric generation companies in the case of the three distribution companies as well as the thermoelectric generation company the central government awarded a 51 per cent equity ownership in each company to the respective private investors a notable exception was the ppp in the ports of balboa and cristobal where the central government retained a 10 per cent equity ownership all of these ppps continue in effect and remain operational concession based ppps in 1988 panamanian legislation adopted a concession framework that enables the government to grant private companies the right to develop projects for public use such as highway and toll road infrastructure and any other type of project chosen by the executive branch in addition the government may grant concessions to private investors to use and develop government owned land islands and coasts in tourism projects for up to 100 years ppp limitations legal limitations what if any are the practical and legal limitations on ppp transactions ppps are connected to concessions that limit the scope of the operation to a specific term geographic area or purpose the concession framework currently in effect and discussed in the preceding section is available only for highway

the austerity programme imposed by the imf after argentina s 2001 economic crisis far from imposing debt universally as maurizio lazzarato s figure of the indebted man would have it hit women hardest george jepson revisits this history to extract the figure of the indebted woman it forged and the collective female body of protest that erupted as a result in december 2001 argentina erupted in popular revolt mass mobilisations and street protests broke out against a government whose policies of debt indued austerity had for too long widened the gap between the elite and the increasingly impoverished masses media images of these insurrections circulated around the globe defining collective knowledge of the crisis and imparting a sense of its severity radicalism and the instability of argentina s political system images of picqueteros street pickets pan banging cacerolazo roadblocks the fire bombing and vandalism of banks and municipal buildings came to symbolise the revolts however rather than erupting from a dormant population it is by now well understood that the conditions that sparked these insurrections had been developing since at least the 1990s the argentinian context itself works as perhaps the ultimate example of a nation in the global south into which a huge influx of capital acted to destabilise both the economy and national and local politics and for which global financial institutions would have to come to save the day how is it that the neoliberal policies imposed by these institutions served contrary to their reasoning to worsen the crisis foster political corruption and plunge 50 percent of the population below the poverty line these conditions imposed in numerous iterations since the 1980s by the imf and the world bank in collusion with lobbying american banks and vulture funds and the argentine state are evocative of an ongoing imbalance of power between the global north and south but these neoliberal policies and economic conditions did more than have a catastrophic effect on the argentine economy in fact the imf and international banks who willingly lent money to a military dictatorship were complicit in and benefitted greatly from the creation of argentina as an indebted nation this process actively sought to recolonise latin america weaponising international finance as a means of governance within this context i will explore maurizio lazzarato s indebted man paradigm that constructs indebtedness as a generalised subjective condition through which the most universal power relation has become that of the debtor creditor is a debtor accountable to and guilty before capital there is however as tiziana terranova understands an inconsistency in relation to analysis of debt as generalised condition which necessitates drawing attention to the gendered character of the debtor creditor relationship and how it intervenes in processes of reproduction i extrapolate from this as a means to explore the possibilities of theorising differential subjective conditions insofar as they are contingent on the concept of debt and its affective potentials lazzarato s figure provides a useful but limited paradigm of global indebtedness that i will expand through the conditions of the argentine financial crisis its history and legacy particularly exploring the scope of its appropriation and effect on the figuration of and possibilities for female subjectivities by interrelating lazzarato s paradigm to work exploring the condition and roles of women in argentina in this period the indebted figure can be expanded to emerge as a self aware non finite differently gendered subjective trope today the conquistadors are the officers of the world bank and the international monetary fund who are still preaching the worth of a penny to the same populations which the dominant world powers have for centuries robbed and pauperized silvia federici following federici we can begin to understand the origins of the argentine financial crisis as subject to the same processes of primitive accumulation as that which marx outlines in capital vol 1 as marx delineates primitive accumulation is the incremental but violent establishment of private property as the central tenet of global capitalism the appropriation of formerly public or unowned commons as private wealth while federici expands the notion to include the female body as an appropriable and expropriable object for marx it is centrally a process of land enclosure which provides grounds for ongoing wealth creation and by extension capitalism s own reproduction following this we can understand as does rosa luxemburg that capitalism s fundamental means of reproduction is in fact its ability to provoke displace and overcome crisis through the assimilation of the form the crisis takes for our purposes this mechanism takes multiple forms as we must understand that not only did the debt crisis emerge from a series of loans amassed by argentina s military dictatorship between 1976 and 1981 essentially for personal gain but that the lending of these loans from mostly united states banks was an active mechanism of support for the regime of both the micro and the macro the same logic is true keeping a particular demographic indebted or the nation in which they reside indebted maintains a pre existing balance of power the process of indebtedness itself is designed to be self perpetuating making the structural conditions of resistance against this balance of power ever more impossible to overcome this also extends to the united states ability to maintain argentina s general state of indebtedness in collusion with a conservative government for whom the country itself functions as an entity from which wealth can be extracted there becomes no danger of political challenge on the global stage from a country whose masses are impoverished we can understand debt itself then through the prism of primitive accumulation debt creation is the appropriation of a nation s pre existing institutions say state owned companies or welfare institutions that are then used as collateral from which capital can be extracted as federici notes quoting capital the only part of the so called national wealth that actually enters into the collective possession of a modern nation is the national debt this logic as we will see can be extended to invoke a biopolitics of debt whereby the body in our case the female body acts as a site of constant accumulation due to the sudden expansion of international finance markets in 1970s huge loans became available which had previously not been seizing on this the argentine dictatorship s minister of finance josé alfredo martinez de hoz adopted a strategy of accelerated external indebtedness instead of allowing space from debt servicing which often stagnates economic growth simply due to the huge amount of money it takes to maintain solvency in the face of massive interest rates his laissez faire policy in the form of loan taking and the abolition of export tariffs as well as a heavy devaluation of the peso was part and parcel of a policy designed to open up the economy to integrate the argentinian economy into the international markets not only then were any internal protective measures eschewed protection for welfare services wage rates and social services but instead argentina s fragile markets were opened up to unhindered international competition this essentially destroyed argentina s latent industrial sector a deliberate result arising from the self preserving agrarian elite who either populated the military government or were close allies of the regime image the swearing in of jorge rafael videla after argentina s military coup of 1976 accordingly the nationally owned oil firm yacimentos petroliferos fiscales ypf was forced by jorge rafael videla s government to take out huge loans despite the company s solvency and high profit rate that were channelled away from the public domain and into the private hands of military officials and a pre existing oligarchy the strong position of the nationally owned firm and the military regime s distaste for it meant that it was also heavily taxed to alleviate argentina s debt essentially using publicly owned capital to sustain massive borrowing on the part of the dictatorship following this the firm itself became privatised by carlos menem in 1993 removing it from the public domain reducing its employee base from 52 000 to 10 600 and further channelling its profits from the public domain the dictatorship s loan taking was an attempt to maintain the agricultural export economy while channelling the loaned money back into private accounts often in the same us banks from which the loans had come this capital flight whereby 28 billion left the country to private offshore accounts almost as quickly as it arrived was a fundamental technique of amassing huge amounts of private wealth through the use of the collective bodies of the argentine population as collateral for loan taking sue branford and bernardo kucinski term this authoritarian indebtedness in which loans were not used to finance large scale industrial or other projects designed to improve the productivity of the national economy the military dictatorships used them instead to open up domestic markets to imports in order to allow the middle classes a brief and therefore all the more passionate frenzy of consumption the loans raised overseas to finance such orgies of consumption with which authoritarian regimes attempt to maintain the loyalty of their supporters led to an exodus of capital as a strategy of governance the mutually constitutive process of the creation of mass wealth for the government its allies and associated transnational corporations and the suppression of wages and employment levels as a means of reducing the possibility for resistance the creation of living conditions inescapable to their inhabitants functioned exactly as intended for a while the process of debt accumulation so as to amass private wealth is naturally short lived however as upon default after the fall of the dictatorship not only did loans become unobtainable to the argentinian state but the imf conditions imposed were significantly harsher than before as manifested in aggressive conditions of austerity international banks recognised the precariousness of the argentine economy which simply became a body essentially an institutional embodiment of the lower classes of argentina upon which huge interest rates could be imposed that not only maintained the global north south economic power balance but also sought to indefinitely prolong conditions of indebtedness these loans were always amassed as a strategy of profiteering which by its very nature relies on the repercussions of economic policies falling onto the argentinian lower classes who would bear the burden of the debt for decades to come the figures speak for themselves the argentine national debt prior to the dictatorship in 1976 was 7 billion in 1983 following the restoration of democratic rule and the election of raul alfonsin the debt had risen to 50 billion with interest payments on this debt from 1984 1996 amounting to 15 billion alone here a specifically argentinean indebted man slowly emerges from the oppressive conditions of the dictatorship the figure however would come to be solidified from the mid 1980s to 2001 due to the imposition of a repertoire of policies that couze venn understands as the neoliberal reconstitution of the state to serve the market this was never more true than with the election of alfonsin who attempted to control the volatile argentine economy and maintain his concurrent image as a figurehead sold to the people as able to resolve the crisis the many hopes of argentina s workers rested on the new government it is at this point that the imf emerges as the dominant force in the re structuring of the argentine economy and concurrently those of bolivia chile mexico and venezuela placing all the responsibility for the adjustment on the shoulders of the debtor nation as a condition which posits the health of the financial market absolute priority over the well being of ordinary latin americans the imf effectively became a guarantor for the international banks the severity of the austerity conditions that the imf program imposed served to reassure lenders that the debts at the very least would continue to be serviced as the essential mediator the imf re gained huge amounts of power in the debt renegotiations image roberto domi opens the offers for the privatisation of ypf 1993 in response to 1985 s 1000 percent increase in inflation the argentine state in order to meet the imfs criteria for refinancing imposed the austral plan its central tenets were the freezing of both prices and wages the inflation of taxes and the cutting of government spending all measures which had their most immediate impact on argentina s poorest where wage freezes were equal to a cut in wages given the rising rate of inflation the defences of the common citizen continued to weaken by extension this also necessitated a sudden inclusion of argentina s female population into the labour market as opposed to traditionally reproductive labour as was largely the case in argentina as understood by mariarosa dalla costa and selma james this process is always contradictory what began with capitalism was the more intense exploitation of women as women and the possibility at last of their liberation through their inclusion into the labour market as a repercussion of increasing male joblessness known as the added worker effect women s labour became a necessary supplement to the traditional fordist family wage which was a wage given to the male head of the household sufficient to provide for the nuclear family as an accumulation of previously unrecognised labour either financially or in its reproductive capacity traditional women s roles continue to be imposed while becoming extended beyond the domestic as argentinian academic ana dinerstein contends responsibilities simply accumulate on the figure of the female labourer although debt mechanisms as with the broader latin american debt crisis in general are often strikingly similar their ramifications are always heavily contextual contingent on the responses of and impositions upon their subjects the entry of women into the labour market emphatically demonstrates this as with lazzarato understanding of the promise of debt that must be honoured by the debtor there is always a concurrent promise to the pre existing social position of women as the reproductive force of the household in stressing that ebt repayment is part of a standardisation of behavior that requires conformity to the life norms dictated by institutions lazzarato can actually be understood as gesturing towards a maintenance of social responsibility on the part of female labourers both formal and informal intensified by the austerity conditions that were concurrent with the debt repayments in argentina as an argentinian woman active in the road block movement of 2001 explains the women are always more numerous than the men because it is embarrassing for men their first reaction is to hide that they are unemployed where the social norm implies that the breadwinning man must be ashamed of his unemployment of his inability to provide for his family and to fulfil the socio economic role that he understands as germane to his gendered social position there are also repercussions for the female figure who must extend the perimeters of her laboring responsibilities this is evocative of the premise of the second essay of nietzsche s on the genealogy of morality nietzsche in whose footsteps lazzarato would follow formulates the central impetus for the repayment of debt as its moralisation as inducing the most fundamental of all morals guilt in fact he posits that guilt itself has its basis in debt it is the imposition of a social and moral responsibility that finds its basis in the idea that a thing must be burnt in so that it stays in the memory only something that continues to hurt stays in the memory in these terms the female figure has to become both reproductive of the household and economically productive due to the social mechanisms by which her husband would deem himself insufficient the moralisation of work thus bears its burden most heavily on the female body as dalla costa states capital has made men wage slaves then to the degree that it has succeeded in allocating to women in the family and by the same process controlled the flow of women onto the labor market image piqueteros puente pueyrredón buenos aires 26th august 2002 by understanding the conditions of indebtedness as familial we can see how the onus is placed on the female figure to bear responsibility for the emotional conditions of the indebtedness the monetary void it has created as well for the protest against these conditions themselves to quote dalla costa women are of service not only because they carry out labour without a wage and without going on strike but also because they always receive back into the home all those who are periodically expelled from their jobs by economic crisis the family this maternal cradle always ready to help and protect in time of need has in fact the best guarantee that the unemployed do not immediately become a horde of disruptive outsiders the reproductive labour expected of the women of the house continued to be expected during the crisis although now the fordist concept of the family wage had become untenable to swaths of working and middle class people wives and daughters are then expected to supplement this wage with informal work ranging from domestic traditional but paid household jobs in houses other than their own to sexual prostitution this of course is not the subjectivity to which lazzarato is referring as it is not work on or for the self but work to survive the time of the female reproductive labourer is still capitalised on as before but its capitalisation becomes ever more extensive and exploitative in becoming what deleuze and guattari refer to as an apparatus of capture the pressures exerted on the female body on its capacity as a labour producing entity through indebtedness speaks of capital s ability to accumulate labour entirely on its own terms as maria mies outlines hatever the differences between the various production relations through which women are integrated into development or rather subordinated under the global process of capital accumulation one thing is clear this integration does not mean that they become free wage labourers or proletarians in this case it is a distorted fulfilment of demands long held by feminist movements for the gainful employment of women insofar as the burden of production as well as reproduction now falls on the heads of the most subjugated in so far as lazzarato contends that capitalism exercises control over the future since debt obligations allow one to foresee calculate measure and establish equivalence between current and future behaviour he is correct the reservation is that he fails to distinguish between the bodies upon which this control this capture is operative if instead we understand that the social familial and economic pressures exerted on the argentine female body are both specific and severe then we can easily recognise that the framework provided for differential subjectivity is even more restricted and the framework of resistance even more contained and pressurised this is expressed succinctly by argentine female activist luz in a response to the 2001 appearance of protesting female bodies in the public arena we have to work because our husbands are unemployed go to the piquete because we are also unemployed work in the communal kitchen take care of the kids gee we have erupted into political life but at too high a cost and to some extent we withstand that and burden our lomos right i believe that we demand from our bodies a lot more than men do the pertinence of the body in the female experiences of debt is apparent as noted by federici in her contention that the female body has always functioned as a site for the accumulation of capital this view is concurrently held by lazzarato who understands through foucault s notion of biopower that the body has come to be pervaded by the logic of debt his body however is always only an abstract debtor body on whom a series of conditions are projected the ability of the paradigm to purvey the specificity of the female condition in argentina during the debt crisis is limited image asociación madres de plaza de mayo c 1977 in family values melinda cooper posits that neoliberalism has always expounded the contradiction between the individualisation of its subjects and the utilisation of the family as indispensable institution for the propagation of its socially oriented laws we must however look to the physical violence that links the moralising cognitive elements of debt as a form of governance with the tangible bodily ones which lock women more tightly to their role within the nuclear family increasing their vulnerability to the cycles of violence that permeate these local familial spheres the act of taking babies from women who were subsequently murdered during the dictatorship in order to procure children for the elite provides an unambiguous example of how the female body becomes a cypher and vehicle for the reproduction of a political regime this logic is still apparent under neoliberalism but merely buried in the moral and physical imperative to maintain the nuclear family as a means of self preservation they are in mies s terms both manifestations of he common feature of all the production and labour relations which entails the use of structural or direct violence and coercion by which women are exploited and superexploited as has been widely reported in european media outlets domestic violence and femicide often by husbands boyfriends family members continues to be extremely prevalent in argentina currently a woman in argentina is killed every 30 hours or at least 1 800 since 2008 where this is often explained as an expression of underdeveloped gender politics always in relation to the more progressive european ones such views misrecognise the shifting economic conditions that act in direct relation to this this domestic violence occurs disproportionately in the informal slum developments given that unsurprisingly the women with the least autonomy socially and economically are the most harshly affected an essential point here is that neoliberalism in undermining the points of contact between individuals by converting money into the medium of all subject relations and the contiguous dissolution of social bonds leaves women with little means bound economically to a husband father or brother this is true even in the case of women who have entered the labour market following the crisis and thus are earning since in almost all cases the money is channelled back into the family institution also tied to austerity measures that are always present in the servicing and attempted re payment of large national debts is the break up of social services integral here is the shutting down of women s centres or shelters that would act as spaces of refuge for victims of domestic abuse in social movements like the annual women s assembly we can see attempts to address the cycle of violence that binds women to the familial institution the space where violence most commonly takes place beginning in 1986 with 1 000 participants the 2017 assembly meeting saw over 70 000 collectively mobilise the intersection of women s resistance and anti debt movements was found in a number of workshops particularly women and the current global crisis organised by the campaign for the abolition of illegitimate debt cadtm discussing and raising issues of vulture funds and the suspension of public debt repayments until audited with consent from the argentine citizens the workshop was part of a forum that acted to disrupt the status quo which dictates that only certain people can express themselves whilst the rest listen in silence this as attac cadtm writer maria elena saludas states acts to allow the topics discussed belong exclusively to women and to operate on the basis of consensus in order to guarantee that everyone has a say by fostering an intersection of resistance against debt imposed crisis and the movements that seek to resist violence against women the conditions for this violence and their relation to global neoliberal capital can come to be recognised incidents of violence are not as is often represented in popular media isolated or performed by a certain isolated or irregular group of men against women rather the violence itself is absolutely contingent on the imposition of austerity measures which both create the social conditions which allow for this violence of course saying this is not to disavow the agency of those committing these violent acts and undermine any means of resistance or measures by which women can seek refuge from them as stated by feminist activist veronica gago the mothers of the plaza de mayo asociación madres de plaza de mayo also form integral precursors for contemporary women s movement in the confrontation of state led violence since their first march in 1977 the madres have used public forms of street protest as their central means of confronting state terrorism what the appearance of hitherto unrecognised bodies in the form of female protestors on the street provokes is the re development of collective political subjectivities by removing them from the place of the victim they become political subjects and producers of value as has been recognised by contemporary collective ni una menos and mirrored by the rise of women s marches in contemporary argentina image ni una menos protests october 2016 the pertinence of visible bodies expressed in the influence of the madres de plaza mayo has consistently provided a central form of protest in the argentinian context it is less well understood however that women and children make up to 70 percent of the picquateros movements that came to embody the insurrections of 2001 this has even led to a re gendering of the language used to term the protest itself with the introduction of the piquetera this necessitates a subversion of the communitarian element implied by the reliance on the family as lazzarato explains the task of a community or society has first of all been to engender a person capable of promising someone able to stand guarantor for himself in the creditor debtor relationship that is capable of honouring his debt what this form of protest seeks to contest is the constant pressure of austerity to individualise responsibility the collectivisation of bodies is a direct response to corporeally experienced individualisation dinerstein recognises this in the term poner el cuerpo a difficult to translate phrase akin to the english phrase putting the body on the line but more generally addressing the need to use the body as a productive force when the power of speech has been denied this resistant practice and its gender specificity lies in the historical use of women s bodies as a primary source of wealth extraction this informs the need of female picqueteras to protest en masse to dissolve the binding of the female body to private space a place where essential political resistance is nevertheless always taking place and to impose a collective embodied process that connotes togetherness engaging other bodies in the project of creating social change of building power together from the bottom up by resisting the pre defined spaces that a female body is permitted to occupy there is a necessary subversion of traditional understandings of the role of the woman in social protest this can also be thought of in terms of the dissolution of the role of the female body as the holder of all familial responsibility in the construction of a collective female body outside of the domestic sphere we can see the limits of the indebted man being blurred and opened up to space of differentiation the constitution of female collectivity in the public sphere produces a recognition of what gago calls autonomous bodies and sexual dissidents which shifts the social role of women in both its relation to social reproduction and to political protest insofar as they act as a charter for producing subjectivity connecting territories and for building community this simultaneously contests debt as universally individualising force at the same time as it questions the commonly held assumption that women s role outside of the home is merely a supplement to male labour a resurgence of popular austerity measures in 2018 under mauricio macri s tenure as president always tied to the national condition of indebtedness continue however to undermine the efficacy of resistance to its oppressive conditions the conditions of inflation which have been endemic to the fragile argentine economy exacerbated by macri s lifting of currency controls in 2015 lead to a 25 percent increase that year which grew to 40 percent in 2018 this resulted in an attempt by macri s government to secure a 30 billion loan from the imf to shore up the country s currency these conditions are further exacerbated by the vulnerability of the argentine economy to capital flight the relinquishing of currency controls was hoped to allow argentine owned capital to re emerge as investement in the national economy which it failed to do gago s work has been fundamental to mapping this re emerging crisis on both micro and macro levels what she recognises is that the government s economic strategy that seeks to free the market claiming to address rising inflation is part of a wider apparatus that utilises the condition of national and personal indebtedness to retain the status quo a technique of governance that diverts the consequences of economic policy onto the most vulnerable yet this emerges as claims of an expanded inclusivity framed in terms of the availability of cheap forms of consumption financed by the availability of small personal loans the sting of debt is then always two pronged the national debt manifests itself in harsh austerity measures while at the domestic level unemployment leads to a rise in personal or familial indebtedness borne of loan taking as an attempt to curtail the economic effects of these austerity measures within the household the social effects of this gago makes plain explaining the trickle down logic of violence at the bottom rungs of argentine society she explains oday the household has gone from being an apparently pacified place to becoming a battlefield domestic violence does nothing but show scenes of a domesticity that explodes homes as sites of gruesome scenarios rita segato explains how this violence is the effect of other forms of violence the violence that men experience as humiliation in their workplaces in a sort of sequence of interconnected pedagogies here the subjective capture of the male wage earner through the structural violence of unemployment the self perceived emasculation and the collapse of the ability to monopolize the provision of resources on the part of the traditional male head of the household can be understood as providing the conditions in which domestic violence proliferates beyond this we must question the comprehension of these conditions as related to the increasing emergence of female bodies as a political presence in public spaces often the apparent emergence of female bodies into public space is stated as a causal effect of the rise in femicide and violence against women the summer 2018 marches challenging existing anti abortion laws that saw over 1 million women take to the streets provide a prescient example this argument can be understood as a means by which cause is diverted turning the blame back onto women themselves for the national debt servitude that precipitates social chaos and creating a causal link between their political actions and the violence they face therefore removing structural inequality and targeted governemental policy from the equation the ongoing debate on abortion in argentina is of course not unrelated image anti austerity protesters march in buenos aires following the presidential call for the early release of the largest imf loan in history in august 2018 while towers of real estate hyper development puerto madero loom overhead functioning as a manifestation of the reemergence of religion as tool of right or centre right politics to both distract from and support the moralising economic measures that amount to the increasing indebtedness of contemporary argentina the abortion debate also entrenches the connection between government policy and restrictive control over women s bodies it is well understood by feminist activists that despite popular support the pressure of the catholic church on the structures of government had no small part in the rejection of the bill seeking to legalise abortion in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy the argentine pope francis personally called for anti abortion senators to ensnare their collegues while the church itself held a mass for life in buenos aires cathedral in opposition to the bill these debates and rejection of the bill itself represent a further diversion of the causes at hand playing on popular moral issues to rally sentiment for parallel debates on monetary and fiscal policy where the structural conditions of indebtedness and austerity emerge clearly from historical if varied iterations of oppressive governemental policy their moralisation in popular debates whether through the abortion debate or those around argentina s further marketisation which only serves to enrich those who have already accumulated wealth clearly aligns with lazzarato s understanding of the condition of debt as enacting a subjective capture of those most vulnerable to its repercussions we can understand this logic as proliferating in what gago calls the bankerisation of social subsidies usage of the welfare system in these terms becomes feminized reminiscent of the way in which women s responsibility for the family unit is cemented as she notes women s preponderance as debtors is linked to the way in which the moralising effects of debt repayment fall most heavily on the heads of women as extrapolated from federici women s bodies come to replace common spaces as an object of privatisation they are made to bear the emotional responsibility and physical repercussions of wider conditions of national debt borne austerity gago s work on the proliferation of popular economies provides an invaluable insight into the informal economic measures undertaken by argentina s working classes to subvert and contest these conditions with smaller localised economies emerging to create solidarity and security against the precarity inducing measures understanding that the gendering of bodies constructs the object from which capital can be extracted the female body becomes visible as a site of repetitive accumulation particularly within the crises through which capitalism accumulates and redevelops itself in exploring the conditions of women s inclusion into the labour market imposed by crisis we have seen how the female body continues to be framed as ancillary to that of the male but it is urgent to speculate beyond this mere comprehension of the relations of bodies the individualisation of the female that is continuous with this by which a woman always attached to a man becomes alienated from all others in that attachment is a division by which capital maintains its balance of power and subjugates female labour in both reproductive and economic terms to market logics that are free to dispel it at whim movements such as the national women s assembly in argentina as well as the recognition that argentine women have always been a fundamental element in political protest offer ways to rethink the connections between bodies in particular this helps forge assemblages in which female bodies come to recognise their relationship to others beyond patriarchal ties or those of the nuclear family it is these fundamental reconceptualisations that gesture towards an expansion of subjectivities that allow for the differential conditions of encounter beyond those prescribed by a still patriarchal and dominating global capitalism george jepson is an independent writer and researcher currently exploring the spatial conditions of financialised subjectivities

use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions creating collateral security packages types of collateral what types of collateral and security interests are available all present and after acquired property interests of a project company can be used as collateral generally speaking in the united states the types of collateral can be divided into real property and personal property security interests in a wide range of personal property interests such as contracts licences equipment receivables bank accounts securities and general intangibles as well as the cash flow resulting from any of the above are governed by a set of relatively uniform rules across all states the uniform commercial code ucc a type of personal property that may serve as collateral and may be of particular interest to lenders are equity interests whether certificated or not in the project company which provides lenders a practical means of enforcing on their collateral package security interests in real property interests such as fee simple interests leasehold interests and easements are usually created through mortgages or deeds of trust governed by real estate laws that may be subject to a somewhat greater degree of variation from state to state collateral perfecting how is a security interest in each type of collateral perfected and how is its priority established are any fees taxes or other charges payable to perfect a security interest and if so are there lawful techniques to minimise them may a corporate entity in the capacity of agent or trustee hold collateral on behalf of the project lenders as the secured party is it necessary for the security agent and trustee to hold any licences to hold or enforce such security the ucc sets forth the rules for the creation perfection and enforcement of most security interests over personal property security interests over real property must be created and perfected in accordance with the laws of the state in which the real property is situated most personal property security interests that are subject to the ucc can be perfected by filing a financing statement indicating the names of the debtor and the secured party and describing the collateral in reasonable detail as to permit its identification in the state in which the debtor is organised or with respect to some types of debtor where their principal office is located for debtors organised outside the united states ucc financing statements may be filed with the central filing office for the district of columbia however for some types of collateral the secured parties must obtain control or possession thereof in order to perfect their security interest perfection by control is required for example for deposit accounts generally perfection through control over deposit accounts is achieved through an account control agreement that grants the secured party the right to control the applicable account to the exclusion of the debtor although this right is often limited to the period during which an event of default has occurred and is continuing further for certain types of personal property perfection may be achieved in more than one way security interests in real property are perfected by filing a mortgage or deed of trust in the state where the property is located typically a mortgage instrument must describe the property and debt and identify both the mortgagee and mortgagor priority is generally established by the party that is first in time to perfect a security interest over collateral however where perfection by a means other than filing is permitted the chosen form of perfection may affect the priority of the security interest a party having control of such collateral will generally have priority over a party that has only made a filing regardless of when the relevant filing was made there are also certain types of liens that are given priority as a matter of law such as mechanic s liens and certain tax liens the fees for filing ucc financing statements vary from state to state but are generally not significant in nature fees associated with filing a mortgage instrument also depend on the laws of the relevant state and are often significant collateral agents or trustees who are typically but not necessarily banks are commonly used to hold collateral on behalf of the project lenders as the secured parties in the event of a bankruptcy of a collateral agent or trustee if the collateral agency arrangement has been properly documented the collateral held by such agent or trustee should be segregated and not be deemed part of the estate assuring absence of liens how can a creditor assure itself as to the absence of liens with priority to the creditor s lien there is no centralised national registry of mortgages or security interests in personal property lenders typically assure themselves as to the absence of liens by conducting searches of existing ucc filings tax liens judgments and insolvency proceedings in all applicable jurisdictions there are private companies that specialise in conducting such searches on behalf of lenders and the lenders in project financings typically have such searches conducted or updated as close as possible to the proposed closing date to the extent a search reveals an existing lien additional due diligence is necessary in order to determine the nature and extent of the underlying secured obligation and whether the lien has been terminated or otherwise ceased to be effective in respect of real property lenders typically rely on both lien searches and title insurance to provide assurances of the priority of their lien enforcing collateral rights outside the context of a bankruptcy proceeding what steps should a project lender take to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral financing documents typically include an express set of non exclusive remedies available to the secured parties in case an event of default occurs article 9 part 6 of the ucc sets out statutory remedies that are available to secured parties whether or not listed in the applicable financing documents these statutory remedies include the right to collect on collateral such as accounts receivables the right to repossess collateral the right to sell or dispose of collateral and the right to retain collateral in total or partial satisfaction of the debt there are limitations on the right of lenders to exercise statutory remedies set forth in the ucc for example although the ucc permits dispositions of collateral through both public and private sales secured parties must provide notice to the debtor and other secured parties before disposing of collateral and secured parties are prohibited from purchasing their collateral through a private sale unless there is a recognised market for such collateral or it is the subject of a widely distributed price quotation enforcement of security interests in real property is governed by state laws the two most common methods of enforcement are judicial and non judicial foreclosure many states require judicial foreclosure whereby a local court issues a judgment ordering that the real property must be sold at a public auction and that the proceeds thereof be applied to satisfaction of the secured debt in states that allow non judicial foreclosure a lender may be able to sell the real property collateral in a private sale without commencing judicial proceedings however notice periods will generally apply and a non judicial foreclosure will generally be permitted only where the mortgage instrument includes a clause giving the lender the power of sale outside judicial proceedings in some states debtors who have defaulted on a mortgage may have the right to redeem a property that is subject to foreclosure proceedings either by repaying the lender all amounts owed including interest and costs prior to the completion of a foreclosure proceedings or where permitted by statute by paying the price paid for the real property in the foreclosure proceedings within a specified period following the completion of foreclosure proceedings enforcing collateral rights following bankruptcy how does a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the project company affect the ability of a project lender to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral are there any preference periods clawback rights or other preferential creditors rights eg tax debts employees claims with respect to the collateral what entities are excluded from bankruptcy proceedings and what legislation applies to them what processes other than court proceedings are available to seize the assets of the project company in an enforcement liquidation and reorganisation proceedings in the united states are governed by chapters 7 and 11 respectively of the us bankruptcy code generally the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings under the us bankruptcy code will result in an automatic stay that will pre empt any other enforcement actions including foreclosure proceedings under state law lenders can seek relief from the automatic stay in order to take specific actions against a debtor with the approval of the us bankruptcy court security interests granted or perfected within 90 days of a bankruptcy or one year if granted to an insider may be subject to avoidance if they are deemed preferential transfers that would enable the secured creditor to recover more than it would have received through the proceeds of a liquidation transfers made within a two year look back period prior to a bankruptcy may be classified as fraudulent transfers and may be subject to clawback if certain facts can be established including that the company was insolvent at the time of the transfer was rendered insolvent by the transfer or the intent of the transfer was to defraud creditors the claims of certain involuntary creditors such as employees and taxing authorities may be given preferential treatment in bankruptcy proceedings foreign creditors are given equal treatment to us creditors under the us bankruptcy code foreign exchange and withholding tax issues restrictions controls fees and taxes what are the restrictions controls fees taxes or other charges on foreign currency exchange the united states does not currently impose exchange controls or taxes on the exchange of foreign currency the federal government however monitors large foreign exchanges and requires the persons involved in such transactions to make full and accurate disclosures of such transactions moreover persons involved in such transactions should consult the rules of the office of foreign assets control which impose economic and trade sanctions in certain instances investment returns what are the restrictions controls fees and taxes on remittances of investment returns or payments of principal interest or premiums on loans or bonds to parties in other jurisdictions foreign investors may generally remit profits abroad however payments and remittances to parties in certain countries or to certain specific companies or individuals may be restricted pursuant to sanctions imposed by the treasury department dividends interest royalties and service fees may be subject to tax withholding at a rate of 30 per cent unless certain conditions are satisfied or certain exemptions such as treaty exemptions apply foreign earnings must project companies repatriate foreign earnings if so must they be converted to local currency and what further restrictions exist over their use us companies are not required to repatriate foreign earnings however profits realised in a foreign country may still be subject to taxation by the united states may project companies establish and maintain foreign currency accounts in other jurisdictions and locally although the united states does not prohibit offshore accounts such accounts may still be subject to taxation domestically the internal revenue service requires us persons with a financial interest in or signature authority over a foreign financial account with funds exceeding us 10 000 to report such holdings by the end of june every year accounts of non us entities controlled by a us company may also need to file a report of foreign bank and financial accounts fbar a filing is required if the funds in foreign financial accounts exceeded the irs threshold at any point during the calendar year and non compliance can result in significant penalties there is no prohibition on local banks accepting deposits and holding deposit accounts in foreign currency however it is not very common to find a project company in the us opening any such account foreign investment issues investment restrictions what restrictions fees and taxes exist on foreign investment in or ownership of a project and related companies do the restrictions also apply to foreign investors or creditors in the event of foreclosure on the project and related companies are there any bilateral investment treaties with key nation states or other international treaties that may afford relief from such restrictions would such activities require registration with any government authority the us generally places very few restrictions on foreign investment however some restrictions do apply to the ownership of certain natural resources and production facilities and certain assets that are deemed material for national security for example deposits of certain natural resources including oil oil shale coal and gas and lands containing such deposits that are owned by the united states may only be sold to us citizens or us entities similarly licences for the construction and operation of facilities for the development transmission or utilisation of power on land controlled by the federal government may only be issued to us citizens or us corporations foreign investment or ownership in a project may also be subject to national security based reviews and restrictions under the foreign investment and national security act of 2007 the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius holds the power of review for transactions involving foreign investment or control over a us business that may have an impact on national security cfius can recommend to the president of the united states to suspend block or renegotiate such a transaction cfius has the authority to review a transaction where a change of control would result from foreclosure the us is party to some free trade agreements that provide protections to foreign investors including multilateral treaties such as the north american free trade agreement and the dominican republic central american free trade agreement and bilateral free trade agreements with countries such as chile colombia peru singapore and south korea generally registration with a government authority is not required for a foreign investor to benefit from these treaties insurance restrictions what restrictions fees and taxes exist on insurance policies over project assets provided or guaranteed by foreign insurance companies may such policies be payable to foreign secured creditors while there are no general restrictions on obtaining insurance policies issued or guaranteed by foreign insurance companies certain restrictions conditions and tax implications may apply to the issuance of such policies for example a federal excise tax may be levied on the premiums paid to foreign insurance companies for certain types of insurance and reinsurance coverage in addition many states provide certain guarantees for insurance policies issued by insurers that meet state regulatory requirements and these guarantees may not be available for insurance policies issued by foreign insurance companies that are not deemed admitted to conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction worker restrictions what restrictions exist on bringing in foreign workers technicians or executives to work on a project us companies must apply for work authorisation for foreign workers under the immigration reform and control act of 1986 and must verify each worker s immigration status that permits him or her to lawfully work in the united states and maintain specified employment documentation for each new foreign national hire employers may sponsor foreign workers for a number of temporary visa categories eligibility for which will depend on the experience and qualifications of the worker some of the free trade agreements entered into by the united states create special categories of workers that may apply for special visa categories that allow them to work in the united states equipment restrictions what restrictions exist on the importation of project equipment all imported equipment or products must be declared with the us customs and border protection agency customs duties or tariffs apply but can in some cases be reduced or eliminated in accordance with the relevant trade agreement that governs the trade relationship with the exporting country the office of foreign assets control administers and enforces import restrictions and bans on a number of countries and persons nationalisation laws what laws exist regarding the nationalisation or expropriation of project companies and assets are any forms of investment specially protected the united states government or any state government may seize private property without consent provided that the private property owner receives just compensation under the doctrine of eminent domain while the power of eminent domain is limited by the takings clause of the fifth amendment and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution the us supreme court has expanded the definition of public use regarding eminent domain to allow private development of projects that serve a public purpose in addition to the protections provided by the fifth amendment many multilateral and bilateral investment treaties including free trade agreements include expropriation provisions that offer protections to foreign investors fiscal treatment of foreign investment incentives what tax incentives or other incentives are provided preferentially to foreign investors or creditors what taxes apply to foreign investments loans mortgages or other security documents either for the purposes of effectiveness or registration there are few tax incentives or other incentives provided preferentially to foreign investors or creditors while no federal taxes apply to loans mortgages or other security documents for the purposes of effectiveness or registration some states do levy taxes on security documents particularly mortgages for such purposes government authorities relevant authorities what are the relevant government agencies or departments with authority over projects in the typical project sectors what is the nature and extent of their authority what is the history of state ownership in these sectors us federal agencies share responsibility with state and in some cases local agencies for regulating projects the agencies with authority to regulate a project will depend on the jurisdiction and the industry involved natural resources transportation energy and telecommunications are regulated by federal agencies such as the us department of energy the us department of transportation the environmental protection agency the federal communications commission and the federal energy regulatory commission the nature and extent of their authority rests on the constitution federal statutes state statutes and what is known as chevron deference ie a principle of administrative law that requires courts to defer to the reasonable interpretation of statutes made by the agency in charge of enforcing them federal statutes federal regulations state statutes state regulations and case law have shaped the nature and extent of the authority of the relevant federal agencies the federal government and state governments have held varying levels of ownership in the infrastructure sector particularly as it relates to energy and transportation projects over time in various forms through direct ownership or control public corporations or joint ventures regulation of natural resources titles who has title to natural resources what rights may private parties acquire to these resources and what obligations does the holder have may foreign parties acquire such rights the federal government state governments and private citizens may all hold title and rights to land and the oil gas and minerals under it such title and rights are governed principally by state law and the treatment varies from state to state title to the surface rights over a parcel of land does not necessarily imply ownership of all natural resources below the surface of such land as surface rights and mineral rights are treated as separate legal estates in many states the obligations imposed on the holder of a mineral estate will vary depending on the jurisdiction and may depend on whether the mineral estate or the surface estate is considered the dominant estate in some states mineral rights may be deemed to be abandoned if they are not developed within a certain time period there are certain restrictions on the foreign ownership of natural resources for example deposits of oil gas and many types of minerals and lands owned by the united states that contain such deposits may only be acquired by us citizens or us entities native american nations are classified as domestic dependent nations meaning that they exercise qualified sovereignty over their tribal lands and the natural resources associated with such lands tribal agreements with outside entities are governed by both state and federal law us case law has gradually sharpened the scope of tribal sovereignty accordingly rights to natural resources within tribal lands may be affected by the rights of native american nations royalties and taxes what royalties and taxes are payable on the extraction of natural resources and are they revenue or profit based the us federal government does not impose any blanket taxation on the extraction of natural resources though there is a federal excise tax applicable to the production of coal the federal government does impose fixed royalties on the natural resources extracted under federal leases which have varied in amount over time royalties imposed under state leases will vary depending on the resource and the jurisdiction income taxes or corporate taxes may also apply to profits made from the extraction of natural resources export restrictions what restrictions fees or taxes exist on the export of natural resources exports of natural resources usually require prior approval from the relevant federal regulatory agency for example the department of energy must approve exports of natural gas the united states does not tax exports generally as the supreme court has found export taxes to be unconstitutional legal issues of general application government permission what government approvals are required for typical project finance transactions what fees and other charges apply the government approvals required for a project finance transaction will depend on the industry involved and the jurisdiction of the project typically project finance transactions will require approvals on the federal state and local level for example electric power projects are regulated at the federal level by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc as well as at the state level ferc is responsible for regulating all wholesale sales of electric power and state authorities have responsibility for regulating electric power generation transmission and distribution assets for example to the extent an interconnection agreement is not fully consistent with an approved tariff the non conforming interconnection agreement must be approved by ferc environmental approvals at the federal state and local level depending on the characteristics of the project will typically be required and they are discussed further below depending on where the project is located a significant number of local construction and operating permits may be required based on local ordinances also as previously mentioned depending on the type of infrastructure cfius clearance may be required registration of financing must any of the financing or project documents be registered or filed with any government authority or otherwise comply with legal formalities to be valid or enforceable pursuant to article 9 of the uniform commercial code security over most types of personal property must be perfected through filing a ucc financing statement in the relevant jurisdiction mortgages or deeds of trust over real property must be recorded in the jurisdiction where the real property is situated as a general matter with the exception of certain real estate documents which often must be notarised and include certain language required by the local filing office the financing and project documents are not subject to legal formalities such as notarisation or apostillation arbitration awards how are international arbitration contractual provisions and awards recognised by local courts is the jurisdiction a member of the icsid convention or other prominent dispute resolution conventions are any types of disputes not arbitrable are any types of disputes subject to automatic domestic arbitration the us is a member of the icsid convention the new york convention and the panama convention the federal arbitration act faa implements the new york convention and the panama convention and promotes arbitration if the arbitration is of a commercial nature a foreign party or property situated abroad is involved or there is some reasonable relationship with a foreign state the international arbitration provisions of the faa will apply if these conditions are not met the faa s domestic arbitration provisions will apply any party to an arbitration that is subject to these conventions may apply to the district court of the united states for an order confirming the award as against any other party as long as it is brought within three years after the arbitral award is made the district courts having jurisdiction over the enforcement of an arbitration award will be those in which an action could be brought except for the arbitration agreement or those in the district and division that embraces the seat of the arbitration if such seat is within the united states the court should confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the applicable convention access to arbitration is not available in certain criminal and family law matters in disputes where civil penalties may apply and in certain employment and civil rights matters law governing agreements which jurisdiction s law typically governs project agreements which jurisdiction s law typically governs financing agreements which matters are governed by domestic law it is typical for project agreements to be governed either by the laws of the state in which the project is situated or by new york law in particular there are many states that consider certain provisions under laws applicable to construction contracts including terms of payments or warranties to be matters of public policy therefore the law of the state where the project is located may override a choice of law in a construction contract given the extensive experience of new york courts in hearing cases involving financing agreements and the well established case law in this area financing agreements are most often governed by new york law security documents such as mortgages may be required to be governed by the law in which the secured property is located in connection with personal property although a security interest could be created by the law of any state subject to applicable conflict of laws rules in the case of possessory security interests and security interests in negotiable documents goods instruments money tangible chattel paper or as extracted collateral perfection of the security interest may be required to be done in accordance with the laws of the state where the collateral or the wellhead or minehead is located submission to foreign jurisdiction is a submission to a foreign jurisdiction and a waiver of immunity effective and enforceable the submission to a foreign jurisdiction is generally enforceable waivers of sovereign immunity are also enforceable pursuant to the foreign sovereign immunities act environmental health and safety laws applicable regulations what laws or regulations apply to typical project sectors what regulatory bodies administer those laws a typical project will be subject to regulations at the federal state and local level with each jurisdiction able to adopt its own regulations as long as they do not conflict with those of the level above certain projects including those receiving funds from federal programmes such as the title xvii loan guarantee program of the us department of energy or the transportation infrastructure finance and innovation act of 1998 tifia loan program of the us department of transportation may be subject to performance of an environmental assessment under the national environmental policy act projects may also be subject to various statutes primarily administered by the environmental protection agency such as the clean air act the clean water act the safe drinking water act the endangered species act the resource conservation and recovery act the toxic substances control act and the oil pollution act many federal environmental laws also delegate administration and enforcement responsibilities to state agencies and additional state and local regulations may apply project companies principal business structures what are the principal business structures of project companies what are the principal sources of financing available to project companies project companies are typically formed as special purpose vehicles that are structured to be bankruptcy remote and most commonly take the form of limited liability companies and limited partnerships so that they can elect to be non taxable entities it is common for a project company to be formed as a joint venture between two or more entities there are multiple sources of financing available for project companies and projects are often financed through multiple sources bilateral or syndicated commercial bank loans are a major source of financing but financing may also be available from a variety of other sources including private equity investors the term loan b market or through the issuance of debt or equity securities which are typically structured as rule 144a regulation s project bonds or 4 a 2 private placements financing for certain projects may also be available through government programmes such as the us department of energy s loan guarantee program or various state administered clean energy funds and municipal bond programmes in addition private activity bonds may be issued by a government vehicle that on lends the bond proceeds to the project private activity bonds may be tax free if certain conditions are satisfied subject to satisfaction of other conditions such tax treatment is available for certain surface transportation projects for example public private partnership legislation applicable legislation has ppp enabling legislation been enacted and if so at what level of government and is the legislation industry specific a majority of states and puerto rico now have some form of ppp enabling legislation and a number of the states that do not have ppp enabling legislation have ppp bills in various stages of legislative consideration however there is a substantial lack of uniformity in ppp laws from state to state in some cases the enabling legislation is industry specific most commonly relating to transportation and in others it grants general authority to pursue a ppp transaction some agencies of the federal government such as the national park service the us department of veterans affairs and the postal service have entered into some ppp projects based on authority granted in specific statutes more importantly the federal government has recently enacted or announced a number of initiatives to encourage the use of ppps in transportation infrastructure projects other sectors including the authorisation of the water infrastructure finance and innovation authority and the continued funding of the loan programmes under tifia and the railroad rehabilitation improvement financing program ppp limitations legal limitations what if any are the practical and legal limitations on ppp transactions practical and legal limitations vary by state especially because there are still a number of states without any ppp enabling legislation currently long review periods for acquisition of environmental approvals have significantly delayed the procurement of many projects this seems particularly due to activism by local communities and environmental activists authorities seeking to procure projects under a ppp model have become very careful about compliance with environmental approval processes and expanded community outreach which has caused some delays in awarding projects ppp transactions significant transactions what have been the most significant ppp transactions completed to date in your jurisdiction some of the significant ppp transactions that have recently been completed in the us include the sale and refinancing of the chicago skyway in illinois the pennsylvania rapid bridge replacement project the purple line light rail project in maryland the laguardia central terminal building replacement project in new york the denver airport great hall ohio state university energy project virginia outside the beltway i 66 project the colorado i 70 east project and the lax automated people mover update trends update trends updates and trends project finance activity by loan volume in the united states has continued to grow over the long term reflecting a return to the market of traditional project finance lenders particularly european commercial banks and an increased interest by more recent entrants such as private equity debt funds and an increased participation by development banks activity during 2017 in terms of amount of debt increased by nearly 14 billion compared with 2016 reflecting significant liquidity in the market as in previous years the greater portion of the projects that came to the market fell within the power and oil and gas sectors also similarly to the previous year a substantial majority of the project financing transactions that closed during 2017 in the united states were for new construction refinancing of existing projects saw a lower volume as many projects already benefited from low borrowing costs available during prior years reversing what had been a trend in the loan markets in recent years fewer lenders were willing to finance merchant power projects in addition to financing for construction of new projects developers continued to look for alternative ways to realise on their investments and redeploy capital as a significant number of projects reached a mature stage prior to the change in administration the federal government had implemented policies and actions that would incentivise project finance activity in the near and medium term the environmental protection agency released the clean power plan proposal which aims at cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent by 2030 from 2005 levels setting specific goals that states must meet however enforcement of the clean power plan has been delayed by litigation and under the current administration the environmental protection agency is seeking to repeal the rule the us department of energy has issued a significant number of licences authorising us companies to export liquid natural gas in 2015 the us department of energy also issued a new title xvii loan guarantee solicitation for applications for the financing of innovative renewable energy and energy efficiency projects located in the united states congress passed the water infrastructure finance and innovation act that creates a low interest rate loan programme to partially fund water and waste water infrastructure projects in september 2015 the federal government introduced the build america transportation investment center which serves as a national p3 resource for states municipalities and project sponsors in addition a number of us states have also created centres of excellence committees and similar resources for ppps in december 2015 a long term surface transportation bill the fixing america s surface transportation act was finally adopted after more than 30 short term extensions had been approved this legislation authorises funding of road bridge and mass transit projects through 2020 in 2016 the federal government created the build america bureau to serve as the single point of contact and coordination for states municipalities and project sponsors looking to explore ways to access private capital in ppps the build america bureau combines the tifia and railroad rehabilitation and improvement financing loan programmes private activity bonds and the infrastructure for rebuilding america formerly fostering advancements in shipping and transportation for the long term achievement of national efficiencies grant programme under a single agency these actions create the opportunity to bring more projects to the market whether by improving the terms on which they can be financed or by facilitating new infrastructure development the current administration has put forward a plan to invest up to 200 billion dollars in federal funds in infrastructure with the goal of stimulating at least 1 3 trillion dollars in new investment by states local government and private investors over the next 10 years a number of practical questions have been raised about the plan and in any event it is considered unlikely that congress will implement it therefore it is unclear whether existing incentives will continue in the longer term and what if any new incentives will be put in place the generally positive developments described above do not mean that there are no challenges for the project finance market the continuing low oil prices which have caused and may continue to cause some projects to no longer be financeable is perhaps one of the most salient ones particularly considering that a larger portion of the project finance activity in recent times has been precisely in the oil and gas sector however companies facing distress as a result of such lower prices may become attractive targets developing a market for acquisition and refinancing of existing projects some natural gas pipeline projects have been delayed or halted due to regulatory and judicial challenges the full impact of the recent tax reform bill and tariffs imposed on among others imported steel and aluminium and solar panels remains to be seen finally the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union the terms of which are currently being negotiated and the currency stock and debt market disruptions that may be created by it even if they result to be brief may require some european lenders to reassess investment strategies in the light of capital requirements and other regulatory considerations as they consider relocation of their operations in summary the pipelines of new projects and projects achieving maturity together with the opportunities created by legacy policy and the liquidity available in the market appear to ensure a healthy near future for project financing in the united states
use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions creating collateral security packages types of collateral what types of collateral and security interests are available there are four basic categories of security interest under english law these are mortgages charges pledges and liens charges and mortgages are generally the most important categories of security interest in a project finance context it should be noted that charge is sometimes used colloquially as a generic reference to security interests under the laws of england and wales often a composite security agreement is used in england and wales commonly known as a debenture when granted by a corporate and both present and future liabilities of a corporate chargor can be secured under a debenture and a security interest taken over both the chargor s present and future assets for public policy reasons it is generally considered impossible to take a charge over all the assets of an individual a security agent or trustee is often the chargee ie the party with the benefit of the charge in place of the lenders mortgages and charges of land are subject to special rules but these are outside the scope of this answer charges a charge is an encumbrance on an asset that does not transfer title to that asset but rather appropriates the asset to the discharge of the relevant obligations a charge is a security interest over specified assets or classes of assets of the chargor as security for the performance of the particular obligations of the borrower that have been secured usually repayment of the debt owed to the lender provided that in the case of corporate third parties issues such as corporate benefit and transactions at an under value have been dealt with charges and other forms of security may be granted by that third party there are two types of charge fixed and floating a fixed charge attaches immediately to the specified assets eg key assets as described in the debenture fixed charges are generally preferable to floating charges as they confer greater priority in an insolvency scenario further below as the chargee is not taking possession of the property it will want to both prevent the chargor from disposing of the assets subject to the charge and to oblige the chargor to maintain the value of the assets these obligations should be contained in the debenture or other finance documents a floating charge capable of being granted by incorporated entities such as companies and limited partnerships but not generally speaking individuals is a charge over a specified class of assets often identified by a generic description as with many other types of finance under english law a floating charge often primarily serves a dual purpose to provide a security interest over assets of the chargor that may inherently fluctuate for example stock and to provide a catch all backstop security interest for example where the formalities of creating another security interest are not properly completed or the assets in question are not subject to a fixed charge in a project finance context a properly drafted floating charge over all or substantially all of the chargor s assets may also mean that the chargee is deemed a qualifying floating charge holder and so can use the administrative receiver procedure further below in contrast to a fixed charge a floating charge only attaches to the assets in question on crystallisation when it becomes a fixed charge at the point of crystallisation this may happen automatically by operation of law for example on the occurrence of certain insolvency related events however accepted practice including both for greater certainty and to expand the crystallisation events by agreement between the parties is that a list of crystallisation events will be included in the debenture these events often include on the giving of notice by the chargee the occurrence of specified and prohibited actions and of insolvency related events finally on charges it should be noted that control is a key determinant and regardless of whether a charge is described as fixed or floating in the debenture if the chargee has insufficient control of a charged asset then it is likely that such charge may be redesignated by the courts to be a floating charge it is possible that the risk of redesignation extends beyond security interests expressed to be charges and may affect other forms of security interest however expressed mortgages a mortgage is a security interest securing the performance of particular obligations which involves the transfer of title in an asset on the condition express or implied that such title will be transferred back on the performance of the relevant obligations mortgages can either be legal or equitable with a legal mortgage transferring legal title to the asset subject to the completion of any formalities whereas an equitable mortgage transfers beneficial title in the asset equitable mortgages arise either where the formalities necessary to create a legal mortgage have not been complied with and legal title has therefore not been transferred the mortgage intends to create a legal mortgage at some point in the future or the asset that is being secured is only recognised in equity ie there is no ability to have legal title in the asset eg beneficial ownership of assets in a trust generally mortgages over choses in action rights over assets that can only be enforced by action such as book debts and contractual rights are taken by way of assignment subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions an assignment can be legal allowing the chargee to sue the third party in the chargee s own name without having to join the chargor in any action or the assignment can be equitable where the conditions for a legal assignment are not fulfilled pledges a pledge is a form of security interest for a debt where the creditor takes possession of an asset hence only where it is possible to take possession of an asset can that asset be pledged for intangible assets as opposed to tangible movable assets these can be pledged if title to the asset can be transferred by delivery of a document of title constructive delivery for example delivery of keys to a property where the asset is situated may also validly give effect to a pledge liens a lien is generally a right to retain possession of another s asset until a debt owed to that person is discharged the expression is also used to cover similar rights liens often arise by operation of law and are normally not of relevance in a project finance context quasi security whereas a security interest is a right granted over a chargor s assets to secure performance of obligations and which may provide an enhanced position for the chargee in the event of the debtor s insolvency quasi security is the collective term for financial actions that seek to improve the creditor s position on debtor insolvency without actually creating a security interest types of quasi security include negative pledges finance leasing set off and retention of title collateral perfecting how is a security interest in each type of collateral perfected and how is its priority established are any fees taxes or other charges payable to perfect a security interest and if so are there lawful techniques to minimise them may a corporate entity in the capacity of agent or trustee hold collateral on behalf of the project lenders as the secured party is it necessary for the security agent and trustee to hold any licences to hold or enforce such security perfection perfection occurs through registration and delivery of possession of the asset or notice depending on the type of security interest with very limited exceptions charges and mortgages created by a company or limited liability partnership incorporated in the uk regardless of the governing law of that charge must be registered with the jurisdiction s registrar of companies companies house within 21 days from the date of the creation of the security interest otherwise the security interest will be void against a liquidator administrator or creditor and the debt secured by that charge becomes payable immediately while registration is not technically mandatory there are significant negative consequences to not registering a security interest registration involves providing companies house with a completed registration form usually an mr01 a certified copy of the relevant security document and a small registration fee it is also possible to register charges and mortgages online and the fee is reduced security interests over some assets such as land intellectual property rights ships and aircraft are registrable in specialist registers where registration fees apply and priority is generally established by the order of such registration where a security assignment occurs or a security interest is created over an equitable interest the security interest needs to be perfected by providing the third party with notice while pledges are not strictly speaking registrable though a cautious approach is recommended pledges are perfected by delivery of the asset priority subject to the provisions of insolvency law and certain other qualifications the priority of security interests is broadly as follows depending on the nature of the asset security interests in an asset have priority in order of the date of their creation or the date of notice or the date of registration special rules may apply to tacking and further advances however legal interests take priority over earlier equitable interests including floating charges if the later legal interest is created in good faith without notice of the earlier equitable interest and value is provided in return for the interest and fixed charges take priority over floating charges even if the floating charge was created earlier unless the floating charge contains a negative pledge further it should be noted that it is often the case that secured creditors will enter into intercreditor or priority agreements that may either reinforce or contractually amend the priority position regulating their respective security interests security trusts it is possible and common for a security agent or trustee to hold security interests on behalf of the project lenders and often also themselves as security for their fees subject to them having the capacity to act under their own constitutional documents security agents and trustees do not have to hold any licence specifically to hold or enforce security unlike many civil law jurisdictions where trusts are not recognised and a parallel debt structure may be used to effect the security trust concept the jurisdiction recognises trusts and security trusts are broadly not complicated structures assuring absence of liens how can a creditor assure itself as to the absence of liens with priority to the creditor s lien liens are not registrable under the companies act 2006 and often arise by the operation of common law or statute making it difficult to easily ascertain priority a creditor could review the register of the company in question at companies house or if applicable the relevant specialist asset register for evidence of any contractual lien that had been registered but inherently this would not provide a definitive answer however by their nature liens are not normally a significant aspect of taking security in a project finance context enforcing collateral rights outside the context of a bankruptcy proceeding what steps should a project lender take to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral in the uk corporate bankruptcy is known as insolvency outside of terminal insolvency proceedings ie liquidation or winding up of the debtor as a preliminary step to potentially enforcing its rights and to avoid unintentionally waiving a breach of any finance document a project lender should explicitly reserve its ability to rely on and exercise its rights under any finance document to the extent there is no clear intention to compromise those rights in all communications with the debtor or its professional advisers the rules on corporate insolvency are largely derived from the insolvency act 1986 as amended and the insolvency rules 2016 and corporate insolvency turns on the concept of an inability of the debtor to pay its debts as determined by section 123 of the insolvency act 1986 in terms of non terminal insolvency proceedings ie self help or rescue mechanisms though these procedures often eventually transition to liquidation a number of mechanisms are available of which three key procedures in a project finance context are administration administrative receivership and receivership administration is a procedure whereby the primary objective is to save the debtor as a going concern if that is not possible the secondary objective is to achieve a better result for the company s creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up without first being in administration the final objective if neither primary nor secondary objectives can be achieved is to realise property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors when a company goes into administration it benefits from a statutory moratorium on creditor action appointment of an administrator may be by application to the court or more likely by the directors or a qualifying floating charge holder using the out of court route the project lender may therefore have the ability to recover monies owing through the debtor being placed into administration administrative receivership is potentially a more beneficial avenue for recovery for a secured project lender holding a qualifying floating charge than administration because it may be a quicker less expensive process while the administrative receiver s role is to realise assets to repay the lender or is to repay the secured debt of the charge holder while not generally available where the floating charge was created after 15 september 2003 there is a project finance exception to this rule subject to the project in question fulfilling the necessary criteria the charge holder can appoint an administrative receiver who can run the business or dispose of assets or the business itself to satisfy the debt contrasting the objectives of administration and administrative receivership the latter may arguably be more beneficial to a project lender though it will depend on the exact circumstances subject to the completion of certain formalities including the observance of notice or standstill periods the ability of a chargee to appoint a receiver may arise at common law or under statute when the debt secured becomes due ie the power of sale arises it is however often preferable and accepted practice including to avoid the standstill periods that the receiver is appointed under the terms of the debenture the receiver can then sell debtor assets to satisfy the debt enforcing collateral rights following bankruptcy how does a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the project company affect the ability of a project lender to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral are there any preference periods clawback rights or other preferential creditors rights eg tax debts employees claims with respect to the collateral what entities are excluded from bankruptcy proceedings and what legislation applies to them what processes other than court proceedings are available to seize the assets of the project company in an enforcement administration involves a moratorium that prevents a project lender from enforcing its rights over collateral without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court an administrator can only sell any assets over which the project lender has a fixed charge with the prior approval of the fixed charge holder or of the court though it can dispose of assets subject to a floating charge without the consent of the holder of that charge while initially non terminal in practice a company in administration may eventually be placed into terminal bankruptcy proceedings liquidation for compulsory liquidations there is also an automatic stay subject to the leave of the court which prevents a project lender enforcing its rights over collateral through court proceedings though it does not prevent a project lender from appointing a receiver or administrative receiver if it has the right to do so in both administration and liquidation the proceeds from the disposal of assets will be distributed to creditors in the order of their priority and subject to the terms of any subordination or intercreditor agreement debts with preferential status include contributions to occupational and state pension schemes certain employee claims for unpaid wages and salary holiday pay eu levies on coal and steel production and monies owed to or deposits protected under the financial services compensation scheme the amount available to the preferential creditors is however recovered from the disposal of assets not subject to a fixed charge and after satisfaction of the expenses of the administration or liquidation on the basis that a project lender will usually seek to recover debts under fixed charges in the first instance these preferential creditors may not have an impact on the project lender s recovery in addition to the expenses of the administration or liquidation and preferential creditors there is also a statutory prescribed part up to a maximum of 600 000 that is deducted from floating charge realisations and paid to unsecured creditors instead of the holder of the floating charge by default entities incorporated in england and wales are not excluded from or immune to bankruptcy proceedings though their insolvency risk may be altered by the extent of any parent company or government support in a project finance context however various infrastructure sectors such as rail energy and water have amended insolvency procedures the detail of which is outside the scope of this note but they broadly provide for varied procedures with the intention of ensuring the continuity of supply of essential services other than liquidation as detailed above administration administrative receivership subject to certain criteria and receivership may all provide routes to recovery of secured debts the exact procedures required to recover secured debts using any of these methods will depend on the relevant statute common law and the terms of the debenture including to what extent the terms of the debenture exclude or amend the common law positions foreign exchange and withholding tax issues restrictions controls fees and taxes what are the restrictions controls fees taxes or other charges on foreign currency exchange while banks and other financial institutions generally charge commercial fees for foreign exchange transactions subject to any applicable political sanctions regimes including us and eu sanctions regimes there are no statutory restrictions fees taxes or other charges on foreign currency exchange foreign currency exchange contracts are an exempt supply for value added tax vat purposes provided that there is consideration in the contract investment returns what are the restrictions controls fees and taxes on remittances of investment returns or payments of principal interest or premiums on loans or bonds to parties in other jurisdictions while banks and other financial institutions may charge commercial fees for remittances subject to any applicable political sanctions regimes including us and eu regimes there are no restrictions controls or other fees on the remittance of investment returns or on loan payments on the taxation of cross border remittances of investor returns withholding taxes currently with a rate of 20 per cent may apply to debt interest payments to parties in other jurisdictions though the application and rate of any withholding tax will depend on whether there is a double taxation treaty with the other jurisdiction it should be noted that withholding tax does not apply in a number of scenarios mainly subject to certain conditions interest paid to or by a bank as defined in the finance act 2008 a wide definition including many uk banks european banks permanently established in the uk and non eu banks operating in the uk with permission to accept deposits any withholding would generally be addressed through gross up provisions in the relevant loan facility agreement no withholding tax applies to distribution payments from companies incorporated in the uk foreign earnings must project companies repatriate foreign earnings if so must they be converted to local currency and what further restrictions exist over their use there is no obligation on entities incorporated in england and wales to repatriate foreign earnings and no obligation to convert to local currency or any other specific restriction if the project company does choose to repatriate foreign earnings may project companies establish and maintain foreign currency accounts in other jurisdictions and locally subject to any applicable political sanctions regimes including us and eu regimes entities incorporated in england and wales are able to establish and maintain foreign currency accounts in other jurisdictions and locally foreign investment issues investment restrictions what restrictions fees and taxes exist on foreign investment in or ownership of a project and related companies do the restrictions also apply to foreign investors or creditors in the event of foreclosure on the project and related companies are there any bilateral investment treaties with key nation states or other international treaties that may afford relief from such restrictions would such activities require registration with any government authority while there are no blanket restrictions fees or taxes on foreign investment in or ownership of a project in the uk ie uk and non uk owned companies are treated equally there are nuances or additional requirements within industry specific legislation or regulations that apply to companies under foreign ownership for example non eu entities wishing to own transmission systems are subject to articles 11 in directives 2009 73 ec and 2009 72 ec articles 11 consequently in addition to the unbundling criteria that applies to all companies operating in that sector ie that the energy transmission network and the energy production and supply aspects have to be operated discretely articles 11 impose a further requirement on non eu entities to obtain a certification of ownership from the relevant national regulatory authority by proving that such certification would not negatively affect the security of energy supply insurance restrictions what restrictions fees and taxes exist on insurance policies over project assets provided or guaranteed by foreign insurance companies may such policies be payable to foreign secured creditors effecting and or carrying out insurance contracts as principal in the uk are regulated activities under article 10 1 and 2 of the financial services and markets act 2000 regulated activity provided that non uk insurance companies issuing insurance policies relating to project assets in the uk are not deemed to be carrying out a regulated activity there are no corresponding restrictions fees or taxes there are a number of considerations for determining whether an insurance contract has been effected or carried out in the uk for example effecting an insurance contract is construed widely and not only includes the underwriting process or entry into the insurance contract but the term also captures the negotiation process confirmation of cover and the issuing of the insurance policy the term carrying out an insurance contract is also interpreted widely to encompass activities undertaken in relation to an insurance contract that has been entered into including but not limited to the handling of claims settlement of claims and collection of premium if an insurance contract is deemed to be effected or carried out in the uk a non uk insurance company would require authorisation from the uk financial conduct authority fca and the prudential regulation authority pra and the insurance policy would need to be compliant with the fca or pra rules and regulations a typical scenario where this would occur is when a non uk insurance company acts through an agent in the uk one exception to the above is where a non uk insurance company is domiciled in the eea in which case it would be governed by its own home state regulator under this exception while eea domiciled insurance companies would still be bound by the principle of the general good ie some fca or pra rules and regulations would still apply to them so as not to prejudice the application of the fca pra customer protection rules these companies can carry out a regulated activity by establishing a foreign branch in the uk or passporting their services into the uk without the need for fca or pra authorisation it should be noted however that the ongoing discussions following the uk s decision to leave the european union will have an impact on this exception this in turn may see the demand for insurance policies effected and carried out by local insurance companies in the uk rise as the eea domiciled insurance companies could receive the same regulatory treatment as non uk non eu insurance companies ie they will have to obtain fca or pra authorisation worker restrictions what restrictions exist on bringing in foreign workers technicians or executives to work on a project in the uk employers have an obligation to ensure that none of their employees are illegally working in the uk employers need therefore to be aware of the categories of migrant workers in the uk broadly these can be divided into european economic area eea swiss workers and non eea swiss workers under the immigration european economic area regulations 2006 which give effect to the free movement of persons directive eea workers have the right to free movement across the eea and may therefore live and work in the uk without immigration permission with the exception of croatian nationals who may enter and remain but not work in the uk without permission for up to three months but who require a registration certificate to be permitted to work in the uk swiss workers enjoy similar rights of free movement following the uk government s decision to trigger article 50 on 29 march 2017 the procedure required to begin the two year process of leaving the eu the uk will leave the european union on 29 march 2019 following the uk s departure from the eu the automatic rights of eea and swiss migrants to freely move to and work in the uk are likely to come to an end at present it seems likely that there will be a transition period following 29 march 2019 and it is likely that the free movement of people to the uk will continue during this period but the length and the effect of this transition period are unknown and therefore this is only speculation following the uk s exit from the eu the uk will introduce a new migration regime with eea or swiss countries but the details of this policy are yet to be confirmed for non eea countries the uk operates a points based immigration system under which non eea nationals must apply for a visa to live study or work in the uk this points based system operates on the basis of a tiered system comprising five tiers tier 1 high value migrants this tier provides access into the uk for highly talented people who intend to start a business or invest in the uk under this tier the permission belongs to the individual and they do not require the sponsorship of an employer it includes four subcategories exceptional talent individuals who are leaders or emerging leaders and are endorsed as such by a designated competent body in the fields of humanities science engineering medicine the arts or digital technology access can be granted for up to five years and four months with the possibility of settlement after five years and 1 000 places are available each year investors individuals who will invest significant amounts in the uk to be granted access these individuals must be able to invest at least 2 million into the uk market and must open a uk regulated investment account access can be granted for up to three years and four months with an option to extend for up to two years with the possibility of settlement after five years entrepreneurs individuals who wish to come to the uk as entrepreneurs in order to be granted access the individual must meet strict financial tests having access to minimum levels of investment capital access can be granted for up to three years and four months with an option to extend for up to two years with the possibility of settlement after five years and graduate entrepreneurs individuals who have graduated from a uk university and are endorsed by a uk organisation as having a genuine credible business idea places under this category are limited access can be granted for up to one year with an option to extend for a further year after which applicants may be able to switch to tier 1 tier 2 highly skilled migrants this tier similarly provides highly skilled migrants with access to the uk tier 2 differs from tier 1 in that there are a number of minimum requirements that each migrant must meet such as english language skills maintenance requirements and a migrant under tier 2 must be issued with a certificate of sponsorship by its employer it includes four subcategories general individuals who have been offered a skilled role by a uk employer this subcategory is limited to an annual limit of 20 700 admissions divided into monthly quotas with those applicants scoring higher scores being granted higher priority and the individual must be sufficiently skilled and paid the minimum level 30 000 for experienced workers 20 800 for new entrants or the appropriate rate for the job whichever is higher the quotas do not apply to applicants with an annual salary of 159 600 or above and the monthly cap varies from month to month access can be granted for up to five years with the option to extend to a maximum total period of six years with the possibility of settlement after five years intra company transfer individuals being transferred by their company to a uk entity that is directly linked by common ownership or control this can be as long term staff a period of up to five years or for employees earning over 120 000 a period of up to nine years or graduate trainees a period of up to 12 months or however long the training course lasts whichever is shorter sportsperson and minister of religion tier 3 low skilled workers this was intended to be a scheme for access for low skilled workers but was never implemented as the uk government no longer felt the need to have such a scheme given the free eea or swiss immigration this may change following the uk s exit from the eu tier 4 students individuals who wish to come to the uk to study these migrants are usually sponsored by their education provider and are usually allowed to work full time in vacations and between 10 and 20 hours a week in term time students may also take part in work placements though these must not exceed 50 per cent of the course length and tier 5 youth mobility and temporary workers the youth mobility scheme allows young people aged 18 30 from australia canada new zealand japan the republic of korea taiwan hong kong special administrative region and monaco to live and work temporarily in the uk for a period of two years the temporary workers scheme allows temporary workers employed in certain sectors creative and sporting charity religion government authorised exchanges and under international agreements to come to the uk those applying under this tier must be sponsored by their employer there are also certain non points based system immigration categories under which non eea citizens can gain access to the uk which include exempt persons eg diplomats or foreign ministers on official business domestic workers in a private household who have been employed by their private household for a year preceding the visa application representatives of overseas businesses posted in the uk and setting up a uk subsidiary turkish business people or workers this may change post brexit commonwealth citizens who are able to prove that one of their grandparents was born in the uk and non eea swiss nationals working in the eu providing services in another member state this may change post brexit as set out above applicants under tiers 2 and 5 must be sponsored by their prospective employers to sponsor an applicant an employer must be registered as a sponsor and obtain a sponsorship licence if licenced to provide sponsorships employers are advised to undertake the uk home office s three step right to work checks these involve obtaining the employee s original identity documents which must be documents included on the prescribed list of identity documents set out by the home office checking that the documents are valid unaltered and original and relate to the employee with the employee present and making a copy of the documents and keeping them securely stored recording the date of the initial identity check and any subsequent checks made given the present political climate in which the government is seeking to limit immigration both legal and illegal and with the immigration act 2016 placing tighter measures on employers to ensure they comply with their obligations it is important to be thorough in ensuing compliance an employer of an illegal worker who has not carried out the necessary checks can face a penalty of up to 20 000 equipment restrictions what restrictions exist on the importation of project equipment the uk does not place any explicit barriers to entry on imports importers simply need to comply with the relevant uk and eu import duties and customs other than in areas such as defence in which there are specific requirements such as licensing and other restrictions one circumstance in which importers may face a barrier to entry is in the event that the european commission deems a non eu company to be dumping dumping is the practice of selling goods at an artificially low value lower than normal market value in its domestic market in order to damage the industries of eu companies in the infrastructure sphere relevant recent action by the european commission has included that against china for dumping solar panels and steel on the european market and against malaysia regarding the dumping of solar glass nationalisation laws what laws exist regarding the nationalisation or expropriation of project companies and assets are any forms of investment specially protected the uk is generally perceived to have minimal political risk and strong rule of law on nationalisations with the exceptions of a small number of rail companies often interim nationalisations and in 2008 during the global financial crisis the part nationalisation of some banks that may have collapsed otherwise notably northern rock the royal bank of scotland and lloyds all of which have subsequently been reprivatised or are in the process of such there have been no material nationalisations since the 1970s nationalisations of assets of significant value require a primary act of parliamentary legislation which would provide a mechanism for compensating shareholders since the 2017 snap uk general election the uk s main opposition party the labour party has been strengthened and there is now a realistic possibility of it gaining power under jeremy corbyn and john mcdonnell the labour party has moved further to the left of the political spectrum and it is currently labour party policy to nationalise a number of key industry sectors such as the railways and review all private finance initiative pfi initiatives with a view to most likely legislating to nationalise some or all of these projects fiscal treatment of foreign investment incentives what tax incentives or other incentives are provided preferentially to foreign investors or creditors what taxes apply to foreign investments loans mortgages or other security documents either for the purposes of effectiveness or registration there are currently no tax or other incentives which are provided preferentially to foreign investors or creditors there are however a number of incentives which foreign investors can benefit from such as the patent box and research and development tax relief which provides tax relief for companies investing in research and development in the uk or who are earning profits from patented inventions to promote innovative services and products business investment relief which allows non uk domiciled uk residents claiming remittance basis taxation who invest foreign income in a qualifying target company to avoid the payment of tax on foreign income that is invested the venture capital trust the enterprise investment scheme and the seed enterprise investment scheme all of which provide tax relief to investors interested in investing in qualifying small early stage and higher risk businesses the uk also has double tax treaties with over 100 countries which ensures that economic activity is not taxed more than once foreign businesses considering investing in the uk may find helpful hmrc s inward investment support service which aims to give clarity and certainty to non resident businesses about the tax consequences of significant investment in the uk to qualify the investment has to be significant a total of 30 million or more unless the investment is of particular importance to the national or regional economy foreign investors investing in the uk will be subject to the same taxes as uk investors which include stamp duty stamp duty land tax and corporation tax government authorities relevant authorities what are the relevant government agencies or departments with authority over projects in the typical project sectors what is the nature and extent of their authority what is the history of state ownership in these sectors most projects are likely to involve some form of development resulting in the need for planning permission possible environmental permits and other sector specific approvals these are examined below after briefly covering two of the government s key agencies involved in infrastructure planning and development key public agencies the national infrastructure commission nic is an executive agency of hm treasury established to provide impartial advice and make recommendations to the government on economic infrastructure the nic is tasked with setting out its assessment of long term infrastructure needs and providing recommendations carrying out studies into the uk s infrastructure challenges and monitoring the government s progress in delivering projects and programmes recommended by the nic the infrastructure and projects authority ipa is the government s centre of expertise for infrastructure and major projects the ipa works with the cabinet office and hm treasury to support the successful delivery of all types of infrastructure and major projects planning since 27 march 2012 the national planning policy framework nppf has governed planning policy in england the npff sets out the government s planning policies for england and how they are expected to be applied and must be taken into account in the preparation of local and neighbourhood plans the npff does not however apply to nationally significant infrastructure projects nsips or national waste nsips are governed by the planning act 2008 and relevant national policy statements major infrastructure projects in england are likely to be considered nsips and so will need a development consent order as well as planning permission from the relevant local authority the planning inspectorate runs the nsip application process in wales developments will need consent from welsh ministers if considered to be a development of national significance under the planning wales act 2015 comprehensive consultations requirements will need to be met for most projects often involving the environment agency natural resources wales and natural england among others depending on the nature of the project this means the planning process can be lengthy and expensive compared with that of many other jurisdictions environmental consents the environmental regulator in england is the environment agency while natural resources wales nrw carries out the same function in wales the environment agency and nrw both are responsible for reviewing and authorising projects where there are any environmental impacts this is usually evidenced by the issue of an environmental permit the environment agency and nrw will also enforce compliance with permits and relevant legislation health and safety the health and safety executive hse fulfils important statutory functions including providing the appropriate regulatory frameworks and assessing major hazard safety reports and inspecting certain establishments sector specific authorities oil and gas all petroleum resources vest in the crown under the petroleum act 1998 however the government may via the oil and gas authority oga grant exploration or extraction licences for both onshore and offshore resources including fracking licences the department for business energy and industrial strategy beis is the competent authority for decommissioning the oga works with beis to assess decommissioning programmes on the basis of cost future alternative use and collaboration most offshore works will require consent from the marine management organisation in england or the welsh government in wales the uk government has had no equity interest in offshore oil and gas production since 1986 following the sale of its oil and gas assets to british gas minerals extraction following the privatisation of the coal industry in 1994 the ownership of almost all coal now resides with the coal authority which grants licences for coal exploration and extraction the crown holds the rights to gold and silver the mines of these metals are known as mines royal and the crown estate is responsible for granting lease options of mines royal other minerals are privately owned and although there is no national licensing system for exploration and extraction planning permission must be obtained from a mineral planning authority for their extraction water treatment ofwat is the economic regulator in england and wales and grants licences for water and sewerage undertakers a company can also be granted an infrastructure provider project licence to carry out a large or complex water or wastewater infrastructure project that has been specified under legislation such as the thames tideway project the provision of water and wastewater services in england and wales was transferred from the state to the private sector in 1989 by the sale of the 10 regional water authorities the potable water supply and sewage disposal functions of each rwa were transferred to new privately owned companies power generation and transmission regulation of power generation supply transmission and distribution is via a statutory licensing regime under the electricity act 1989 the electricity and gas regulator is the office of gas and electricity markets ofgem an independent national regulatory body recognised by eu directives the power generation supply transmission and distribution markets were privatised in 1990 ofgem also accredits power generation stations for the purposes of receiving various government subsidies including the feed in tariff and the renewable heat incentive transportation highways england operates maintains and improves england s motorways and major a roads highways england works with the department for transport highways england is a government company formerly known as the highways agency highways england does not manage all roads local roads in england are managed by the relevant local authority london roads are managed by transport for london and all welsh roads are managed by the welsh assembly network rail owns and operates all railway infrastructure in england and wales passenger services are divided into regional franchises and run by private companies these companies bid for contracts to run individual franchises most contracts are awarded by the department for transport british rail operations were privatised between 1994 and 1997 ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to railtrack subsequently transferred to network rail while passenger operations were franchised to individual private sector operators the office of rail and road orr regulates the rail industry s health and safety performance it holds network rail and high speed 1 hs1 to account and is tasked with ensuring that the rail industry is competitive and fair orr monitors highways england and has regulatory functions in relation to the channel tunnel the orr is an independent statutory regulator operating within the framework set by uk and eu legislation it is accountable through parliament and the courts ports the majority of port operations are administered by statutory harbour authorities each governed by their own legislation for new harbours and ports both a works order and marine licence are likely to be required these will be processed by the marine management organisation from 1 april 2018 welsh ministers took over responsibility for port development policy for harbours wholly in wales apart from major trust ports telecommunications ofcom is the uk regulator of the telecommunications industry in the uk this includes tv radio video on demand telephone lines mobiles and postal services plus the airwaves over which wireless devices operate ofcom is accountable to parliament and sets and enforces regulatory rules for the sectors for which it is responsible ofcom also has power to enforce competition law in those sectors alongside the competition and markets authority mobile network operators and satellite service providers will need a licence under section 8 of the wireless telegraphy act 2006 unless the government has exempted the particular use from the need for a licence the telecommunications act 1984 abolished british telecommunications monopoly of running telecommunications systems and established a framework to safeguard the workings of competition regulation of natural resources titles who has title to natural resources what rights may private parties acquire to these resources and what obligations does the holder have may foreign parties acquire such rights water the environment agency controls how much where and when water can be abstracted in accordance with uk and eu law through their abstraction licensing regime a number of parties including but not limited to landowners and manufacturers can apply to the environment agency for an abstraction licence with different types of licences available dependant on the type of abstraction to be conducted whether a licence is granted or not depends on the amount of water available after the needs of the environment and existing abstractors are met and whether the abstraction is justified the environment agency also has the power to amend or revoke an existing licence where abstraction is damaging the environment the duration of the licence is usually between six and 18 years for a new licence and 12 years for a renewal licence the environment agency also has the power to grant short duration licences where they think that there may be issues with water availability in the long term and permits the trading of water rights an abstraction licence is not required for certain abstraction activities such as abstractions of 20 cubic metres or less per day filling ships or boats with drinking water and as of 1 january 2018 various low risk abstractions the environmental permitting england and wales amendment regulations 2013 regulate activities that could harm the environment an environmental permit is required from the environmental agency for discharge of liquid effluent or waste water into surface water such as lakes or coastal waters or onto into the ground if the discharge of water is part of a waste installation or mining operation then this can be conducted through an installation or waste and mining permit natural resources wales is responsible for the management and use of water in wales similar to the environment agency regime a licence is required for water abstraction and impoundment minerals there is no national licensing system for the exploration and extraction of minerals however planning permission must be obtained prior to their extraction the owner of the land will have the right of ownership to minerals found or extracted from their land provided that these rights have not been excepted or reserved under a previous title transfer or by legislation uk onshore coal the coal authority grants licences for coal exploration and extraction the rights of ownership in almost all coal belongs to the coal authority gold and silver gold and silver are classed as mines royal therefore rights of ownership in gold and silver vest in the crown permission must be sought from the crown estate mineral agent for commercial exploration of these metals if the crown does not own the land in question then permission must be sought from the landowner planning permission is also required to mine the metals oil and gas ownership of oil and gas located in united kingdom vests in the crown in accordance with the petroleum production act 1934 the petroleum act 1934 is supplemented by the energy act 2016 and the infrastructure act 2015 a licence must be obtained from the oil and gas authority for the exploration of oil and gas the licence grants the licensee a non exclusive right to explore but not produce the acreage outside the areas of any other exploration licence in place at the time any licence granted does not include rights of access the licensee is therefore required to obtain the consent required for access and any planning permission necessary where a coal operator needs to capture natural gas during coal mining they will require a methane drainage licence the oil and gas authority will consult with the coal authority to ensure that the operations to be carried out are in line with the coal authority s regulations uk offshore the seabed beneath the seabed and beyond territorial waters with a 12 mile limit is known as the uk continental shelf ukcs these are the areas over which the uk sovereign exercises rights of exploration and exploitation of mineral resources the department for business innovation skills grants licences in respect of oil and gas on the ukcs and the coal authority grants permission to enter or drill through coal seams for coal bed methane and coal mine gas the rights of title to the natural resources is dependent on the owner of the land the same rules will apply in relation to foreign investors there are no rules that exclude foreign investors from holding title to these natural resources royalties and taxes what royalties and taxes are payable on the extraction of natural resources and are they revenue or profit based profits made from the extraction of oil and gas in the uk or the ukcs attract tax which currently comprises i ring fence corporation tax rfct of 30 per cent ii a supplementary charge sc of 10 per cent and iii petroleum revenue tax prt of zero per cent rfct is calculated in the same way as corporation tax that applies to all companies rfct comprises a ring fence around profits made from oil and gas extraction in the uk and the ukcs preventing these taxable profits from being reduced by losses from other activities or excessively high interest payments in addition to rfct a company is charged an additional sc of 10 per cent on its ring fenced profits finally individual oil fields that received development consent before 16 march 1993 attracted prt on their profits however this tax has now been permanently set to zero per cent but has not been abolished the marginal tax rate payable on oil and gas profits is 40 per cent various reliefs are available in respect of these taxes such as the investment allowance cluster allowance and onshore allowance which apply to the sc and the ring fence expenditure supplement which applies to rfct among other available reliefs businesses that exploit aggregates sand gravel and rock in the uk will be subject to an aggregates levy this will apply to aggregates that have either been dug from the ground dredged from the sea in the uk waters or imported a levy of 2 per tonne of taxable aggregate is payable with less payable on smaller amounts eg 1 on half a tonne each as of the date of drafting companies that receive royalties for mineral extraction are charged corporation tax of 19 per cent terminal loss relief may be applicable to reduce the tax payable on the royalties by offsetting the loss against the other gains or profits of the business in the same accounting period export restrictions what restrictions fees or taxes exist on the export of natural resources customs procedures and taxes generally apply to the export of natural resources from the uk legal issues of general application government permission what government approvals are required for typical project finance transactions what fees and other charges apply government approvals for a typical project finance transaction may include planning permission generally within the remit of the local authority unless the project is an nsip see further above and environmental approvals and permissions from various governmental agencies and bodies further detail on governmental authorities is given in the answer to question 16 if the project finance transaction is public infrastructure being privately financed eg through pfi pf2 mim models then hm treasury approvals are likely to be needed if the value of the financing transaction exceeds the delegated authorities of the public body procuring the infrastructure registration of financing must any of the financing or project documents be registered or filed with any government authority or otherwise comply with legal formalities to be valid or enforceable subject to the need to register debentures at companies house to ensure that the security interests are not void against a liquidator administrator or creditor and the debt secured by that charge does not become payable immediately see above while not technically a requirement failure to register accordingly has very serious practical consequences there are as a matter of course no requirements to register or file any financing or project document nor any other similar legal formality outside the document s due execution to ensure that it is valid and enforceable arbitration awards how are international arbitration contractual provisions and awards recognised by local courts is the jurisdiction a member of the icsid convention or other prominent dispute resolution conventions are any types of disputes not arbitrable are any types of disputes subject to automatic domestic arbitration the english courts are supportive of arbitration and will generally seek to uphold contractual agreements to arbitrate the uk is a party to the new york convention and the geneva convention relating to recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitration awards the uk has ratified the washington convention icsid and has enacted the arbitration international investment disputes act 1966 which provides for the recognition and enforcement of icsid awards most types of commercial disputes can be arbitrated there are some very limited cases in which disputes are not arbitrable including employment where an employee has statutory rights to have his or her case heard before an employment tribunal and insolvency proceedings that are subject to the statutory regimes set out in the insolvency act 1986 and criminal matters there no types of commercial disputes that are automatically subject to domestic arbitration the arbitration act 1996 governs all arbitrations seated in england wales or northern ireland both domestic and international law governing agreements which jurisdiction s law typically governs project agreements which jurisdiction s law typically governs financing agreements which matters are governed by domestic law while not mandatory both project and financing agreements are typically governed by the laws of england and wales where the project is based in england or wales where the project is based in scotland or northern ireland the real estate elements of the project eg leases will be governed by the domestic law of that jurisdiction though often the other project and finance documents will be governed by the laws of england and wales real estate related security interests should also be governed by domestic of the relevant jurisdiction in which they are located there are some other statutory restrictions on governing law including public policy requirements primarily that the constitution of an entity incorporated in one of the jurisdictions in the uk must be governed by the law of that jurisdiction and that both employment and insolvency related matters will be governed by the domestic jurisdiction english law is also often used for financing agreements though not necessarily security agreements for projects based outside the uk submission to foreign jurisdiction is a submission to a foreign jurisdiction and a waiver of immunity effective and enforceable submission to a foreign jurisdiction to settle disputes under a commercial contract is a valid choice under the laws of england and wales and the judgments of that foreign jurisdiction may be effective and enforceable subject to the relevant formalities broadly the judgments of other eu states are enforceable under regulation eu 1215 2012 of the european parliament and of the council of 12 december 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil commercial matters known as the recast brussels regulation in the case of denmark the regulation is applicable by separate agreement rather than it having direct effect iceland norway and switzerland ie the european free trade association members excluding liechtenstein reciprocally recognise the jurisdiction of other european states through the similar but less developed 2007 lugano convention there is also a separate regime for the simplified recognition of scottish and northern irish judgments under the civil jurisdiction and judgments act 1982 while the judgments of some mainly commonwealth states and uk overseas territories are subject to formalities recognised variously under the administration of justice act 1920 foreign judgments reciprocal enforcement act 1933 and civil jurisdiction and judgments act 1982 gibraltar order 1997 the judgments of the courts of mexico and singapore for example can be recognised in the jurisdiction through the operation of the hague convention on the choice of court agreements in the absence of any specific reciprocal arrangement for example most notably in the united states russia and china foreign judgments may only be recognised and enforced by separate proceedings in the domestic jurisdiction sovereign immunity under the laws of england and wales is primarily derived from the state immunity act 1978 subject to the relevant domestic law and whether this permits the sovereign entity to waive immunity and provided the clause is properly drafted immunity from adjudication and enforcement can be effectively waived and enforced though in practice there are few differences to the state immunity act 1978 it should be noted that the uk is also a signatory to the united nations convention on jurisdictional immunities of states and their property though it is not yet in force under the laws of england and wales environmental health and safety laws applicable regulations what laws or regulations apply to typical project sectors what regulatory bodies administer those laws environmental matters in england and wales are regulated by a complex mixture of increasingly stringent legislation and common law health and safety is often considered alongside environmental matters but is governed by separate laws and regulations while there are several relevant bodies to the regulation of environmental matters the key regulators are the environment agency for england and natural resources wales for wales other bodies thatmay be relevant depending on the project include natural england which is responsible for biodiversity wildlife and habitats the marine management organisation which is responsible for marine activities and local authorities that can have a number of roles primarily relating to regulation of emissions planning permissions and waste disposal the main environmental laws relevant to projects include the following the contaminated land regime contained in part 2a of the environmental protection act 1990 under this regime liability for remediation of any contamination which includes investigation mitigation and monitoring of contamination sits primarily with those who caused or knowingly permitted the contamination however this liability can rest with landowners or occupiers regardless of whether they are aware of the contamination if those who caused the contamination cannot be found the environmental permitting regime which is set out in the environmental permitting england and wales regulations 2016 under this regime if certain activities are being undertaken the party carrying them out must hold an environmental permit there is a wide range of activities covered and they tend to be those activities that release emissions to land air and water or that involve waste if a project causes contamination pollution or a nuisance a party including a company who has suffered loss as a result may be able to bring a civil claim in court under the common law of nuisance or negligence the main aim of such an action is not the remediation of the issue but to compensate the party for its loss any project involving waste whether it is the production collection holding storage and handling processing reuse or disposal will be subject to statutory regulation if a project is an installation in an energy intensive sector such as manufacturing facilities oil refiners and powers stations the eu emissions trading system may be applicable under this scheme an installation must surrender an amount of emissions allowances corresponding to the amount of carbon dioxide produced the is also a mandatory emissions trading scheme known as the crc energy efficiency scheme which applies to large non energy intensive businesses and public sector organisations however this scheme will end in october 2019 biodiversity habitats and wildlife are also protected by legislation if the site for a project is a designated site or if there are protected species on the site there are likely to be significant limitations on the activities and developments that can be carried out on the site breaches of the above laws can have a range of consequences including criminal liability and sanctions including fines or imprisonment civil penalties under the specific regime which can include fixed monetary penalties discretionary requirements or stop notices payment of damages as part of civil court actions and requirement to carry out and cost of cost of remediation health and safety matters are extensively regulated through common law and statutory obligations with the basis of the statutory obligations set out in the health and safety at work etc act 1974 these obligations are regulated and enforced by the health and safety executive the core obligation on employers is to as far as reasonably practicable ensure the health and safety of their employees and those affected by their activities the qualification means that employers do not have to take measures to avoid or reduce risks affecting health and safety if they are technically impossible or if the time effort and cost of implementing such actions is grossly disproportionate to the risk employers also have obligations in relation to the assessment monitoring and auditing of the health and safety risks associated with its business and must appoint a competent person to implement the measures required to ensure compliance breaches of the statutory health and safety obligations is a criminal offence by the company with a range of accompanying sanctions including improvement notices requiring an issue to be remedied prohibition notices requiring an activity to cease individual liability for directors company secretary or a manager if the offence was committed with their consent neglect or connivance and corporate manslaughter charges project companies principal business structures what are the principal business structures of project companies what are the principal sources of financing available to project companies typically a project company will be structured as a special purpose vehicle spv often known as the projectco though the sponsors will hold equity in the projectco s sole holding company the holdco for operational efficiency limited liability and equity transfer reasons usually the spv is a limited liability company but it may also be structured as a limited partnership often for tax efficiency and transparency reasons the projectco may alternatively be a public limited company if it intends to raise bond finance often through the use of a separate spv often known as a finco or debtco the projectco will contract with the relevant authority concessionaire via the project agreement concession and will then subcontract the building and maintenance obligations to specialist subcontractors often but not always parties related to the sponsors the projectco will aim to pass down liability for obligations to the relevant subcontractor with the aim of minimising the residual liability remaining with the projectco and this residual liability may be addressed using insurance as applicable the principal sources of financing available to project companies are as follows equity both pure equity and subordinated shareholder loans often predominantly the latter by value equity will be passed down the corporate structure from sponsor to the holdco to the projectco a project s leverage will be dependent on the industry sector and the particular situation of that project but leverage is typically between 75 per cent and 90 per cent for projects located in england and wales bank institutional debt while finance from institutional investors is becoming increasingly common bank still play a significant role in financing projects bond finance some projects especially those with long term debt requirements or those with minimal or no construction risk may look to raise finance through public or private bond placements this may also take place as a part of a bridge to bond financing structure and leasing projects where the asset in question is primarily equipment rather than building based often contain some lease financing public private partnership legislation applicable legislation has ppp enabling legislation been enacted and if so at what level of government and is the legislation industry specific ppp has been a government policy for over 25 years and state contracting entities for example nhs trusts central government or local authorities have had the power to enter into such arrangements under general existing legislative powers unlike many other jurisdictions there is no overarching ppp law under which such projects are mandated the pfi was the driving force behind ppp projects in england and wales and was a policy implemented through the cabinet office and hm treasury however there is legislation that assists with the bankability of uk ppp projects such as the localism act 2011 which extended powers to local government or the national health service private finance act 1997 which enabled nhs trusts to enter into development finance agreements furthermore the form of contracts used by government entities to enter into pfi and now pf2 contracts was made more consistent through the standardisation of pfi contracts suite of documentation that is now in its fourth incarnation sopc4 and forms the bedrock of bankable pfi transactions in england and wales pfi is an evolving initiative most lately re emerging in the form of pf2 primarily to fend off accusations that pfi represented poor value for money for the tax payer the key changes in the standardised documentation and guidance included reduction in the length of the tendering process removal of soft facilities management which produced a rich source of profits for pfi sponsors public sector equity stakes in the pfi vehicles and open book accounting and gain share mechanism for life cycle funding although none of these changes represented legislative change they did represent a marked change in government policy in its approach to new pfi projects it is however worth noting that the procurement itself of pfi pf2 contracts is also regulated by general procurement regulation in england and wales this regulation is found primarily in the eu s public contracts directive 2014 24 eu but was implemented in the uk by the public contracts regulations 2015 the majority of pfi projects will be caught by the most stringent procurement regulations requiring a fully regulated procurement process including ojeu notices and detailed rules regarding the running of the tender competition itself ppp limitations legal limitations what if any are the practical and legal limitations on ppp transactions from a legal perspective public bodies are broadly able to contract private sector participants subject to certain formalities at a macro level public sector procurement such as ppp transactions are generally subject to eu procurement rules and processes these include the requirement to follow the ojeu notice procedure where the public sector procurement directive directive 2014 24 eu as implemented by the public procurement regulations 2015 applies it should also be noted that there are specific procurement processes for the award of concession contracts concession contracts regulations 2016 utilities utilities contracts regulations 2016 and defence defence and security public contracts regulations 2016 each of which require certain processes to be followed if the procurement meets the relevant value threshold largely determined by the type of services being procured ppp transactions in the jurisdiction take a range of forms but where the private sector is to provide finance generally pfi transactions subsequently taking an updated standardised form pf2 though there are other models notably the welsh government s mutual investment model the finance procurement is overseen by hm treasury where the value exceeds the relevant public body s delegated authority spending limits and the project will need to follow hm treasury s approvals processes at a more micro level projects contracting with a local government entity should be aware that the capacity of local government bodies to contract is derived from statute and these powers are narrowly interpreted as a result it is often necessary to obtain certificates pursuant to the local government contract act 1997 lgca certificates from the relevant local government body certifying that the relevant actions are within its capacity subject to very limited circumstances where a certificate can be challenged meaning that the relevant contract will not be declared void as a result of being outside of the capacity of the local government body in question the actions of public bodies are reviewable within a limited period of time on the grounds of illegality including that the public body acted outside of its proper capacity irrationality or procedural unfairness the risks posed by a judicial review process for example in relation to planning permissions is often dealt with through conditions precedent from a practical perspective the major limitations on ppp transactions are broadly political the labour party the uk s main opposition party has a stated policy of opposition to pfi pf2 and are generally antipathetic to all forms of private investment in the public sector and intend to conduct a review if elected currently a realistic possibility of existing pfi pf2 projects with a view to potentially nationalising the equity in some or all of these projects the insolvency of carillion a key pfi contractor has also heightened antipathy towards ppp in particular to pfi and questions remain as to the value for money of the pf2 structure no pf2 projects have reached financial close since 2016 and while high government debt and the comparative lack of public funding may suggest future infrastructure investment may need to be privately funded political antipathy may well be a significant obstacle to this investment ppp transactions significant transactions what have been the most significant ppp transactions completed to date in your jurisdiction in the uk there has been a very small number of greenfield new money ppp transactions in 2017 q1 q2 2018 arguably also very few are notable in terms of size complexity or novelty in contrast the uk ppp and infrastructure debt financing market has been dominated by a large number of complex large acquisition finance and refinancing transactions at the time of writing market conditions for debt are very favourable for project sponsors in terms of pricing tenor and terms enabling refinancing opportunities ie forthcoming m25 ppp refinancing scheduled to close in q2 q3 2018 and contributing to a perceived high point in asset valuations the uk market has witnessed insurance pension and institutional fund debt investors advancing funds to a wide range of infrastructure projects to both investment and non investment grade credits we have also noted the emergence of the use of holdco debt whereby debt is advanced typically above regulated operating companies or project companies to create leverage opportunities against junior debt and dividend cash flows ie uk high speed rail 1 acquisition and the inter city express ppp acquisition in the context that many perceive infrastructure asset class as generally being conservatively leveraged indeed we are seeing potential leverage opportunities to be advanced to infrastructure equity funds rather than at an asset level it is also worth noting debt raising on a deferred basis allowing sponsors to take advantage of current positive debt conditions ie thames tideway raising green bond finance to be issued in 2021 2022 for their construction financing requirements from institutional investors update trends update trends updates and trends brexit at the time of writing the uk is set to leave the eu on 29 march 2019 though it is expected that throughout a transition period presently likely to last until some point in 2021 there will be minimal change to the uk s legal relationship with the eu further and assuming both that the uk does leave the eu and that there is a relatively short transition period with the possible exception of the employment and immigration law referenced above there is no stated ambition from the uk government nor given the complexity and relative lack of resources and parliamentary time available to the uk government any likelihood that any of the law around project financing in england and wales will change significantly in the near term as a result of brexit political risk there is increasing political antipathy towards pfi pf2 both from ideological and value for money perspectives this antipathy may manifest itself in two ways the first is that there is currently a restricted pipeline of greenfield private finance infrastructure projects in the uk with the possible exception of the silvertown tunnel in east london and the a303 tunnel project in the south west of england this restricted greenfield pipeline is likely to continue the second is that it is the stated policy of the labour party the main opposition to the uk government to review all existing pfi projects with a view to nationalising the equity in these projects a labour government is now a realistic possibility in the near future so any nationalisation may increase risk premium required to finance infrastructure in the uk to account for additional political risk jeremy corbyn the current leader of the labour party is also a long term supporter of government subsidisation of industry however despite indications from him that any labour government would seek to amend state aid rules potentially as part of a brexit settlement with the eu the likelihood of the eu agreeing to any relaxation of state aid rules in respect of the uk while agreeing to a comprehensive tariff free trade and customs agreement is extremely remote carillion the january 2018 insolvency of carillion plc a major pfi contractor has further hardened public sentiment towards private finance initiative projects in particular the midlands metropolitan hospital royal liverpool hospital and aberdeen bypass were all significantly behind schedule and over budget at the point of carillion plc s collapse in addition major contractors have increasingly moved away from large fixed price construction contracts a key risk transfer aspect of pfi owing to their often wafer thin margins and the systemic risk they represent to these contractors both the upward pressure on construction costs and relatively expensive financing costs noting the risk transfers involved have increased value for money concerns and while some welsh mim model projects may come to market soon the pipeline of new private finance projects is likely to remain limited secondary markets and whole business securitisation while as noted above the pipeline of primary transactions has been limited with high liquidity low debt costs and investment fund allocations to infrastructure increasing there is a strong m a and project refinancing market and this has included whole business securitisations as part of acquisition finance in the context of a relative paucity of primary market opportunities competition has driven valuations up debt costs down and increased the range of assets that infrastructure investors are willing and able to invest in a key example of the expanding scope of infrastructure project finance is the increased interest in broadband internet infrastructure investment while traditionally this may have been regarded as too risky to project finance as the uk market matures there may be a significant increase in broadband internet infrastructure being project financed as has been seen in a number of jurisdictions in continental europe

trusts exchange traded funds closed end funds mutual funds and separate managed accounts fta is the supervisor of the first trust unit investment trusts while ftp is the sponsor ftp is also a distributor of mutual fund shares and exchange traded fund creation units fta and ftp are based in wheaton illinois you should consider the investment objectives risks charges and expenses of a fund before investing prospectuses for the funds contain this and other important information and are available free of charge by calling toll free at 1 800 621 1675 or visiting www ftportfolios com a prospectus should be read carefully before investing past performance is no assurance of future results investment return and market value of an investment in a fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost principal risk factors a fund s shares will change in value and you could lose money by investing in a fund an investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency there can be no assurance that a fund s investment objectives will be achieved an investment in a fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges the risks of investing in each fund are spelled out in its prospectus shareholder report and other regulatory filings an index etf seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield of an index you should anticipate that the value of an index fund s shares will decline more or less in correlation with any decline in the value of the index an index fund s return may not match the return of the index unlike a fund the indices do not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore do not incur the expenses incurred by a fund investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share s net asset value shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account however unlike mutual funds shares may only be redeemed directly from a fund by authorized participants in very large creation redemption units if a fund s authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem fund shares may trade at a discount to a fund s net asset value and possibly face delisting one of the principal risks of investing in a fund is market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a fund fund shares or securities in general may fall in value an actively managed etf is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio in managing such a fund s investment portfolio the portfolio managers management teams advisor or sub advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result a fund that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks including limited diversification an investment in a fund concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically certain funds may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger more established companies there is no guarantee that the issuers of the securities in any fund will declare dividends in the future or that if declared they will either remain at current levels or increase over time an investment in a fund containing securities of non u s issuers is subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations political risks withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting non u s issuers these risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in or with significant operations in emerging market countries a fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market investments in sovereign bonds involve special risks because the governmental authority that controls the repayment of the debt may be unwilling or unable to repay the principal and or interest when due in times of economic uncertainty the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligations a fund that invests in the european region is subject to certain risks because member states in the european union no longer control their own monetary policies money supply and official interest rates for the euro rather such control is exercised by the european central bank the swiss economy is dependent on the economies of other european nations as key trading partners any reduction in spending by other european countries could have a negative effect on the swiss economy the european sovereign debt crisis has resulted in a weakened euro and has put into question the future financial prospects of the surrounding region the ongoing implementation of the european union provisions and euro conversion process may materially impact revenues expenses or income and increase competition for other european companies which could have an effect on the swiss economy certain securities held by certain of the funds are subject to credit risk call risk income risk inflation risk interest rate risk prepayment risk and zero coupon risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest and or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result credit risk is heightened for floating rate loans and high yield securities call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher yielding debt instruments held by a fund performance could be adversely impacted income risk is the risk that income from a fund s fixed income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed income securities in a fund will decline because of rising market interest rates prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected this may result in a decline in a fund s income zero coupon risk is the risk that zero coupon bonds may be highly volatile as interest rates rise or fall senior floating rate loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated as a result the risks associated with these loans are similar to the risks of high yield fixed income instruments high yield securities or junk bonds are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings and therefore may be highly speculative these securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history narrowly focused operations and or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity the market for high yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities income from municipal bonds held by a fund could be declared taxable because of among other things unfavorable changes in tax laws adverse interpretations by the internal revenue service or state tax authorities or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer income from municipal bonds held by a fund may be subject to the federal alternative minimum income tax convertible securities have characteristics of both equity and debt securities and as a result are exposed to certain additional risks the values of certain synthetic convertible securities will respond differently to market fluctuations than a traditional convertible security because such synthetic convertibles are composed of two or more separate securities or instruments each with its own market value a fund is subject to the credit risk associated with the counterparty creating the synthetic convertible instrument synthetic convertible securities may also be subject to the risks associated with derivatives exchange traded notes etns are senior unsecured unsubordinated debt securities whose returns are linked to the performance of a particular market benchmark or strategy minus applicable fees the value of an etn may be influenced by various factors real estate investment trusts reits and real estate operating companies reocs are subject to certain risks including changes in the real estate market vacancy rates and competition volatile interest rates and economic recession master limited partnerships mlps are subject to certain risks including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics energy conservation taxes price controls and other regulatory policies of various governments in addition there is the risk that an mlp could be taxed as a corporation resulting in decreased returns from such mlp blockchain technology is an entirely new and relatively untested technology and may never be implemented to a scale that provides identifiable economic benefit to the companies included in a blockchain index blockchain systems could be vulnerable to fraud there is little regulation of blockchain technology and because blockchain technology systems may operate across many national boundaries and regulatory jurisdictions it is possible that it may be subject to widespread and inconsistent regulation the values of the companies included in a blockchain index may not be a reflection of their connection to blockchain technology but may be based on other business operations currently blockchain technology is primarily used for the recording of transactions in digital currency which are extremely speculative unregulated and volatile because digital assets registered in a blockchain do not have a standardized exchange like a stock market there is less liquidity for such assets and greater possibility of fraud or manipulation a fund may invest in robotics and artificial intelligence companies which may have limited product lines markets financial resources or personnel and are subject to the risks of changes in business cycles world economic growth technological progress and government regulation these companies are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and challenges to or misappropriation of such rights could have a material adverse effect on such companies securities of robotics and artificial intelligence companies tend to be more volatile than securities of companies that rely less heavily on technology robotics and artificial intelligence companies typically engage in significant amounts of spending on research and development and rapid changes to the field could have a material adverse effect on a company s operating results the use of futures options and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives these risks are heightened when a fund s portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance a fund s return or as a substitute for a position or security rather than solely to hedge or offset the risk of a position or security held by a fund the stocks of companies that have recently conducted an initial public offering have exhibited above average price appreciation in connection with the initial public offering prior to inclusion in a fund which may not continue and these investments may be subject to additional risks price volatility and speculative trading a fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash rather than in kind securities as a result an investment in a fund may be less tax efficient than an investment in an exchange traded fund that effects its creations and redemptions for in kind securities a fund s investment in repurchase agreements may be subject to market and credit risk with respect to the collateral securing the repurchase agreements alternative investments may employ complex strategies have unique investment and risk characteristics and may not be suitable for all investors certain funds may invest in other investment companies including closed end funds cefs etfs and affiliated etfs which involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds in addition a fund s investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds a fund may invest in u s government obligations u s treasury obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government securities issued or guaranteed by federal agencies and u s government sponsored instrumentalities may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government short selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns in times of unusual or adverse market economic regulatory or political conditions a fund may not be able fully or partially to implement its short selling strategy certain funds may invest in distressed securities and many distressed securities are illiquid or trade in low volumes and thus may be more difficult to value illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by the fund or at prices approximately the value at which the fund is carrying the securities on its books because the shares of cefs cannot be redeemed upon demand shares of many cefs will trade on exchanges at market prices rather than net asset value which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than the net asset value nav premium or less than nav discount there can be no assurance that the market discount on shares of any cef purchased by a fund will ever decrease or that when a fund seeks to sell shares of a cef it can receive the nav for those shares a fund may also be exposed to higher volatility in the market due to indirect use of leverage through its investment in cefs cefs may issue senior securities in an attempt to enhance returns certain funds have fewer assets than larger more established funds and like other relatively new funds large inflows and outflows may impact such funds market exposure for limited periods of time alphadex is a registered trademark of first trust portfolios l p first trust portfolios l p has obtained a patent for the alphadex stock selection

free of charge by calling toll free at 1 800 621 1675 or visiting www ftportfolios com a prospectus should be read carefully before investing past performance is no assurance of future results investment return and market value of an investment in a fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost principal risk factors a fund s shares will change in value and you could lose money by investing in a fund an investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency there can be no assurance that a fund s investment objectives will be achieved an investment in a fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges the risks of investing in each fund are spelled out in its prospectus shareholder report and other regulatory filings an index etf seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield of an index you should anticipate that the value of an index fund s shares will decline more or less in correlation with any decline in the value of the index an index fund s return may not match the return of the index unlike a fund the indices do not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore do not incur the expenses incurred by a fund investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share s net asset value shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account however unlike mutual funds shares may only be redeemed directly from a fund by authorized participants in very large creation redemption units if a fund s authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem fund shares may trade at a discount to a fund s net asset value and possibly face delisting one of the principal risks of investing in a fund is market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a fund fund shares or securities in general may fall in value an actively managed etf is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio in managing such a fund s investment portfolio the portfolio managers management teams advisor or sub advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result a fund that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks including limited diversification an investment in a fund concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically certain funds may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger more established companies there is no guarantee that the issuers of the securities in any fund will declare dividends in the future or that if declared they will either remain at current levels or increase over time an investment in a fund containing securities of non u s issuers is subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations political risks withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting non u s issuers these risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in or with significant operations in emerging market countries a fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market investments in sovereign bonds involve special risks because the governmental authority that controls the repayment of the debt may be unwilling or unable to repay the principal and or interest when due in times of economic uncertainty the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligations a fund that invests in the european region is subject to certain risks because member states in the european union no longer control their own monetary policies money supply and official interest rates for the euro rather such control is exercised by the european central bank the swiss economy is dependent on the economies of other european nations as key trading partners any reduction in spending by other european countries could have a negative effect on the swiss economy the european sovereign debt crisis has resulted in a weakened euro and has put into question the future financial prospects of the surrounding region the ongoing implementation of the european union provisions and euro conversion process may materially impact revenues expenses or income and increase competition for other european companies which could have an effect on the swiss economy certain securities held by certain of the funds are subject to credit risk call risk income risk inflation risk interest rate risk prepayment risk and zero coupon risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest and or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result credit risk is heightened for floating rate loans and high yield securities call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher yielding debt instruments held by a fund performance could be adversely impacted income risk is the risk that income from a fund s fixed income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed income securities in a fund will decline because of rising market interest rates prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected this may result in a decline in a fund s income zero coupon risk is the risk that zero coupon bonds may be highly volatile as interest rates rise or fall senior floating rate loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated as a result the risks associated with these loans are similar to the risks of high yield fixed income instruments high yield securities or junk bonds are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings and therefore may be highly speculative these securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history narrowly focused operations and or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity the market for high yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities income from municipal bonds held by a fund could be declared taxable because of among other things unfavorable changes in tax laws adverse interpretations by the internal revenue service or state tax authorities or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer income from municipal bonds held by a fund may be subject to the federal alternative minimum income tax convertible securities have characteristics of both equity and debt securities and as a result are exposed to certain additional risks the values of certain synthetic convertible securities will respond differently to market fluctuations than a traditional convertible security because such synthetic convertibles are composed of two or more separate securities or instruments each with its own market value a fund is subject to the credit risk associated with the counterparty creating the synthetic convertible instrument synthetic convertible securities may also be subject to the risks associated with derivatives exchange traded notes etns are senior unsecured unsubordinated debt securities whose returns are linked to the performance of a particular market benchmark or strategy minus applicable fees the value of an etn may be influenced by various factors real estate investment trusts reits and real estate operating companies reocs are subject to certain risks including changes in the real estate market vacancy rates and competition volatile interest rates and economic recession master limited partnerships mlps are subject to certain risks including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics energy conservation taxes price controls and other regulatory policies of various governments in addition there is the risk that an mlp could be taxed as a corporation resulting in decreased returns from such mlp blockchain technology is an entirely new and relatively untested technology and may never be implemented to a scale that provides identifiable economic benefit to the companies included in a blockchain index blockchain systems could be vulnerable to fraud there is little regulation of blockchain technology and because blockchain technology systems may operate across many national boundaries and regulatory jurisdictions it is possible that it may be subject to widespread and inconsistent regulation the values of the companies included in a blockchain index may not be a reflection of their connection to blockchain technology but may be based on other business operations currently blockchain technology is primarily used for the recording of transactions in digital currency which are extremely speculative unregulated and volatile because digital assets registered in a blockchain do not have a standardized exchange like a stock market there is less liquidity for such assets and greater possibility of fraud or manipulation a fund may invest in robotics and artificial intelligence companies which may have limited product lines markets financial resources or personnel and are subject to the risks of changes in business cycles world economic growth technological progress and government regulation these companies are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and challenges to or misappropriation of such rights could have a material adverse effect on such companies securities of robotics and artificial intelligence companies tend to be more volatile than securities of companies that rely less heavily on technology robotics and artificial intelligence companies typically engage in significant amounts of spending on research and development and rapid changes to the field could have a material adverse effect on a company s operating results the use of futures options and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives these risks are heightened when a fund s portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance a fund s return or as a substitute for a position or security rather than solely to hedge or offset the risk of a position or security held by a fund the stocks of companies that have recently conducted an initial public offering have exhibited above average price appreciation in connection with the initial public offering prior to inclusion in a fund which may not continue and these investments may be subject to additional risks price volatility and speculative trading a fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash rather than in kind securities as a result an investment in a fund may be less tax efficient than an investment in an exchange traded fund that effects its creations and redemptions for in kind securities a fund s investment in repurchase agreements may be subject to market and credit risk with respect to the collateral securing the repurchase agreements alternative investments may employ complex strategies have unique investment and risk characteristics and may not be suitable for all investors certain funds may invest in other investment companies including closed end funds cefs etfs and affiliated etfs which involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds in addition a fund s investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds a fund may invest in u s government obligations u s treasury obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government securities issued or guaranteed by federal agencies and u s government sponsored instrumentalities may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government short selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns in times of unusual or adverse market economic regulatory or political conditions a fund may not be able fully or partially to implement its short selling strategy certain funds may invest in distressed securities and many distressed securities are illiquid or trade in low volumes and thus may be more difficult to value illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by the fund or at prices approximately the value at which the fund is carrying the securities on its books because the shares of cefs cannot be redeemed upon demand shares of many cefs will trade on exchanges at market prices rather than net asset value which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than the net asset value nav premium or less than nav discount there can be no assurance that the market discount on shares of any cef purchased by a fund will ever decrease or that when a fund seeks to sell shares of a cef it can receive the nav for those shares a fund may also be exposed to higher volatility in the market due to indirect use of leverage through its investment in cefs cefs may issue senior securities in an attempt to enhance returns certain funds have fewer assets than larger more established funds and like other relatively new funds large inflows and outflows may impact such funds market exposure for limited periods of time alphadex is a registered trademark of first trust portfolios l p first trust

it is difficult to forecast when the next global economic recession will happen it is much easier to predict its severity this is particularly the case in the light of excessively high global debt levels asset price bubbles and the generalised mispricing of credit market risk those considerations coupled with the lack of adequate policy instruments to respond to the next global slowdown point to a much more severe crisis than the average post war recession among the more disturbing vulnerabilities of the global economy is the large amount of debt spawned by years of ultra unorthodox monetary policy by the world s major central banks according to the international monetary fund the global debt to gdp level is 250 around 30 percentage points higher than it was on the eve of the 2008 financial crisis handling a high debt level in the midst of a recession will be a major challenge for policy makers it may lead to a wave of defaults that could cause financial market distress which in turn would risk deepening the recession that challenge would be compounded substantially if that debt proved to be owed by borrowers of dubious creditworthiness there are many reasons to fear that years of unorthodox monetary policy and low interest rates have led to a marked deterioration in lending standards as former us federal reserve chair janet yellen cautioned recently the size of the risky us leveraged loan market has doubled to more than 1 2tn from around 600bn on the eve of the 2008 recession at the same time there has been a large increase in lending to corporations of questionable creditworthiness in emerging markets particularly troubling is the fact that more than 3tn of that debt is dollar denominated which will be difficult for those companies to repay if the world economy were to weaken and the dollar to strengthen an important reason to be more concerned about high debt levels today than we might have been in 2008 is that the mispricing of global debt in the current economic cycle has become much more pervasive in 2008 that mispricing was largely limited to us mortgage lending today it appears to be across the board and around the world this could lead to considerable financial market dislocation if there is a serious repricing of risk to more normal levels and the asset price bubbles in the global equity and housing markets burst examples of credit risk mispricing include the us high yield debt market and the emerging economy corporate debt market borrowing rates in both markets have reached levels that do not nearly compensate the lenders for default risk mispricing was also evident in the sovereign debt markets of highly indebted countries like italy where until recently the government could borrow long term at interest rates close to those in the us the us is less well equipped now than it was in 2008 to fight the next recession with interest rates still low and with considerable political resistance to another round of quantitative easing the fed has little room for manoeuvre similarly with the us budget deficit already bloated by large tax cuts at a time of cyclical strength there is little room for another fiscal stimulus package when the next economic downturn occurs the 2008 crisis caught global policy makers flat footed a coordinated global policy response was required to get the world economy out of that recession hopefully this time policy makers will be better prepared when the next recession comes around one must hope that president donald trump s administration will take a more constructive stance with respect to the need for global economic policy coordination however judging by its america first policy to date this seems unlikely to happen desmond lachman is a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute he was formerly a deputy director in the international monetary fund s policy development and review department and the chief emerging market economic strategist at salomon smith barney

shares reflecting the issuance of shares in the private placement equity offering in december 2017 commenting on the results yang xingqiang chairman of adama s board of directors said our robust performance reaching all time record highs of nearly 3 9 billion in sales and 653 million in ebitda continues to demonstrate our ability to overcome challenging market conditions and grow our market share worldwide adama s vast portfolio of differentiated products and global commercial presence enables us to continue our significant growth momentum chen lichtenstein president and ceo of adama added we delivered the strongest fourth quarter results to date driving double digit sales growth over the full year despite continued subdued agricultural commodity prices and challenging weather conditions in key regions we continue to strengthen our core business by investing in our pipeline of new and differentiated products executing on our growth strategy performance in context of market environment the global crop protection market grew somewhat in 2018 due to stronger demand conditions and normalized inventory levels alongside higher procurement costs emanating from china this growth was partially offset by challenging weather conditions especially in europe as well as uncertainty surrounding the us china trade tensions which weighed on agricultural commodity prices continuing to impact farmers incomes for the fourth consecutive year in some regions inventory levels in the crop protection distribution channels were lower compared to 2017 which allowed customary market activity levels to resume softness of many currencies in the fourth quarter when compared to the same quarter last year most notably in brazil and india impacted sales and profit contribution yet was more than offset by volume growth and price increases as previously communicated the negative impact of 2017 european hedge positions largely ended in the first half of the year and had negligible impact on the second half of 2018 there was still however a marked effect over the full year period with a negative impact of almost 40 million on sales and profits the company continues to maintain manufacturing cost discipline and mitigate the impact of shortages in certain raw materials and intermediates mostly owing to increased environmental focus in china the supply constrained environment further contributed to overall stronger pricing despite these uneven agchem market conditions the company delivered record sales in the fourth quarter and full year significantly exceeding all of its fourth quarter 2017 record sales and adjusted profit metrics driven by a combination of robust business growth as well as higher prices and the introduction of new and differentiated products which have supported penetration and continued clear share gains in markets across the globe the company continues to advance collaboration opportunities with other chemchina group entities as well as other entities in china to make the most of its positioning financial highlights revenues grew by 17 3 in the quarter to a record 963 million and by 10 2 in the full year to a record 3 881 million in us dollar terms compared to the corresponding periods last year in constant currency terms revenues grew by 22 8 in the quarter and by 12 4 in the full year this robust performance was driven by strong business growth of the company s increasingly differentiated product portfolio with volumes up by 15 8 in the quarter and 8 1 in the full year in the quarter the company recorded particularly strong performance in latin america led by brazil as well as in north america europe and asia pacific while sales in india were impacted by severe drought in china adama continues to prioritize the sale of branded formulated products through its domestic commercial network as well as their export and distribution through the company s global commercial network and is shifting away from selling unformulated technical product to other intermediaries in addition to the strong business growth improved demand conditions facilitated a stronger pricing environment compensating for the softer currencies and allowing the passing on of some of the impact of the constrained supply and higher procurement costs gross profit in the quarter increased by 17 6 to 312 million gross margin of 32 4 and by 4 4 to 1 291 million gross margin of 33 3 in the full year compared to the corresponding periods last year the higher gross profit in both the quarter and the full year was achieved due to the strong growth and an improved product mix as well as higher pricing which more than offset the impact of higher procurement costs of raw materials and intermediates supply shortages and the softer currencies most notably the brazilian real and the indian rupee as well as the impact of missed high margin sales in europe in the third quarter as a result of the extreme drought in the region operating expenses the company continues to maintain strong operating cost discipline while accommodating significantly higher sales with total operating expenses of 231 million 24 0 of sales in the quarter and 850 million 21 9 of sales in the full year compared to 220 million 26 8 of sales and 800 million 22 7 of sales in the corresponding periods last year respectively sales and marketing expenses in the quarter were 163 million 16 9 of sales in line with 163 million 19 9 of sales in the corresponding period last year sales and marketing expenses in the full year were 626 million 16 1 of sales compared to 595 million 16 9 of sales in the corresponding period last year the moderate increase over the full year reflects primarily an increase in sales marketing and product development teams in growing geographies and higher other variable expenses as a result of the increased sales general and administrative expenses in the quarter were 36 million 3 7 of sales compared to 32 million 3 9 of sales in the corresponding period last year general and administrative expenses in the full year were 135 million 3 5 of sales compared to 133 million 3 8 of sales last year r d expenses in the quarter were 16 million 1 6 of sales compared to 14 million 1 8 of sales in the corresponding period last year r d expenses in the full year were 66 million 1 7 of sales compared to 53 million 1 5 of sales in the corresponding period last year reflecting higher spend on strategic research and development projects in addition to these factors operating expenses in the fourth quarter and the full year benefited somewhat from the softer currencies against the us dollar operating income in the quarter was 81 million increasing by a significant 79 6 over the corresponding period last year bringing operating income over the full year to an all time high of 441 million above last year s record ebitda in the quarter was 134 million a strong 34 5 increase over the corresponding period last year bringing ebitda over the full year to an all time high of 653 million exceeding last year s record financial expenses and investment income total net financial expenses and investment income in the quarter were 34 million compared to 33 million in the corresponding period last year this moderate increase reflects the adoption of a new accounting standard which classifies interest income on sales as revenue adjusting for the impact of the change in accounting standard financial expenses decreased driven by lower interest costs due to reduced debt levels and a decrease in costs of the shekel denominated bonds as a result of the depreciation of the currency over the quarter compared to the corresponding quarter last year these savings were partially offset by an increase in hedging expenses related to balance sheet positions total net financial expenses and investment income in the full year were 131 million compared to 128 million last year the moderate increase over the year reflects the adoption of the new accounting standard adjusting for the impact of the change in accounting standard financial expenses decreased over the year reflecting reduced interest costs due to lower debt levels as well as foreign exchange income related to balance sheet positions somewhat offset by an increase in costs of the cpi linked bonds as a result of an increase in the israeli cpi over the period income before tax in the quarter was 47 million almost four times the corresponding period last year bringing pre tax income over the full year to an all time high of 310 million above last year s record tax expenses net tax expenses were 2 million in the quarter this compares to a 13 million tax income recorded in the corresponding period last year which benefited from the creation of deferred tax assets in 2017 in respect of losses carried forward and timing differences in anticipation of their expected utilization in subsequent periods as well as lower taxable income generated in that period net tax expenses in the full year were 61 million compared to 28 million last year the increase reflects higher taxable income worldwide most notably in brazil as well as the impact of the devaluation of net non cash tax assets as a result of the weakening of the brazilian real against the us dollar the relatively low tax expenses recorded last year reflect the mentioned creation of deferred tax assets in respect of losses carried forward in the fourth quarter of 2017 net income in the quarter was a record 46 million up by 79 compared to the 26 million achieved in the corresponding period last year over the full year net income was 249 million lower than the record 280 million achieved last year reflecting the unusually low tax expense incurred in 2017 working capital at december 31 2018 was higher by 258 million compared to the corresponding point last year supporting the significant momentum generating a 358 million increase in sales over the year strong supply chain discipline allowed maintaining best ever inventory days for this time of year while building a higher inventory level in preparation for the upcoming season as well as absorbing the higher procurement costs the significant increase in sales over the quarter and the full year saw trade receivables higher in comparison to the same point last year despite ongoing tight control of credit ensuring receivable days remain close to their record best levels for this time of year the higher receivables were partially offset by increased trade payables cash flow despite the strong sales growth and associated need for higher working capital the company generated robust operating cash flow of 79 million in the fourth quarter this compares to 217 million in the same period last year during which the company grew at a somewhat more moderate rate over the full year a significant operating cash flow of 301 million was generated compared to 586 million generated in the corresponding period last year net cash used in investing activities was 57 million in the quarter and 142 million in the full year compared to 67 million and 192 million invested in the corresponding periods last year respectively additions to assets include investments in product registrations and other intangible and fixed assets including the transfer of products in europe from syngenta in the first quarter of 2018 proceeds from disposal of assets include the divestment of certain products in europe in the first quarter of 2018 in connection with the approval of the european commission for chemchina s acquisition of syngenta while in 2017 similarly includes one time proceeds resulting from the divestment of certain products in the us in the second quarter of 2017 in connection with the approval of the us ftc for chemchina s acquisition of syngenta as well as the sale of non core assets investments in fixed assets net of investment grants amounted to 32 million in the quarter and 109 million in the full year compared to 38 million and 115 million invested in the corresponding periods last year respectively while free cash flow of 14 million was consumed in the quarter compared to the 115 million generated in the corresponding period last year the company generated continued free cash flow of 79 million in the full year compared to 310 million last year despite the company s strong growth and higher cost environment leverage balance sheet net debt at the end of the quarter was 457 million compared to net debt of 442 million as of december 31 2017 keeping the company s net

to the completion of the divestments and transfers of products related to chemchina s acquisition of syngenta sales increased by 24 1 in the quarter and were flat in the full year in constant currency terms compared with the corresponding periods last year the strong increase in the quarter was driven by significant business growth of 23 8 and modest price increases which more than offset the negative impact of currency moves this strong result in the quarter brought the performance in europe over the full year to modest growth despite the challenging weather conditions that persisted for significant parts of the year this performance over the year against the backdrop of a decline in the overall european market saw adama continue to grow its market share in the region following the unprecedented drought earlier in the year northern europe grew strongly in the fourth quarter the late sowing and favorable rainfall which started in early october facilitated continuous planting extending the herbicide treatment period and allowing for the recovery of herbicide sales mainly in wheat cereals and oilseed rape adama saw particularly strong performance in the ukraine where it launched a number of new products including karneol a distinctive fungicide for orchards combining a high strength fungicide with complementary phosphoric potash plant nutrition calma a differentiated fast acting plant growth regulator for use in cereals and trimbita a three way mixture seed treatment for the combined management of both insects and disease in cereals the company also grew strongly in germany and the czech republic as well as in russia where its comprehensive sugar beet portfolio performed well in southern europe sales grew in the quarter compared with the corresponding period last year despite ongoing challenging weather conditions with the summer drought only breaking in early november this resulted in delayed herbicide consumption and reduction of grass treatment due to lower oilseed rape planted areas as well as lower demand for insecticides due to the late emergence of wheat adama performed well in the southwestern markets especially in spain and italy as well as in france where it saw demand leading into the upcoming season the company received several product registrations in the fourth quarter in france spain portugal greece and italy all planned for launch

by a strong 28 4 in the quarter in constant currency terms compared with the corresponding period last year driven by significant business growth and higher prices the marked performance in the quarter brought growth in the full year to 13 4 in constant currency terms the company s robust business growth in the quarter was driven by strong demand for adama s increasingly differentiated

for the higher procurement costs double digit growth was recorded in consumer and professional solutions with continued strong momentum in both professional pest and industrial vegetation management

for soybean rust outperformed expectations in its first half year of launch and led a strong performance across the company s differentiated portfolio with noteworthy performances also from a number

24 5 in the full year compared with the corresponding periods last year reflecting the softer local currencies asia pacific sales were lower by 9 6 in the quarter in constant currency terms compared with the corresponding period last year with a strong performance in the wider region being more than offset by shifting away from lower margin sales to intermediaries globally and in china towards direct sales through the company s global network over the full year sales increased by 2 8 in constant currency terms with strong demand for the company s differentiated formulated and branded products adama continues to prioritize the sale of these products through its own channels by rapidly shifting away from selling unformulated technical product to intermediaries and in so doing benefiting from the full product positioning as well as end to end margin this shifting reduces total sales in china however sales of the company s branded formulated sales in china continue their strong growth increasing by 40 over the full year in the rest of asia pacific adama grew strongly in the fourth quarter driven by solid business growth and the introduction of new differentiated

turkey israel and west africa in the fourth quarter the company registered nimitz in india to be launched during 2019 this follows multiple product launches in the country in 2018 including barazide

basic and diluted the number of shares used to calculate earnings per share in q4 2017 is 2 341 9 million shares the number of shares used to calculate earnings per share in q4 2018 is 2 446 6 million shares reflecting the issuance of shares in the private placement equity offering in december 2017 commenting on the results yang xingqiang chairman of adama s board of directors said our robust performance reaching all time record highs of nearly 3 9 billion in sales and 653 million in ebitda continues to demonstrate our ability to overcome challenging market conditions and grow our market share worldwide adama s vast portfolio of differentiated products and global commercial presence enables us to continue our significant growth momentum chen lichtenstein president and ceo of adama added we delivered the strongest fourth quarter results to date driving double digit sales growth over the full year despite continued subdued agricultural commodity prices and challenging weather conditions in key regions we continue to strengthen our core business by investing in our pipeline of new and differentiated products executing on our growth strategy performance in context of market environment the global crop protection market grew somewhat in 2018 due to stronger demand conditions and normalized inventory levels alongside higher procurement costs emanating from china this growth was partially offset by challenging weather conditions especially in europe as well as uncertainty surrounding the us china trade tensions which weighed on agricultural commodity prices continuing to impact farmers incomes for the fourth consecutive year in some regions inventory levels in the crop protection distribution channels were lower compared to 2017 which allowed customary market activity levels to resume softness of many currencies in the fourth quarter when compared to the same quarter last year most notably in brazil and india impacted sales and profit contribution yet was more than offset by volume growth and price increases as previously communicated the negative impact of 2017 european hedge positions largely ended in the first half of the year and had negligible impact on the second half of 2018 there was still however a marked effect over the full year period with a negative impact of almost 40 million on sales and profits the company continues to maintain manufacturing cost discipline and mitigate the impact of shortages in certain raw materials and intermediates mostly owing to increased environmental focus in china the supply constrained environment further contributed to overall stronger pricing despite these uneven agchem market conditions the company delivered record sales in the fourth quarter and full year significantly exceeding all of its fourth quarter 2017 record sales and adjusted profit metrics driven by a combination of robust business growth as well as higher prices and the introduction of new and differentiated products which have supported penetration and continued clear share gains in markets across the globe the company continues to advance collaboration opportunities with other chemchina group entities as well as other entities in china to make the most of its positioning financial highlights revenues grew by 17 3 in the quarter to a record 963 million and by 10 2 in the full year to a record 3 881 million in us dollar terms compared to the corresponding periods last year in constant currency terms revenues grew by 22 8 in the quarter and by 12 4 in the full year this robust performance was driven by strong business growth of the company s increasingly differentiated product portfolio with volumes up by 15 8 in the quarter and 8 1 in the full year in the quarter the company recorded particularly strong performance in latin america led by brazil as well as in north america europe and asia pacific while sales in india were impacted by severe drought in china adama continues to prioritize the sale of branded formulated products through its domestic commercial network as well as their export and distribution through the company s global commercial network and is shifting away from selling unformulated technical product to other intermediaries in addition to the strong business growth improved demand conditions facilitated a stronger pricing environment compensating for the softer currencies and allowing the passing on of some of the impact of the constrained supply and higher procurement costs gross profit in the quarter increased by 17 6 to 312 million gross margin of 32 4 and by 4 4 to 1 291 million gross margin of 33 3 in the full year compared to the corresponding periods last year the higher gross profit in both the quarter and the full year was achieved due to the strong growth and an improved product mix as well as higher pricing which more than offset the impact of higher procurement costs of raw materials and intermediates supply shortages and the softer currencies most notably the brazilian real and the indian rupee as well as the impact of missed high margin sales in europe in the third quarter as a result of the extreme drought in the region operating expenses the company continues to maintain strong operating cost discipline while accommodating significantly higher sales with total operating expenses of 231 million 24 0 of sales in the quarter and 850 million 21 9 of sales in the full year compared to 220 million 26 8 of sales and 800 million 22 7 of sales in the corresponding periods last year respectively sales and marketing expenses in the quarter were 163 million 16 9 of sales in line with 163 million 19 9 of sales in the corresponding period last year sales and marketing expenses in the full year were 626 million 16 1 of sales compared to 595 million 16 9 of sales in the corresponding period last year the moderate increase over the full year reflects primarily an increase in sales marketing and product development teams in growing geographies and higher other variable expenses as a result of the increased sales general and administrative expenses in the quarter were 36 million 3 7 of sales compared to 32 million 3 9 of sales in the corresponding period last year general and administrative expenses in the full year were 135 million 3 5 of sales compared to 133 million 3 8 of sales last year r d expenses in the quarter were 16 million 1 6 of sales compared to 14 million 1 8 of sales in the corresponding period last year r d expenses in the full year were 66 million 1 7 of sales compared to 53 million 1 5 of sales in the corresponding period last year reflecting higher spend on strategic research and development projects in addition to these factors operating expenses in the fourth quarter and the full year benefited somewhat from the softer currencies against the us dollar operating income in the quarter was 81 million increasing by a significant 79 6 over the corresponding period last year bringing operating income over the full year to an all time high of 441 million above last year s record ebitda in the quarter was 134 million a strong 34 5 increase over the corresponding period last year bringing ebitda over the full year to an all time high of 653 million exceeding last year s record financial expenses and investment income total net financial expenses and investment income in the quarter were 34 million compared to 33 million in the corresponding period last year this moderate increase reflects the adoption of a new accounting standard which classifies interest income on sales as revenue adjusting for the impact of the change in accounting standard financial expenses decreased driven by lower interest costs due to reduced debt levels and a decrease in costs of the shekel denominated bonds as a result of the depreciation of the currency over the quarter compared to the corresponding quarter last year these savings were partially offset by an increase in hedging expenses related to balance sheet positions total net financial expenses and investment income in the full year were 131 million compared to 128 million last year the moderate increase over the year reflects the adoption of the new accounting standard adjusting for the impact of the change in accounting standard financial expenses decreased over the year reflecting reduced interest costs due to lower debt levels as well as foreign exchange income related to balance sheet positions somewhat offset by an increase in costs of the cpi linked bonds as a result of an increase in the israeli cpi over the period income before tax in the quarter was 47 million almost four times the corresponding period last year bringing pre tax income over the full year to an all time high of 310 million above last year s record tax expenses net tax expenses were 2 million in the quarter this compares to a 13 million tax income recorded in the corresponding period last year which benefited from the creation of deferred tax assets in 2017 in respect of losses carried forward and timing differences in anticipation of their expected utilization in subsequent periods as well as lower taxable income generated in that period net tax expenses in the full year were 61 million compared to 28 million last year the increase reflects higher taxable income worldwide most notably in brazil as well as the impact of the devaluation of net non cash tax assets as a result of the weakening of the brazilian real against the us dollar the relatively low tax expenses recorded last year reflect the mentioned creation of deferred tax assets in respect of losses carried forward in the fourth quarter of 2017 net income in the quarter was a record 46 million up by 79 compared to the 26 million achieved in the corresponding period last year over the full year net income was 249 million lower than the record 280 million achieved last year reflecting the unusually low tax expense incurred in 2017 working capital at december 31 2018 was higher by 258 million compared to the corresponding point last year supporting the significant momentum generating a 358 million increase in sales over the year strong supply chain discipline allowed maintaining best ever inventory days for this time of year while building a higher inventory level in preparation for the upcoming season as well as absorbing the higher procurement costs the significant increase in sales over the quarter and the full year saw trade receivables higher in comparison to the same point last year despite ongoing tight control of credit ensuring receivable days remain close to their record best levels for this time of year the higher receivables were partially offset by increased trade payables cash flow despite the strong sales growth and associated need for higher working capital the company generated robust operating cash flow of 79 million in the fourth quarter this compares to 217 million in the same period last year during which the company grew at a somewhat more moderate rate over the full year a significant operating cash flow of 301 million was generated compared to 586 million generated in the corresponding period last year net cash used in investing activities was 57 million in the quarter and 142 million in the full year compared to 67 million and 192 million invested in the corresponding periods last year respectively additions to assets include investments in product registrations and other intangible and fixed assets including the transfer of products in europe from syngenta in the first quarter of 2018 proceeds from disposal of assets include the divestment of certain products in europe in the first quarter of 2018 in connection with the approval of the european commission for chemchina s acquisition of syngenta while in 2017 similarly includes one time proceeds resulting from the divestment of certain products in the us in the second quarter of 2017 in connection with the approval of the us ftc for chemchina s acquisition of syngenta as well as the sale of non core assets investments in fixed assets net of investment grants amounted to 32 million in the quarter and 109 million in the full year compared to 38 million and 115 million invested in the corresponding periods last year respectively while free cash flow of 14 million was consumed in the quarter compared to the 115 million generated in the corresponding period last year the company generated continued free cash flow of 79 million in the full year compared to 310 million last year despite the company s strong growth and higher cost environment leverage balance sheet net debt at the end of the quarter was 457 million compared to net debt of 442 million as of december 31 2017 keeping the company s net

europe closed 2018 in line with 2017 a significant achievement in the face of several challenges during the year severe drought 2017 hedge loss supply shortages and a notable change in portfolio due to the completion of the divestments and transfers of products related to chemchina s acquisition of syngenta sales increased by 24 1 in the quarter and were flat in the full year in constant currency terms compared with the corresponding periods last year the strong increase in the quarter was driven by significant business growth of 23 8 and modest price increases which more than offset the negative impact of currency moves this strong result in the quarter brought the performance in europe over the full year to modest growth despite the challenging weather conditions that persisted for significant parts of the year this performance over the year against the backdrop of a decline in the overall european market saw adama continue to grow its market share in the region following the unprecedented drought earlier in the year northern europe grew strongly in the fourth quarter the late sowing and favorable rainfall which started in early october facilitated continuous planting extending the herbicide treatment period and allowing for the recovery of herbicide sales mainly in wheat cereals and oilseed rape adama saw particularly strong performance in the ukraine where it launched a number of new products including karneol a distinctive fungicide for orchards combining a high strength fungicide with complementary phosphoric potash plant nutrition calma a differentiated fast acting plant growth regulator for use in cereals and trimbita a three way mixture seed treatment for the combined management of both insects and disease in cereals the company also grew strongly in germany and the czech republic as well as in russia where its comprehensive sugar beet portfolio performed well in southern europe sales grew in the quarter compared with the corresponding period last year despite ongoing challenging weather conditions with the summer drought only breaking in early november this resulted in delayed herbicide consumption and reduction of grass treatment due to lower oilseed rape planted areas as well as lower demand for insecticides due to the late emergence of wheat adama performed well in the southwestern markets especially in spain and italy as well as in france where it saw demand leading into the upcoming season the company received several product registrations in the fourth quarter in france spain portugal greece and italy all planned for launch in the 2019 season in us dollar terms sales in europe grew by 22 4 in the fourth quarter and by 1 1 over the full year compared with the corresponding periods last year north america sales increased by a strong 28 4 in the quarter in constant currency terms compared with the corresponding period last year driven by significant business growth and higher prices the marked performance in the quarter brought growth in the full year to 13 4 in constant currency terms the company s robust business growth in the quarter was driven by strong demand for adama s increasingly differentiated portfolio from both distributors and retail customers in the us the company benefited from the stronger pricing environment which continued in the face of industry wide supply shortages compensating for the higher procurement costs double digit growth was recorded in consumer and professional solutions with continued strong momentum in both professional pest and industrial vegetation management in us dollar terms sales in north america increased by 28 3 in the quarter and by 13 8 in the full year compared to the corresponding periods last year latin america sales increased by a significant 48 9 in the quarter and by 36 6 in the full year in constant currency terms compared with the corresponding periods last year the robust growth in the fourth quarter was driven by a strong performance in brazil alongside growth in most other markets throughout the region adama continues to develop its differentiated portfolio in the region in brazil cronnos tov the novel three way mixture fungicide for soybean rust outperformed expectations in its first half year of launch and led a strong performance across the company s differentiated portfolio with noteworthy performances also from a number

24 5 in the full year compared with the corresponding periods last year reflecting the softer local currencies asia pacific sales were lower by 9 6 in the quarter in constant currency terms compared with the corresponding period last year with a strong performance in the wider region being more than offset by shifting away from lower margin sales to intermediaries globally and in china towards direct sales through the company s global network over the full year sales increased by 2 8 in constant currency terms with strong demand for the company s differentiated formulated and branded products adama continues to prioritize the sale of these products through its own channels by rapidly shifting away from selling unformulated technical product to intermediaries and in so doing benefiting from the full product positioning as well as end to end margin this shifting reduces total sales in china however sales of the company s branded formulated sales in china continue their strong growth increasing by 40 over the full year in the rest of asia pacific adama grew strongly in the fourth quarter driven by solid business growth and the introduction of new differentiated

turkey israel and west africa in the fourth quarter the company registered nimitz in india to be launched during 2019 this follows multiple product launches in the country in 2018 including barazide

it is difficult to forecast when the next global economic recession will happen it is much easier to predict its severity this is particularly the case in the light of excessively high global debt levels asset price bubbles and the generalised mispricing of credit market risk those considerations coupled with the lack of adequate policy instruments to respond to the next global slowdown point to a much more severe crisis than the average post war recession among the more disturbing vulnerabilities of the global economy is the large amount of debt spawned by years of ultra unorthodox monetary policy by the world s major central banks according to the international monetary fund the global debt to gdp level is 250 around 30 percentage points higher than it was on the eve of the 2008 financial crisis handling a high debt level in the midst of a recession will be a major challenge for policy makers it may lead to a wave of defaults that could cause financial market distress which in turn would risk deepening the recession that challenge would be compounded substantially if that debt proved to be owed by borrowers of dubious creditworthiness there are many reasons to fear that years of unorthodox monetary policy and low interest rates have led to a marked deterioration in lending standards as former us federal reserve chair janet yellen cautioned recently the size of the risky us leveraged loan market has doubled to more than 1 2tn from around 600bn on the eve of the 2008 recession at the same time there has been a large increase in lending to corporations of questionable creditworthiness in emerging markets particularly troubling is the fact that more than 3tn of that debt is dollar denominated which will be difficult for those companies to repay if the world economy were to weaken and the dollar to strengthen an important reason to be more concerned about high debt levels today than we might have been in 2008 is that the mispricing of global debt in the current economic cycle has become much more pervasive in 2008 that mispricing was largely limited to us mortgage lending today it appears to be across the board and around the world this could lead to considerable financial market dislocation if there is a serious repricing of risk to more normal levels and the asset price bubbles in the global equity and housing markets burst examples of credit risk mispricing include the us high yield debt market and the emerging economy corporate debt market borrowing rates in both markets have reached levels that do not nearly compensate the lenders for default risk mispricing was also evident in the sovereign debt markets of highly indebted countries like italy where until recently the government could borrow long term at interest rates close to those in the us the us is less well equipped now than it was in 2008 to fight the next recession with interest rates still low and with considerable political resistance to another round of quantitative easing the fed has little room for manoeuvre similarly with the us budget deficit already bloated by large tax cuts at a time of cyclical strength there is little room for another fiscal stimulus package when the next economic downturn occurs the 2008 crisis caught global policy makers flat footed a coordinated global policy response was required to get the world economy out of that recession hopefully this time policy makers will be better prepared when the next recession comes around one must hope that president donald trump s administration will take a more constructive stance with respect to the need for global economic policy coordination however judging by its america first policy to date this seems unlikely to happen desmond lachman is a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute he was formerly a deputy director in the international monetary fund s policy development and review department and the chief emerging market economic strategist at salomon smith barney
so far this decade brazil and russia s currencies have turned in nearly identical performances spot real brl and spot ruble rub values are down about 55 versus the u s dollar usd figure 1 figure 1 spot real and ruble are down about 55 this decade versus the u s dollar however the evolution of spot prices doesn t tell the whole story of currency movements because the spot price ignores the accumulated interest rate carried over brazilian and russian short term interest rates have averaged 7 7 and 6 9 higher than u s short term rates respectively even with the interest rate carried over being reinvested brl and rub have turned in a remarkably similar performance so far this decade figure 2 in some respects their similar performance is logical both nations are commodity exporters whose fortunes depend heavily on commodity prices in other respects however their similar performance versus the dollar is surprising given their radically different fiscal paths figure 2 reinvested rolled futures contracts account for carry differentials that spot prices ignore diverging fiscal paths russia has been on an ultra conservative fiscal path since 2011 it has been alternating between small deficits and occasional surpluses by contrast brazil ran mid sized deficits from 2009 until 2013 before hemorrhaging red ink from 2014 figure 3 the result is that brazil has an accumulated public sector debt equivalent to 86 of gdp and that ratio is rising in stark contrast russia s public sector debt totals 14 7 of gdp and is falling there is also a contrast in private sector debt between the two countries russian private sector debt amounts to 64 of gdp 17 household and 47 non financial corporations somewhat lower than brazil s 72 of gdp 28 households and 44 non financial corporations russian president vladimir putin convinced the legislature to enact unpopular pension reforms raising the retirement age from 60 to 65 for men and 55 to 60 for women these reforms sparked protests and the government gave some ground the original proposal raised women s retirement from 55 to 63 but nevertheless got the reforms through what s interesting is that russia enacted the reforms while the government was in a strong fiscal position and wasn t forced into it by a financial crisis brazil s situation could hardly be more different reforming brazil s overly generous pension systems for public workers is high up on president jair bolsonaro s agenda unlike putin however who s united russia party commands a large majority 340 of 450 seats in the duma bolsonaro s social liberal party psl controls only 52 out of 513 seats in brazil s lower house to be fair this somewhat understates bolsonaro s influence he won 46 of the vote in the first round and 55 in the second round and has many allies among the other parties in the legislature nevertheless getting pension reform legislation through and taking other steps to reduce the budget deficit such as raising tax revenues will be vastly more complicated than in russia and will involve cross party coalitions moreover it involves taking on pension reforms not just for ordinary civil servants but also for the police and military who are among bolsonaro s core supporters so far bolsonaro s early successes have mainly been symbolic investors are still waiting on the enactment of substantive reforms figure 3 brazil s public debt is 86 3 of gdp and rising russia s is 14 7 of gdp and falling that said surely currency markets are aware of the differences between brazil and russia s debt levels fiscal trajectory and political situations so why do investors treat the two currencies in such a similar manner there are several possible answers real optimism perhaps unfounded that bolsonaro will achieve meaningful reforms ruble pessimism about the negative impact of sanctions against russia the influence of china and commodity prices in other words brl and rub s fate is governed by forces bigger than domestic debt and politics in many respects market reaction to bolsonaro s election as president is reminiscent of how investors reacted to indian prime minister narendra modi s election in 2014 the indian rupee inr rallied strongly in anticipation of his win and remained strong for about two months after he took power after that it was mostly downhill for inr as modi delivered a mixed record reforms the real could follow a similar pattern if bolsonaro fails to deliver on key reforms and is unable to achieve the needed fiscal consolidation if investors are overly optimistic for what bolsonaro might achieve in brazil they might be overly pessimistic regarding the russian ruble despite russia s robust fiscal health the country does face long term challenges falling population and an extreme dependence on natural resources for export commodities account for 75 of russia s exports and oil alone is about 60 russia s commodity dependence is easily evident by looking at oil prices and the ruble graphed side by side from 2011 until 2017 they moved in lockstep figure 4 since 2017 the ruble has underperformed burdened by the pressure of eu and u s sanctions stemming from the ukraine conflict and alleged election interference figure 4 after tracking oil closely for years the ruble has recently underperformed the good news about sanctions is that they are already in place and are unlikely to get worse at least from the eu if the eu was to begin easing sanctions that could prove quite bullish for the ruble the future course of u s sanctions policy is less clear u s sanctions could pose a downside risk however if washington was to enact tougher sanctions later this year brazil s currency also displays its own dependence on commodities although brazil is a significant oil producer it consumes most of what it produces domestically and is not a major net exporter oil exports account for about 10 of brazil s total exports it is however a large exporter of industrial metals such as iron ore 20 of total as well as crops such as soybeans and corn 36 of total this helps to explain why despite the extreme differences in the brazilian and russian domestic situations the currencies move more or less in lockstep they are responding to the same underlying driver of returns global commodity prices commodity prices themselves are responding to a large extent to fluctuations in chinese economic growth as we have pointed out in past research most commodities including oil industrial metals such as copper and agricultural goods have a strong correlation to a narrow measure of chinese economic growth called the li keqiang index which measures the growth rates of chinese electricity demand rail freight volumes and bank loans figure 5 the same is true of the currencies of commodity exporting nations such as brazil russia australia canada and south africa figure 5 china s li keqiang index often presages moves in brl rub and commodity prices one might argue that only 22 of brazil s exports and 11 of russian exports head to china that may be true but chinese demand plays a large role in setting the global price in u s dollars for nearly every commodity irrespective of who the ultimate buyer is to that end chinese stimulus measures are potentially good news for brl and rub china is stoking its slowing economy by easing monetary and fiscal policies so far this year the people bank of china has continued to slash its reserve requirement ratio while keeping interest rates at record lows meanwhile the chinese government announced that another tax cut will soon go into effect all of this has steepened the chinese yield curve which over the past dozen years has proven itself to be a fairly solid indicator of changes in the pace of china s economic growth china s growth possibly picking up quickly in 2019 could boost both commodity prices as well as emerging market currencies such as brl and rub over the course of 2019 and 2020 looking deeper into the 2020s however brl and rub could be in for a challenging decade whatever the results of china s short term stimulus measures the chinese economy over the longer term could be beset by excessive levels of debt which are being made worse by the short term stimulus measures and strong demographic headwinds debt and demographics bode poorly for commodity demand during the 2020s especially due to abundant supplies and for the real and ruble that said when differentiating between these otherwise similarly behaving currencies brazil s fiscal trajectory worries us a great deal whereas russia s does not bottom line so far this decade the real and the ruble have moved in lockstep yet russia and brazil s fiscal and political situations could hardly be more different both nations depend to a great extent on commodity exports both currencies correlated strongly to the ebb and flow of chinese demand
modern monetary theorists ignore how their policies could hurt developing countries modern money theory mmt has recently gained a remarkable amount of attention this has stemmed largely from the shout outs it has received from prominent progressive politicians such as alexandria ocasio cortez its recent appearances in the news and social media have also drawn a variety of criticisms from economists of different stripes though much of the previous debate about mmt has concentrated on theoretical and doctrinal issues less seriously discussed have been those mmt monetary and fiscal policy proposals that have attracted the attention of progressive politicians and activists i recently presented a paper at the economic association conference in new york in early march in order to engage in a constructive debate of mmt monetary and fiscal policy ideas here are the main points from that presentation and paper roughly speaking as developed by randall wray stephanie kelton and others mmt s macroeconomic approach amounts to abba lerner s functional finance approach with several twists sovereign money and debt monetization for them the main goal of fiscal and monetary policy is to maintain full employment without excessive inflation their point about sovereign money is that governments do not need to save or levy taxes to pay for goods and services because all they need to do is print their sovereign currencies and use this money to acquire them in fact when the central bank and the treasury are institutionally connected this money payment happens automatically according to mmt but in the case of the u s as marc lavoie points out these policies amount to deliberate decisions by the federal reserve to monetize treasury debt since the federal reserve charter prohibits the fed from directly lending to the u s government what then is the role of monetary and fiscal policy the functional finance claim is that the role of taxes and borrowing should be to drain spending from the economy when necessary to prevent excessive inflation not to finance spending per se mmt advocates add that the proper target of monetary policy should be to keep interest rates very low in the long run while fiscal policy should be adjusted when necessary to maintain full employment and moderate inflation according to mmt any level of sovereign debt is sustainable in the narrow sense that the issuers of sovereign money will never need to default on its debt it just needs to print more money to service and even repay the debt if necessary there are obvious questions about the viability of mmt macro policies what would be their impacts on inflation exchange rate instability interest rates financial instability investment and economic growth what ultimately are the limits and constraints on mmt macro policy wray and other mmt analysts have recognized many of these issues and have discussed them in various writings including wray s 2012 mmt primer but in my view mmt advocates have not sufficiently addressed the institutional empirical and policy realities of the modern international financial system and their implications for the limitations on mmt policy my conclusion is that when one takes these into account the substantial empirical and institutional literature that has studied these issues the applicability of mmt policy proposals appears to be at best extremely limited to start even though mmt advocates claim that its macroeconomic framework applies to all countries with sovereign currencies there is significant evidence that it does not apply to the vast majority of such countries in the developing world that are integrated into global financial markets as is well known these countries are subject to the vagaries of international capital flows sometimes called sudden stops the problem is that in light of these flows these countries have limited fiscal and monetary policy space surely insufficient to conduct mmt prescribed monetary and fiscal policies for full employment wray argues that that flexible exchange rates are sufficient to provide sufficient policy space for these countries to undertake mmt macro policies occasionally the issue of capital controls is briefly mentioned but not seriously discussed as a complementary policy but a careful survey of the empirical evidence casts grave doubts on the effectiveness of flexible rates for giving policy autonomy or insulating these countries from the vagaries of global financial flows this problem is worse for countries that cannot borrow in their own currencies but also applies to small open countries that are able to borrow in their own currencies the upshot is that only countries that issue their own internationally accepted currency might have the policy space to conduct mmt policies even for those countries that issue their own international currencies the sustainability and exploitability of the international role is not absolute the country that has the greatest fiscal and monetary space is the united states which issues the predominant key currency the us dollar whereas wray has written that the predominance of the dollar is not something we will need to worry about in our lifetime historical and empirical evidence suggests that even considerable forces for persistence of key currency positions can weaken over time perhaps even rapidly and dramatically this is especially true when there are competing currencies with both a will and a way to achieve key currency status china and to a lesser extent the euro zone are competitors in this sense there is significant evidence of a move to a multi currency system in which dollar holders can more easily switch out of the dollar if significant perceived problems arise such as high exchange rate instability or excessive inflation in such a world the ability of the us government to exploit the dollar s exorbitant privilege to sustain very large debt levels or sustained low interest rates will have limits to be sure these limits are uncertain but history suggests that the us cannot completely ignore them but even if the dollar s role continues indefinitely to create space to implement mmt macro policies that doesn t mean that the us should actually do so mmt proposed policy amounts to an america first macroeconomic policy while it is traditional for the us and other countries to ignore the impacts of their macroeconomic policies on the rest of the world presumably a progressive approach to policy would adopt a more internationalist perspective there is significant evidence that there are substantial spillover effects of us monetary policy on emerging market and developing countries that are transmitted largely through the dollar s predominant international role these spillover effects can be highly destabilizing if the federal reserve pursues excessively loose or tight monetary policy without any consideration of their impacts on developing countries for example as jane d arista shows the low interest rates of the greenspan era helped to generate dangerous levels of dollar denominated leverage in emerging markets which contributed to the spread of financial crisis in 2007 2008 a more internationalist progressive approach to macroeconomic would take these impacts into account at a minimum to address these impacts mmt analysts would have to evaluate institutional arrangements such as capital controls and financial regulations to mitigate these negative impacts these receive at most only a cursory mention in their work mmt advocates might argue that their proposed low us interest rates would facilitate growth in developing countries by reducing the cost of capital for these countries so that the spill overs would be good not bad but by itself this claim ignores the highly speculative nature of modern international financial markets a careful analysis of the impact of low long term interest rates shows that in the absence of strong financial regulations domestically and internationally the impact is likely to be the accumulation of high leverage asset bubbles and financial instability yet mmt theorists talk very little in the context of their proposed macroeconomic policies about the necessary role of financial regulations and capital account regulations in channeling funds productively and limiting financial crises this is puzzling in view of their long association with the work of hyman minsky but it is true nonetheless in short this relative lack of attention to financial instability and financial regulation in the context of their proposed monetary and fiscal policy is a key example of their inattention to institutional and empirical constraints on the policies they propose as i mentioned earlier much of mmt s policy appeal stems from the perception that the theory implies that progressives with programmatic plans do not need to say or worry about the costs of these programs or how they are going to be paid for but even within the framework of mmt itself this claim of a free lunch is incorrect recall that mmt theorists recognize that at or around full employment further economic expansion could lead to an increase in inflation and if this fiscal and monetary expansion were pushed too far inflation could accelerate in this world at full employment the government would have to raise taxes or cut private or other public spending in order to make room for new fiscal initiatives this is no free lunch while stephanie kelton a key point person on policy issues has occasionally indicated in interviews that at full employment such trade offs need to be considered the thrust of the mmt argument sits elsewhere the point made over and over is that the us can afford any policy by simply printing money and that any level of debt is sustainable but the mmt proponents do not emphasize sufficiently in policy arenas that they use the terms affordable and sustainable in narrow technical ways that are not all that economically meaningful in wray s text referenced earlier afford means that the fed can simply print the money and sustainable simply means that since the fed can print the money the us never has to formally default it does not speak to the macroeconomic impacts of these policies given the mmt emphasis on this point progressive policy activists can be forgiven for missing the occasional qualifications in interviews and footnotes scattered around to see how dangerous this illusion is consider this example let s say there is a coalition of progressive groups want passed into law the following set of policies 1 employer of last resort policy to guarantee full employment a favorite policy of mmt advocates 2 a green new deal 3 medicare for all 4 free or debt free college education 5 universal child care the illusion of empowerment that mmt brings is that the coalition of forces that promotes these plans don t have to discuss who is going to pay for these programs but going through a simple exercise shows that this is inconsistent with mmt theory itself if we implemented all these policies then we would have over full employment this is true by definition in fact because the elr policy creates full employment the green new deal plan itself has a public job guarantee program so this set of programs would generate full employment and full capacity utilization even if these are envisioned as buffer programs implementing the remaining programs at some point would generate over full employment if the coalition does not find a way to pay for the group of programs as a whole those that come up above the full employment line will have to be abandoned whose policy gets to be implemented first is therefore crucial so the question is whose plan should be on the chopping block in this world the different members of the coalition will simply have to fight it out amongst themselves it would be better to recognize at the outset that there is no free lunch as the economy moves toward full employment it would be better to engage in the old fashioned exercise of determining national priorities to free up production capacity in a progressive way rather than cut one of the progressive policies it would be better for example to cut excessive government military expenditures and raise taxes on the wealthy this means that policy advocates do have to discuss from the beginning national priorities taxes and means to pay for programs even within the narrow confines of mmt the failure to do so leads to a completely perverse situation that spares the progressive s enemies and gores their allies a better alternative macroeconomic policy framework to guide progressive programs can in fact be built on the principles long annunciated by heterodox economists and increasingly even some newly enlightened keynesian economists analyze the costs and employment implications of various policies of course in a recession and with high unemployment these opportunity costs are much less even perhaps close to zero understand the long term investment aspects of the policy and the social returns to those investments insist that increasing the debt to finance productive investments is sensible understand the externality solving and social wealth creation that programs implement assess the superiority of these proposed policies relative to other uses of our resources and cut back on those uses that are found inferior we already largely know what those are military spending fossil fuel production and consumption financial speculation that threatens our financial stability and the accumulation of excessive wealth that destroys our democracy in this conceptualization functional finance might have some important perspectives to offer to be sure but the theory and logistics of sovereign money and mmt i would argue offer very little of use to any progressive policy revolution
use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions creating collateral security packages types of collateral what types of collateral and security interests are available angolan law offers a range of collateral and security types a borrower may provide guarantee under the form of attachment preferential credits special guarantees such as money deposit debt securities precious stones or metals pledge mortgage or bank guarantee real estate securities although the angolan constitution recognises private ownership alongside public and community ownership it also states that the ownership of land originally belongs to the state and that it may if considered appropriate using a public interest criterion transfer it to private individuals or entities while the constitution allows private ownership with some latitude the land act is much more restrictive hence the transfer of ownership in some categories of land in spite of being possible almost never occurs the transfer of minor land rights eg leasehold right of customary dominium utile right of civil dominium utile right to temporary occupation is the most usual form of allocation of rights over land upon prior authorisation of the holder of such minor land rights securities over said rights may be awarded given that such minor land rights relate to immovable property the security shall be bestowed in the form of mortgage and through the execution of a notarial deed and the subsequent relevant registration it is worth mentioning the possibility of awarding a factory mortgage over a plant which includes not only the real estate property itself but also its contents eg all machines and equipment finally a pledge over equipment may be granted subject to the execution of a written agreement signed by the parties and duly certified by a notary security over receivables under angolan law the creditor is allowed to secure its rights against the debtor through the grant of a security over receivables the assignment of receivables rights and credits and the assignment of revenues the grant of a security over receivables shall be executed through a written agreement both the grant of a security over receivables and the assignment of receivables rights and credits can only be executed upon notification of the relevant debtor through the assignment of revenues which shall be executed by notarial deed the debtor can ascribe to the creditor the revenues generated by its immovable and movable assets security over shares a pledge of shares can be granted over shares of commercial companies incorporated under the laws of angola the grant of a pledge of shares of a limited liability company by quotas where the share capital is represented by a form of nominative shares shall be executed through written agreement and subsequently registered with the competent commercial registry office security over mining rights the 2010 constitution of angola ascribes the ownership of all natural resources within the angolan jurisdiction to the state the angolan jurisdiction comprises the onshore territory of angola the internal waters the territorial sea the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf and therefore all oil and gas fields located in such areas belong to the public domain of angola all mining rights are exclusively assigned to the national concessionaire moreover all petroleum deposits existing in angola are an integral part of the public domain with the national concessionaire being the exclusive holder of all mineral rights related to such deposits pursuant to petroleum activities law mineral rights are granted to the national concessionaire which cannot assign these mining rights but may associate with an upstanding domestic or foreign company having the necessary technical and financial capacity the associates of the national concessionaire do not own the mineral rights nor may be deemed as a concessionaire thus the provision of a security by a private entity over the mining rights cannot be provided since such rights cannot be encumbered given that such rights belong to the angolan state collateral perfecting how is a security interest in each type of collateral perfected and how is its priority established are any fees taxes or other charges payable to perfect a security interest and if so are there lawful techniques to minimise them may a corporate entity in the capacity of agent or trustee hold collateral on behalf of the project lenders as the secured party is it necessary for the security agent and trustee to hold any licences to hold or enforce such security as a rule the angolan law does not require any special formalities or written documents for the perfection of securities the exceptions to such principles are covered in question 1 the registry and execution of the documents supporting the grant of securities namely mortgages is subject to the payment of a stamp duty tax the applicable rates may vary between 0 1 per cent and 0 3 per cent notarial fees charged by the public notaries whenever required may vary according to the specific guarantee to be provided assuring absence of liens how can a creditor assure itself as to the absence of liens with priority to the creditor s lien under the angolan civil code cc some credits benefit from prior ranking over others which means that some credits are paid with preference over others preferential credits may be over movable property or over real estate preferential credits over movable property may be general when they cover all movable assets as is the case of the credits arising from an employment contract or special if otherwise the preferential credit targets only certain assets conversely preferential credits over real estate are always special given that they refer to certain real estate property eg state credits from property taxes as to the order of preference the following rules apply between a third party s guarantee and a general preferential credit over movables the first prevails however if a special preferential credit over moveables conflicts with a third party s guarantee the oldest credit prevails and finally between a preferential credit over real estate and a third party s guarantee over the same real estate property the first prevails as per the civil procedural code cpc after the liquidation of the debtor s assets the creditors shall be paid according to the above mentioned rules hence the time of registration of a security is relevant for the purposes of determining the priority of the creditor enforcing collateral rights outside the context of a bankruptcy proceeding what steps should a project lender take to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral as a rule the enforcement of guarantees depends on judicial proceedings however the cc foresees some mechanisms to enable the creditors to secure their rights outside or before a judicial proceeding for instance the creditor is allowed to retain the debtor s assets until the latter complies with its contractual obligations moreover in the event the debtor does not do so the creditor may replace the debtor in the exercise of its patrimonial rights against a third party unless owing to its nature such rights can only be exercised by the debtor enforcing collateral rights following bankruptcy how does a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the project company affect the ability of a project lender to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral are there any preference periods clawback rights or other preferential creditors rights eg tax debts employees claims with respect to the collateral what entities are excluded from bankruptcy proceedings and what legislation applies to them what processes other than court proceedings are available to seize the assets of the project company in an enforcement the bankruptcy legal framework set forth in cpc was designed to protect creditors for instance the assets belonging to a company that has been declared bankrupt are seized in order to protect the creditor s rights upon the declaration of bankruptcy by the judgment of a court the maturity of the company s debts occurs and all actions carried out by the company affecting the creditor s patrimonial guarantee may be deemed null void or ineffective upon the fulfilment of certain requirements the ranking of the credits is addressed above being a foreign or national creditor does not influence the ranking there are certain entities excluded from bankruptcy proceedings and others that are subject to special bankruptcy proceedings the angolan central bank bna cannot be declared bankrupt the general preventive means of bankruptcy are not applicable to financial institutions the regime governing said entities is the one set forth in the framework act of financial institutions and the public business sector act is the statute governing the special procedures of liquidation and winding up of public companies regarding the processes other than court proceedings available to seize the assets of the project company see question 4 foreign exchange and withholding tax issues restrictions controls fees and taxes what are the restrictions controls fees taxes or other charges on foreign currency exchange the foreign exchange act governs commercial and financial transactions having an actual or potential impact on the balance of payments of angola and is applicable to capital transactions and foreign exchange fx trading the fx operations deemed most relevant are the following purchase or sale of foreign currency opening and operation of foreign currency accounts in angola by fx or non fx residents opening and operation of local currency accounts in angola by non fx residents and settlement of any transaction relating to goods invisible items of trade or capital payments between fx residents and non fx residents are subject to bna s control either prior authorisation or subsequent notification the specific fx rules applicable to currency transfers between a fx resident and a non fx resident are subject to different requirements depending on whether the underlying transaction relates to invisible items of trade service fees royalties etc dividends or

periodically organises public auctions for the sale of foreign currency us dollars and euros to commercial banks for each one of these auctions the bna expressly decides what the currency sold may be used for clearly identifying these specific purposes such auctions are attended by the bna and financial institution duly authorised by the bna to carry out foreign exchange trade additionally banking institutions are authorised to trade foreign currency with each other with other financial institutions duly authorised for such purpose and with the public out of the sessions mentioned above using an exchange rate freely set the bna is responsible for calculating the reference exchange rate investment returns what are the restrictions controls fees and taxes on remittances of investment returns or payments of principal interest or premiums on loans or bonds to parties in other jurisdictions the remittance of investment returns is only possible under a private investment project approved hitherto under the private investment act pia a new pia npia was approved by the angolan parliament on 17 may 2018 this statutory instrument shall only enter into force once enacted by the president and published in the angolan official gazette diário da república comments in relation to the npia were made considering the draft proposal submitted for discussion by the angola parliament and are subject to further review once the final gazetted version of the npia is made available once the private investment project has been implemented and upon proof of such implementation the foreign investor enjoys the right to transfer profits and dividends abroad as well as other amounts related to the investment made however under the pia and except in the case of reinvestment in angola profits and dividends distributed to natural or legal persons are subject to an investment tax surcharge levied on the amount that surpasses the share of equity based on the draft proposal reviewed under the npia the investment tax surcharge established in the pia will be suppressed the payment of principal interest or premiums on loans or bonds is classified as a capital operation under decree no 23 98 of 24 july however full or partial repayment of loans and other credits whatever the form nature or title thereof is only deemed as a capital operation when it is for a term exceeding one year with the exception of loans and other credits exclusively civil in nature applications for capital operations must be submitted by the interested parties to a financial institution authorised to carry out foreign exchange trade which forwards them to the bna following authorisation of the operation and the issuance of a capital export licence the applicant may export the capital which can only be done through banks authorised to carry out foreign exchange trade in angola foreign earnings must project companies repatriate foreign earnings if so must they be converted to local currency and what further restrictions exist over their use both the pia and npia allow foreign investors to repatriate abroad the earnings of the relevant private investment project implemented in angola however repatriation is not mandatory the creation of new companies or any branches abroad as well as buying shares of companies domiciled outside the country using capital domiciled in angola is considered a medium or long term capital operation and as such is subject to the requirements of prior authorisation by the bna the law limits to financial institutions domiciled in angola the ability to export capital after authorisation by the bna in certain cases this authorisation may be delegated to credit institutions the foreign exchange authorisation attributed to the holder of a licence to export capital cannot be used for purposes other than those for which it was granted in these cases the amounts exported abroad must be subsequently repatriated to angola may project companies establish and maintain foreign currency accounts in other jurisdictions and locally foreign currency accounts may be held by fx residents and non residents subject to the limitations established by bna order no 2 17 of 3 february 2017 according to this instrument foreign currency credit accounts may be held and managed for the following grounds funds that came from abroad or funds arising from financial applications made through financial institutions on the other hand foreign currency debit accounts may be held and managed when exercising an exchange operation to pay angolan nationals in national currency issuing payment or transfer orders abroad transfers in between banks to accounts held by fx residents that are a part of the same group using electronic payment cards or other internationally accepted payment mechanism and payment of any encumbrances arising from account maintenance and management the aforementioned bna order does not apply to foreign exchange operations conducted in the petroleum sector the opening and operation of bank accounts in other jurisdictions is subject to the grant of a special authorisation by the bna foreign investment issues investment restrictions what restrictions fees and taxes exist on foreign investment in or ownership of a project and related companies do the restrictions also apply to foreign investors or creditors in the event of foreclosure on the project and related companies are there any bilateral investment treaties with key nation states or other international treaties that may afford relief from such restrictions would such activities require registration with any government authority although it is arguable that the foreign ownership of commercial companies in angola is not expressly hindered by the applicable law in practice the incorporation of a company held by foreign citizens or entities and the repatriation of the respective profits abroad can only be performed under a private investment project previously approved by the competent authorities given that according to the pia the incorporation of a company is deemed a private investment operation comments included in this section in relation to npia were made considering the draft proposal submitted for discussion by the angolan parliament and are subject to further review of the final gazetted version of the npia based on the draft proposal reviewed under the npia private investors will be entitled if they opt to do so under the prior declaration regime a simplified procedure to incorporate companies before the approval of the private investment project ie before the issuance of the certificate for the registration of an investment project however the repatriation of profits will still depend on the approval of a private investment project under the npia there are two procedural regimes the prior declaration regime and the special regime the prior declaration regime is characterised by the simple presentation of the investment project for purposes of registration and attribution of the benefits foreseen in the npia the access to the special regime however depends if the investment is made in the considered to be prioritised activity sectors and in the development zones the secondary legislation for the npia has not been discussed or approved yet in the angolan parliament however we note that the organic structures that have been assisting the ministries in respect of private investment matters under the pia s regime have been extinguished and a centralised entity aipex which has authority to negotiate the terms of investment projects on behalf of the angolan state and to enter into investment contracts has been created presidential decree no 81 18 19 march 2018 it is worth mentioning that the tax benefits and incentives foreseen in the pia can only be granted to foreign private investment projects with a total amount equal to or higher than us 1 million and to internal private investments of amount equal or higher than us 500 000 another constraint worth referring to is the requirement of having partnerships between angolan citizens public owned companies or angolan companies in foreign private investment projects in certain areas of activity electricity and water hospitality and tourism logistics and transport construction works telecommunications and it and media the npia has eliminated these restrictions despite the fact that angola is a signatory to a few bilateral investment treaties these do not provide relief from the requirement to put forward an investment project for an investor intending to repatriate profits outside angola insurance restrictions what restrictions fees and taxes exist on insurance policies over project assets provided or guaranteed by foreign insurance companies may such policies be payable to foreign secured creditors the conducting of insurance and reinsurance activities in angola is limited to entities duly incorporated and authorised under the insurance activity act such authorisation is granted by the ministry of finance upon prior consulting of the angolan agency of insurance regulation and supervision the transfer of any amounts abroad under an insurance policy is deemed an fx operation given that it entails the transfer of money between an fx resident and an fx non resident upon the relevant authorisation of the bna insurance policies over project assets can be paid to foreign secured creditors worker restrictions what restrictions exist on bringing in foreign workers technicians or executives to work on a project presidential decree no 43 17 of 6 march 2017 as amended by presidential decree no 78 17 of 24 april 2017 which revoked decree no 5 95 of 7 april regulates the professional activity of non resident foreign workers along with the general labour law law no 7 15 of 15 june 2015 a quota rule is imposed on companies of all sizes according to which 70 per cent of the workforce is to be composed of national workers angolan or foreign residents and up to 30 per cent may be non resident foreign workers non resident workers have to be registered and their salaries can be paid in any currency agreed between the worker and the employer equipment restrictions what restrictions exist on the importation of project equipment the carrying out of import export and re export operations which is made through the integrated system of external trade sicoex is subject to prior registration in the registry of exporters and importers of the ministry of commerce rei registration in the rei is mandatory and valid for a period of five years the applicable law foresees two different regimes of importation temporary and permanent permanent importation of goods into angola under the general customs regime is subject to the payment of various charges eg customs duties consumption tax and stamp duty as the payment of the imported goods also entails an fx operation the procedures applicable to said payments are expressly governed by order no 19 12 25 april issued by the bna as amended by the instruction no 4 17 27 march also issued by the bna in 2014 the bna approved a simplified and more flexible regime applicable to these operations allowing advanced payments up to the amount of 100 million kwanza this simplified regime is only available to entities duly registered with the bna for such purpose and that comply with a set of requirements with a view to boosting the angolan industrial sector the importation of certain goods may be hindered or subject to quotas for instance in 2016 the importation of cement was expressly forbidden unless authorised by the cement sector commission the same prohibition was extended to 2017 by virtue of joint executive decree no 220 17 of 17 april 2017 finally under the pia the importation of machinery equipment and other fixed means is a form of foreign private investment hence the importation of project equipment may be performed under a private investment project nationalisation laws what laws exist regarding the nationalisation or expropriation of project companies and assets are any forms of investment specially protected according to both the pia and the npia under a private investment project the investor s ownership rights are protected by the angolan state and cannot be nationalised or seized unless a public interest purpose is being pursued in any event in the event of nationalisation or seizure both the pia and the npia foresee that the state undertakes to fairly promptly and effectively compensate the investor the 2010 angolan constitution provides that the state respects and protects the property and further property rights of natural and legal persons and therefore the expropriation for public utility is subject to the payment of a fair compensation which is a prerequisite of the effectiveness of the expropriation the procedures applicable to expropriation are further regulated by the expropriation regulations said regulations are based on statutes of the pre independence period namely law no 2030 of 24 october of 1953 public expropriations and decree no 43587 of 8 april of 1961 regulations on public expropriations considering the anachronism of regulations in force the president of republic approved recently the creation of the commission for the revision of the legal regime of expropriations fiscal treatment of foreign investment incentives what tax incentives or other incentives are provided preferentially to foreign investors or creditors what taxes apply to foreign investments loans mortgages or other security documents either for the purposes of effectiveness or registration the scope of the pia comprises all foreign private investments regardless of the amount and internal private investments of amounts equal to or higher than 50 million kwanza although tax benefits and incentives can only be granted to foreign investment projects of an amount equal to or higher than us 1 million and to internal investment projects of amounts equal to or higher than us 500 000 however under the terms of the npia all investment projects are entitled to tax benefits regardless of their amount under the pia the granting of such tax benefits and incentives must be analysed considering the objective criteria expressly provided by the pia to qualify for said benefits and incentives the project shall meet certain prerequisites of prime importance to the angolan economy eg employment creation production to export and value added to angola as opposed to the pia the npia does not provide for these objective criteria the npia establishes that under the contractual regime the tax benefits are higher than those foreseen for the prior declaration regime and that there may be a ranking of the tax rates and time frames according to the activity sector and location of the investment the maximum duration for the reduction of tax rates and the percentages in which these may be reduced are expressly indicated for each tax and for each regime the registry and execution of the documents supporting loans mortgages and other securities is subject to the payment of a stamp duty tax the applicable rates may vary between 0 1 per cent and 0 3 per cent for guarantees and between 0 1 per cent and 1 per cent depending on the financing operation additionally in this context it is worth recalling that the profits and dividends distributed to natural or legal persons under a private investment project subject to the pia are subject to an investment tax surcharge levied on the amount that surpasses the share of equity as previously explained based on the draft proposal submitted for review by the angolan parliament under the npia this investment tax surcharge will be suppressed government authorities relevant authorities what are the relevant government agencies or departments with authority over projects in the typical project sectors what is the nature and extent of their authority what is the history of state ownership in these sectors as already addressed above private investment projects shall be approved by the ministerial departments responsible for the project s key sector of activity note that mining oil and gas and financial sectors are excluded from the pia s scope however under the npia as explained this approval is obtained from a sole centralised entity the aipex in addition to this approval other licences or authorisations may be required depending on the business carried out by the investor projects in oil and gas are approved and monitored by the ministry of petroleum projects in the mining sector are approved and monitored by ministry of geology and mining or by the president depending on the value of the project at issue and projects in the financial sector are approved and monitored by the ministry of finance under the npia the president shall not have direct intervention in the negotiations of private investment projects but we expect that the regulations of the npia still to be discussed and approved by the angolan parliament provide for the required framework on these matters the project sectors of chemical refining water treatment power generation and transmission transportation ports and telecommunications are all included in the scope of the pia and therefore the competent authorities for the approval and monitoring of private investment projects are the ministries responsible for such sectors considering the new organic structure these projects shall be approved once the npia and its secondary legislation is in force by the aipex however it must be borne in mind that under the npia there is no limitation on the investment in key sectors of activity but will benefit from the special regime as stated in question 10 nor is the partnership with angolan nationals mandatory the prerequisites for conducting different activities of course vary and therefore additional or different licences may be required depending on the activity at stake regarding the history of state ownership in the above mentioned sectors it is worth mentioning the following the oil and gas and mining sectors are participated by the angolan state through the national concessionaires sonangol and endiama within the water treatment sector epal a public company that is engaged in the provision of water treatment services there are also a number of private companies engaged in the water treatment sector and the distribution of electricity is also a sector secured by the angolan state through public companies regulation of natural resources titles who has title to natural resources what rights may private parties acquire to these resources and what obligations does the holder have may foreign parties acquire such rights as mentioned above the 2010 constitution of angola ascribes the ownership of all natural resources within the angolan jurisdiction to the state the angolan jurisdiction comprises the onshore territory of angola the internal waters the territorial sea the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf and therefore all oil and gas fields minerals water and other resources located in such areas belong to the public domain of angola the state can only transfer rights over land that is part of the private domain in any case the transfer of rights almost never entails the transfer of ownership but merely the transfer of minor land rights although the applicable law foresees a wider range of land rights that can be assigned including ownership pursuant to the petroleum activities law mineral rights are attributed to the national concessionaire sonangol ep which cannot assign these mining rights but may associate with a reputed domestic or foreign company having the necessary technical and financial capacity such association is usually undertaken through a production sharing agreement under which the national concessionaire is entitled to receive part of the profits generated by the petroleum activities as per the mining code the mining rights of prospection exploitation treatment and trade of minerals are exclusively attributed to the national concessionaire additionally mining rights may also be granted to natural or legal persons national or foreign with proper technical and financial capacity for the performance of the mining activities through the issuance of one of the following permits prospecting permit exploitation permit mining permit or mining pass under the mining code the holders of mining rights have a number of obligations connected to health and safety training financial commitments environment protection use and enjoyment of the land and use of explosives the acquisition or exercise of the rights at issue is not affected by the rights of aboriginal indigenous or other recognised groups of people royalties and taxes what royalties and taxes are payable on the extraction of natural resources and are they revenue or profit based the taxes applicable to the performance of petroleum operations either by foreign or national entities are the following petroleum production tax petroleum revenue tax petroleum transaction tax surface area charge and contribution towards the training of angolan staff furthermore under the mining code all national and foreign entities performing activities of mineral prospection and exploitation in angola depending on the developed activity are subject to the payment of the following taxes revenue tax royalty surface fee and artisanal fee export restrictions what restrictions fees or taxes exist on the export of natural resources see questions 17 and 18 additionally under the mining code when so required by the interests of the country the state may request the purchase of the produced minerals at a market price to allocate them to the local industry the petroleum activities law also foresees that in case of national emergency armed conflict or natural disaster the government may require all or part of the production of any oil concession and determine that the national concessionaire and its associate companies increase the production to the maximum limit technically feasible legal issues of general application government permission what government approvals are required for typical project finance transactions what fees and other charges apply the investments as already addressed in question 7 entail the approval of a private investment project under the pia and under the npia soon in relation to loans and remittances by foreign parties or by local companies owned or controlled by foreign parties foreign exchange and private investment issues must be considered see question 7 further operations and transactions are not in general subject to any government approvals however the specifics of each operation and transaction shall be assessed on a case by case basis in order to evaluate if any relevant authorisations are applicable regarding the applicable fees and charges see questions 10 13 and 15 registration of financing must any of the financing or project documents be registered or filed with any government authority or otherwise comply with legal formalities to be valid or enforceable the entity before which the project documents shall be filed will vary according to the nature of the project if the project is included in the pia s scope project documents shall be filed before the ministry responsible for its approval under the npia the relevant documentation and requests shall be submitted with the aipex if the project comprises for instance the incorporation of a bank than the project documents shall be filed with the bna regarding legal formalities the contractual freedom prevails as the general principle under the cc however the law imposes notarial intervention for certain specific cases eg the execution of agreements for the transfer of real estate require the intervention of a public notary all documents related to the project shall be in portuguese the original documents issued by other states shall be subject to legalisation and recognition procedures normally before the ministry of foreign affairs and the angolan consulate of the relevant state arbitration awards how are international arbitration contractual provisions and awards recognised by local courts is the jurisdiction a member of the icsid convention or other prominent dispute resolution conventions are any types of disputes not arbitrable are any types of disputes subject to automatic domestic arbitration the voluntary arbitration act establishes that disputes regarding rights that the parties may freely waive extinguish or assign may be subject to arbitration upon agreement of the parties and under the assumption that such dispute is not mandatorily submitted to the judgment of a judicial court eg labour disputes or those connected to real estate or to necessary arbitration conversely disputes regarding non disposable rights cannot be subject to arbitration the applicable law allows the submission of disputes to international arbitration although angola is not a party to the icsid convention the country has on 6 march 2017 submitted to the secretary general of the united nations the formal instrument of ratification of the new york convention which came into force in angola on 4 june 2017 the application of the convention is subject to the reservation of reciprocity angola will apply the convention to the recognition and enforcement of awards made in the territory of another contracting state furthermore we note however that the angolan arbitration law which applies to domestic arbitrations and therefore to ny convention awards permits the making of a set aside action to the supreme court of angola and an opposition procedure to the enforcement application itself both procedures can only be based in broad terms on some specific formal grounds plus one that may be of a substantive nature breach of angolan public policy it is also worth mentioning that the pia expressly provides that any dispute regarding a private investment project may be referred to arbitration even though such arbitration must take place in angola and be subject to angolan law in the npia however also foreseen is the possibility of arbitration being silent as regards where it takes place and the necessary subjection to angolan law law governing agreements which jurisdiction s law typically governs project agreements which jurisdiction s law typically governs financing agreements which matters are governed by domestic law as to project agreements it is worth noting that private investment contracts are subject to angolan law particularly to the pia and the npia as the case may be conversely financial agreements may be governed by the law chosen by the parties as long as such choice corresponds to a serious interest of one of the parties and the selected jurisdiction has a connection with the contract at issue submission to foreign jurisdiction is a submission to a foreign jurisdiction and a waiver of immunity effective and enforceable although there are some matters that must be referred to angolan courts such as the disputes regarding real estate property located in angola the cpc expressly allows the parties of an international economic contract to submit any disputes regarding such contract to the courts of the respective country or to other jurisdiction environmental health and safety laws applicable regulations what laws or regulations apply to typical project sectors what regulatory bodies administer those laws one of the obligations imposed by the pia on the investors is the compliance with the environmental rules in force in angola among which are the environment framework law and the regulations on the liability for environmental damages while this is not expressly foreseen in the npia we expect that its regulations foresee as a mandatory requirement for the approval of certain investment projects an environmental impact assessment study the ministry of environment is the entity responsible for the enforcement of the environmental rules depending on the nature of the project at issue its approval by the competent authority might require the elaboration of an environmental impact assessment study additionally investors shall also consider throughout the course of their businesses in angola the regulations regarding health and security in the workplace which are enforced by the ministry of labour in particular by the labour inspection department the regulation of environmental protection in the course of petroleum activities sets forth the rules specifically applicable to this sector and provides that the national concessionaire and all the oil companies must adopt appropriate measures to prevent negative effects of pollution and as far as possible mitigate its consequences said statute is enforced by the ministry of petroleum project companies principal business structures what are the principal business structures of project companies what are the principal sources of financing available to project companies project companies are almost invariably incorporated under the form of private limited liability companies by quotas or public limited liability companies by shares considering the partnership requirement mentioned in question 10 the formation of joint ventures has been increasingly implemented however the requirement of the angolan partnership is no longer foreseen under the npia regarding the sources of financing it is worth noting that until the sharp drop in oil prices angola was one of the countries in sub saharan africa where project finance was more prosperous under the most common model of project finance implemented by china in angola the loan is repaid with the provision of natural resources most likely oil public private partnership legislation applicable legislation has ppp enabling legislation been enacted and if so at what level of government and is the legislation industry specific with a view to intensifying the use of the management capacity of the private sector by the state and consequently developing public services and rationalising the use of public funds in 2011 a new law on public private partnerships was enacted the law on public private partnerships was approved at national level and is not industry specific however it expressly foresees that sector specific regimes may be set up when the specifics of a certain sector so require ppp limitations legal limitations what if any are the practical and legal limitations on ppp transactions the law on public private partnerships foresees that the formation of ppps must be compliant with the financial planning rules set forth in the state budget law and must represent an advantage to the public partner when compared with alternative means of achieving the same objective eg traditional public procurement additionally the possibility of restoring the financial balance of the ppp in response to significant changes in the financial conditions is expressly provided for at last any increase to the budgetary costs of the ppp equal to or higher than 200 million kwanza is subject to the prior approval of the minister of economy the minister of finances and the relevant sectoral minister ppp transactions significant transactions what have been the most significant ppp transactions completed to date in your jurisdiction one good example of a significant ppp is that established between the angolan government and the company caioporto for the construction of a deep water port in cabinda with an estimated cost of us 600 million update trends update trends updates and trends the new president of angola who was elected in september 2017 has been championing certain statutory instruments to boost foreign investment fight against corruption and money laundering recover funds illegitimately transferred abroad etc the npia in particular will provide for a more favourable regime to foreign investors in comparison with the pia most relevantly the obligation for angolan partnerships in share capital and management participation in investment projects defined in the pil for the strategic sectors such as tourism and hotel business transportation and logistics telecommunication and information technologies and social media ceases to exist yet another example of a very important piece of legislation finally seeing the light of day is the long awaited approval of a competition anti trust law in may 2018 it is too early to fully understand the impact of these recent efforts but it is expected that the new political climate and legislative changes will attract new investors to angola

engineers for the rosemont project and that it expects to receive rosemont s mine plan of operations from the u s forest service shortly wheaton had an exceptionally successful year with our precious metals business exceeding guidance for gold silver and palladium resulting in cash flows of over 475 million said randy smallwood president and chief executive officer of wheaton precious metals in addition to our strong production and cash flow in 2018 we were also able to optimize the san dimas stream add two additional high quality streams from low cost long life mines and reach a settlement in our long running tax dispute with the cra from the firm foundation that 2018 has provided we expect our portfolio to now deliver steady organic growth for the foreseeable future coming from increasing grades and better recoveries at peñasquito the blitz project at stillwater ramping up to full capacity the development of the pampacancha deposit at constancia the ongoing expansion of the salobo mine continued improvements at san dimas and now the strong possibility of rosemont coming into production with our sector leading cash flows high margins and steady organic growth wheaton is primed to be the premier investment vehicle for precious metals investors worldwide financial review revenues revenue was 197 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 on sales volume of 102 800 ounces of gold 4 4 million ounces of silver and 5 000 ounces of palladium this represents a 19 decrease from the 243 million of revenue generated in the fourth quarter of 2017 due primarily to i a 40 decrease in the number of silver ounces sold ii a 12 decrease in the average realized silver price 14 66 in q4 2018 compared with 16 75 in q4 2017 and iii a 4 decrease in the average realized gold price 1 229

respectively as compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 operational highlights for the quarter ended december 31 2018 based upon counterparties reporting are as follows salobo in the fourth quarter of 2018 salobo produced 77 000 ounces of attributable gold an increase of approximately 1 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 as per vale s third quarter 2018 md a on october 24 2018 vale s board of directors approved the salobo expansion a brownfield expansion which if completed as proposed would increase processing throughput capacity to 36 mtpa wheaton precious metals international ltd wheaton international first entered into a gold purchase agreement with vale in respect of the salobo mine in 2013 and made subsequent amendments to the agreement in 2015 and 2016 the gold agreement as part of the gold agreement if actual throughput is expanded above 28 mtpa within a predetermined period and depending on the grade of material processed wheaton will be required to make an additional payment to vale based on a set fee schedule as proposed the salobo expansion would increase throughput capacity from 24 mtpa to 36 mtpa once fully ramped up vale has approved the investment of us 1 1 billion in the salobo expansion with a start up scheduled for the first half of 2022 and an estimated ramp up of 15 months vale has indicated that the salobo expansion will encompass a third concentrator and will use salobo s existing infrastructure as agreed to as part of the original gold agreement and based on vale s disclosure relating to size and timing of the salobo expansion the company estimates that an expansion payment of between 550 million to 650 million would be payable given vale s proposed schedule this payment would likely be made no earlier than 2023 peñasquito in the fourth quarter of 2018 peñasquito produced 1 5 million ounces of attributable silver a decrease of approximately 7 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 due to lower throughput according to goldcorp inc s fourth quarter of 2018 md a higher than expected ore hardness impacted mill throughput in the quarter in addition commissioning of the plp continued during the quarter with the project having achieved commercial production as of december 31 2018 the carbon pre flotation plant a component of the plp achieved commercial production on october 1 2018 and was successfully treating high carbon ore during the fourth quarter of 2018 antamina in the fourth quarter of 2018 antamina produced 1 2 million ounces of attributable silver a decrease of approximately 15 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 as expected due to mine sequencing in the open pit san dimas in the fourth quarter of 2018 san dimas produced 10 100 ounces of attributable gold according to first majestic silver corp s first majestic fourth quarter of 2018 production report the san dimas mill processed a total of 172 641 tonnes with average gold and silver grades of 3 9 g t and 262 g t respectively the operation reportedly continued to process higher volumes from lower grade stopes left behind as they were deemed uneconomical under the old streaming agreement and have now become economical under the new streaming agreement sudbury in the fourth quarter of 2018 vale s sudbury mines produced 7 100 ounces of attributable gold a decrease of approximately 18 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to lower throughput and grades constancia in the fourth quarter of 2018 constancia produced 4 300 ounces of attributable gold and 0 7 million ounces of attributable silver an increase of approximately 45 and 12 respectively relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 due to higher precious metals grades and recovery stillwater in the fourth quarter of 2018 the stillwater mines produced 3 500 ounces of attributable gold and 5 900 ounces of attributable palladium on july 25 2018 the company through its wholly owned subsidiary wheaton international completed the acquisition from sibanye stillwater of a fixed percentage of gold and palladium production from the stillwater mines as part of the agreement wheaton international was entitled to the attributable gold and palladium production for which an offtaker payment was received after july 1 2018 resulting in reported production for the third quarter including some material processed in the previous quarters as a result the stillwater mines significantly outperformed the company s expectations in the first six months of the stream with attributable production of 9 800 ounces of attributable gold and 14 700 ounces of attributable palladium relative to 2018 guidance of approximately 5 400 ounces of gold and 10 400 ounces of palladium other gold in the fourth quarter of 2018 total other gold attributable production was 5 700 ounces a decrease of approximately 35 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease was due primarily to lower production at the minto mine as per capstone mining corp s capstone news release dated october 11 2018 the agreement under which capstone had agreed to sell its minto mine to pembridge resources plc has been terminated in conjunction with this capstone placed the minto mine on care and maintenance in the fourth quarter of 2018 other silver in the fourth quarter of 2018 total other silver attributable production was 2 1 million ounces a decrease of approximately 3 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 the slight decrease was driven primarily by the cessation of attributable production from the lagunas norte veladero and pierina mines as the silver purchase agreement with barrick gold corp barrick related to these mines expired on march 31 2018 and lower production at yauliyacu partially offset by the start up of attributable production at the aljustrel mine produced but not yet delivered 3 as at december 31 2018 payable ounces attributable to the company produced but not yet delivered amounted to 77 500 payable gold ounces 3 3 million payable silver ounces and 5 300 payable palladium ounces representing a decrease of 100 payable gold ounces an increase of 0 2 million payable silver ounces and an increase of 600 payable palladium ounces during the three month period ended december 31 2018 payable gold ounces produced but not yet delivered decreased slightly primarily as a result of decreases related to the salobo and other gold interests partially offset by increases related to the san dimas and sudbury gold interests payable silver ounces produced but not yet delivered increased primarily as a result of increases related to the peñasquito partially offset by a decrease related to the antamina silver interest payable ounces produced but not yet delivered to the wheaton group of companies are expected to average approximately two to three months of annualized production for both gold and palladium and two months for silver but may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of mining operation factors including mine ramp up and timing of shipments detailed mine by mine production and sales figures can be found in the appendix to this press release and in wheaton s consolidated md a in the results of operations and

of december 31 2018 proven and probable mineral reserves attributable to wheaton were 11 75 million ounces of gold compared with 11 28 million ounces as reported in wheaton s 2017 annual information form aif an increase of 4 542 1 million ounces of silver compared with 575 2 million ounces a decrease of 6 0 66 million ounces of palladium and 32 6 million pounds of cobalt on an attributable

palladium and 9 3 million pounds of cobalt estimated attributable reserves and resources contained in this press release are based on information available to the company as of march 20 2019 and therefore will not reflect updates if any after that date updated reserves and resources data incorporating year end 2018 estimates will also be included in the company s 2018 annual information form wheaton s most current attributable reserves and resources as of december 31 2018 can be found on the company s website at www wheatonpm com outlook wheaton s estimated attributable precious metals production in 2019 is forecast to be approximately 365 000 ounces of gold 24 5 million ounces of silver and 22 000 ounces of palladium resulting in gold equivalent production2 of approximately 690 000 ounces for the five year period ending in 2023 the company estimates that average annual gold equivalent production2 will amount to 750 000 ounces in 2019 forecast silver production growth from peñasquito is expected to be partially offset by the change in the san dimas stream from silver to gold as well as the cessation in 2018 of production from assets with fixed terms gold production in 2019 is expected to be slightly below 2018 as a result of lower grades at salobo due to mine sequencing most pronounced in the first quarter of 2019 being partially offset by increased attributable gold production from the san dimas mine at constancia hudbay expects to begin mining the pampacancha satellite deposit later in 2019 which has significantly higher precious metals grades than what is currently being mined however given the lack of a definitive schedule at this point forecast gold production in 2019 does not include any contribution from the pampacancha deposit4 palladium production is expected to increase in 2019 as the company has its first full year of production from the stillwater stream which was acquired in july of 2018 average production over the next five years is expected to increase primarily due to continued production growth from peñasquito constancia and stillwater as well as the commencement of the voisey s bay stream in 2021 at peñasquito grades are expected to increase and the addition of the plp should improve recoveries at constancia production from the pampacancha deposit is included in wheaton s five year production average palladium and gold production from stillwater is expected to increase with the continued ramp up of the blitz project which is expected to reach full capacity in 2021 in addition effective january 1 2021 wheaton will be entitled to receive from vale an amount of cobalt equal to 42 4 of the voisey s bay mine cobalt production and lastly wheaton does not include any production from barrick s pascua lama project or hudbay s rosemont project in its estimated average five year production guidance5 from a liquidity perspective the 76 million of cash and cash equivalents as at december 31 2018 combined with the liquidity provided by the available credit under the 2 billion revolving facility and ongoing operating cash flows positions the company well to fund all outstanding commitments and known contingencies as well as providing flexibility to acquire additional accretive precious metal stream interests webcast and conference call details a conference call and webcast will be held thursday

the us dollar little changed ahead of today s key fed meeting pound sterling continues to trade toward the top end of recent ranges as further news on the potential implications of any brexit delay is awaited say analysts at lloyds the pound to euro exchange rate is 0 24 lower 1 16584 today the pound to us dollar exchange rate is 0 34 lower 1 32249 today overnight risk sentiment continued to sour overnight as the fallout from a potential roadblock in us china trade talks hit stock markets the nikkei 225 was down 0 3 in japan while us index futures also fell fx markets were quite ahead of what promises to be a big day for the us dollar as jerome powell and the fomc meet to decide on interest rates in the us the federal reserve is not the only big risk event as cpi data is awaited for pound sterling advertisement analyst view marshall gittler acls global it s entirely possible that this week s summit defers a decision on a delay until next week mere days or hours before b day in my view the likelihood of britain crashing out of the eu without an agreement the nuclear option for the british economy and for sterling is increasing i think gbp should be significantly lower note too that eur should be a lot lower too if this happens because it will cause chaos in europe as well the uk takes 6 of germany s exports 6 of france s 4 7 of italy s and 6 3 of spain s so it is a significant market for these countries and any confusion at the border of which there is bound to be plenty will hurt their economies as well the day ahead once again it will be a full day of economic data in the uk after yesterday s jobs report today we see cpi and ppi headlining there is also cbi industrial trend data but the cpi is more than likely going to generate the most volatility in the british pound the data continues to be significant into the north american sessions as crude oil inventories will be closely watched by investors and probably have an impact on petro currencies like the canadian dollar this is followed by the most important fx event of the month when the federal reserve meet to decide on interest rates and release their statement the dollar and us markets are widely believed to be anticipating a dovish fed analyst view lloyds bank today s policy update from the us fed will in the absence of major new brexit developments be the key focus for markets today it seems unlikely to spring any major surprises interest rates will be left unchanged for the second successive meeting moreover the key message will continue to be that the fed will be patient before considering any further changes to policy that suggests the pause will last for at least several more months that will likely be reflected in a dovish but largely unchanged post meeting press statement analyst view marshall gittler acls global the market sees no chance of a change in rates at this meeting in fact it s pricing in zero chance of a rate hike and only 25 chance of a rate cut during the year the focus of attention will therefore be on the dot plot in which the committee members give their forecasts for rates at the end of each year the median dot is taken to represent the fomc s consensus view of where rates are likely to be currently the dot plot is pricing in two more rate hikes this year and one next year quite different from what the market is assuming market participants seems to be expecting that the median dot will fall to only one rate hike this year with another expected next year and none in 2021 leaving the terminal fed funds rate lower than is penciled in now also of interest will be where the highest projected rates are will the two hawks who predicted 3 625 in 20201 throw in the towel of particular interest is their forecast for longer term the dots to the right of the dotted line that s taken to be their estimate of where the neutral rate of interest is the level at which monetary policy is neither helping nor hindering economic activity fed chair powell recently said fed funds were now within the broad range of estimates of the neutral rate ny fed president williams was even more specific saying the fed is right at neutral if they are at neutral full employment and more or less at their inflation target then they ve hit it in that case they ve somehow managed to reach the holy grail of monetary policy equilibrium no reason to move rates either way for the foreseeable future as newton said a body at rest tends to stay at rest unless acted upon by some external force i think that would be negative for the dollar since it would mean no more hikes any time soon of course since that s already what the market is assuming it might not have that big an impact on the other hand if the dot plot continues to forecast two hikes this year that would be a big surprise to the market and probably send the dollar higher data releases on 20 3 2019 09 30 gbp cpi yoy feb 09 30 gbp cpi mom feb 09 30 gbp cpih yoy 09 30 gbp ppi input mom feb 11 00 gbp cbi

this is that better than forecast employment and wage growth stats failed to create much of a bounce in cable with the fomc meeting today here is bk asset management s take on what to look out for from powell and the gang today the us dollar is trading lower ahead of the rate decision on the expectation that the fed will maintain their patient stance but positive and negative surprises could easily trigger big swings in currencies to start no one expects the central bank to change interest rates but there will be a press conference by fed chair powell a dot plot and their latest economic projections here are the main three things that bk s kathy lien is looking for to gauge the reaction in eur usd exchange rate and the other major pairs this won t be one of those meetings where we ll just get the fomc statement and a few words from powell instead these 3 things could significantly impact the market s appetite for us dollars dot plot will it drop from 2 to 1 rate hike for 2019 economic projections will growth or inflation forecasts be lowered fed chair powell s press conference will powell s outlook be laced with optimism it seems like the bar is extremely high for the fed to surprise dovishly despite the recent drop off in jobs data there is a risk they might surprise hawkishly if they are willing to look through the slowdown as temporary and take a glass half full on

stillwater of a fixed percentage of gold and palladium production from the stillwater mines as part of the agreement wheaton international was entitled to the attributable gold and palladium production for which an offtaker payment was received after july 1 2018 resulting in reported production for the third quarter including some material processed in the previous quarters as a result the stillwater mines significantly outperformed the company s expectations in the first six months of the stream with attributable production of 9 800 ounces of attributable gold and 14 700 ounces of attributable palladium relative to 2018 guidance of approximately 5 400 ounces of gold and 10 400 ounces of palladium other gold in the fourth quarter of 2018 total other gold attributable production was 5 700 ounces a decrease of approximately 35 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease was due primarily to lower production at the minto mine as per capstone mining corp s capstone news release dated october 11 2018 the agreement under which capstone had agreed to sell its minto mine to pembridge resources plc has been terminated in conjunction with this capstone placed the minto mine on care and maintenance in the fourth quarter of 2018 other silver in the fourth quarter of 2018 total other silver attributable production was 2 1 million ounces a decrease of approximately 3 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 the slight decrease was driven primarily by the cessation of attributable production from the lagunas norte veladero and pierina mines as the silver purchase agreement with barrick gold corp barrick related to these mines expired on march 31 2018 and lower production at yauliyacu partially offset by the start up of attributable production at the aljustrel mine produced but not yet delivered 3 as at december 31 2018 payable ounces attributable to the company produced but not yet delivered amounted to 77 500 payable gold ounces 3 3 million payable silver ounces and 5 300 payable palladium ounces representing a decrease of 100 payable gold ounces an increase of 0 2 million payable silver ounces and an increase of 600 payable palladium ounces during the three month period ended december 31 2018 payable gold ounces produced but not yet delivered decreased slightly primarily as a result of decreases related to the salobo and other gold interests partially offset by increases related to the san dimas and sudbury gold interests payable silver ounces produced but not yet delivered increased primarily as a result of increases related to the peñasquito partially offset by a decrease related to the antamina silver interest payable ounces produced but not yet delivered to the wheaton group of companies are expected to average approximately two to three months of annualized production for both gold and palladium and two months for silver but may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of mining operation factors including mine ramp up and timing of shipments detailed mine by mine production and sales figures can be found in the appendix to this press release and in wheaton s consolidated md a in the results of operations and

of december 31 2018 proven and probable mineral reserves attributable to wheaton were 11 75 million ounces of gold compared with 11 28 million ounces as reported in wheaton s 2017 annual information form aif an increase of 4 542 1 million ounces of silver compared with 575 2 million ounces a decrease of 6 0 66 million ounces of palladium and 32 6 million pounds of cobalt on an attributable measured and indicated mineral resource basis gold resources were 2 89 million ounces compared with 2 67 million ounces as reported in wheaton s 2017 aif an increase of 8 silver resources were 784 4 million ounces compared with 887 0 million ounces a decrease of 12 and 1 6 million pounds of cobalt on an attributable inferred mineral resource basis gold resources were 4 08 million ounces compared with 2 71 million ounces as reported in wheaton s 2017 aif an increase of 50 silver resources were 432 7 million ounces compared with 446 5 million ounces a decrease of 3 0 36 million ounces of palladium and 9 3 million pounds of cobalt estimated attributable reserves and resources contained in this press release are based on information available to the company as of march 20 2019 and therefore will not reflect updates if any after that date updated reserves and resources data incorporating year end 2018 estimates will also be included in the company s 2018 annual information form wheaton s most current attributable reserves and resources as of december 31 2018 can be found on the company s website at www wheatonpm com outlook wheaton s estimated attributable precious metals production in 2019 is forecast to be approximately 365 000 ounces of gold 24 5 million ounces of silver and 22 000 ounces of palladium resulting in gold equivalent production2 of approximately 690 000 ounces for the five year period ending in 2023 the company estimates that average annual gold equivalent production2 will amount to 750 000 ounces in 2019 forecast silver production growth from peñasquito is expected to be partially offset by the change in the san dimas stream from silver to gold as well as the cessation in 2018 of production from assets with fixed terms gold production in 2019 is expected to be slightly below 2018 as a result of lower grades at salobo due to mine sequencing most pronounced in the first quarter of 2019 being partially offset by increased attributable gold production from the san dimas mine at constancia hudbay expects to begin mining the pampacancha satellite deposit later in 2019 which has significantly higher precious metals grades than what is currently being mined however given the lack of a definitive schedule at this point forecast gold production in 2019 does not include any contribution from the pampacancha deposit4 palladium production is expected to increase in 2019 as the company has its first full year of production from the stillwater stream which was acquired in july of 2018 average production over the next five years is expected to increase primarily due to continued production growth from peñasquito constancia and stillwater as well as the commencement of the voisey s bay stream in 2021 at peñasquito grades are expected to increase and the addition of the plp should improve recoveries at constancia production from the pampacancha deposit is included in wheaton s five year production average palladium and gold production from stillwater is expected to increase with the continued ramp up of the blitz project which is expected to reach full capacity in 2021 in addition effective january 1 2021 wheaton will be entitled to receive from vale an amount of cobalt equal to 42 4 of the voisey s bay mine cobalt production and lastly wheaton does not include any production from barrick s pascua lama project or hudbay s rosemont project in its estimated average five year production guidance5 from a liquidity perspective the 76 million of cash and cash equivalents as at december 31 2018 combined with the liquidity provided by the available credit under the 2 billion revolving facility and ongoing operating cash flows positions the company well to fund all outstanding commitments and known contingencies as well as providing flexibility to acquire additional accretive precious metal stream interests webcast and conference call details a conference call and webcast will be held thursday

of directors approved the salobo expansion a brownfield expansion which if completed as proposed would increase processing throughput capacity to 36 mtpa wheaton precious metals international ltd wheaton international first entered into a gold purchase agreement with vale in respect of the salobo mine in 2013 and made subsequent amendments to the agreement in 2015 and 2016 the gold agreement as part of the gold agreement if actual throughput is expanded above 28 mtpa within a predetermined period and depending on the grade of material processed wheaton will be required to make an additional payment to vale based on a set fee schedule as proposed the salobo expansion would increase throughput capacity from 24 mtpa to 36 mtpa once fully ramped up vale has approved the investment of us 1 1 billion in the salobo expansion with a start up scheduled for the first half of 2022 and an estimated ramp up of 15 months vale has indicated that the salobo expansion will encompass a third concentrator and will use salobo s existing infrastructure as agreed to as part of the original gold agreement and based on vale s disclosure relating to size and timing of the salobo expansion the company estimates that an expansion payment of between 550 million to 650 million would be payable given vale s proposed schedule this payment would likely be made no earlier than 2023 peñasquito in the fourth quarter of 2018 peñasquito produced 1 5 million ounces of attributable silver a decrease of approximately 7 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 due to lower throughput according to goldcorp inc s fourth quarter of 2018 md a higher than expected ore hardness impacted mill throughput in the quarter in addition commissioning of the plp continued during the quarter with the project having achieved commercial production as of december 31 2018 the carbon pre flotation plant a component of the plp achieved commercial production on october 1 2018 and was successfully treating high carbon ore during the fourth quarter of 2018 antamina in the fourth quarter of 2018 antamina produced 1 2 million ounces of attributable silver a decrease of approximately 15 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 as expected due to mine sequencing in the open pit san dimas in the fourth quarter of 2018 san dimas produced 10 100 ounces of attributable gold according to first majestic silver corp s first majestic fourth quarter of 2018 production report the san dimas mill processed a total of 172 641 tonnes with average gold and silver grades of 3 9 g t and 262 g t respectively the operation reportedly continued to process higher volumes from lower grade stopes left behind as they were deemed uneconomical under the old streaming agreement and have now become economical under the new streaming agreement sudbury in the fourth quarter of 2018 vale s sudbury mines produced 7 100 ounces of attributable gold a decrease of approximately 18 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to lower throughput and grades constancia in the fourth quarter of 2018 constancia produced 4 300 ounces of attributable gold and 0 7 million ounces of attributable silver an increase of approximately 45 and 12 respectively relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 due to higher precious metals grades and recovery stillwater in the fourth quarter of 2018 the stillwater mines produced 3 500 ounces of attributable gold and 5 900 ounces of attributable palladium on july 25 2018 the company through its wholly owned subsidiary wheaton international completed the acquisition from sibanye stillwater of a fixed percentage of gold and palladium production from the stillwater mines as part of the agreement wheaton international was entitled to the attributable gold and palladium production for which an offtaker payment was received after july 1 2018 resulting in reported production for the third quarter including some material processed in the previous quarters as a result the stillwater mines significantly outperformed the company s expectations in the first six months of the stream with attributable production of 9 800 ounces of attributable gold and 14 700 ounces of attributable palladium relative to 2018 guidance of approximately 5 400 ounces of gold and 10 400 ounces of palladium other gold in the fourth quarter of 2018 total other gold attributable production was 5 700 ounces a decrease of approximately 35 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease was due primarily to lower production at the minto mine as per capstone mining corp s capstone news release dated october 11 2018 the agreement under which capstone had agreed to sell its minto mine to pembridge resources plc has been terminated in conjunction with this capstone placed the minto mine on care and maintenance in the fourth quarter of 2018 other silver in the fourth quarter of 2018 total other silver attributable production was 2 1 million ounces a decrease of approximately 3 relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 the slight decrease was driven primarily by the cessation of attributable production from the lagunas norte veladero and pierina mines as the silver purchase agreement with barrick gold corp barrick related to these mines expired on march 31 2018 and lower production at yauliyacu partially offset by the start up of attributable production at the aljustrel mine produced but not yet delivered 3 as at december 31 2018 payable ounces attributable to the company produced but not yet delivered amounted to 77 500 payable gold ounces 3 3 million payable silver ounces and 5 300 payable palladium ounces representing a decrease of 100 payable gold ounces an increase of 0 2 million payable silver ounces and an increase of 600 payable palladium ounces during the three month period ended december 31 2018 payable gold ounces produced but not yet delivered decreased slightly primarily as a result of decreases related to the salobo and other gold interests partially offset by increases related to the san dimas and sudbury gold interests payable silver ounces produced but not yet delivered increased primarily as a result of increases related to the peñasquito partially offset by a decrease related to the antamina silver interest payable ounces produced but not yet delivered to the wheaton group of companies are expected to average approximately two to three months of annualized production for both gold and palladium and two months for silver but may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of mining operation factors including mine ramp up and timing of shipments detailed mine by mine production and sales figures can be found in the appendix to this press release and in wheaton s consolidated md a in the results of operations and

form wheaton s most current attributable reserves and resources as of december 31 2018 can be found on the company s website at www wheatonpm com outlook wheaton s estimated attributable precious metals production in 2019 is forecast to be approximately 365 000 ounces of gold 24 5 million ounces of silver and 22 000 ounces of palladium resulting in gold equivalent production2 of approximately 690 000 ounces for the five year period ending in 2023 the company estimates that average annual gold equivalent production2 will amount to 750 000 ounces in 2019 forecast silver production growth from peñasquito is expected to be partially offset by the change in the san dimas stream from silver to gold as well as the cessation in 2018 of production from assets with fixed terms gold production in 2019 is expected to be slightly below 2018 as a result of lower grades at salobo due to mine sequencing most pronounced in the first quarter of 2019 being partially offset by increased attributable gold production from the san dimas mine at constancia hudbay expects to begin mining the pampacancha satellite deposit later in 2019 which has significantly higher precious metals grades than what is currently being mined however given the lack of a definitive schedule at this point forecast gold production in 2019 does not include any contribution from the pampacancha deposit4 palladium production is expected to increase in 2019 as the company has its first full year of production from the stillwater stream which was acquired in july of 2018 average production over the next five years is expected to increase primarily due to continued production growth from peñasquito constancia and stillwater as well as the commencement of the voisey s bay stream in 2021 at peñasquito grades are expected to increase and the addition of the plp should improve recoveries at constancia production from the pampacancha deposit is included in wheaton s five year production average palladium and gold production from stillwater is expected to increase with the continued ramp up of the blitz project which is expected to reach full capacity in 2021 in addition effective january 1 2021 wheaton will be entitled to receive from vale an amount of cobalt equal to 42 4 of the voisey s bay mine cobalt production and lastly wheaton does not include any production from barrick s pascua lama project or hudbay s rosemont project in its estimated average five year production guidance5 from a liquidity perspective the 76 million of cash and cash equivalents as at december 31 2018 combined with the liquidity provided by the available credit under the 2 billion revolving facility and ongoing operating cash flows positions the company well to fund all outstanding commitments and known contingencies as well as providing flexibility to acquire additional accretive precious metal stream interests webcast and conference call details a conference call and webcast will be held thursday

donald trump has been elected president of the united states what now here s a running commentary of how financial markets commentators movers and shakers are reacting and how it affects you 4 25pm what should mortgage holders be doing post election bnz chief economist tony alexander suggests fixing for three years he says some migration boost may ensue to nz but it is important to look beyond the initial dummyspitting by those who opposed mr trump and see how things settle down there has already been some extra upward movement in us medium to long term interest rates overnight in anticipation of larger budget deficits and higher inflation and this adds to the already growing pressure for fixed home lending rates to rise here big movements up are unlikely but perhaps this time post gfc we can have very high confidence that we have finally gone past the low point for the fixed rate cycle i d fix three years now alexander notes market recovery was swift as attention turned to a likely economic stimulus from higher infrastructure spending possible absence of the previously expected tightening of us monetary policy next month likely tax cuts and reduced burdens upon sectors such as health and banking he has downplayed the impact of a trump victory on the new zealand economy saying my personal view remains that the kiwi dollar has support from a wide range of factors not the least being the strong state of the economy plus the new element of recovering international dairy prices any weakness attributable to the uncertainty surrounding the president elect may already have been and gone 4 05pm social media has played a huge role in this election bloomberg explores the extent to which it helped trump win america just endured its first presidential election in which the majority of the electorate got its news from social media and the outcome is already prompting soul searching by the companies that shaped it facebook inc will have to contend with mounting dissatisfaction over its role as the most widely used news filter in history forty four percent of american adults get their media through the site many consuming news from partisan sources with which they agree the proliferation of fake news on facebook has also been a problem false stories about the clinton family committing murder and huma abedin being a terrorist flew fast and furious despite refutations from responsible news organizations those stories shaped public opinion said ed wasserman the dean of the university of california berkeley graduate school of journalism this is a landmark he said trump was able to get his message out in a way that was vastly influential without undergoing the usual kinds of quality checks that we associate with reaching mass public you had a whole set of media having influence without really having authority and the media that spoke with authority the authority that comes after careful fact checking didn t really have the influence 3 45pm the chinese yuan has fallen to a six year low against the usd the onshore yuan opened trade at 6 798 per dollar while the people s bank of china set a weaker official midpoint for the fifth consecutive day at 6 789 trump has labelled china a currency manipulator and threatened to impose a 45 punitive tariff rate on all chinese imports asb s chief economist nick tuffley says this could see china s exports to the us could fall by as much as 80 given 4 6 of china s gdp is exports to the us economy we anticipate china s real gdp growth will slow from 6 5 to 5 5 as us tariffs imposed on china are offset by chinese domestic stimulus measures he says the slowing in china s economy would have some flow on economic implications to the rest of asia including nz and australia 3 15pm the sydney morning herald reports everybody was caught with their pants down when it came to donald trump s unexpected election victory including the bookies which are paying dearly for their collective misjudgement sportsbet reports it has paid out 11 million to 25 000 punters who backed trump including one punter who picked up 10 100 from a 100 bet on trump in 2014 the company owned by irish bookmaker paddy power betfair hasn t said how much was bet on a hillary clinton victory but twice as many bets were made on trump suggesting the losses across the industry will be substantial 2 55pm australian prime minister malcolm turnbull has wasted no time pressing trump over issues core to australia s interests the australian financial review reports during a 15 minute phone call to congratulate trump on his victory turnbull urged him to rethink his opposition to the tpp he also raised his concerns over the us s military presence in asia pacific 2 40pm asb chief economist nick tuffley at face value donald trump s policies are inflationary lower taxes and higher government spending are stimulatory consequently there is the prospect of stronger us growth and an earlier lift in inflation pressures furthermore the proposed cut in the company tax rate would improve the after tax return of equities generating larger capital inflows into the us economy us corporates would repatriate profits that are now subject to less tax into the us economy this mix of policies points to higher us interest rates higher us equity prices and a stronger usd the implications of a trump presidency on nz are mixed and depend much on what policy shifts dominate nz s export demand the big uncertainty is to what extent any trade protectionism undoes the impact of a us fiscal boost on nz the mix of nz monetary conditions is likely to shift in favour of a weaker than otherwise nzd counterbalanced by higher term interest rates via higher us interest rates the nzd impact may overall win out but at this stage the net effect does not look like it will be dramatic the rbnz has a lot of time up its sleeve to assess the likely nz impact of the trump presidency even the next monetary policy statement on february 9 may be too soon to for the rbnz to incorporate any economic changes given donald trump s inauguration is less than 3 weeks prior for the time being we see the implications for nz monetary policy as mixed we continue to expect the rbnz to keep the ocr on hold at 1 75 the risks are slightly skewed to the downside with the incoming president trump one further uncertainty to respond to 2 20pm standard poors has affirmed the us investment grade aa a 1 sovereign rating further to trump being elected it says we assume the longstanding institutional strengths and robust checks and balances of the u s will support policy execution in a trump administration despite the president elect s lack of experience in public office which raises uncertainty on policy proposals the credit strengths of the u s include its diversified and resilient economy extensive economic policy flexibility and unique status as the issuer of the world s leading reserve currency however high general government debt and now increased uncertainty over its trajectory constrain the ratings 2 05pm 1 20pm will trump actually have the power to start a nuclear war yes and no says new zealand based security expert paul buchanan on radio new zealand the command of the nuclear arsenal the order to fire is done by the president alone there are no checks or balances on him once he makes that choice he doesn t have to consult with congress he certainly doesn t have to consult with the judiciary buchanan says yet he notes the president will have to operate under the weight of us foreign and domestic policy and will be closely vetted by military officials and then there s the check of ultimate resort buchanan says twice before when nixon was in the middle of his watergate troubles and during the time that reagan was suffering from alzheimer s the military stopped them from pulling the trigger i would imagine if trump starts operating in a very erratic way they would do the same thing to him he says 12 55pm here s a map of what the election result may have looked like if only millennials voted according to polling firm surveymonkey yes we have all learnt a lesson about the accuracy of polls in this election but even with a sizeable margin of error the results are telling you can hone in on other demographics on surveymonkey s website see this page for its methodology 12 40pm xero ceo rod drury is keen to recruit staff from the states here s a snippet from a letter he sent his staff this morning and published on twitter 12 30pm prime minister john key on radio new zealand about what will happen to the trans pacific parternship it s definitely not going anywhere in a hurry we ve had a great and growing and strong economy one of the strongest economies in the developed world without tpp it would have been nice to have but we re not going to have it in the short term but does that mean there will never be an attempt to re negotiate it no because president trump will get the same advice from the state department from the pentagon from the treasury that president obama got which is that you need to have influence and you need to have presence in asia and to do that free trade locking you in there is the way to do it 12 25pm speaking at a press conference this morning reserve bank governor graeme wheeler said the decision to cut the official cash rate had been reconsidered today in light of the us election result the rbnz reaffirmed it was the right one 12 15pm to begin with this from bnz markets expert nigel collins

this article is more than 5 years old getty all eyes are on the argentine peso as the gauge to measure whether or not incumbent mauricio macri can beat the expected challenger cristina kirchner in october if the peso weakens yet again macri is a goner everyone assumes a macri vs cristina nail biter actual candidates will be known for sure on june 22 when parties are required to submit their candidates for the general election to date market expectations are for the peso and inflation to remain in check that s the consensus year to date the peso is worse off than the turkish lire over the last 12 months the peso has lost 101 of its value against the dollar making it the weakest emerging market currency investors love it because they believe they are being paid handsomely for taking on the risk of investing in both hard and local currency debt short term but all of this depends on the central bank s ability to keep inflation under control and stop the peso from weakening to 50 it s now at 41 pesos to the dollar the imf endorsed the argentine central bank s 60 million a day currency auctions to limit the number of pesos in the market starting mid april there is some conditionality to these auctions however meaning the imf is fine with them so long as the currency is more appreciated than the central bank s non intervention target rate this caveat prevents excessive purchases of pesos by the central bank to strengthen the currency a move that would encourage exporters to liquidate their export sales while also discouraging large sales of peso carry trades by foreign investors the central bank also validated the smaller pace of the forex trading band at 1 75 per month in the second quarter down from 2 in the first which de facto accepts a real appreciation of the peso rate the forex rate should also benefit from the commitment to a restrictive monetary policy with the central bank now reaffirming the zero monetary base not printing pesos through 2019 it s a small menu of options for minimizing local market volatility with the economic team prioritizing the restrictive monetary stance to discourage demand for dollars as well as encourage dollar supply through the imf loans says siobhan morden head of latin america fixed income for nomura securities the fact that the imf has let the central bank intervene to the tune of 60 million a day starting in roughly three weeks gives the market a sense that there will be just enough currency market intervention to keep the peso steady to stronger 2018 bloomberg finance lp this is good news for macri forex inflation and economic growth will be the key indicators of macri s chances going forward we expect a better second half but we see a difficult near term environment adding to equity risk and remain on the sidelines morgan stanley analysts led by economist fernando sedano wrote in a note to clients on march 19 the global x msci argentina argt exchange traded fund is up 21 7 this year though morgan does not see this trend continuing sedano and company said there is limited risk priced in companies face fragile earnings in the upcoming quarters and of course the cristina variable is huge the upcoming harvest may also help strengthen the peso as argentina will be exporting commodities for dollars in the months ahead the current trade surplus is helpful as well so anyone betting against the peso short term may have to cut their losses wall street is willing to give macri the benefit of the doubt the risk is that few investors are convinced macri s economic team will fail things are not going in the right direction in argentina says fernando pertini chief advisor for millenia costa rica a private wealth management firm it looks almost inevitable to me that we are going to see another default or debt restructuring these ultra high interest rates are killing economic activity and gives no incentive to anyone to put money into production he says warning that inflation could go higher if he s right macri s chances of reelection are reduced and argentina investors will start pricing in the odds of cristina s return to the casa rosada in buenos aires
there are reasons for worry as rogoff tells us interest rates today are far below fed and forecasts and the same time inflation has also been far lower for longer than virtually any economic model would have predicted given current robust us growth and very low unemployment despite trump s deficits and many mainstream warnings the dollar has been amazingly solid is something perhaps wrong with the mainstream s models a specter is haunting mainstream economics it is the specter of modern monetary theory so recent essays from harvard luminaries kenneth rogoff and lawrence summers attest for rogoff mmt is just nuts folly and nonsense for summers mmt adherents are fringe economists their ideas are voodoo or what is worse supply side economics the flood of invective suggests that the two professors feel a threat probably not to themselves but to the orthodoxies they represent and uphold advertisement mmt is built on the work of john maynard keynes and hyman minsky a core insight is that money in modern states meaning as keynes wrote for the past four thousand years at least is defined by government money is created mostly by public spending and bank loans money is not something out there that the government must borrow from the public in order to function it is created as government functions only afterward those who take payment may then trade the cash for a bond mmt is about the way the world actually works it explains why big deficits do not drive up interest rates or crowd out private investment and why big governments in big countries don t go bankrupt such countries can support big public debts if they have to contrary to mainstream wisdom there is no threshold beyond which public debts produce financial disaster advertisement for example japan has a debt to gdp ratio of 236 percent in 2017 with a large share held by the central bank the yen has not collapsed during the great financial crisis the united states federal reserve bank monetized both the public and even more in trillions the private debt a policy known as quantitative easing the dollar did not collapse why not mmt explains countries with effective tax systems can support the value of their money it is countries without effective tax systems that cannot it is true that open economies seeking to protect their exchange rates operate under constraints but the us dollar isn t very vulnerable and mmt explains why we have a large liquid bond market with no default risk precisely because the treasury can always pay in dollars whatever interest and principal are due summers objects that since government today pays interest on bank reserves deficits are not cost free but mmt points out that government pays interest as well as for everything else by the electronic version of writing a check this actually doesn t cost anything again money is created when you deposit the check you can t do this but governments can i once said this at the council on foreign relations in front of former treasury secretary robert rubin he did not dissent summers and rogoff claim that doing too much of this will lead to hyperinflation perhaps but hyperinflation is hard to arrange today public debt to gdp ratios have risen toward or above 100 percent in many countries but no advanced country has seen it in fact as rogoff admits we have hardly seen inflation in the advanced world in nearly 40 years it is possible barely for a very large country to run a policy so expansionary that it will drive up the world price of oil food and labor mmt does not favor this quite the opposite as stephanie kelton has explained advertisement what mmt does favor is a a public option for employment also called the job guarantee the job guarantee would eliminate involuntary unemployment it would require more federal spending around 1 to 2 percent of gdp or half the military budget but it would not raise spending beyond what is strictly necessary to bring about full employment efficiently and without giveaways to the rich i am not a contributing modern monetary theorist i was raised in older traditions at harvard cambridge britain and yale the scholars of mmt know their underlying ideas are not new they are congenial with what i learned especially from keynes s followers at cambridge more than 40 years ago they are supported as statements of how the world actually works by many current practitioners of high finance so i admire and support the mmt group which is voicing a powerful common sense in the face of grumpy resistance what then is the threat simple if the mainstream s weaknesses and the power and truths of modern monetary theory were ever admitted it would become necessary to cite the work even giving names such as kelton tcherneva mitchell wray and mosler and to describe their ideas in classrooms and in textbooks it would even be necessary to make places for mmt scholars in economics departments even at universities like harvard control over the paradigm over the training of future economists over the minds of the young might begin to slip away advertisement hell it s already happening my students read the arguments on the net and ask questions in class perhaps the same is true even up there along the charles it must be terribly annoying james k galbraith holds the lloyd m bentsen jr chair in government businees relations at the lbj school of public affairs at the university of texas at austin his most recent books are inequality what everyone needs to know and welcome to the poisoned chalice the destruction of greece and the future of europe

photo by hedgerow global kingsmill bond certainly sounds like a proper name for a city of london financial analyst he looks the part too gray hair expertly trimmed well cut suit he s lived in moscow and hong kong and worked for deutsche bank the russian financial firm troika dialog and citibank he s currently new energy strategist for a small british think tank called carbon tracker and last fall he published a short paper called 2020 vision why you should see the fossil fuel peak coming it asks an interesting question at what point does a new technology cause an existing industry to start losing significant value this may turn out to be the most important economic and political question of the first half of this century and the answer might tell us much about our chances of getting through the climate crisis without completely destroying the planet based on earlier technological transitions horses to cars sails to steam land lines to cell phones it seems possible that the fossil fuel industry may begin to weaken much sooner than you d think the british venezuelan scholar carlota perez has observed that over a period of twenty years trains made redundant a four thousand mile network of canals and dredged rivers across the uk the canal builders fought hard and even finished a couple of major canals in the 1830s but defeat was inevitable as it later was for american railroads and horses when they were replaced by trucks and cars major technological transitions often take a while the czech canadian academic vaclav smil has pointed out that although james watt developed the coal powered steam engine in 1776 coal supplied less than 5 percent of the planet s energy until 1840 and it didn t reach 50 percent until 1900 but the economic effect of those transitions can happen much earlier bond writes as soon as it becomes clear to investors that a new technology is accounting for all the growth in a particular sector over the last decade there has been a staggering fall in the price of solar and wind power and of the lithium ion batteries used to store energy this has led to rapid expansion of these technologies even though they are still used much less than fossil fuels in 2017 for instance sun and wind produced just 6 percent of the world s electric supply but they made up 45 percent of the growth in supply and the cost of sun and wind power continues to fall by about 20 percent with each doubling of capacity bond s analysis suggests that in the next few years they will represent all the growth we will then reach peak use of fossil fuels not because we re running out of them but because renewables will have become so cheap that anyone needing a new energy supply will likely turn to solar or wind power bond writes that in the 2020s probably the early 2020s the demand for fossil fuels will stop growing the turning point in such transitions is typically the moment when the impact is felt in financial markets when stock prices tumble and never recover who is going to invest in an industry that is clearly destined to shrink though we ll still be using lots of oil its price should fall if it has to compete with the price of sunshine hence the huge investments in pipelines and tankers and undersea exploration will be increasingly unrecoverable precisely how long it will take is impossible to predict but the outcome seems clear this transition is already obvious in the coal markets to understand for example why peabody the world s largest private sector coal mining company went from being on fortune s list of most admired companies in 2008 to bankrupt in 2016 consider its difficulties in expanding its market india until very recently was expected to provide much of the growth for coal as late as 2015 its coal use was expected to triple by 2030 the country was resisting global efforts like the paris accords to rein in its carbon emissions but the price of renewable energy began to fall precipitously and because india suffered from dire air pollution but has inexhaustible supplies of sunlight its use of solar power started to increase dramatically in 2017 the price in india of wind and solar power dropped 50 percent to 35 40 a megawatt hour said tim buckley who analyzes australasia south asia for the institute for energy economics and financial analysis fifty percent in one year and a zero inflation indexation for the next twenty five years just amazing this price drop occurred not because india subsidizes renewable energy it doesn t but because engineers did such a good job of making solar panels more efficient the cost of power from a newly built coal plant using indian coal is by comparison about 60 a megawatt hour if you have to import the coal the price of power is 70 megawatt hour and solar s 40 megawatt hour price is guaranteed not to rise over the thirty year life of the contract the suppliers sign their bids are based on building and then running a facility for the life of the contract no wonder that over the first nine months of 2018 india installed forty times more capacity for renewable than for coal fired power much the same is happening around the world president trump has spared no effort to help the coal industry but more coal fired power plants shut down during the first two years of his presidency than during president obama s entire first term american coal consumption fell 4 percent in 2018 in 2017 kentucky s coal mining museum installed solar panels on its roof in order to save 10 000 a year on electric costs and it s not just coal that s on the way out natural gas was supposed to be the planet s next big fuel source since it produces less carbon than coal although its production releases great clouds of methane another potent greenhouse gas while fracking has produced high volumes of natural gas especially in the us where it was pioneered wells tend to dry out quickly and despite enormous investment the international energy agency estimates that between 2010 and 2014 the shale industry operated with negative cash flows of more than 200 billion even cheap natural gas is now starting to look expensive compared to the combination of sun wind and batteries in an essay for vox the energy reporter david roberts listed all the natural gas plants many of them designed to provide quick bursts of peaking power on heavy demand days whose planned construction has been canceled in recent months as utilities and banks began to figure out that over the projected forty year life of a new plant there was a good chance it would become an uncompetitive stranded asset producing pointlessly expensive electricity the chief executive of one us solar company said in january i can beat a gas peaker anywhere in the country today with a solar plus storage power plant who in their right mind today would build a new gas peaker we are a factor of two cheaper you get some sense of the future from the stunning fall of general electric they were the world leader the thought leader the finance leader the it leader said buckley and their share price is down 70 percent in the last two and a half years in a market that s up 50 percent it s a thermal power reliant basket case that s in large measure because manufacturing turbines for coal and gas fired power plants was a significant part of the company s business in 2015 it hugely expanded that capacity by buying its largest european competitor alstom but then the bottom dropped out of the industry as proposed new generating plants couldn t find financing ge makes wind turbines too but that s a lower margin business with many more competitors the fall in ge s stock has meant hundreds of billions of dollars of shareholder value reduction according to buckley last june after more than a century general electric was dropped from the dow industrial index replaced by a drugstore chain oil was believed to be better protected than coal and gas from competition because cars have long needed liquid fuel to run but electric cars are becoming affordable for more and more consumers in 2017 only three million out of a worldwide total of 800 million cars were electric but they accounted for 22 percent of the growth in global car sales the world s leading car companies have become convinced that electric vehicles will account for all the growth in demand by the early 2020s that s why by january 2018 they had committed 90 billion to developing electric vehicles and why by 2017 tesla was worth more than gm or ford and for every tesla that rolls off the assembly line chinese manufacturers are producing five electric cars auto analysts are already warning consumers to think twice before buying a gas powered car since its resale value may fall dramatically over just the next three years the oil companies tell investors not to worry in mid february exxon announced that it had found huge new deepwater oil deposits off the coast of guyana and that overall it planned to pump 25 percent more oil and gas in 2025 than it had in 2017 which it claimed would triple its profits in september opec released a report predicting higher oil demand due to increases in jet travel and the production of plastics which are made from petrochemicals analysts like bond are skeptical of such claims although oil has been the planet s most important industry for over a century over the last five years it s been the slowest growing sector of the stock market petrochemicals and jet fuel are indeed harder to replace with renewable energy but they make up a relatively small part of the market for oil even if demand for them grows it can t offset the losses in core uses like pumping gas for cars the recent history of european utilities may provide a more realistic preview of what will happen in the rest of the world in the early years of this century the german government increased the pace of decarbonization subsidizing solar and wind energy as more and cheaper renewable supplies became available the existing utilities were slow to react they had built new gas plants to account for what they assumed would be rising demand but solar and wind cut into that demand and the price of electricity began to fall so far european utilities have written down about 150 billion in stranded assets fossil fuel installations that are no longer needed in the netherlands by the time the last three coal plants were turned on their owners had already written them down by 70 percent said buckley and they re scheduled to close by 2030 one obvious question is why the fossil fuel companies don t simply transform themselves into renewable energy companies and use the huge cash flows they still have to gain control of future markets they re putting under ten percent of capital expenditures into renewables says bond which translates into about one percent of their balance sheets as exxon s ceo recently told the economist we have much higher expectations for the returns on the capital we invest than sun and wind can provide from their point of view there s some money to be made from putting up solar panels but once they re on the roof the sunshine is free for corporations that made vast profits by selling their customers fuel every day for a century that s not an attractive business model another important question is whether this transition will crash the world economy investors have money at risk and not just in fossil fuel shares a shift of this size will affect car companies machinery companies and many others but as the climate activist and billionaire investor tom steyer has pointed out most technological transitions damage existing industries without wrecking the economy because they create value even as they destroy it look at the communications industry over the last two decades as the internet came of age steyer said some of the most valuable businesses on the planet that had been around for more than a century got decimated i mean newsweek sold for a dollar but a lot of new businesses got created that were worth more and banks have had at least some warning to prepare for this enormous shift in 2015 mark carney the governor of the bank of england began issuing strident warnings about stranded fossil fuel assets urging the banks he regulated to begin taking close account of their exposure he gave a memorable speech on the trading floor of lloyds of london pointing out that if countries made serious efforts to meet climate targets vast amounts of money spent on oil wells pipelines coal mines and tankers would be written off he had to issue the warnings he said because the normal time horizon for financiers was too short once climate change becomes a defining issue for financial stability it may already be too late he said noting that the exposure of uk investors including insurance companies to these shifts is potentially huge he urged them to start preparing for a lower carbon world companies he said should disclose not only what they are emitting today but how they plan their transition to the net zero world of the future carney s warning which reverberated out from the financial center of london seems to have spurred a reevaluation of fossil fuel exposure by many big financial institutions the major banks are now addressing this risk whereas three years ago they were asleep to it buckley said now in australia all our banks have climate policy where they didn t three years ago we didn t even have data a report in late february from the institute for energy economics and financial analysis showed that since 2013 a hundred major banks had restricted coal lending or gotten out of the business altogether a far more important question of course is whether the changes now underway will happen fast enough to alter our grim climatic future here the answers are less positive scientists conservative by nature have routinely underestimated the pace of planetary disruption the enormous melt now observed at the poles was not supposed to happen until late in the century for instance and the galloping pace of ocean acidification wasn t even recognized as a threat two decades ago that means that we have very little time to act not enough certainly for business cycles to do the job alone the latest report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change released last autumn laid out a strict timeline we need to effectively halve our use of fossil fuels within a dozen years to prevent the worst damage which is why activists and politicians have called for dramatic government interventions like the green new deal recently proposed by representative alexandria ocasio cortez and her democratic colleagues 2 government action is required because for one thing there s vast inertia in the energy system plants are built to last decades and even if plants that use fossil fuels aren t built today banks will insist that existing ones operate long enough to pay back their investments and in some parts of the world fossil fuel expansion continues china for instance is trying to close down its own coal fired power plants because its cities are choked in smog but chinese companies are using their expertise to build coal powered plants abroad buckley noted that the opportunities for bribes on colossal projects mean among other things that a number of developing countries may indeed continue down the fossil fuel path in countries like the us or canada the political power of the fossil fuel industry is still considerable barack obama boasted to a texas audience last year that during his administration the us had passed russia and saudi arabia as the biggest producer of hydrocarbons even the progressive canadian prime minister justin trudeau recently spent billions in tax dollars to finance a pipeline designed to increase exports from the country s environmentally ruinous tar sands that s why the most important aspect of the decline of fossil fuel companies might be a corresponding decline in their political influence the coal oil and gas industries have been the architects of the disinformation campaigns that kept us from responding earlier to scientists warnings about climate change and they are using every trick they know to keep us from making a quick transition history indicates that the oil majors and those who invest in them will bribe and fund trump type candidates and use their money in any other way to slow down change carlota perez said but change is here while engineers are doing their part by making renewable energy cheaper activists are mounting efforts to weaken the companies directly and there are some signs that the pressure is working an effort that i helped launch beginning in 2012 to persuade universities and churches to divest their fossil fuel shares has spread rapidly and become the largest divestment campaign in history over the last five years insurance companies and sovereign wealth funds have joined in raising the total value of endowments and portfolios involved to over 8 trillion and prompting shell to declare the campaign a material risk to its future business early last year the governments of new york city and london pledged to divest their pension funds and the entire nation of ireland joined in midsummer campaigns have also targeted banks like wells fargo and jp morgan chase to force them to stop supporting particular pipelines the bottom line is clear to the degree that the fossil fuel industry is weakened by some combination of technological change and furious activism the chances for serious change increase if energy barons like the koch brothers and exxon remain flush with cash they can probably delay or undermine initiatives like the green new deal but if their businesses are under strong pressure from a rapidly changing energy economy polities around the world would be freer to take the steps that scientists insist are necessary with the speed required to prevent global catastrophe should these changes happen quickly they could do more than save us from planetary peril a new world the january report on the geopolitics of energy transformation from the international renewable energy agency irena is one of the most hopeful documents i ve read in a long time it points out that for the 80 percent of the world s population that lives in countries that are net importers of fossil fuels the transition to renewable energy means the end of a crushing import burden the long term consequences of a switch to renewables are very positive said bond who helped write the report fossil fuels are produced by a small number of companies and countries and the benefits flow to a small number of people with solar and wind you get a lot more local jobs a lot more local investment you get a whole new geopolitics take india the poorest large nation on earth it imports 80 percent of its oil and 40 percent of its gas along with much of its coal currently that costs the country 240 billion a year if as its leaders hope its economy grows 7 percent annually that figure would double in a decade which is economically unsustainable renewables also offer developing economies an opportunity to leapfrog not only fossil fuels but to some extent the need for a centralized electricity grid the irena report concludes countries in africa and south asia have a golden opportunity to avoid expensive fixed investments in fossil fuels and centralized grids by adopting mini grids and decentralized solar and wind energy deployed off grid just as they jumped straight to mobile phones and obviated the need to lay expensive copper wired telephone networks the changeover of course would be rocky beyond the effects on the global economy or on particular companies and their investors countries like russia or saudi arabia and increasingly parts of the us are essentially oil companies themselves as these petro states face a fall in the value of their only real asset there is a risk of destabilization on a vast scale in fact it s possible that we re in the early stages of this process with mischief and cruelty increasingly on display as countries with no other source of economic power struggle to maintain profits while they can the worst damage will as usual be inflicted on the poorest oil producers kuwait might be able to manage the transition but could angola yet overall the benefits would be immeasurable imagine a world in which the tortured politics of the middle east weren t magnified in importance by the value of the hydrocarbons beneath its sands and imagine a world in which the greatest driver of climate change the unrelenting political power of the fossil fuel industry had begun

the federal reserve is meeting again this week to decide what to do about interest rates earlier this year it surprised everyone by pausing indefinitely its recent run of rate hikes all indications are that the pause will continue this is to the central bank s credit the fed is a deeply flawed institution but its record since 2008 suggests a willingness to think broadly to adapt and to seriously weigh ordinary americans need for jobs and wages by contrast the other most powerful central bank in the world the european central bank spent the last decade running much of the continent into the ground in single minded pursuit of low inflation subscribe to the week escape your echo chamber get the facts behind the news plus analysis from multiple perspectives subscribe save sign up for the

newsletter get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox sign up over the years mainstream western policymaking has reached a certain ad hoc consensus while governments should try to fight recessions and provide welfare aid to their citizens within reason their tax and spending policies should ultimately focus on minimizing year to year deficits and containing their overall debt load the job of managing the macro economy balancing aggregate demand with supply and thus controlling inflation should fall to central banks which use interest rate adjustments and other methods to manage the supply of credit but british historian adam tooze points out that the u s federal reserve is somewhat unusual among central banks in prioritizing both prices and employment which became part of its mandate in 1978 with the humphrey hawkins act the mandate for the ecb on the other hand directs it to worry about inflation alone in the aftermath of the global financial crisis this difference between a dual mandate and single mandate certainly seemed to matter the fed dropped its interest rates to zero almost immediately and kept them there for at least seven years it only began gradually hiking a mere 0 25 percentage points three times a year at most in december of 2015 the ecb on the other hand dilly dallied dropping its target close to zero but not all the way then raising it slightly in 2011 before gradually falling to zero over the next few years where it remains the fed s strategy of interest rate hikes since 2015 was almost certainly too much too fast but not by much compared to europe s ongoing struggles the u s economy is one of the global bright spots today when it mattered in the depths of the crisis the fed acted beyond short term interest rates there was also the fed s massive quantitative easing qe program which it kicked off almost immediately it s difficult to say exactly how much qe mattered in the end but the fed tried weathering a remarkable backlash from inflation hawks in congress and the economics profession in the process and was ultimately vindicated with a recovering u s economy and inflation that never budged again the ecb twiddled its thumbs and did not begin experimenting with qe until 2013 finally there s the matter of how the ecb dealt with specific national crises particularly in greece a single currency and monetary policy spread across multiple national fiscal policies is far from ideal but the ecb could have surmounted those obstacles if it wanted to it could have bought government bonds en masse from specific countries like greece who desperately needed the big fiscal stimulus measures and the overall design of the eurozone s central banking system allows new euro supplies to be created and directed into the specific places where help is most needed the ecb simply refused to take advantage of any of this as tooze writes the ecb instead used its leverage for an explicitly ideological project of smashing welfare states and imposing crushing austerity as a result america s unemployment rate today has fallen to a remarkable low of 3 8 percent eurozone unemployment peaked at 12 percent in 2013 and remains around 8 percent today it s far worse in the eurozone countries hit hardest by the crisis looking back over the history of the ecb s construction and the statements of its supporters economist j w mason concluded that the whole point of the euro system was to subordinate democracy to the money claims of the financial system and private wealth holders to roll back social democracy and to reimpose the discipline of the market on the state in truth if we look back beyond 2008 the u s fed shares many of these same instincts the ink on the humphrey hawkins act was barely dry when fed chairman paul volcker brazenly threw it overboard setting off a massive recession to tame inflation the u s central bank s institutional culture is deeply bound up with that of wall street and business owners which prize low inflation while ignoring or even preferring high unemployment the fed s record since volcker s time clearly demonstrates those same biases its relatively worker friendly policy after 2008 was a long and hard won concession the great difference between the ecb and the fed may be that the latter has actually been the subject of explicit political fights the ecb operates behind an immense veil of both ideological consensus and byzantine political and policy processes the fed however has found itself the target of political movements and activist ire on more than one occasion the dual mandate resulted from a push for a full employment guarantee born aloft by the remaining power of the civil rights movement today the fed finds itself the focus of an ongoing and organized pressure campaign by progressive economists and working class activists even democratic policymakers are beginning to get in on the act ultimately the dual mandate is as much a symptom of the fed s differences with the ecb than a cause it is de rigueur among america s very serious people to insist the federal reserve never be politicized its monetary policy decisions should be left to the technocratic experts ironically it s the ecb that comes much closer to meeting that ideal america has always fallen short and we are indisputably better for it
calgary alberta march 20 2019 globe newswire inplay oil corp tsx ipo otcqx ipoof inplay or the company announces its financial and operating results for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2018 and the results of its independent oil and gas reserves evaluation effective december 31 2018 the sproule report prepared by sproule associates limited sproule inplay s audited annual financial statements and notes as well as management s discussion and analysis md a for the year ended december 31 2018 will be available shortly on the system for electronic document analysis and retrieval sedar and our website www inplayoil com message to shareholders inplay had a strong year in 2018 pursuing a focused light oil growth strategy which also included increasing our land base in both short and long term premier light oil assets this was achieved without share dilution while maintaining financial flexibility inplay achieved organic drill bit light oil and liquids production growth of 22 over 2017 with a capital efficiency of 14 770 per boe d which we believe is in the top tier among our light oil peers we successfully grew our willesden green land base by adding over 50 net tier one locations effectively replacing five years of drilling inventory inplay also added 7 680 acres a 34 increase to our land base in the longer term east duvernay light oil shale play where we have now spent the required capital extending our land tenure four to five years these long tenured crown lands allow us to continue to evaluate increasingly positive results from industry delineating the play inplay disposed of 27 3 million of non core facilities and infrastructure as well as non core non operated assets that were producing approximately 250 boe d in 2018 these dispositions enabled us to increase our position in our top tier plays while also maintaining our strong balance sheet production results and drilling and completion costs continue to exceed our expectations and budget this was accomplished through strong execution of an efficient cost effective development program including drilling pacesetter wells evolving and optimizing completions utilizing new technology and smart facility enhancements this resulted in two increases to our annual production guidance in the second half of 2018 achieving exceptional financial and operational results with a 25 year over year increase in annual operating income to 39 8 million the strong performance of the company s assets specifically in willesden green resulted in increased year end reserves volumes and values across all categories including reserves sold during the year and the removal of legacy undeveloped gas locations held by inplay s predecessor entity prior to going public in november 2016 the performance is highlighted by proved developed producing reserves pdp that increased 6 to 8 348 mboe and before tax net present values of future net revenue discounted at 10 npv10 bt that increased 7 to 139 2 million the net result is pdp net asset value nav increased 9 to 2 17 per share while generating solid finding development and acquisition fd a costs of 9 49 per boe with a recycle ratio of 2 5 times total proved plus probable reserves tpp increased 4 and associated npv10 bt increased 11 to 27 063 mboe and 387 7 million respectively resulting in a tpp nav that increased 11 to 5 81 per share see section net asset value for these nav calculations these results were achieved in light of the extreme negative market factors that affected canada s crude oil pricing market in the fourth quarter of 2018 revenues were impacted by reduced west texas intermediate wti pricing with the peak lows in december at 42 53 per bbl usd coupled with significantly widening edmonton light oil differentials which settled at 34 80 per bbl usd in december and averaged 26 30 per bbl usd for the quarter these differentials exacerbated for most of the canadian oil weighted production companies due to the activities of some large producers who have upstream and downstream operations as well as refiners from the united states all of whom have the majority of terminal storage and firm service on pipelines tied up and in most cases are nominating pipeline volumes above and beyond their producing capacity inplay prudently reacted to these deteriorating pricing scenarios by delaying the completions and tie in of two horizontal wells that were drilled in 2018 to the first quarter of 2019 when we saw the crude oil pricing and differential situation start to improve commodity pricing has quickly corrected positively in the first quarter of 2019 with wti prices currently at approximately 59 00 per bbl usd and edmonton differentials settling back to more normalized levels in the 4 00 6 00 per bbl usd range the result for inplay is that we expect the first quarter of 2019 to be one of our best financial and operational quarters in our history the solid start to 2019 with pricing and operational results from our capital program has us confirming guidance for the year which we anticipate will result in top tier organic light oil and liquids growth among our light oil peers of 6 to 10 percent on annual production and 10 to 14 percent on exit production while spending approximately adjusted funds flow from operations the company has continued to evolve by increasing our exposure to two high quality and focused plays the current high return quick payout light oil cardium growth play and the evolving longer term light oil east basin duvernay shale play this transformation has put us in a much stronger position than when inplay went public in november of 2016 and places us in an enviable position as a sustainable canadian junior light oil exploration

focused light oil core asset base while maintaining a strong balance sheet this effective activity was the driver that allowed us to increase our production guidance twice in the second half of 2018 and includes the following acquired 6 059 net acres in q1 2018 in willesden green for consideration of 5 5 million which added an additional 50 net tier one drilling locations 12 8 6 net wells have been drilled to date with results that have exceeded our expectations sold our 100 interest in a non core natural gas facility and associated infrastructure for 10 million in the q1 2018 of which inplay was only using 14 of the throughput capacity disposed of predominantly non operated non core assets in west pembina producing 250 boe d for premium market valuation proceeds of 16 6 million in q4 2018 capital efficiencies of 14 770 per boe d were achieved on exploration and development capital spent on drilling completions equipping and facilities the majority of capital was spent in willesden green where we drilled 16 11 2 net horizontal wells and in the duvernay where a 100 vertical stratigraphic test well was drilled that has been abandoned and completion of the horizontal well drilled in 2017 annual 2018 light oil and liquids growth is up 22 to 3 248 bbl day over 2017 reflecting the focused development of our light oil and liquids assets annual average 2018 production is up 17 over 2017 to 4 653 boe day exceeding corporate guidance of 4 600 boe d day production per weighted average basic share increased 8 in 2018 over 2017 and all of the growth was achieved while disposing of 250 boe d on october 1 2018 and with the deferral of completions of two horizontal wells drilled in the fourth quarter of 2018 to first quarter of 2019 average fourth quarter 2018 light oil and liquids production is up 22 over fourth quarter 2017 to 3 510 bbl day reflecting our focus on our light oil weighted cardium assets fourth quarter 2018 production was up 20 over the fourth

mboe respectively annual revenues increased by 23 to 76 4 million 94 derived from crude oil and natural gas liquids resulting in operating income profit margins 1 of 52 in 2018 operating income 1 increased by 25 to 39 8 million in 2018 and operating netbacks per boe 1 increased by 7 to 23 43 per boe in 2018 backed by increased oil and liquid weightings stronger prices and reduced operating costs this was accomplished even with the extreme market factors affecting crude commodity pricing in the fourth quarter which resulted in operating netbacks of 8 84 per boe versus 28 88 per boe achieved in the first three quarters of 2018 adjusted funds flow from operations 1 increased by 8 to 27 0 million year over year in 2018 this would have increased by 31 to 31 2 million without hedging gains and losses on derivative contracts over the years and results would have been much higher without the severe crude commodity price environment in the fourth quarter strategic crown land holdings in the east duvernay light oil shale play increased by 12 sections for consideration of 1 4 million in the year the company now has a significant land position in one of the most exciting new canadian light oil plays with 30 640 net acres 48 25 net sections an independent report was prepared for inplay on this land by qualified land evaluators seaton jordan associates which resulted in a value of 49 6 million at year end see the section entitled net asset value 1 non gaap term see non gaap financial measures section 2018 capital and operating overview inplay executed a 50 2 million capital program during 2018 focused on the willesden green bioturbated cardium formation the company drilled 12 8 6 net extended reach horizontal erh wells and 4 2 6 net one mile horizontal wells the final two cardium completions were deferred from october of 2018 into 2019 to avoid the poor fourth quarter 2018 canadian oil prices and add value by selling the flush production period into a time frame with improved pricing in aggregate inplay drilled an equivalent of 23 0 16 5 net horizontal miles the company completed one duvernay horizontal well during the second quarter of 2018 and drilled one vertical stratigraphic duvernay test well in the fourth quarter by drilling these wells our land tenure has been extended between four to five years the company also acquired an additional 12 sections of undeveloped crown land in the duvernay area inplay s focus on developing the willesden green bioturbated cardium assets continued to deliver exceptional results with production volumes and rates consistently exceeding internal estimates we believe inplay is delivering top tier capital efficiencies with its capital program where we have managed to achieve some of the shortest spud to rig release days for erh wells seen to date in the area our most recent six 1 5 mile erh wells have averaged 9 7 drilling days we have also achieved very consistent drilling performance whereby the maximum deviation from average drilling time of the six 1 5 mile erh wells has been 0 7 days our 1 5 mile erh wells allow us to access approximately 60 more reservoir while incurring only 20 more in additional capital expenditures compared to a one mile horizontal well these factors drove improved capital efficiencies on our 2018 capital program to approximately 14 770 per boe d 2018 reserve

program budgeted for 2019 all wells drilled in the first quarter have been completed with initial results in line with previous wells which have exceeded our forecasted type curves the company is on track with our focused capital budget of 36 million for the year drilling approximately 9 net erh wells with the majority being cardium wells in willesden green the remaining erh wells are expected to be drilled and brought on production in the second half of 2019 our 2019 guidance is maintained with annual average production estimated at 4 900 to 5 100 boe d approximately 70 oil liquids with growth between 6 and 10 percent for oil and liquids and on a total boe basis exit production of 5 400 to 5 600 boe d 70 oil liquids with growth between 10 and 14 percent this guidance is based on

reader advisories non gaap financial measures inplay uses certain terms within this news release that do not have a standardized prescribed meaning under gaap and these measurements may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measurements of other entities the terms adjusted funds flow from operations adjusted funds flow from operations per share adjusted funds flow from operations per boe operating income operating netback per boe and operating income profit margin in this news release are not defined measures under gaap and do not have standardized meanings or standardized methods of calculation and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies management believes that in addition to net earnings and cash flow provided by operating activities as defined by gaap these terms are useful supplemental measures to evaluate operating performance as it demonstrates its field level of profitability relative to current commodity prices and to assess leverage adjusted funds flow from operations should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than cash flow provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s performance inplay s determination of adjusted funds flow from operations may not be comparable to that reported by other companies adjusted funds flow from operations is calculated by adjusting for changes in operating non cash working capital and decommissioning expenditures from cash flow provided by operating activities these items are adjusted from cash flow provided by operating activities as these expenditures are primarily incurred on previous operating assets and there is uncertainty with the timing and payment of these items and they are incurred on a discretionary basis making them less useful in the evaluation inplay s operating performance adjusted funds flow from operations per share is calculated using the same weighted average number of shares outstanding used in calculating earnings per share for a detailed description of inplay s method of the calculation of adjusted funds flow from operations and its reconciliation to its nearest gaap term see non ifrs measures in the company s md a filed on sedar the term net debt is not recognized under gaap and is calculated as bank debt plus working capital deficiency adjusted for risk management derivative contract fair values deferred lease credits flow through share premiums and current portion of decommissioning obligation net debt is used by management to analyze the financial position and leverage of inplay inplay monitors working capital and net debt as part of its capital structure such terms do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities inplay also uses operating income and operating netback per boe as a key performance indicator operating income is calculated by the company as oil and natural gas sales less royalties operating expenses and transportation expenses and is a measure of the profitability of operations before administrative share based compensation financing and other non cash items management considers operating income an important measure to evaluate its operational performance as it demonstrates its field level profitability operating netback per boe is calculated by the company as operating income divided by average production for the respective period management considers operating netback per boe an important measure to evaluate its operational performance as it demonstrates its field level profitability per unit of production operating income profit margin is calculated as operating netback as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales this measure demonstrates the company s ability to generate field level profitability in relation to sales revenue information regarding disclosure on oil and gas reserves and operational information our oil and gas reserves statement for the year ended december 31 2017 which will include complete disclosure of our oil and gas reserves and other oil and gas information in accordance with ni 51 101 will be contained within our annual information form which will be available on our sedar profile at www sedar com on or before march 29 2019 the recovery and reserve estimates contained herein are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered in relation to the disclosure of estimates for individual properties such estimates may not reflect the same confidence level as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties due to the effects of aggregation the company s belief that it will establish additional reserves over time with conversion of probable undeveloped reserves into proved reserves is a forward looking statement and is based on certain assumptions and is subject to certain risks as discussed below under the heading forward looking information and statements this press release contains metrics commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry such as finding development and acquisition costs finding and development costs operating netbacks recycle ratios and recycle ratio reserve replacement and reserve life index or rli each of these terms are calculated by inplay as described in this press release these terms do not have standardized meanings or standardized methods of calculation and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and therefore should not be used to make such comparisons such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional information to evaluate the company s performance however such metrics should not be unduly relied upon finding development and acquisition costs take into account reserves revisions during the year on a per boe basis the aggregate of the costs incurred in the financial year and changes during that year in estimated future development costs may not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserves additions for that year finding development and acquisition costs have been presented in this press release because acquisitions and dispositions can have a significant impact on our ongoing reserves replacement costs and excluding these amounts could result in an inaccurate portrayal of our cost structure exploration development capital means the aggregate exploration and development costs incurred in the financial year on exploration and on reserves that are categorized as development exploration development capital excludes capitalized administration costs and exploration costs incurred acquiring duvernay lands with no reserves assigned acquisition capital amounts to the total amount of cash and share consideration net of any working capital balances assumed with an acquisition on closing management

use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions creating collateral security packages types of collateral what types of collateral and security interests are available there are different real guarantees ie those created over goods either tangible or intangible depending on the type of collateral the nature of the secured obligation and its beneficiary one of the most important real guarantees is the mortgage which may be created among others over real estate mining property water rights usufruct rights aircraft and vessels additionally the pledge is a kind of security interest that can be created over movable assets there are different types of pledges such as the civil pledge to secure any kind of obligations the commercial pledge to secure commercial obligations and the pledge without conveyance where the pledgor maintains the possession of the asset using these pledges a security interest can be created over any type of movable assets such as personal property contractual rights receivables securities shares monies deposited in bank accounts after acquired property and concession rights there is also a special pledge over securities in favour of banks which can be created over any kind of securities including shares delivered to a bank or other financial institution in order to secure the obligations of the pledgor with such institution collateral perfecting how is a security interest in each type of collateral perfected and how is its priority established are any fees taxes or other charges payable to perfect a security interest and if so are there lawful techniques to minimise them may a corporate entity in the capacity of agent or trustee hold collateral on behalf of the project lenders as the secured party is it necessary for the security agent and trustee to hold any licences to hold or enforce such security the mortgage over real estate property is perfected by means of a public deed executed before a chilean public notary registered in the corresponding real estate registry more than one mortgage can be created over the same property and in such case the priority among existing mortgages will be given by the order of their respective registrations the parties can also create priorities among mortgages in the same mortgage agreements the civil and commercial pledges are perfected by delivering the relevant pledged asset to the pledgee without requiring any kind of registration however in the case of the commercial pledge in order for the relevant creditor to benefit from the preference created by the pledge it must be executed by means of a public deed or a private document incorporated in a notary public s registry if a civil or commercial pledge is created over a credit it has to be notified to the debtor the pledge without conveyance is perfected by executing a public deed or a private document duly authorised and registered by a notary public the pledge agreement has to be registered in the registry of pledges without conveyance kept by the civil registry service if the pledged asset is subject to mandatory registration in other specific registry eg motorised vehicles a reference to the pledge agreement shall be annotated in such registry one or more pledges of this kind can be created over the same asset and in such case the priority among them will be given by their registration order the parties can also create priorities among pledges in the same pledge agreements in order to perfect pledge over securities in favour of banks the pledgor shall deliver the pledged securities to the financial institution if the securities have been issued to the bearer or endorse them in guarantee if the securities have been issued to the order of the holder the pledge over shares shall be executed by means of a public deed or a private document and notified to the issuing company no taxes are required to be paid in order to perfect the above mentioned guarantees but there are fees charged by the intervening notary public and other charges and expenses associated with the applicable registrations the law expressly recognises the collateral agency pursuant to a collateral agency agreement two or more creditors with the acceptance of the debtor appoint a common agent to represent them in the creation amendment or release of their guarantees and in the joint exercise of their rights the guarantees are created in favour of the collateral agent who accepts them on behalf of all present and future creditors and therefore new creditors will be secured without the need to amend the underlying security agreements it is not necessary for the collateral agent to hold any licences to hold or enforce such securities in the event of bankruptcy of the collateral agent the assets granted as collateral should be excluded from the bankruptcy process as the collateral agent does not own the collateral which is held on behalf of the secured creditors the parallel debt clause concept is not expressly recognised by chilean law assuring absence of liens how can a creditor assure itself as to the absence of liens with priority to the creditor s lien liens over real estate property have to be registered in the corresponding real estate registry and therefore a creditor can obtain from the competent real estate registrar a certificate listing all liens affecting the relevant property in the case of moveable property a creditor can obtain from the civil registry service a certificate of pledges without conveyance granted by an individual or legal entity since this certificate cannot be requested with respect to a specific asset it may not give a creditor total assurance that no preferred lien exists over such asset there is no certification with respect to civil and commercial pledges created over an asset enforcing collateral rights outside the context of a bankruptcy proceeding what steps should a project lender take to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral it is mandatory for a secured creditor to follow the procedures contemplated in the law for the enforcement of its rights over any collateral located in chile in general these procedures must be carried out before an ordinary court and the sale of assets must be made through a public auction in which the secured creditors can participate as bidders there are statutory rules related to notice periods rights and obligations of all the parties involved in the process there is no legal prohibition for a sale in foreign currency but in practice sales within a judicial procedure are made in the local currency enforcing collateral rights following bankruptcy how does a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the project company affect the ability of a project lender to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral are there any preference periods clawback rights or other preferential creditors rights eg tax debts employees claims with respect to the collateral what entities are excluded from bankruptcy proceedings and what legislation applies to them what processes other than court proceedings are available to seize the assets of the project company in an enforcement as regards a project company there are two main insolvency proceedings i the reorganisation proceeding which has the purpose of restructuring the liabilities and assets of a debtor permitting to continue with its business and ii the liquidation proceeding for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor in a reorganisation proceeding the debtor will enjoy a bankruptcy financial protection for 30 business days which can be extended for up to 60 additional business days if supported by the creditors during such bankruptcy financial protection all contracts entered into by the debtor and the payment conditions thereof will remain in force consequently they may not be unilaterally early terminated or accelerated nor may any collateral thereunder be enforced based on the commencement of a reorganisation proceeding if a creditor contravenes this ban its credit will be subordinated until all creditors are paid additionally during a reorganisation proceeding creditors may not demand the early payment of obligations based on the legal acceleration recognised by the civil code in case of the debtor s notorious insolvency in a liquidation proceeding the rights of the creditors to individually enforce its rights against the debtor are suspended but secured creditors are entitled to initiate or continue their legal actions to enforce their rights over the collateral subject to mortgages or pledges but securing the payment of certain preferential credits however there are certain events that suspend the rights of secured creditors to exercise their rights over the relevant collateral eg sale of assets as an economic unit and the continuation of the economic activities of the debtor if the creditor accepts the terms thereof regarding clawback rights any act or contract executed by the debtor within two years prior to the commencement of the reorganisation or liquidation proceeding may be rendered ineffective if it is proved that i the counterparty had knowledge of the debtor s bad business condition and ii the act or contract caused damages to the bankruptcy estate or affected the parity that shall exist among creditors exceptionally there are specific cases based on objective grounds that allow the creditors or the insolvency trustee to request the revocation of certain acts or contracts executed by the debtor within the year prior to the commencement of the insolvency proceedings eg payments before its maturity date or the creation of security interests over a debtor s assets to guarantee pre existing obligations in a liquidation creditors are paid following the mandatory preferences established by the law and employee s salaries wages social security obligations taxes and court fees among others will have preference over other claims in the case of a reorganisation proceeding certain expenses incurred and facilities granted during the bankruptcy financial protection will be preferred the bankruptcy law applies to individuals and private legal entities banks and other regulated entities such as insurance companies pension funds and public agencies are subject to other insolvency proceedings contained in different specific laws as a general rule no out of court proceedings are available to seize the assets of the project company in an enforcement claims of foreign creditors are treated equally as the claims of local creditors foreign exchange and withholding tax issues

are bilateral or syndicated loans which may be granted either by local or foreign banks or financial institutions and the issuance of debt securities to be publicly offered bonds public private partnership legislation applicable legislation has ppp enabling legislation been enacted and if so at what level of government and is the legislation industry specific yes at national level it covers different industries such as toll roads bridges airports transmission lines cable railways multipurpose dams hospitals jails stadia and other social infrastructure ppp limitations legal limitations what if any are the practical and legal limitations on ppp transactions for the development of a project as a ppp transaction the regulations and limitations imposed by the respective ppp enabling regulation shall be observed in this sense for example under the public works concessions law and related regulation a concession shall be awarded only to an entity that complies with certain requirements and the concession cannot be granted for more that 50 years other particular restrictions shall be analysed on a case by case basis if a ppp transaction requires the use of public funds it has to be included in the national budget and duly authorised pursuant to the applicable laws and regulations there are some relevant practical limitations such as the following the awarding of the ppp contract involves a lengthy administrative process that includes the participation of different authorities eg the ministry of finance and the general comptroller of the republic on the same note the processes of environmental approval are complex and environmental agencies involved in the process such as municipalities may require adaptations to the awarded project the risk of obtaining financing for the project is borne by the developer guarantees required by ppp contracts such as performance bonds and insurance policies must be issued in chile by local banks or local insurance companies those guarantees must be taken directly by the bidders or the concessionaire company and not by its shareholders or sponsors this could make guarantees more expensive or may force the sponsors to issue a counter guarantee during the construction stage the shareholders of a project company concessionaire that has been awarded a public work concession cannot freely transfer its shareholdings in the project company and also project companies that have been awarded a public works concession are sole purpose entities which imposes certain restriction to the type of business they can engage in ppp transactions significant transactions what have been the most significant ppp transactions completed to date in your jurisdiction codelco a state owned company that is one of the world s main copper producers tendered for the supply of desalinated water for its mining operations in the antofagasta region the project purpose is to supply desalinated water at competitive prices under a boot type arrangement the initial capacity of the project will be 630 litres per second l s and a potential 1 680 l s the project includes marine works a desalination plant and approximately 160km of pipeline and relevant pumping system to transfer the water as well as the associated electrical infrastructure a consortium formed by vinci aéroports de paris and astaldi was awarded the santiago airport concession project in april 2015 and was the major ppp chilean project of the year the transaction was for an amount of approximately us 700 million and obtained international financing in 2016 update trends update trends updates and trends in may 2018 the government announced two measures to promote investment in chile and the country s growth one is the pro investment agenda to promote a legal environment that is friendlier to project investments in chile including measures to create digital platforms to obtain permits regulate the suspension of new works to avoid frivolous claims that could delay investment projects facilitate the process of environmental approvals allow the creation of security interest over maritime concessions etc the other announcement was the creation of a new public office the sustainable projects management office whose main purpose will be to coordinate and expedite the authorisation process of large investment projects in the country whether public or private to do this the new office will coordinate the various public services in charge of issuing permits and authorisations to ensure that the deadlines established by the regulations are met and that the licensing and permitting processes are more efficient and transparent there is also a proposal regarding public works concessions with respect to the environmental approvals for such projects what is under discussion is the ease of obtaining environmental approvals of public works before they are tendered by the government authority with the purpose of eliminating the concessionaire s risk of not obtaining the relevant environmental permits or their being revoked the revocation of environmental permits as a consequence of third parties allegations has become one of the major risks faced by developers in project finance

the new gahcho kué mine and we are pleased with its operational performance the gahcho kué mine has settled down well and has outperformed our initial expectations in terms of throughput and overall diamond production which is an excellent achievement this trend has continued into 2019 with the mine continuing to perform substantially ahead of expectations financial year 2019 is expected to be another strong year of production we are confident that we will meet or exceed our production targets as we have done in the last two years along with our joint venture partner de beers canada we are working on various short and medium term initiatives which will have a positive impact on the future of the gahcho kué mine these relate to improvement of production rates and extending the life of mine by including additional jv ore discovered during 2018 and we look forward to updating the market as we complete these tasks later in 2019 in addition to the jv related improvements we are also focussing on the wholly owned kennady advanced stage diamondiferous kimberlites and near mine exploration opportunities and will update the market on our progress in due course the company also delivered very good results from its sales process selling all of its production made available during 2018 which translated into good operating margins further demonstrating the ability of the ore bodies at the gahcho kué mine to deliver strong free cash flow the rough diamond market experienced a relatively difficult finish to the year with price pressure in the smaller and lower quality diamond categories although we did see a stabilisation of prices towards the end of the year and so far we have seen a small improvement in the lower quality categories at the start of 2019 the company s longer term view of the fundamentals of the diamond business remain positive and combined with the quality of the gahcho kué mine with its long life and high margins we believe we are well positioned for the future to benefit even more with improved diamond prices 2019 is a year of innovation and assessing how to improve the returns to shareholders and i am positive that the work we are doing together with de beers will deliver on this throughout the year ahead gahcho kué mine operations the following table summarizes key operating statistics for the gahcho kué mine in the three

non ifrs measures with no standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs see the non ifrs measures section of the company s december 31 2018 md a for explanation and reconciliation mountain province president and ceo stuart brown commented financial year 2018 was mountain province s first full year of commercial production at the new gahcho kué mine and we are pleased with its operational performance the gahcho kué mine has settled down well and has outperformed our initial expectations in terms of throughput and overall diamond production which is an excellent achievement this trend has continued into 2019 with the mine continuing to perform substantially ahead of expectations financial year 2019 is expected to be another strong year of production we are confident that we will meet or exceed our production targets as we have done in the last two years along with our joint venture partner de beers canada we are working on various short and medium term initiatives which will have a positive impact on the future of the gahcho kué mine these relate to improvement of production rates and extending the life of mine by including additional jv ore discovered during 2018 and we look forward to updating the market as we complete these tasks later in 2019 in addition to the jv related improvements we are also focussing on the wholly owned kennady advanced stage diamondiferous kimberlites and near mine exploration opportunities and will update the market on our progress in due course the company also delivered very good results from its sales process selling all of its production made available during 2018 which translated into good operating margins further demonstrating the ability of the ore bodies at the gahcho kué mine to deliver strong free cash flow the rough diamond market experienced a relatively difficult finish to the year with price pressure in the smaller and lower quality diamond categories although we did see a stabilisation of prices towards the end of the year and so far we have seen a small improvement in the lower quality categories at the start of 2019 the company s longer term view of the fundamentals of the diamond business remain positive and combined with the quality of the gahcho kué mine with its long life and high margins we believe we are well positioned for the future to benefit even more with improved diamond prices 2019 is a year of innovation and assessing how to improve the returns to shareholders and i am positive that the work we are doing together with de beers will deliver on this throughout the year ahead

that the committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes should be maintained there will be two major focuses for the announcement as well as press conference firstly fed s is known to be preparing for ending the balance sheet roll off this year the balance sheet surged from less than usd 1t in 2008 to hit a peak of usd 4 5t as a result of the quantitative easing program it then started to be reduced by usd 50b per month since early last year the detailed plan might be revealed today with specifics on when and how the runoff would end fed will also publish first set of new economic projections after it shifted to a patient stance forecasts on gdp unemployment rate and inflation

data protection patent linkages and refused to give ground on data service issues nevertheless some officials on both sides are seeing the back and froth as something expected in typical negotiations the date for signing a trade deal between the countries has been pushed back recently while it s still possible to happen in april the more probable occasion would be as sideline of g20 summit in

president and ceo stuart brown commented financial year 2018 was mountain province s first full year of commercial production at the new gahcho kué mine and we are pleased with its operational performance the gahcho kué mine has settled down well and has outperformed our initial expectations in terms of throughput and overall diamond production which is an excellent achievement this trend has continued into 2019 with the mine continuing to perform substantially ahead of expectations financial year 2019 is expected to be another strong year of production we are confident that we will meet or exceed our production targets as we have done in the last two years along with our joint venture partner de beers canada we are working on various short and medium term initiatives which will have a positive impact on the future of the gahcho kué mine these relate to improvement of production rates and extending the life of mine by including additional jv ore discovered during 2018 and we look forward to updating the market as we complete these tasks later in 2019 in addition to the jv related improvements we are also focussing on the wholly owned kennady advanced stage diamondiferous kimberlites and near mine exploration opportunities and will update the market on our progress in due course the company also delivered very good results from its sales process selling all of its production made available during 2018 which translated into good operating margins further demonstrating the ability of the ore bodies at the gahcho kué mine to deliver strong free cash flow the rough diamond market experienced a relatively difficult finish to the year with price pressure in the smaller and lower quality diamond categories although we did see a stabilisation of prices towards the end of the year and so far we have seen a small improvement in the lower quality categories at the start of 2019 the company s longer term view of the fundamentals of the diamond business remain positive and combined with the quality of the gahcho kué mine with its long life and high margins we believe we are well positioned for the future to benefit even more with improved diamond prices 2019 is a year of innovation and assessing how to improve the returns to shareholders and i am positive that the work we are doing together with de beers will deliver on this throughout the year ahead

calgary alberta march 20 2019 globe newswire inplay oil corp tsx ipo otcqx ipoof inplay or the company announces its financial and operating results for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2018 and the results of its independent oil and gas reserves evaluation effective december 31 2018 the sproule report prepared by sproule associates limited sproule inplay s audited annual financial statements and notes as well as management s discussion and analysis md a for the year ended december 31 2018 will be available shortly on the system for electronic document analysis and retrieval sedar and our website www inplayoil com message to shareholders inplay had a strong year in 2018 pursuing a focused light oil growth strategy which also included increasing our land base in both short and long term premier light oil assets this was achieved without share dilution while maintaining financial flexibility inplay achieved organic drill bit light oil and liquids production growth of 22 over 2017 with a capital efficiency of 14 770 per boe d which we believe is in the top tier among our light oil peers we successfully grew our willesden green land base by adding over 50 net tier one locations effectively replacing five years of drilling inventory inplay also added 7 680 acres a 34 increase to our land base in the longer term east duvernay light oil shale play where we have now spent the required capital extending our land tenure four to five years these long tenured crown lands allow us to continue to evaluate increasingly positive results from industry delineating the play inplay disposed of 27 3 million of non core facilities and infrastructure as well as non core non operated assets that were producing approximately 250 boe d in 2018 these dispositions enabled us to increase our position in our top tier plays while also maintaining our strong balance sheet production results and drilling and completion costs continue to exceed our expectations and budget this was accomplished through strong execution of an efficient cost effective development program including drilling pacesetter wells evolving and optimizing completions utilizing new technology and smart facility enhancements this resulted in two increases to our annual production guidance in the second half of 2018 achieving exceptional financial and operational results with a 25 year over year increase in annual operating income to 39 8 million the strong performance of the company s assets specifically in willesden green resulted in increased year end reserves volumes and values across all categories including reserves sold during the year and the removal of legacy undeveloped gas locations held by inplay s predecessor entity prior to going public in november 2016 the performance is highlighted by proved developed producing reserves pdp that increased 6 to 8 348 mboe and before tax net present values of future net revenue discounted at 10 npv10 bt that increased 7 to 139 2 million the net result is pdp net asset value nav increased 9 to 2 17 per share while generating solid finding development and acquisition fd a costs of 9 49 per boe with a recycle ratio of 2 5 times total proved plus probable reserves tpp increased 4 and associated npv10 bt increased 11 to 27 063 mboe and 387 7 million respectively resulting in a tpp nav that increased 11 to 5 81 per share see section net asset value for these nav calculations these results were achieved in light of the extreme negative market factors that affected canada s crude oil pricing market in the fourth quarter of 2018 revenues were impacted by reduced west texas intermediate wti pricing with the peak lows in december at 42 53 per bbl usd coupled with significantly widening edmonton light oil differentials which settled at 34 80 per bbl usd in december and averaged 26 30 per bbl usd for the quarter these differentials exacerbated for most of the canadian oil weighted production companies due to the activities of some large producers who have upstream and downstream operations as well as refiners from the united states all of whom have the majority of terminal storage and firm service on pipelines tied up and in most cases are nominating pipeline volumes above and beyond their producing capacity inplay prudently reacted to these deteriorating pricing scenarios by delaying the completions and tie in of two horizontal wells that were drilled in 2018 to the first quarter of 2019 when we saw the crude oil pricing and differential situation start to improve commodity pricing has quickly corrected positively in the first quarter of 2019 with wti prices currently at approximately 59 00 per bbl usd and edmonton differentials settling back to more normalized levels in the 4 00 6 00 per bbl usd range the result for inplay is that we expect the first quarter of 2019 to be one of our best financial and operational quarters in our history the solid start to 2019 with pricing and operational results from our capital program has us confirming guidance for the year which we anticipate will result in top tier organic light oil and liquids growth among our light oil peers of 6 to 10 percent on annual production and 10 to 14 percent on exit production while spending approximately adjusted funds flow from operations the company has continued to evolve by increasing our exposure to two high quality and focused plays the current high return quick payout light oil cardium growth play and the evolving longer term light oil east basin duvernay shale play this transformation has put us in a much stronger position than when inplay went public in november of 2016 and places us in an enviable position as a sustainable canadian junior light oil exploration

focused light oil core asset base while maintaining a strong balance sheet this effective activity was the driver that allowed us to increase our production guidance twice in the second half of 2018 and includes the following acquired 6 059 net acres in q1 2018 in willesden green for consideration of 5 5 million which added an additional 50 net tier one drilling locations 12 8 6 net wells have been drilled to date with results that have exceeded our expectations sold our 100 interest in a non core natural gas facility and associated infrastructure for 10 million in the q1 2018 of which inplay was only using 14 of the throughput capacity disposed of predominantly non operated non core assets in west pembina producing 250 boe d for premium market valuation proceeds of 16 6 million in q4 2018 capital efficiencies of 14 770 per boe d were achieved on exploration and development capital spent on drilling completions equipping and facilities the majority of capital was spent in willesden green where we drilled 16 11 2 net horizontal wells and in the duvernay where a 100 vertical stratigraphic test well was drilled that has been abandoned and completion of the horizontal well drilled in 2017 annual 2018 light oil and liquids growth is up 22 to 3 248 bbl day over 2017 reflecting the focused development of our light oil and liquids assets annual average 2018 production is up 17 over 2017 to 4 653 boe day exceeding corporate guidance of 4 600 boe d day production per weighted average basic share increased 8 in 2018 over 2017 and all of the growth was achieved while disposing of 250 boe d on october 1 2018 and with the deferral of completions of two horizontal wells drilled in the fourth quarter of 2018 to first quarter of 2019 average fourth quarter 2018 light oil and liquids production is up 22 over fourth quarter 2017 to 3 510 bbl day reflecting our focus on our light oil weighted cardium assets fourth quarter 2018 production was up 20 over the fourth quarter 2017 to 5 021 boe day representing per weighted average share growth of 13 significant growth occurred in production and reserves in our core willesden green area production grew 107 to over 3 000 boe day for q4 2018 compared to just over 1 400 boe day in q4 2017 with light oil and liquids weighting of 73 year end pdp tp and tpp reserves grew 54 59 and 50 to 4 124 mboe 9 035 mboe and 12 055 mboe respectively annual revenues increased by 23 to 76 4 million 94 derived from crude oil and natural gas liquids resulting in operating income profit margins 1 of 52 in 2018 operating income 1 increased by 25 to 39 8 million in 2018 and operating netbacks per boe 1 increased by 7 to 23 43 per boe in 2018 backed by increased oil and liquid weightings stronger prices and reduced operating costs this was accomplished even with the extreme market factors affecting crude commodity pricing in the fourth quarter which resulted in operating netbacks of 8 84 per boe versus 28 88 per boe achieved in the first three quarters of 2018 adjusted funds flow from operations 1 increased by 8 to 27 0 million year over year in 2018 this would have increased by 31 to 31 2 million without hedging gains and losses on derivative contracts over the years and results would have been much higher without the severe crude commodity price environment in the fourth quarter strategic crown land holdings in the east duvernay light oil shale play increased by 12 sections for consideration of 1 4 million in the year the company now has a significant land position in one of the most exciting new canadian light oil plays with 30 640 net acres 48 25 net sections an independent report was prepared for inplay on this land by qualified land evaluators seaton jordan associates which resulted in a value of 49 6 million at year end see the section entitled net asset value 1 non gaap term see non gaap financial measures section 2018 capital and operating overview inplay executed a 50 2 million capital program during 2018 focused on the willesden green bioturbated cardium formation the company drilled 12 8 6 net extended reach horizontal erh wells and 4 2 6 net one mile horizontal wells the final two cardium completions were deferred from october of 2018 into 2019 to avoid the poor fourth quarter 2018 canadian oil prices and add value by selling the flush production period into a time frame with improved pricing in aggregate inplay drilled an equivalent of 23 0 16 5 net horizontal miles the company completed one duvernay horizontal well during the second quarter of 2018 and drilled one vertical stratigraphic duvernay test well in the fourth quarter by drilling these wells our land tenure has been extended between four to five years the company also acquired an additional 12 sections of undeveloped crown land in the duvernay area inplay s focus on developing the willesden green bioturbated cardium assets continued to deliver exceptional results with production volumes and rates consistently exceeding internal estimates we believe inplay is delivering top tier capital efficiencies with its capital program where we have managed to achieve some of the shortest spud to rig release days for erh wells seen to date in the area our most recent six 1 5 mile erh wells have averaged 9 7 drilling days we have also achieved very consistent drilling performance whereby the maximum deviation from average drilling time of the six 1 5 mile erh wells has been 0 7 days our 1 5 mile erh wells allow us to access approximately 60 more reservoir while incurring only 20 more in additional capital expenditures compared to a one mile horizontal well these factors drove improved capital efficiencies on our 2018 capital program to approximately 14 770 per boe d 2018 reserve

program budgeted for 2019 all wells drilled in the first quarter have been completed with initial results in line with previous wells which have exceeded our forecasted type curves the company is on track with our focused capital budget of 36 million for the year drilling approximately 9 net erh wells with the majority being cardium wells in willesden green the remaining erh wells are expected to be drilled and brought on production in the second half of 2019 our 2019 guidance is maintained with annual average production estimated at 4 900 to 5 100 boe d approximately 70 oil liquids with growth between 6 and 10 percent for oil and liquids and on a total boe basis exit production of 5 400 to 5 600 boe d 70 oil liquids with growth between 10 and 14 percent this guidance is based on

reader advisories non gaap financial measures inplay uses certain terms within this news release that do not have a standardized prescribed meaning under gaap and these measurements may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measurements of other entities the terms adjusted funds flow from operations adjusted funds flow from operations per share adjusted funds flow from operations per boe operating income operating netback per boe and operating income profit margin in this news release are not defined measures under gaap and do not have standardized meanings or standardized methods of calculation and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies management believes that in addition to net earnings and cash flow provided by operating activities as defined by gaap these terms are useful supplemental measures to evaluate operating performance as it demonstrates its field level of profitability relative to current commodity prices and to assess leverage adjusted funds flow from operations should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than cash flow provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s performance inplay s determination of adjusted funds flow from operations may not be comparable to that reported by other companies adjusted funds flow from operations is calculated by adjusting for changes in operating non cash working capital and decommissioning expenditures from cash flow provided by operating activities these items are adjusted from cash flow provided by operating activities as these expenditures are primarily incurred on previous operating assets and there is uncertainty with the timing and payment of these items and they are incurred on a discretionary basis making them less useful in the evaluation inplay s operating performance adjusted funds flow from operations per share is calculated using the same weighted average number of shares outstanding used in calculating earnings per share for a detailed description of inplay s method of the calculation of adjusted funds flow from operations and its reconciliation to its nearest gaap term see non ifrs measures in the company s md a filed on sedar the term net debt is not recognized under gaap and is calculated as bank debt plus working capital deficiency adjusted for risk management derivative contract fair values deferred lease credits flow through share premiums and current portion of decommissioning obligation net debt is used by management to analyze the financial position and leverage of inplay inplay monitors working capital and net debt as part of its capital structure such terms do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities inplay also uses operating income and operating netback per boe as a key performance indicator operating income is calculated by the company as oil and natural gas sales less royalties operating expenses and transportation expenses and is a measure of the profitability of operations before administrative share based compensation financing and other non cash items management considers operating income an important measure to evaluate its operational performance as it demonstrates its field level profitability operating netback per boe is calculated by the company as operating income divided by average production for the respective period management considers operating netback per boe an important measure to evaluate its operational performance as it demonstrates its field level profitability per unit of production operating income profit margin is calculated as operating netback as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales this measure demonstrates the company s ability to generate field level profitability in relation to sales revenue information regarding disclosure

several theories explain why india s new central bank governor took his boldest step yet little attention has been paid to the consequences last week governor shaktikanta das made an unexpected tweak to the reserve bank of india s traditional management of longer term liquidity in the banking system by buying and selling government bonds india s currency sovereign debt and credit markets were all caught off guard by the announcement of a three year dollar rupee swap the rbi will buy 5 billion from banks for its reserves by giving them rupees and reverse the trade in 2022 this preemptive move would prevent the currency s appreciation according to one theory the central bank may want to scoop up incoming dollars from arcelormittal s long awaited 5 8 billion check for essar steel india ltd lest the rupee strengthens from an oversupply of greenbacks that payment should be coming in now that the ruia family former owners of the bankrupt asset is almost out of legal options to prevent the sale footnote i remain skeptical of a resolution before the next general elections are over and a new government is formed another hypothesis ties the swap to elevated funding costs for nonbank financiers the real economy which is already slowing could be in trouble if shadow lenders are forced to turn off the tap for builders amid a glut of unsold apartments in this line of thinking the rbi s move aims to ease financial conditions that s not far fetched with the biggest arranger of indian corporate debt warning of a crisis in credit markets however there s a third view which sees the swap spurring demand for lackluster government bonds long term yields continue to be stubbornly high banks could use the rupees they get by selling dollars to buy sovereign notes to the extent their purchases push yields lower they get to book mark to market gains or cut losses on their asset portfolios by march 31 the end of their financial year however it doesn t matter whether the rbi had currency credit or interest rates in mind what s more relevant is how the new liquidity management tool will shape expectations of what comes next now that that the central bank is buying dollars to create domestic liquidity will it continue to snap up as many indian government bonds the purchases in the current financial year have topped 42 billion traders expect these to be dialed down starting april 1 if the reduction is large enough to offset the 5 billion infusion bond investors get nothing in the net they may remain cautious about buying 10 year government bonds given the risk of fiscal slippage next year is high much of the massaging of the headline fiscal deficit for instance by pushing a chunk of the government s borrowing off budget will be reversed once the poll results are in the bond market hasn t failed to notice that a state run telecom company has delayed salaries hard to privatize national carrier air india ltd is on perpetual life support and that state run banks balance sheet repair job is proving longer and more expensive than the government expected when prime minister narendra modi took office in 2014 put another way the benchmark 10 year bond yield may remain sticky even if inflation doesn t accelerate to that extent the dollar swap may be ineffective in the government bond market though it could help ease the private sector s worsening credit crunch where the swap could do damage is the currency market a steeper yield curve might attract foreigners to tactically buy into high long term yields now that das is acquiring dollars in bulk via long term swaps the market may expect him to purchase less in the spot market a one off swap to stanch rupee appreciation could thus end up being foreign investors invitation to push the rupee uncomfortably higher on a daily basis but what is the alternative to the das put if the rbi keeps buying government bonds it surrenders its power to teach the government a lesson in fiscal arithmetic regardless of who wins on may 23 the next administration is expected to take a hard left turn more unfunded programs will be unveiled aficionados of modern monetary theory may say deficits don t matter but unlike the u s india s private and public sectors together can t borrow all they need in their own currency besides inflation which mmters accept as the only constraint on government borrowing isn t as well anchored as in developed nations volatile food and fuel prices still dominate consumers price expectations on the other hand if the rbi stops resisting day to day rupee appreciation and steps in only periodically with bulk dollar buying via swaps an overvalued rupee will usher in a short lived asset price boom followed by a bust after all fiscal and monetary policies can be coordinated locally and politicians longing to reclaim their power to freely print money can be ignored but how does das ask federal reserve chairman jerome powell to guarantee that the dollar won t resume its upward march a 5 billion swap is harmless enough any more and das would become as villainous in the eyes of the politically dominant indian nationalist thinking as his two immediate predecessors for turning india into a stooge of america the rbi s new boss is stuck between a rock and a hard place source bloomberg

president and ceo stuart brown commented financial year 2018 was mountain province s first full year of commercial production at the new gahcho kué mine and we are pleased with its operational performance the gahcho kué mine has settled down well and has outperformed our initial expectations in terms of throughput and overall diamond production which is an excellent achievement this trend has continued into 2019 with the mine continuing to perform substantially ahead of expectations financial year 2019 is expected to be another strong year of production we are confident that we will meet or exceed our production targets as we have done in the last two years along with our joint venture partner de beers canada we are working on various short and medium term initiatives which will have a positive impact on the future of the gahcho kué mine these relate to improvement of production rates and extending the life of mine by including additional jv ore discovered during 2018 and we look forward to updating the market as we complete these tasks later in 2019 in addition to the jv related improvements we are also focussing on the wholly owned kennady advanced stage diamondiferous kimberlites and near mine exploration opportunities and will update the market on our progress in due course the company also delivered very good results from its sales process selling all of its production made available during 2018 which translated into good operating margins further demonstrating the ability of the ore bodies at the gahcho kué mine to deliver strong free cash flow the rough diamond market experienced a relatively difficult finish to the year with price pressure in the smaller and lower quality diamond categories although we did see a stabilisation of prices towards the end of the year and so far we have seen a small improvement in the lower quality categories at the start of 2019 the company s longer term view of the fundamentals of the diamond business remain positive and combined with the quality of the gahcho kué mine with its long life and high margins we believe we are well positioned for the future to benefit even more with improved diamond prices 2019 is a year of innovation and assessing how to improve the returns to shareholders and i am positive that the work we are doing together with de beers will deliver on this throughout the year ahead

a veteran labor activist says the maduro government must boost national production and reduce prices or face erosion of its political base the conspiracies and the fight to the death haven t stopped in 20 years of chavista governments the following are excerpts from an interview with stalin pérez borges a union leader and veteran socialist militant in venezuela he is a member of the unitarian unionist chavista league luchas and of the bolivarian socialist workers central cbst advisory council the original appeared in spanish on feb 7 that is long before the feb 23 showdown on the border translated by pedro alvarez from aporrea entire interview tinyurl com y4tknu43 social and economic crisis in venezuela the economic and social crisis has grown exponentially for five years and has gotten to this rotten state of hyper inflation that we re barely coping with this is the cause for the huge discontent that we have at this stage and for the important change in the correlation of political power in this juncture this is a consequence of three fundamental facts two of them circumstantial and one structural the circumstantial causes are first the economic sabotage and blockade described by the government as economic warfare this factor is the main determinant in the current economic and social situation the trade exclusion and the blockade have caused a stagnation of 80 percent of what little was being produced in the country s industries it has also led to plummeting in the high levels of imports of food medicines raw materials and machinery it is also the cause of the hoarding and the fact that unscrupulous traders can set the price for all sorts of commodities including the u s dollar the second circumstantial cause is corruption ineptitude and impunity which have soared in the past five years the level of corruption and ineptitude government functionaries is major and damaging in many cases it coincides with the sabotage by the elites and imperialists with the complicity of military and civilian functionaries regarding the speculative value of the market price of commodities that the people need the trade exclusion and the blockade have caused a stagnation of 80 percent of what little was being produced in the country s industries the structural problem is that the national productive capacity is very low this is also determined by the historic high level of oil income which turned the local bourgeoisie into a very parasitic social class always dependent on the price of oil they prefer to import rather than produce or export under chávez despite some appropriate programs and plans to improve the development of national industry this largely remained on paper the levels of national production needed were never made a reality under chávez from 2007 to 2012 that low production capacity didn t produce discontent as the high price of oil was enough to import even luxury goods but from 2013 to date with maduro a high price has been paid for this mistake with the decreasing price of oil there is no money for imports nor for the national industry including transnational companies to receive the dollars that they used to be guaranteed due to the currency controls the struggle of these sectors to seize a share of that income is the main reason whythe conspiracies and the fight to the death haven t stopped in 20 years of chavista governments and it is here making use of this situation that yankee and european interests also play a role scope and class character of the jan 23 opposition the opposition s demonstrations on jan 23 were impressively big those in caracas and valencia surprised both them and others that has encouraged the opposition the right wing segments had largely surrendered after the elections for the congress anc since the election until jan 23 they were absent at street demonstrations they were focused on media campaigns against the government taking advantage of the growing discontent because the government hasn t been able to provide measures to successfully counter the economic warfare and they focused on the complicity of corrupt bureaucrats who have allowed speculation in the commercial sector as solutions president maduro has implemented distribution of food packages carried out by the local committees of distribution and production clap and also compensation bonuses and continuous increases to the minimum wage and food ticket for workers these are progressive measures but they have not been enough to cover the loss of purchasing power of workers salaries so the right wing demonstrations of jan 23 included the usual social base of middle class people plus some segments of workers including some unions that earlier this year identified with chavismo chavistas organized spectacular demonstrations after jan 23 the opposition made big efforts to turn out the same number of people or more as on that day in caracas and valencia they demonstrated again on feb 2 but it wasn t the same in numbers or expectations as on jan 23 meanwhile the chavista demonstration on jan 23 in caracas was very well attended the feeling among the government sympathizing popular class is very strong on january 28 29 30 31 and feb 1 and 2 chavistas organized surprisingly spectacular demonstrations in more than six cities the feb 2 demonstration in caracas was attended by large numbers of people similar to those during the best days of chavismo so currently we have a chavismo that is more motivated to take the offensive against the coup or invasion plans there are no visible signs of grassroots self organizing the united socialist party of venezuela psuv and government structures are leading these demonstrations the strong presence of youth is striking internal rupture within the army since before jan 10 the opposition and high ranking members of the trump administration u s senators and some governments like those of ivan duque in colombia jair bolsonaro in brazil mauricio macri in argentina and luis almagro from the organization of american states oas have been waiting for the push for maduro s fall to come from segments of the bolivarian national army forces fanb however until now that has failed they have offered fanb members large sums of money and promises of amnesty and appointment to high positions ever since guaidó proclaimed himself interim president this usurper s main proposition is aimed at members of the army promoting a supposed amnesty law in favor of soldiers who rebel against maduro s government no signs have been seen inside or outside the fanb that a force may appear which is capable of risking a suicidal venture on the side of imperialism and its lackeys in the opposition imperialism s strategy imperialism s aim has always been to oust the chavista government at any cost since the moment maduro came to power in 2013 they started the plan to oust him currently they are acting with more urgency they need to put an end to maduro and the bolivarian revolution the cycle of instability and the progressive and more or less sovereign governments that arose in our continent after chávez kicked off the revolutionary process and started governing with lenin moreno s treason in ecuador and having regained complete control in brazil and argentina and with a favorable balance of forces in the region imperialism does the rest they want to oust maduro and defeat the bolivarian process with the least possible political cost but if they don t achieve this in the short term they will try to do it at any cost trump represents a segment of imperialism that desperately wants the u s to seize global economic political and military hegemony they want to recover economic financial and industrial supremacy which they have been losing to china their power is mainly military anti imperialist sentiment deep the anti imperialist sentiment of our people is historic and it runs very deep it will be difficult to defeat us it will be hard to convince a majority of the workers and poor people to accept the raising of the u s flag as guaidó and the right wing political leaders who are with him have done in their public demonstrations since the oil strike of 1936 which almost became a national strike against the british and yankees and the military dictatorship a very deep anti imperialist sentiment has grown it was rebuilt or revived for more than 15 years with chávez s message a rebellious sentiment appeared here that hasn t stopped since feb 27 and 28 1989 this found expression in the decisive fearless struggle of april 13 2002 when an attempted military coup against chávez was defeated and it was demonstrated in the response to the bosses strike and oil sabotage from december 2002 to january 2003 and in all the resistance we have carried out not letting the right wing oust maduro by force the government continues to pay on the foreign debt in the middle of this imperialist economic blockade it hasn t touched any monopolies such as the polar group and others when these same monopolies hoard food stocks or distribute them arbitrarily and overpriced living in valencia the country s main industrial city and being a unionist i can say that its industrial zones are almost paralyzed that there are stagnant or nearly stagnant industrial sectors that working conditions safety and salaries in important sectors such as energy oil health and education have suffered to worrisome levels capacity of venezuelan gov t popular militias to resist in a public statement by luchas we urgently requested the dispatch of army officials and soldiers to at least 11 000 zones so that they can live with the communities and organize the military aspect of anti imperialist resistance we need to make the civilian military alliance a reality in the community in that statement we said in this context we encourage the people and workers to voluntarily join the 50 000 popular defense units in all neighborhoods cities and corners of the country for them to back up and strengthen an integral defense of the motherland which president maduro has asked to implement popular militias or those popular defense units are a work in process the venezuelan national militia has existed for years there are already 2 million militia members many of whom are being called on to integrate other army forces as active permanent soldiers it s said that the weapons capacity of the army is very modern and the army has good logistics and respectable professionalism we also call for the formation of simón bolívar international brigades of solidarity with venezuela and we call for 1 the world federation of trade unions wftu national unions federations and other social movements and organizations around the world to trade in medicines food and raw materials with the legitimate government of president maduro and or with union and social organizations of venezuela and 2 the social organizations of latin america to organize solidarity caravans and come here through our borders with colombia and brazil nationalization expropriation if doesn t act soon resolving the consequences of its stagnation in these economic and social aspects it will do more damage than any missile or incoming imperialist humanitarian aid if it doesn t control problems effectively and for the long term such as currency exchange speculation supply shortages and the price of food and medicines or encourage the national production of goods and services in mid term it will lose its social base and find it difficult to survive among other measures it has to stop paying the foreign debt block capital flight impose progressive taxation on assets and promote the distribution and control of goods by a communal state run by the workers otherwise we will fail let me finish this interview with our motto fight fight don t stop fighting for a government of the workers and of the people this article previously appeared at

ottawa the federal government is making targeted spending commitments aimed towards millennials workers and seniors in their 2019 pre election budget and are continuing to spend while posting deficits with still no path to balance the 2019 budget titled investing in the middle class is the last of this government s mandate it includes a new skilled training program a plan to lower the interest rates on student loans new initiatives related to seniors savings and new measures for first time home buyers the federal liberals are projecting a 19 8 deficit in 2019 20 higher than the 19 6 billion projected during november s fiscal update this figure includes the 3 billion contingency fund for 2019 20 otherwise considered an adjustment for risk or rainy day fund during the last federal election the liberals pledged not to run deficits over 10 billion and said they would return to a balance by 2019 a promise now not on the fiscal horizon for at least the next four years the most the government is projecting the deficit to drop is 10 billion by 2023 24 in that year the deficit is projected at 9 8 billion with tax revenues increasing instead of chipping away at the deficit the government has announced 4 billion in new spending in 2019 20 with total new spending over the next six years amounting to 22 8 billion in his remarks to reporters inside the budget lockup finance minister bill morneau touted the 900 000 new jobs created over this government s mandate and record low unemployment rate he bolstered the liberal s approach of deficit spending saying the canadian economy is on good fiscal track but noted there is more to do we know that canadians still feel anxious about their future worried that the next generation will be able to do as well as the current generation and that s the frame for our budget this year we ve taken a look at some of those things that are causing people to worry morneau said canada s federal debt as a percentage of gdp is projected to incrementally decline over the next five years from 30 7 per cent in 2019 20 to 28 6 per cent in 2023 24 overall economists ctvnews ca spoke with described the 2019 budget as one that was future focused with a little something for a lot of people but no blockbuster initiatives i don t think any of these measures are big enough to have much of an economic impact matthew stewart who is director of economics at the conference board of canada told ctvnews ca the biggest things missing were items around improving business investment and addressing canada s lacking competitiveness stewart said adding that while the deficit is projected to decline it s a risk to continue to spend rather than save should the economy take a downturn former parliamentary budget office kevin page said that while it is very clear it is a pre election budget there are no signature initiatives however he said there are enough little things in it to allow liberal mps to head out with a refreshed slate of announcements for their ridings or regions over the coming months the condition attached to much of the promised new spending is that it is contingent on the liberals getting re elected this sets the stage for voters to have to weigh the value of what s being promised in contrast to the other parties approaches that are starting to take shape when they head to the polls in less than eight months time key initiatives in budget 2019 among the biggest ticket items contained within budget 2019 are changes aimed at improving the economic security of low income seniors and lowering the interest on canada student loans and canada apprentice loans the government wants to make the prospect of going back to school or gaining new skills more appealing for people between the ages of 25 and 64 the liberals are proposing to do so through a new canada training benefit that will to chip in a small amount towards the cost of training fees it s a credit of 250 a year that can accumulate to help pay for future training up to 5 000 over a person s career the federal government is also setting up a new employment insurance training support benefit that will allow people who want to get more training to take four weeks every four years to do so without coming up short on living expenses to qualify workers need to be making between 10 000 and 150 000 and it would result in paid leave at 55 per cent of weekly earnings though this promise isn t set to kick in until the end of 2020 as hinted in advance of today s budget the government also wants to make it easier for young people to buy their first home how they will aim to do this is through a targeted new support for first time home buyers this first time home buyer incentive will allow buyers who have the minimum down payment for a mortgage to finance 10 per cent on a new home or five per cent on an existing home through a shared equity mortgage with the canadian mortgage and housing corporation doing so will lower buyers monthly mortgage payments by up to 228 per month and applies to households with combined incomes lower than 120 000 a year the 2019 budget takes the initial steps towards implementing a national pharmacare program in the coming years with 35 million over four years to establish a canadian drug agency and 500 million beginning in 2022 23 to improve access to drugs for rare diseases it also lays out more than 100 targeted and small ticket items aimed at regions and other niche voting blocks including supply managed farmers and rural canadians the supply management pledge is sizeable promising 3 9 billion for canada s supply managed dairy eggs and poultry farmers who have been impacted by recently negotiated trade deals like the new nafta and the cptpp the government is making an income protection program eligible and is promising a measure to protect the value of quota investments this includes a quota value guarantee program and for rural voters the government is promising that by 2030 100 per cent of canadian homes and businesses will have access to high speed internet something many in rural canada are still without this promise comes with up to 6 billion over the next decade in spending to see this promise come to fruition continuing with an approach initiated in the 2017 federal budget the 460 page document includes a gender based analysis of the impacts of all initiatives contained within the budget the government estimates that 80 per cent of measures impact men and women equally our government has been clear since day one we are going to invest in the middle class and in the things that matter most to canadians good jobs strong communities a clean environment and better opportunities for future generations we are going to make these investments to grow our economy for the long term while we bring the books back toward balance morneau said in his budget speech morneau usurps procedural wrangling tuesday s budget tabling came amid considerable procedural wrangling in the house of commons related to the ongoing snc lavalin scandal the opposition vowed earlier in the day to delay the budget on account for liberal mps shutting down the house justice committee probe into the snc lavalin affair without allowing jody wilson raybould to testify again this had all on the hill preparing for a vote on a private member s bill to be called on the request of the conservatives minutes before 4 p m when the budget was set to be tabled but minutes before the vote was called morneau appeared in the house and tabled the 2019 budget instead of then launching into his budget day speech he stepped out to the foyer where media were set up for budget day specials and began doing interviews with various outlets while the bells were ringing for the vote during the vote several opposition mps voted both for and against and then were allowed to stand in the house to address their voting error it was then that one by one these mps used their time to say let her speak referring to wilson raybould after a volley of other procedural measures morneau was able to launch into his formal budget speech he was shortly drowned out by the opposition who were banging on their desks and making other oral noises that prevented morneau from being audible during his delivery this continued for several minutes interrupted by various interjections from the speaker and the sound of an amber alert ringing on mps phones then 20 minutes into the speech conservative leader andrew scheer rose on a point of order and decried the liberals tactics as an assault on democracy conservative mps rose from their seats and walked out of the house and morneau continued it took him 50 minutes to complete his speech concluding just before 6 p m it s disappointing that the conservatives actually don t care and don t know what s in the actual budget said prime minister justin trudeau on his way out of the house tuesday evening he said his final budget before the campaign is one that includes the kinds of things that canadians know they will be better off for in the coming years opposition leaders react on his way out of the commons flanked by many members of his caucus scheer said that while the liberals tried to present a budget as if it was business as usual it isn t and that s why the conservatives acted the way they did today s budget is part of the continuing coverup this budget is not a serious fiscal plan for the country this budget has no legitimacy and we could not legitimize it by remaining in the chamber scheer said he vowed to continue to use any tools they can to highlight the snc lavalin affair we are prepared for anything scheer said asked if the conservatives have a plan to return to balanced books scheer said the conservatives would restore fiscal responsibility and pivoted to criticize the government for their continued deficit spending ndp leader jagmeet singh said the budget gives crumbs to canadians after the liberals have given the entire pie to wealthy canadians over their mandate he said the budget did not address the urgent problems canadians are facing this budget does not make life better for canadians who continue to struggle singh said speaking about the delay tactics and raucous behaviour in the house he said the protests are not relevant to the issues of the budget but are reflective of the dissatisfaction among canadians who he says are still concerned about the allegations at the heart of the snc lavalin scandal political pressure and attempted interference in a criminal trial green party leader elizabeth may also picked up on the small dollar amounts attached to many of the announcements and noted that some of the marquee announcements like lowering student loan interest rates will require legislative changes to implement given the timing of the legislative calendar there s no chance that most of these things can be done before the next election though it is likely that all of these changes that require legislative change will be wrapped up into an omnibus budget implementation bill and passed that way speaking to the acrimony in the house may said that the snc lavalin still hangs over this parliament and she anticipated the partisanship to only increase from here on out addressing the liberals broken promise of a balanced budget people s party leader maxime bernier said it was irresponsible because it ll be future generations that will have to pay for it they want to buy votes and that s not the way to do politics with people s money bernier said he also was not impressed with the new measures for the supply management sector other budget measures of note

the secret to funding a green new deal as alarm bells sound over the advancing destruction of the environment a variety of green new deal proposals have appeared in the u s and europe along with some interesting academic debates about how to fund them monetary policy normally relegated to obscure academic tomes and bureaucratic meetings behind closed doors has suddenly taken center stage the 14 page proposal for a green new deal submitted to the u s house of representatives by rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y does not actually mention modern monetary theory mmt but that is the approach currently capturing the attention of the media and taking most of the heat the concept is good abundance can be ours without worrying about taxes or debt at least until we hit full productive capacity but as with most theories the devil is in the details mmt advocates say the government does not need to collect taxes before it spends it actually creates new money in the process of spending it and there is plenty of room in the economy for public spending before demand outstrips supply driving up prices critics however insist this is not true the government is not allowed to spend before it has the money in its account and the money must come from tax revenues or bond sales in a 2013 treatise called modern monetary theory 101 a reply to critics mmt academics concede this point but they write these constraints do not change the end result and here the argument gets a bit technical their reasoning is that the fed is the monopoly supplier of cb currency treasury spends by using cb currency and since the treasury obtained cb currency by taxing and issuing treasuries cb currency must be injected before taxes and bond offerings can occur the counterargument made by american monetary institute ami researchers among others is that the central bank is not the monopoly supplier of dollars the vast majority of the dollars circulating in the united states are created not by the government but by private banks when they make loans the fed accommodates this process by supplying central bank currency bank reserves as needed and this bank created money can be taxed or borrowed by the treasury before a single dollar is spent by congress the ami researchers contend all bank reserves are originally created by the fed for banks government expenditure merely transfers previous bank reserves back to banks as the federal reserve bank of st louis puts it federal deficits do not require that the federal reserve purchase more government securities therefore federal deficits per se need not lead to increases in bank reserves or the money supply what federal deficits do increase is the federal debt and while the debt itself can be rolled over from year to year as it virtually always is the exponentially growing interest tab is one of those mandatory budget items that taxpayers must pay predictions are that in the next decade interest alone could add 1 trillion to the annual bill an unsustainable tax burden to fund a project as massive as the green new deal we need a mechanism that involves neither raising taxes nor adding to the federal debt and such a mechanism is proposed in the u s green new deal itself a network of public banks while little discussed in the u s media that alternative is being debated in europe where green new deal proposals have been on the table since 2008 european economists have had more time to think these initiatives through and they are less hampered by labels like socialist and capitalist which have long been integrated into their multi party systems a decade of gestation in europe the first green new deal proposal was published in 2008 by the new economics foundation on behalf of the green new deal group in the u k the latest debate is between proponents of the democracy in europe movement 2025 diem25 led by former greek finance minister yanis varoufakis and french economist thomas piketty author of the best selling capital in the 21st century piketty recommends funding a european green new deal by raising taxes while varoufakis favors a system of public green banks varoufakis explains that europe needs a new source of investment money that does not involve higher taxes or government deficits for this purpose diem25 proposes an investment led recovery or new deal program to be financed via public bonds issued by europe s public investment banks e g the new investment vehicle foreshadowed in countries like britain the european investment bank and the european investment fund in the european union etc to ensure that these bonds do not lose their value the central banks would stand ready to buy them above a certain yield in summary diem25 is proposing a re calibrated real green investment version of quantitative easing that utilizes the central bank public development banks already have a successful track record in europe and their debts are not considered government debts they are financed not through taxes but by the borrowers when they repay the loans like other banks development banks are money making institutions that not only don t cost the government money but actually generate a profit for it diem25 collaborator stuart holland observes while piketty is concerned to highlight differences between his proposals and those for a green new deal the real difference between them is that his however well intentioned are a wish list for a new treaty a new institution and taxation of wealth and income a green new deal needs neither treaty revisions nor new institutions and would generate both income and direct and indirect taxation from a recovery of employment it is grounded in the precedent of the success of the bond funded roosevelt new deal which from 1933 to 1941 reduced unemployment from over a fifth to less than a tenth with an average annual fiscal deficit of only 3 percent roosevelt s new deal was largely funded through the reconstruction finance corporation rfc a public financial institution set up earlier by president hoover its funding source was the sale of bonds but proceeds from the loans repaid the bonds leaving the rfc with a net profit the rfc financed roads bridges dams post offices universities electrical power mortgages farms and much more and it funded all this while generating income for the government a system of public banks and green qe the u s green new deal envisions funding with a combination of the federal reserve a new public bank or system of regional and specialized public banks which could include banks owned locally by cities and states as sylvia chi chair of the legislative committee of the california public banking alliance explains the green new deal relies on a network of public banks like a decentralized version of the rfc as part of the plan to help finance the contemplated public investments this approach has worked in germany where public banks have been integral in financing renewable energy installations and energy efficiency retrofits local or regional public banks chi says could help pay for the green new deal by making low interest loans for building and upgrading infrastructure deploying clean energy resources transforming our food and transportation systems to be more sustainable and accessible and other projects the federal government can help by for example capitalizing public banks setting environmental or social responsibility standards for loan programs or tying tax incentives to participating in public bank loans u k professor richard murphy adds another role for the central bank as the issuer of new money in the form of green infrastructure quantitative easing murphy who was a member of the original 2008 u k green new deal group explains all qe works by the buying debt issued by the government or other bodies using money that it quite literally creates out of thin air his money creation process is what happens every time a bank makes a loan all that is unusual is that we are suggesting that the funds created by the using this process be used to buy back debt that is due by the government in one of its many forms meaning that it is effectively canceled the invariable objection to that solution is that it would act as an inflationary force driving up prices but as argued in an earlier article of mine this need not be the case there is a chronic gap between debt and the money available to repay it that needs to be filled with new money every year to avoid a balance sheet recession as u k professor mary mellor formulates the problem in her book debt or democracy 2016 a major contradiction of tying money supply to debt is that the creators of the money always want more money back than they have issued debt based money must be continually repaid with interest as money is continually being repaid new debt must be being generated if the money supply is to be maintained this builds a growth dynamic into the money supply that would frustrate the aims of those who seek to achieve a more socially and ecologically sustainable economy in addition to interest says mellor there is the problem that bankers and other rich people generally do not return their profits to local economies unlike public banks which must use their profits for local needs the wealthy mostly hoard their money invest it in the speculative markets hide it in offshore tax havens or send it abroad to avoid the cyclical booms and busts that have routinely devastated the u s economy this missing money needs to be replaced and if the new money is used to pay down debt it will be extinguished along with the debt leaving the overall money supply and the inflation rate unchanged if too much money is added to the economy it can always be taxed back but as mmters note we are a long way from the full productive capacity that would overheat the economy today murphy writes of his green qe proposal the qe program that was put in place between 2009 and 2012 had just one central purpose which was to refinance the city of london and its banks what we are suggesting is a smaller programme to kickstart the uk economy by investing in all those things that we would wish our children to inherit whilst creating the opportunities for everyone in every city town village and hamlet in the uk to undertake meaningful and appropriately paid work a network of public banks including a central bank operated as a public utility could similarly fund a u s green new deal without raising taxes driving up the federal debt or inflating prices ellen brown developed

use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions creating collateral security packages types of collateral what types of collateral and security interests are available dutch law has a closed system of security interests and recognises three basic forms of security interests mortgages pledges and the financial security agreement mortgages and pledges are the most relevant forms of security interests in the context of project finance and accordingly the financial security agreement is not discussed below mortgages a mortgage is a form of security that can be granted over immovable property ie land buildings and ground leases registered ships and aircraft pursuant to a mortgage the mortgagor ie the owner of the assets creates a security interest in favour of a mortgagee to secure its payment obligations or the payment obligations of a third party against such a mortgagee the mortgagee can sell the secured assets if the mortgagor or such a third party defaults in the performance of the secured obligations under the mortgage and use the proceeds to satisfy these secured obligations pledges a right of pledge is the most common form of security in the netherlands a right of pledge can be created over inter alia moveable assets other than registered ships and aircraft shares receivables including bank accounts and insurance receivables and intellectual property rights ip rights the creation requirements for a right of pledge are different from those for a right of mortgage but their characteristics in terms of what they secure and when they can be enforced are broadly the same collateral perfecting how is a security interest in each type of collateral perfected and how is its priority established are any fees taxes or other charges payable to perfect a security interest and if so are there lawful techniques to minimise them may a corporate entity in the capacity of agent or trustee hold collateral on behalf of the project lenders as the secured party is it necessary for the security agent and trustee to hold any licences to hold or enforce such security mortgage a mortgage is created pursuant to a notarial deed executed before a civil law notary which must subsequently be registered in the public registers of the dutch land registry the maximum amount of obligations secured by the mortgage must be stated in the deed for that reason a mark up usually 40 per cent over the principal amount is included in the secured obligations to cover interest and costs pledge the required formalities for the creation of a right of pledge differ according to the type of asset that is pledged moveable assets a right of pledge over moveable assets can either be a possessory or non possessory right of pledge a possessory right of pledge requires the pledgee to take possession of the pledged asset this type of pledge is not common in project finance transactions a non possessory right of pledge is created by way of a notarial deed of pledge executed by a dutch civil law notary or by way of a privately executed agreement between the pledgor and the pledgee that is subsequently registered with the dutch tax authority such registration is non public and is for date stamping purposes only shares for the purpose of the creation of a right of pledge over the shares in the capital of a dutch company either a public company or a private company with limited liability a distinction should be made between registered shares and bearer shares assuming that the pledging of shares is not prohibited under the articles of association of a company whose shares are being pledged a right of pledge over a dutch company s registered shares is created by the execution of a notarial deed of pledge before a dutch civil law notary and the acknowledgment thereof by the company the deed of pledge can provide that the voting rights are to be transferred to the pledgee upon the occurrence of an event of default and notice thereof under the agreement that contains the secured liabilities or under the deed of pledge the right of pledge must be registered in the shareholders register of the company a right of pledge over bearer shares is created in the same manner as a right of pledge over movable assets this principle applies to bearer shares held or deposited in the netherlands regardless of whether the shares relate to dutch companies or foreign companies whether the right of pledge needs to be registered in the shareholders register or the register of members of the company depends on whether this is required under the laws of incorporation of the relevant company a right of pledge over shares that are transferable by means of book entries in accordance with the securities giro system act is created by means of a book entry in the name of the pledgee by the custodian bank responsible for the books receivables a pledge of receivables can either be created as a disclosed pledge of receivables or an undisclosed pledge of receivables a disclosed pledge of receivables is created by way of a privately executed agreement entered into by the pledgor and the pledgee with notice thereof being provided to the debtors of the pledged receivables an undisclosed pledge of receivables can either be created by a notarial deed of pledge executed before a civil law notary or by a privately executed agreement entered into by the pledgor and the pledgee which is subsequently registered with the dutch tax authority for date stamping purposes only in terms of a pledge of future receivables an undisclosed pledge of future receivables can only be created over future receivables that directly derive from a legal relationship existing at the time of the execution of the pledge as a result the agreement pursuant to which an undisclosed pledge of receivables is created usually contains an obligation on the pledgor to pledge future receivables which are not derived from existing legal relationships on a regular basis throughout the term of the financing arrangements by way of executing and registering a supplemental pledge which is typically annexed to the relevant deed of pledge assignability limitations in contracts may result in receivables arising under that contract not being capable of being pledged pledge on bank accounts a pledge over monies held in bank accounts is created as a pledge over receivables due by the relevant bank as debtor to the pledgor in its capacity as holder of the bank account this pledge is generally created by way of a disclosed pledge of receivables as notice of the pledge is given to the bank where the account is maintained usually the pledgee will authorise the pledgor in the deed of pledge to continue to give payment instructions and dispose of the monies in the bank account until the occurrence of an event of default in relation to the secured liabilities at which time the monies standing to the credit of the bank account will be frozen account banks in the netherlands typically have a first ranking right of pledge over the accounts held with them pursuant to their general banking terms and conditions these rights of pledge may be waived by the relevant account bank or may be limited to bank fees and costs intellectual property rights although not usual in dutch project finance practice a right of pledge over ip rights is created by either the execution of a notarial deed before a dutch civil law notary or a privately executed agreement entered into by the pledgor and the pledgee which is subsequently registered with the dutch tax authority for date stamping purposes only pledges over ip rights are generally registered in the registers of the benelux office for intellectual property and the dutch patent centre the registration agencies registration of the pledges in the registers of the relevant registration agency is not required to create the right of pledge notwithstanding this the creation of a valid pledge over an ip right cannot be invoked against third parties who have relied in good faith on the information registered with the relevant registration agency therefore registration of the pledge in the registers of the relevant registration agency is common practice security agent when there is more than one lender in a finance transaction the concept of parallel debt is used in dutch law security documents to allow a security agent to hold as a secured party the security on behalf of all lenders assuring absence of liens how can a creditor assure itself as to the absence of liens with priority to the creditor s lien a search in the dutch land registry which is publicly accessible shows all validly created mortgages there is no public register to verify the existence of a right of pledge on moveable assets or receivables however pledges created on ip rights are often registered in one of the registration agencies see question 2 which are publicly accessible in addition a company is required to record the creation of a right of pledge on registered shares in its shareholders register a prospective creditor may request to examine this shareholders register prior to entering into a financing agreement enforcing collateral rights outside the context of a bankruptcy proceeding what steps should a project lender take to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral a pledge or a mortgage can be enforced if the payment obligations that are secured by the right of pledge or mortgage are not fulfilled a default under other obligations does not as such entitle the secured creditor to enforce the pledge or mortgage unless and until it results in the acceleration of the debt and the borrower is in default of its payment obligations in principle the creditor must first issue a notice of default before enforcing the security this requirement can be excluded by a provision in the relevant security document enforcement of pledges and mortgages other than a pledge of receivables generally security rights are enforced by means of a public sale of the secured assets in the manner as prescribed by the dutch code of civil procedure and the dutch civil code in respect of certain assets the creditor and the debtor may agree on a different method of sale or they may ask the court to allow a different method of sale public sale in principle a mortgagee or pledgee should enforce its security interest by way of a public sale to proceed with such a public sale the mortgagee or pledgee does not need to obtain a court order or court permission a public sale of immovable property registered ships or aircraft must take place before a civil law notary there are no statutory requirements that apply to a public sale of the asset secured by a right of pledge other than that the sale should be conducted in accordance with local customs pledged assets that are traded on a market or on an exchange may be sold on the public market through a broker or on an exchange through a qualified intermediary in accordance with the rules and customs that generally apply to an ordinary sale on that market or exchange private sale unless stipulated otherwise an enforcement may also occur through a private sale agreed between the mortgagor or pledgor and the mortgagee or pledgee this requires cooperation between the mortgagor or pledgor and the mortgagee or pledgee an agreement on a private sale between the mortgagor or pledgor and the mortgagee or pledgee requires the consent of all lower ranking secured parties if any and can only be entered into after the pledgee or mortgagee has the right to enforce its security right a voluntary private sale is the fastest method of enforcement court ordered private sale should a mortgagor or pledgor and a mortgagee or pledgee be unable to reach an agreement on a private sale a court authorised private sale is generally considered preferable to proceeding by way of public sale unless otherwise agreed between the parties a pledgee may request the interim provisions judge voorzieningenrechter of the competent dutch court to authorise a private sale of the secured assets for an amount and on the terms and conditions to be determined by that court a court will generally prefer the highest bid regardless of its payment terms legal proceedings for a court authorised sale are initiated by submitting a petition to the court containing a draft purchase agreement with a prospective purchaser a list of other bids received if any a list of interested parties and an independent valuation of the collateral pledge on receivables including a pledge on bank accounts the enforcement of a pledge of receivables may also occur through a public auction voluntary private sale or a court ordered private sale in each case in the manner specified above in the case of a public auction of receivables the pledgee has the right to bid during the auction and take recourse against the proceeds a bid by the pledgee and a bid made by a third party are treated equally in this respect however a pledge of receivables is usually enforced through a notice to the debtors of the receivables and to the pledgor itself upon receipt of such a notice the debtors may only pay any amount due under the pledged receivables to the pledgee and the pledgee may take recourse against the monies received by it in accordance with the rules regarding the application of proceeds as set out in the dutch civil code a pledge on a bank account which is a pledge of receivables is typically enforced by notification to the account bank of a default in payment of the secured liabilities which will revoke the authorisation usually granted to the pledgor to continue using the bank account and the monies therein and allows the pledgee to receive the amounts standing to the credit of the bank account enforcing collateral rights following bankruptcy how does a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the project company affect the ability of a project lender to enforce its rights as a secured party over the collateral are there any preference periods clawback rights or other preferential creditors rights eg tax debts employees claims with respect to the collateral what entities are excluded from bankruptcy proceedings and what legislation applies to them what processes other than court proceedings are available to seize the assets of the project company in an enforcement the dutch bankruptcy act dba distinguishes between two different proceedings for companies temporary suspension of payment and bankruptcy both are insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the european insolvency regulation the objective of the temporary suspension of payment proceeding is to allow the debtor to reorganise its business or restructure its debts to avoid bankruptcy a bankruptcy proceeding is aimed at liquidating the assets of the bankrupt company for the purpose of distributing the proceeds among its creditors it is considered to be a general attachment on all assets of the bankrupt company which freezes all assets and liabilities at the date of the bankruptcy a suspension of payment may be converted into a bankruptcy when it is evident that the suspension will not be successful a holder of a right of pledge or mortgage is entitled to enforce its right over the secured collateral notwithstanding a suspension of payment or a bankruptcy proceeding a moratorium may be invoked whereby a secured creditor will temporarily be prevented from enforcing its security right with the exception of a holder of a right of undisclosed pledge on receivables who remains entitled to give notice of its right of pledge to and receive payments from the debtors of the receivables the pledgee or mortgagee is not required to seek court intervention in order to confirm the indebtedness before foreclosing over the secured assets the bankruptcy receiver curator may for the benefit of the estate void voluntary juridical acts of the insolvent entity if the insolvent entity was or ought to have been aware that its actions would prejudice its creditors the counterparty of the insolvent entity must also have such knowledge unless the juridical act was without consideration if the juridical act took place within one year prior to bankruptcy there will in a number of specified situations be a rebuttable presumption that the insolvent entity and its counterparty were aware of its prejudicial nature the bankruptcy receiver may also void non voluntary juridical acts if certain specific requirements have been met in general all claims rank equally but rights secured by a mortgage or pledge take priority in the proceeds of the secured assets in addition certain claims may take priority over the claims of secured creditors including tax claims including vat and wage tax which take priority in the proceeds of certain moveable property on the insolvent entity s premises to the extent that those claims cannot be paid out of the proceeds of unsecured assets costs of enforcing judgments or deeds of indebtedness and costs of the insolvent entity s bankruptcy only if the secured creditor fails to sell the secured assets separately from the bankruptcy proceedings ordinary creditors will only receive payment out of the bankrupt estate once all preferred creditors have been paid if the secured assets would not be sold separate from the bankruptcy proceedings the costs of the bankruptcy will be charged proportionally against all proceeds including the security proceeds the bankruptcy costs include the fees and disbursements charged by the bankruptcy receiver and the wages and social security premiums lease instalments or if the insolvent entity s business has not been suspended the operational loss of the business in the bankruptcy period the dba will in principle apply to all legal entities under private law however pursuant to the dutch financial supervision act special insolvency proceedings apply to credit institutions such as banks and insurance companies the dba also contains separate sections on the settlement of insolvencies of such credit institutions as a bankruptcy proceeding is considered to be an attachment on all assets of the insolvent entity it is in principle not possible to seize the insolvent entity s assets once it has been declared bankrupt outside of insolvency proceedings creditors can quite easily obtain leave from a dutch court to levy a pre judgment attachment on the insolvent entity s assets foreign creditors will in principle have the same rights as local creditors in a dutch bankruptcy proceeding foreign exchange and withholding tax issues restrictions controls fees and taxes what are the restrictions controls fees taxes or other charges on foreign currency exchange subject to any applicable sanction regulations there are no controls or taxes on foreign currency exchange itself a dutch resident entity is normally subject to dutch corporate income tax in respect of any currency exchange gains whereas any currency exchange losses are tax deductible banks impose fees in respect of currency exchanges investment returns what are the restrictions controls fees and taxes on remittances of investment returns or payments of principal interest or premiums on loans or bonds to parties in other jurisdictions subject to any applicable sanction regulations there are no controls on remittances of investment returns or loan payments to parties in other jurisdictions investment returns may be made in the form of a dividend distribution or interest payments under a loan dividend distributions made by a dutch resident entity are normally subject to dutch withholding tax at a rate of 15 per cent however an exemption from or a refund or reduction in whole or in part of dutch dividend withholding tax may apply pursuant to the eu parent subsidiary directive or the dutch double tax treaty network if no exemption from or refund or reduction of dutch dividend withholding tax is available under the eu parent subsidiary directive or the dutch double tax treaty network there are other planning techniques available to reduce dutch dividend withholding tax including without limitation the use of a dutch cooperative interest payments under a loan are normally not subject to dutch withholding tax in general interest payments made by a dutch entity under a loan are tax deductible if interest payments are made under an inter company loan the terms and conditions agreed upon in the inter company loan should reflect the same terms and conditions as commercial dealings ie be at arm s length deduction of interest payments may be limited on the basis of interest deduction limitation rules for example where an inter company loan is provided to a dutch company to fund a profit distribution to fund an equity contribution or to acquire an interest in a company and debt funding has been provided to a dutch entity insofar that this debt funding is deemed to be connected with the funding of certain qualifying shareholdings however counter evidence rules and thresholds may permit tax deduction of interest payments after all foreign earnings must project companies repatriate foreign earnings if so must they be converted to local currency and what further restrictions exist over their use there is no requirement on dutch companies to repatriate foreign earnings and there is no requirement to convert foreign earnings to domestic currency if dutch companies do repatriate foreign earnings may project companies establish and maintain foreign currency accounts in other jurisdictions and locally subject to any applicable sanction regulations and local law restrictions in other jurisdictions dutch companies may have accounts in any currency both at home and overseas all accounts need to comply with dutch tax and anti money laundering rules foreign investment issues investment restrictions what restrictions fees and taxes exist on foreign investment in or ownership of a project and related companies do the restrictions also apply to foreign investors or creditors in the event of foreclosure on the project and related companies are there any bilateral investment treaties with key nation states or other international treaties that may afford relief from such restrictions would such activities require registration with any government authority foreign companies are treated in the same way as dutch owned businesses there are no restrictions and fees with regard to investment in or ownership of a project special purpose vehicle spv no specific taxes will be payable by a foreign party on investments made into the netherlands in specific situations a foreign party may be subject to dutch corporate income tax in respect of income including capital gains derived from investments made into the netherlands however normally no such taxes should be payable by a foreign party on the basis of an exemption under dutch domestic tax law or an applicable double tax treaty the netherlands has entered into more than 100 bilateral investment treaties and is party to the energy charter treaty these treaties guarantee the fair and equitable treatment of the investors investments often specify most favoured nation clauses to prevent discrimination offer protection against damages or for deprivation of property and guarantee the free transfer of income in and outbound investors may invoke rights under these treaties including procedural rights to alternative forms of dispute resolution typically arbitration the netherlands treaties typically include liberal definitions of investors and investments that qualify for protection often enabling indirect investors to have standing as well consequently netherlands treaties are often relied upon in international investment arbitration when acquiring ownership of a project related company that is not subject to eu merger control rules mergers acquisitions and certain joint ventures collectively referred to as concentrations may require competition clearance in the netherlands when such a clearance is required the dutch authority for consumers and markets acm has to be notified of the intended acquisition after notification the acm will examine the effect of the concentration on the dutch market if there is no undermining competition the acm will in principle grant competition clearance for the concentration the notification duty is also applicable in the event of foreclosure on the project and related companies if there is an acute threat that one of the involved companies will go bankrupt or will be granted a moratorium parties may request the acm to make a decision on an urgent basis insurance restrictions what restrictions fees and taxes exist on insurance policies over project assets provided or guaranteed by foreign insurance companies may such policies be payable to foreign secured creditors foreign insurers that have a valid licence and that are registered in an eu or eea member state may conduct their insurance business in the netherlands without further permission of any dutch authorities this is known as the european passport or single licence principle before the insurer can actually operate in the netherlands it has to go through a notification procedure with the dutch central bank insurance premium tax may apply in relation to insurance contracts where the risk is deemed to be located in the netherlands certain exemptions may apply for example in respect of marine insurance aircraft insurance export credit insurance and reinsurance worker restrictions what restrictions exist on bringing in foreign workers technicians or executives to work on a project in principle all employers who wish to employ foreign employees within the netherlands regardless of the length of the employment and the nationality of the employee except for most eu or eea nationals swiss nationals and certain individuals to whom special regulations apply must obtain a work permit for the employee prior to the commencement of his or her employment employees may be brought in as a labour migrant a highly skilled migrant or as a scientific researcher for each category certain conditions and salary requirements apply a labour migrant will for instance have to earn the dutch statutory minimum wage which is indexed on an annual basis a work permit will generally be issued only if there is no equally suitable dutch or eu or eea national for the job and the permit is limited in time up to a maximum of three years under certain conditions no work permit is required in respect of foreign nationals working temporarily in the netherlands in the context of cross border service provision where the foreign national is employed by an employer established in a european union member or eea state other than the netherlands or switzerland most foreign nationals from outside the eu and eea who wish to work in the netherlands for more than three months must apply for a temporary residence permit in person at the dutch embassy or consulate in their country of origin alternatively the employer can apply to the immigration service in the netherlands for a temporary residence permit a temporary residence permit is valid for six months a special regulation applies to highly skilled migrants under this regulation a work permit is no longer necessary if the foreign employee will earn a certain gross monthly salary in addition the employer has to sign a statement by which it assumes a number of responsibilities if however the employee needs a residence permit then this will still need to be obtained the immigration service will in principle decide on the request to issue a temporary residence permit within weeks foreign employees temporarily seconded to the netherlands may obtain a special expatriate tax regime the 30 per cent ruling provided that certain conditions are met this ruling has the effect of materially reducing the rate of income tax paid by the employee besides the migration rules employers have to follow other dutch regulations these include the working conditions act setting out rules with respect to working environment safety and the working hours act regulating maximum working hours failure to meet all mentioned rules may result in administrative fines and civil liability equipment restrictions what restrictions exist on the importation of project equipment there are no specific restrictions regarding the importation of project equipment with the exception of certain products that might affect among other matters public safety health the environment or public security customs duties and vat apply to importation from non eu states and a customs declaration is required nationalisation laws what laws exist regarding the nationalisation or expropriation of project companies and assets are any forms of investment specially protected if the dutch local government requires soil or buildings not owned by the government and this is in the public interest the government must seek to acquire such assets using the most amicable means available if the negotiations between the local government and owner are unsuccessful the local government may expropriate the assets by way of a legal procedure expropriation may only be used as a last resort and the government is obliged to pay damages the courts will weigh certain factors including the public need to expropriate the efforts to buy the assets and the offered damages payment fiscal treatment of foreign investment incentives what tax incentives or other incentives are provided preferentially to foreign investors or creditors what taxes apply to foreign investments loans mortgages or other security documents either for the purposes of effectiveness or registration there are no dutch tax incentives provided specifically to foreign investors or creditors however the netherlands does offer a highly competitive fiscal climate which includes without limitation for both domestic and foreign investors or creditors tax incentives for r d environmentally friendly investments and sustainable energy projects an extensive double tax treaty network and the possibility to obtain a tax ruling to confirm the dutch tax position in advance with the dutch tax authority no dutch stamp duty registration tax or other similar tax or duty will be payable for the effectiveness or registration of foreign investments loans mortgages or other security documents where dutch real estate or certain rights thereto is acquired either directly or indirectly dutch real estate transfer tax at a rate of 2 per cent residential properties or 6 per cent non residential properties may be payable by the acquirer of dutch real estate or certain rights thereto government authorities relevant authorities what are the relevant government agencies or departments with authority over projects in the typical project sectors what is the nature and extent of their authority what is the history of state ownership in these sectors there is no coordinating act on projects or exhaustive sector legislation relevant stipulations for any project can mainly be found in the environmental management act and the spatial planning act both expected to be replaced by the new environment and planning act in 2019 see question 25 regulation of natural resources titles who has title to natural resources what rights may private parties acquire to these resources and what obligations does the holder have may foreign parties acquire such rights minerals minerals that are capable of being produced in a commercially viable way in the netherlands include coal various salts and hydrocarbons ownership of minerals located at a depth of 100 metres or more under the surface is regulated in and by the mining act which applies to minerals located under the mainland to minerals located under the continental shelf of the north sea and to those located under inland waters and seas title to minerals is vested in the dutch state article 3 1 mining act the production of minerals is not allowed unless a licence for that purpose has been granted article 6 mining act by their extraction from the soil title passes to the licensee article 3 2 mining act production of minerals is not restricted to dutch persons or entities or to persons or entities of any particular nationality water subsoil water is a res nullius as long as it has not been abstracted abstraction and distribution of drinking water including water intended to be converted into drinking water is not allowed by any party other than the owner of a drinking water company or certain other parties in specific local situations article 4 drinking water act it is prohibited that parties who do not meet the regulatory requirements directly or indirectly gain entire or partial control over a drinking water company or the management of its business article 15 drinking water act each licensee is granted an exclusive territory for production and supply article 5 1 drinking water act licensees for the abstraction of drinking water are not allowed to distribute industrial water outside their exclusive territory except for the supply to licensees in other territories article 5 2 drinking water act the minister can amend such territory article 5 4 drinking water act and licensees can request for this territory to be amended article 5 6 drinking water act for the abstraction of water other than drinking water a licence by the relevant district water board the relevant provincial executive for volumes in excess of 150 000 cubic metres per annum or by the government offshore will be required article 6 4 6 5 water act whereby exceptions apply if the offshore wind energy act article 6 5a water act applies what grows or lives on the land title to plants growing on the land is vested in the landowner royalties and taxes what royalties and taxes are payable on the extraction of natural resources and are they revenue or profit based as a general rule production licences will be granted subject to the execution of a cooperation agreement between the licensee and a company designated by the government whereby the latter shall be given a 40 per cent participation in the production activities in consideration of a 40 per cent participation in the costs of exploration articles 87 to 97 mining act 2003 in nearly all cases the company designated by the government is the 100 per cent state owned company ebn bv profits made by the licensee s production activities are subject to a corporate income tax and a profit share collected by the tax collector articles 65 to 70 mining act at a combined rate of up to 50 per cent in addition there is also a surface duty in an amount between 257 of 771 for exploration and of 771 for extraction in each case per square kilometre of the area to which the licence applies articles 56 to 59 mining act finally a levy is payable on the value of sales of oil and gas the percentage thereof is fixed at rates between zero per cent and 17 5 per cent in accordance with the volumes produced for onshore production and at zero per cent for offshore production articles 60 to 64 mining act to the extent extraction activities for hydrocarbons are performed on the territory of a province ie in all cases other than offshore production a one time levy is payable to the provincial executive calculated per square metre articles 75 to 80 mining act 2003 rights related to the exploration or exploitation in the netherlands including the dutch continental shelf of natural resources including the generation of energy from water float and wind or rights vested on such assets are normally qualified as a dutch permanent establishment accordingly a foreign investor will generally be subject to corporate income tax in the netherlands in respect of income it derives from its rights related to the exploration or exploitation of dutch natural resources and a profit share at the combined rate set out above export restrictions what restrictions fees or taxes exist on the export of natural resources there are normally no restrictions on exports to eea member states and there are normally no restrictions on the export of natural resources to countries outside the eea other than the applicable customs regulations and duties and in respect of certain countries sanction regulations the dutch government may be entitled to a certain profit share in respect of the income in connection with the exploration and exploitation of minerals in the netherlands including the dutch continental shelf legal issues of general application government permission what government approvals are required for typical project finance transactions what fees and other charges apply under dutch law government approvals are usually not required for project finance transactions however for project implementation different types of approvals exist eg building permits permission under applicable environmental legislation the dutch water act the environmental management act and the spatial planning act etc as the requirements for each permission vary and some types of permission are linked by operation of law careful overall review of the permitting requirements is required a foreign investor will not be treated more strictly in obtaining a required permission it is expected that 26 different acts will be replaced by one new environmental and planning act as per 1 january 2021 to increase efficiency and decrease complexity of the decision making processes of competent authorities by allowing for a more integrated and flexible approach as per the date of this article underlying regulations are being prepared in respect of offshore wind energy projects specific legislation applies in the form of the offshore wind energy act and particular parts of the electricity and gas act bill this legislation provides for plot decisions as well as the process of tendering of renewable energy subsidies combined with a permit to construct and operate the offshore wind farm to cater to the international interest for these projects the competent authority has provided for publicly available translations of several relevant documents in english registration of financing must any of the financing or project documents be registered or filed with any government authority or otherwise comply with legal formalities to be valid or enforceable in the netherlands there are no documentation formalities with regard to the financing or project documents for verification reasons written agreements are highly recommended even if a written form is not required by law if the spv is a private limited liability company or a public company the constitution documents should be in the form of a notarial deed which must be executed by a civil law notary any transfer of or right of mortgage on real estate must be done respectively created through a notarial deed which must be executed by a civil law notary the deed of transfer or mortgage must be registered with the dutch land registry office and a transfer levy will apply the payment obligations under the financing or project documents could be secured by means of a mortgage or a right of pledge which in the case of shares may need to be in the form of a notarial deed see question 2 for perfection requirements arbitration awards how are international arbitration contractual provisions and awards recognised by local courts is the jurisdiction a member of the icsid convention or other prominent dispute resolution conventions are any types of disputes not arbitrable are any types of disputes subject to automatic domestic arbitration the awards of all major arbitral institutions and rulebooks are enforceable and the dutch courts are strongly supportive of the enforceability and finality principles in arbitration permission to enforce exequatur is typically swiftly granted on the basis of a prima facie review of formalities once a simple request has been submitted to the competent court almost any type of commercial dispute can be arbitrated if the parties agree subject to matters pertaining to the formal validity of corporate decision making which is a matter concerning third party rights as well that is has erga omnes effects there is no regime of specific domestic arbitration in the sense that the applicable legal regime differs from international arbitration that being said construction and product arbitrations are typically administered by national arbitration institutes that borrow some of their rules from domestic litigation the courts are strongly supportive of arbitration the netherlands is a party to the 1958 convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards known as the new york convention and is also a member of the icsid convention law governing agreements which jurisdiction s law typically governs project agreements which jurisdiction s law typically governs financing agreements which matters are governed by domestic law the parties may freely choose the law applicable to an agreement with an international character provided that such a choice is not in conflict with public order and mandatory law a choice of law will usually be accepted by a dutch court dutch law will mandatorily govern property law aspects tax and customs duties labour and safety law environmental aspects authorisations and permits delivered by the dutch local government and insolvency laws of entities having their main centre of interest in the netherlands depending on the jurisdiction of incorporation of the lender or lenders in the case of a syndicate financing agreements will typically be governed by either dutch law or the laws of england and wales however the security documentation regarding assets located in the netherlands eg real estate and shares in dutch companies must be governed by dutch law submission to foreign jurisdiction is a submission to a foreign jurisdiction and a waiver of immunity effective and enforceable yes submission to a foreign jurisdiction is in principle enforceable subject to certain limitations including those following from regulation 1215 2012 it is uncertain if and to what extent a waiver of immunity from prosecution is effective if the waiving entity enjoys such immunity which is typically only sovereign states acting in their capacity as states a waiver would probably also be subject to such immunity environmental health and safety laws applicable regulations what laws or regulations apply to typical project sectors what regulatory bodies administer those laws most projects qualify as installations under the environmental management act for installations with some substance the main requirement for building and operating installations is obtaining an environmental permit based on the environmental permitting general provisions act the municipality is in principle the competent authority however for projects above a certain threshold the provincial executive is the competent authority some projects will be covered by the crisis and recovery act the crisis and recovery act apart from having a coordinating role for the provincial executive has its own set of rules to speed up the process for example the administrative high court is required to decide within six months after an appeal is filed instead of the usual 12 months in order to speed up and streamline the process for large projects eg wind parks with production power from 100mw and upwards some projects may be declared of national interest and will as a result be coordinated by the national authorities an operating permit for the installation is not required when an installation falls within a category for which general rules apply as a result of which the obligation to obtain a permit is lifted this is the case for 90 per cent of operative installations such as offices and standardised factories apart from the environmental permitting general provisions act and environmental management act sector regulations may provide amendments to the general provisions further the spatial planning act the housing act the nature conservation act the flora and fauna act the water act and several lower regulations contain requirements to build and operate projects eu directives are or will be implemented in the dutch environmental management act and sector regulations see question 20 for more information on the expected upcoming environment and planning act replacing several of the above mentioned acts as well as legislation on offshore wind parks project companies principal business structures what are the principal business structures of project companies what are the principal sources of financing available to project companies a special purpose vehicle spv will typically be a dutch bv which is a private company with limited liability the project company will then enter into back to back subcontracts in relation to the project works these would typically include a design and build contract and a maintenance and operation contract the most common sources of finance are equity often provided by a combination of financial and industrial sponsors floating and fixed rate interest bank debt including from multilaterals such as the european investment bank and bond finance increasingly from institutional investors public private partnership legislation applicable legislation has ppp enabling legislation been enacted and if so at what level of government and is the legislation industry specific there is no general regulatory framework for ppp contracts under dutch law legislation relevant to facilitating ppp in the netherlands mainly relates to procurement laws enacted by the national government public procurement act as amended as the implementation of european directives nos 2014 23 eu 2014 24 eu and 2014 25 eu whether the public procurement act applies is determined on a case by case basis large contracts design build finance maintain operate dbfm o nec3 nec4 and alliancing in for example infrastructure water office and accommodation projects are usually subject to the public procurement rules for works services and supplies set forth in the public procurement act since employers of such projects generally are governmental authorities further ppp contracts are governed by dutch contract law which mainly consists of directory law the larger dbfm o contracts referred to above which are being tendered by the central government are generally in a preset format that was developed by the ministry of waterways and public works and adapted by the central government real estate agency for use in office and accommodation related ppp schemes a new updated model dbfm o agreement is expected in due course with updates expected in relation to amongst others the collaboration between parties from the perspective of the new marketvision amendment procedures social return and provided information and compensation ppp limitations legal limitations what if any are the practical and legal limitations on ppp transactions there are some limitations on ppp transactions in certain sectors including the education and healthcare sector for ppps in the education sector there is a requirement to have separate funds for construction and maintenance the construction costs are paid by the municipal fund prior to the time the relevant school board receives a construction budget that is based on standard costs per pupil per square metre schools themselves are responsible for the replacement of the inventory and operating costs for which a limited budget is set by the ministry of education on the basis of the said principle in school ppps the advantages become manifest especially during the operational phase smart solutions in the design and functionality of the building and use of maintenance materials provide particular advantages in the operational phase but in the preliminary stage there are additional costs particularly in drawing up contracts and making additional investments in the quality of the building another practical limitation is that ppps in the healthcare sector require a stable predictable flow of funds but there are no stable predictable cash flows because of the focus on short term one year contracts with healthcare insurers rather than lengthier contracts legal limitations on ppp transactions also result from the applicability of the public procurement act ppp transactions significant transactions what have been the most significant ppp transactions completed to date in your jurisdiction a number of ppp projects and other finance projects have been successfully closed blankenburg reached contract close and eefde lock reached financial close in 2017 ppp projects that are in the process of tendering include the a16 the afsluitdijk and the marine corps barracks among the non ppp projects we have seen transactions close in onshore wind parks and solar and energy infrastructure clearly the sector that has received the most attention internationally is the dutch offshore wind industry with projects such as borssele i ii iii and iv being awarded by the dutch government in 2016 to dong energy borssele 1 bv a danish offshore wind developer in the case of borssele i and ii and to a consortium of eneco diamond generation europe a 100 per cent subsidiary of mitsubishi corporation shell and van oord in the case of borssele iii and v in january 2018 it was reported that all consortium members except van oord had sold part of their participations in borssele iii iv to partners group borssele v s tender period closed in january 2018 in addition the dutch government designated additional strips of sea area for offshore wind infrastructure to allow for the realisation of offshore wind projects at hollandse kust zuid 1 400mw and hollandse kust noord 700mw the aim of this move is to cut offshore wind costs by enabling construction closer to the coast the tenders for hollandse kust zuid i and ii closed in december 2017 market participants submitted zero subsidy bids in respect of hollandse kust zuid i and ii which was reported in the dutch press as a major new milestone in the development of renewable energy and a first for the netherlands the project was awarded to a subsidiary of nuon vattenfall although the decision is not yet final update trends update trends updates and trends the year 2017 was a relatively active one for the project finance sector in the netherlands with a number of projects reaching financial close during this period this is testament to the fact that there is a strong deal flow in the netherlands although the number of projects actually brought to the market was less than originally expected this continues the trend we have seen develop over the past couple of years which clearly reaffirms the stability and maturity of the dutch project finance market the types of projects that closed in 2017 were as in previous years quite diverse mainly including road and water infrastructure public private partnerships renewables of different sorts including rooftop and ground mounted solar pv systems on and offshore wind biomass biogas but also featuring refinancings of data centres and geothermal assets the dutch project finance market continues to attract a mix of domestic and international lenders public financing institutions such as the european investment bank and japan bank for international cooperation debt funds and institutional investors in particular more banks have become active in the offshore wind market as this sector continues to mature resulting in increased competition leading to higher leverage and lower margins for refinancings also the involvement of institutional investors continues to be strong providing a welcome additional source of funds although on the debt side it is likely to be limited to refinancing transactions because of the bank lending market being much more competitive some noteworthy debt strategy trends have continued which can be summarised as follows there is an increasing number of lenders prepared to take large tickets for example in the offshore wind market commercial banks have been underwriting up to a maximum of 75 million 150 million in addition to being involved in more than one deal per year and being willing to take increasing construction risk at present the more traditional domestic or european institutional investors are often lending alongside institutional investors from canada the united states japan and china that have been looking for opportunities in the dutch market there has been an increase in the number of refinancings at different stages of development this refinancing trend is supported by factors such as margins being low which still makes debt cheap financing structures being relatively stable in terms of ratios and convents project costs coming down with more competition across the variety of project phases from development to operation and finally in the offshore wind market there is generally a better understanding of the construction risks which makes for a reduction in the risk premium element in relation to offshore wind projects no longer need to rely as much on government subsidies and market participants are able to access a variety of funding sources in addition to project financings

acquisition related intangible amortization other acquisition and divestiture related items stock based compensation restructuring and other costs impairment charges and asset write offs gain on divestiture debt restructuring and debt issuance cost amortization non cash adjustments related to tax receivable agreement similar adjustments attributable to our non controlling interest and certain tax related items although adjusted net income is not calculated in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap this non gaap measure is integral to the company s reporting and planning processes and the chief operating decision maker of the company uses segment adjusted operating income to allocate resources among our operating segments the company considers this measure integral because it excludes the above specified items that the company s management excludes in evaluating the company s performance specifically in addition to evaluating the company s performance on a gaap basis management evaluates the company s performance on a basis that excludes the above items because exclusion of the non cash mark to market adjustments on financial instruments including interest rate swap agreements and investment securities helps management identify and assess trends in the company s underlying business that might otherwise be obscured due to quarterly non cash earnings fluctuations associated with these financial instruments additionally the non cash mark to market adjustments on financial instruments are difficult to forecast accurately making comparisons across historical and future quarters difficult to evaluate net foreign currency gains and losses primarily result from the remeasurement to functional currency of cash receivable and payable balances certain intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies and any gain or loss on foreign currency hedges relating to these items the exclusion of these items helps management compare changes in operating results between periods that might otherwise be obscured due to currency fluctuations the company considers certain acquisition related costs including certain financing costs investment banking fees warranty and indemnity insurance certain integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles as well as gains and losses from divestitures to be unpredictable dependent on factors that may be outside of our control and unrelated to the continuing operations of the acquired or divested business or the company in addition the size and complexity of an acquisition which often drives the magnitude of acquisition related costs may not be indicative of such future costs the company believes that excluding acquisition related costs and gains or losses of divestitures facilitates the comparison of our financial results to the company s historical operating results and to other companies in our industry during the year ended december 31 2017 the company determined that our telapoint business did not align with the long term strategy of our core businesses and as a result sold the net assets of the business stock based compensation is different from other forms of compensation as it is a non cash expense for example a cash salary generally has a fixed and unvarying cash cost in contrast the expense associated with an equity based award is generally unrelated to the amount of cash ultimately received by the employee and the cost to the company is based on a stock based compensation valuation methodology and underlying assumptions that may vary over time restructuring and other costs are related to certain identified initiatives to further streamline the business improve the company s efficiency create synergies and to globalize the company s operations all with an objective to improve scale and increase profitability going forward this also includes other immaterial costs that the company has incurred and are non operational and non recurring we exclude these items when evaluating our continuing business performance as such items are not consistently occurring and do not reflect expected future operating expense nor do they provide insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business impairment charges and asset write offs represent non cash write offs which do not reflect recurring costs that would be relevant to the company s continuing operations in 2018 impairment charges represent a goodwill impairment related to fleet solutions operations in latin america we also impaired computer software which was determined to have no future value in 2017 we incurred impairment charges of certain prepaid services following a strategic decision to in source certain technology functions and on certain payment processing software as part of our ongoing platform consolidation strategy the company believes that excluding these nonrecurring expenses facilitates the comparison of our financial results to the company s historical operating results and to other companies in its industry debt restructuring and debt issuance cost amortization are unrelated to the continuing operations of the company debt restructuring costs are not consistently occurring and do not reflect expected future operating expense nor do they provide insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business in addition since debt issuance cost amortization is dependent upon the financing method which can vary widely company to company we believe that excluding these costs helps to facilitate comparison to historical results as well as to other companies within our industry the adjustments attributable to non controlling interests and to non cash adjustments related to our tax receivable agreement have no significant impact on the ongoing operations of the business the tax related items are the difference between the company s u s gaap tax provision and a pro forma tax provision based upon the company s adjusted net income before taxes as well as the impact from certain discrete tax items the methodology utilized for calculating the company s adjusted net income tax provision is the same methodology utilized in calculating the company s u s gaap tax provision for the same reasons wex believes that adjusted net income may also be useful to investors as one means of evaluating the company s performance however because adjusted net income is a non gaap measure it should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to net income operating income or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap in addition adjusted net income as used by wex may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies the table below

period last year see exhibit 1 for a full explanation and reconciliation of adjusted net income attributable to shareholders and adjusted net income attributable to shareholders per diluted share to

investments to support solid organic growth we continue to build a stronger growth foundation to capitalize on additional opportunities in fleet corporate payments and especially within the consumer directed healthcare market which is one of the fastest growing areas in healthcare said roberto simon wex s chief financial officer financial guidance and assumptions the company provides revenue guidance on a gaap basis and earnings guidance on a non gaap basis due to the uncertainty and indeterminate amount of certain elements that are included in reported gaap earnings the full year guidance below is updated from the preliminary 2019 guidance provided on february 22 2019 to include the revenue related to the discovery benefits acquisition which closed on march 5 2019 and a refinement to our estimate for noventis for revenue recognition for the first quarter of 2019 wex expects revenue in the range of 375 million to 380 million and adjusted net income in the range of 72 million to 74 million or 1 64 to 1 70 per diluted share for the full year 2019 the company expects revenue in the range of 1 680 million to 1 720 million and adjusted net income in the range of 385 million to 403 million or 8 80 to 9 20 per diluted share first quarter and full year 2019 guidance is based on an assumed average u s retail fuel price of 2 60 and 2 63 per gallon respectively the fuel prices referenced above are based on the applicable nymex futures price from mid february our guidance also assumes that fleet credit loss for first quarter will be in the range of 13 to 18 basis points and the full year will be in the range of 13 to 18 basis points our guidance assumes approximately 43 8 million shares outstanding for the full year the company s adjusted net income guidance which is a non gaap measure excludes unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments net foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses acquisition related intangible amortization other acquisition and divestiture related items stock based compensation restructuring and other costs impairment charges and asset write offs gain on divestiture debt restructuring and debt issuance cost amortization non cash adjustments related to tax receivable agreement similar adjustments attributed to our non controlling interest and certain tax related items we are unable to reconcile our adjusted net income guidance to the comparable gaap measure without unreasonable effort because of the difficulty in predicting the amounts to be adjusted including but not limited to foreign currency exchange rates unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments and acquisition and divestiture related items which may have a significant impact on our financial results additional information as previously disclosed beginning in the first quarter of 2018 the company has modified the presentation of certain line items in its consolidated statements of income under the new presentation the

captions additionally the revised presentation does not result in a change to previously reported revenues operating income income before income taxes or net income amounts from the prior period have been recast to reflect the new presentation management uses the non gaap measures presented within this news release to evaluate the company s performance on a comparable basis management believes

acquisition related intangible amortization other acquisition and divestiture related items stock based compensation restructuring and other costs impairment charges and asset write offs gain on divestiture debt restructuring and debt issuance cost amortization non cash adjustments related to tax receivable agreement similar adjustments attributable to our non controlling interest and certain tax related items although adjusted net income is not calculated in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap this non gaap measure is integral to the company s reporting and planning processes and the chief operating decision maker of the company uses segment adjusted operating income to allocate resources among our operating segments the company considers this measure integral because it excludes the above specified items that the company s management excludes in evaluating the company s performance specifically in addition to evaluating the company s performance on a gaap basis management evaluates the company s performance on a basis that excludes the above items because exclusion of the non cash mark to market adjustments on financial instruments including interest rate swap agreements and investment securities helps management identify and assess trends in the company s underlying business that might otherwise be obscured due to quarterly non cash earnings fluctuations associated with these financial instruments additionally the non cash mark to market adjustments on financial instruments are difficult to forecast accurately making comparisons across historical and future quarters difficult to evaluate net foreign currency gains and losses primarily result from the remeasurement to functional currency of cash receivable and payable balances certain intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies and any gain or loss on foreign currency hedges relating to these items the exclusion of these items helps management compare changes in operating results between periods that might otherwise be obscured due to currency fluctuations the company considers certain acquisition related costs including certain financing costs investment banking fees warranty and indemnity insurance certain integration related expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles as well as gains and losses from divestitures to be unpredictable dependent on factors that may be outside of our control and unrelated to the continuing operations of the acquired or divested business or the company in addition the size and complexity of an acquisition which often drives the magnitude of acquisition related costs may not be indicative of such future costs the company believes that excluding acquisition related costs and gains or losses of divestitures facilitates the comparison of our financial results to the company s historical operating results and to other companies in our industry during the year ended december 31 2017 the company determined that our telapoint business did not align with the long term strategy of our core businesses and as a result sold the net assets of the business stock based compensation is different from other forms of compensation as it is a non cash expense for example a cash salary generally has a fixed and unvarying cash cost in contrast the expense associated with an equity based award is generally unrelated to the amount of cash ultimately received by the employee and the cost to the company is based on a stock based compensation valuation methodology and underlying assumptions that may vary over time restructuring and other costs are related to certain identified initiatives to further streamline the business improve the company s efficiency create synergies and to globalize the company s operations all with an objective to improve scale and increase profitability going forward this also includes other immaterial costs that the company has incurred and are non operational and non recurring we exclude these items when evaluating our continuing business performance as such items are not consistently occurring and do not reflect expected future operating expense nor do they provide insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business impairment charges and asset write offs represent non cash write offs which do not reflect recurring costs that would be relevant to the company s continuing operations in 2018 impairment charges represent a goodwill impairment related to fleet solutions operations in latin america we also impaired computer software which was determined to have no future value in 2017 we incurred impairment charges of certain prepaid services following a strategic decision to in source certain technology functions and on certain payment processing software as part of our ongoing platform consolidation strategy the company believes that excluding these nonrecurring expenses facilitates the comparison of our financial results to the company s historical operating results and to other companies in its industry debt restructuring and debt issuance cost amortization are unrelated to the continuing operations of the company debt restructuring costs are not consistently occurring and do not reflect expected future operating expense nor do they provide insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business in addition since debt issuance cost amortization is dependent upon the financing method which can vary widely company to company we believe that excluding these costs helps to facilitate comparison to historical results as well as to other companies within our industry the adjustments attributable to non controlling interests and to non cash adjustments related to our tax receivable agreement have no significant impact on the ongoing operations of the business the tax related items are the difference between the company s u s gaap tax provision and a pro forma tax provision based upon the company s adjusted net income before taxes as well as the impact from certain discrete tax items the methodology utilized for calculating the company s adjusted net income tax provision is the same methodology utilized in calculating the company s u s gaap tax provision for the same reasons wex believes that adjusted net income may also be useful to investors as one means of evaluating the company s performance however because adjusted net income is a non gaap measure it should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to net income operating income or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap in addition adjusted net income as used by wex may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies the table below

trump envisions four straight years of budget deficits topping 1 trillion as the overall federal debt load would build this is something that we ll have to deal with powell said at a news conference

rising steadily and hiring is healthy that looks like a setting where consumption has underlying support powell said ___ 3 00 p m asked if the federal reserve might consider actually cutting rates later this year powell says that the current economic data does not indicate the need for the fed to start cutting rates it is a great time for us to be patient and to watch and wait powell says ___ 2 55 p m federal reserve chairman jerome powell sidestepped a question about why the u s central bank is significantly less bullish about u s economic growth than the trump white house fed officials are estimating growth of 2 1 percent a full percentage point lower than the estimates from white house aides that is a difference of roughly 200 billion in growth with trump officials suggesting that the tax cuts approved at the end of 2017 will continue to bolster faster economic gains despite multiple reports about trump s high expectations for growth powell says he was unfamiliar with the figures i haven t seen their projection he said at a news conference i wouldn t comment on their projection ___ 2 45 p m federal reserve chairman jerome powell says his view on the economy is still optimistic even as officials at the u s central bank sharply downgraded their projections for growth this year powell said at a news conference wednesday that our outlook is a positive one the fed chairman stressed that the unemployment rate is still low incomes are rising and surveys of consumers and businesses suggest that confidence in the economy remains fed officials are projecting a median growth of 2 1 percent in 2019 down from growth of 3 1 percent between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the same period in 2018 ___ 2 05 p m federal reserve policymakers took a dimmer view of the economy over the next three years in a set of economic projections they released wednesday they now forecast slower growth this year and next compared to their last set of projections three months ago and they project that the unemployment rate will rise slightly from this year through 2021 that more pessimistic outlook is likely the main reason that the fed forecast zero interest rate hikes this year a

in 2021 the fed also says it will stop shrinking its bond portfolio in september a step that would help hold down long term interest rates together the moves signal no major increases in borrowing rates for consumers and businesses some analysts believe the next rate move could be a cut later this year if the economy slows as much as some fear the fed s pause in credit tightening is in response to slowdowns in the u s and global economies it says that while the labor market remains strong growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter fed officials expect

this budget is a testament to the pleasures of endless growth forget productivity tax cuts or investment times have changed bill morneau the former executive who has served as trudeau s finance minister since the liberals unexpectedly won the last election keeps finding himself with more money than he expected his latest budget released on march 19 includes additional revenue of about 30 billion through 2024 compared with october s economic update unlike martin morneau s habit is to spend the windfall all of it on initiatives that will play well with his party s base balanced budgets rainy day funds and debt reduction no longer are features of the liberal brand from a purely economic perspective the strategy could result in reduced poverty and narrower wealth gaps which would have long term societal benefits the worry is that too little is being done to prepare for an economic downturn but that appears to be a risk that the trudeau government is willing to take especially

content the most important promise we made to canadians is to invest in their future morneau said at a press conference in ottawa before he tabled his fourth budget in the house of commons he congratulated himself for making these investments while moving the books back towards balance the deficit will be about 20 billion in the fiscal year that ends a year from now and about 10 billion in 2024 according to morneau s latest financial plan if the economy continues to roll those deficits won t be a problem they amount to one per cent of gross domestic product or less entirely manageable and low by international standards but there is reason to be wary about canada s economic prospects the budget assumes economic growth of about 1 8 per cent over the next five years which is about as fast as the bank of canada reckons the economy can grow without causing inflation that s a reasonable outlook but one that some forecasters will see as optimistic gdp barely grew in the fourth quarter and the first quarter probably won t be much better the soft patch could be temporary the result of an unusually large convergence of headwinds that converged over the second half of last year that have since begun to relent the future of the north american free trade agreement no longer is in doubt for example that should be good for investment as executives will have one less thing to worry

recession if only a shallow one according to david wolf a former adviser at the bank of canada who now is a portfolio manager at fidelity investments in toronto household debt is about 174 per cent of disposable income a record and one the highest levels in the world the surprise in the fourth quarter was a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending suggesting that all that debt could finally be weighing on domestic demand at the same time national home prices declined in 2018 for the first time in records that date to 1990 according to bloomberg news a slump could cause the value of the currency to drop to record lows of around us 0 65 creating a new headwind according to wolf the country s economy remains uncompetitive so there is little to offset weaker household spending there s a good chance that those stars are going to be misaligned wolf told bloomberg news in an interview earlier this week balance sheet recessions tend to drag the u s recovery from the financial crisis was

federal government alone would be in a position to do something about it according to david dodge the former bank of canada governor and the deputy minister at finance when martin balanced the budget in the 1990s the biggest provinces all spent heavily to help reverse the great recession none of them have the fiscal room to do so now especially ontario the country s biggest provincial economy dodge and richard dion a former economist at the central bank said in a pre budget report published by bennet jones the toronto based law firm for which both now work as advisers in his spring budget the federal minister of finance should take no spending or tax actions which would further compromise a future government s room to take the necessary discretionary action to support growth and public investment in the event of a major economic downturn unless these actions are aimed directly and demonstrably at enhancing productivity and investment to promote the potential growth of the economy dodge and dion wrote morneau pledged incentives to ensure all of rural canada has a broadband connection by 2030 and promised about 2 billion over five years for new training initiatives the rest of

opinions of wednesday 20 march 2019 columnist emmanuel tweneboah senzu there are varied aggregate factors that macro economically determine the state of welfare or the unhealthy nature of a nation among these factors the most easily noted symptom indicator is the performance of a national currency therefore it never theoretically wrong for an economist to assert you could do all politricks with your economy about its welfare but the free fall of your currency will expose you such a statement is a practical fact that sieve the truth from lies about the honest status of an economy however this article is premised on these bases there is one thing in knowing the cause of a problem and ambiguously narrating it to score a political point and another thing of appreciating the causal existence of a problem and meticulously striving to address the discussion about the declining value of the cedi currency and it varied cause of factors could attract different economists with different perspectives depending on their strategic position in the labour service of ghana but the effort of this article is to argue on the functional root cause responsible for the numerous subset of causes at the macro level complicating the cedi value decline issue making it to be perceived as an unsolvable problem on the economic board per it stabilization or appreciation of value a keen observation to the ghana cedi fall before its trading counterpart does go beyond the average analytical indicators used by economists to probably predicts it rise or fall if it wasn t so i believe the current economic managers would had done everything possible to address the challenge to buttress their competency argument as a political score hence the most anticipated question is what is the functional cause such that the economic managers seem hopeless to resolve the problem lies in a distorted ideological path of the current government as my observation affecting it principle execution of policies that supposed to be governed by a formidable theory of action it must be acknowledged that a good policy that worth implementation is always guided by a theory and a well constructed theory is ideologically driven to define it parametric efficiency however this article seeks not to prescribe an ideological stand relevant to the cedi stabilization or appreciation of the value that will lead to an economic growth but rather to open the floor for an analytical debate that presumably may hold the best solution to the predicament of our country as a sovereign nation we should recognize most of our challenges we face today as a nation is rooted from our thinking and actions whether conscious or unconscious which has it dna from how this nation was birthed in 1957 a socialist movement in orientation towards our decisions and actions traditionally it is the character of the left stylish political movement with perceived moral conduct to decide and act mostly just by the emotion and empathy for the people wishes against a required act of precision and rigorous analysis of pros and cons of actions to an intended result these leaders run their political administration on the emotion of masses which is noted to have a great effect on the monetary economy of any state because such a sector as an engine to the political economy function in a method of precision hence it policy implementation is always expected to be theoretically guided towards a scientific result for the above assertion to be elaborately understood will proceed to clarify with evidential historic facts as scenarios that has significantly contributed to the poor development of our financial market the weakening of the cedi currency in value and had projected a nation with a debt portfolio over the period of four decades in reference to tsikata et al 2000 they submit nkrumah government s position on foreign direct investment and economic development initially appeared to be somewhat controversial while globally foreign direct investment was regarded developmentally as an important component of the engine of growth nkrumah s marxist leninist political stance identified foreign investors as a primary agent of neocolonialism and western capitalist exploitation which made it very difficult for dr kwame nkrumah to attract as much investment from the west as he envisaged when they made u turn to compromise their overzealous socialist position which resulted in a major breakthrough with the agreement made with american aluminum consortium kaiser reynolds over the establishment of an aluminium smelter volta aluminum company valco at tema to exploit the power facilities being generated from the akosombo dam it was realized the content of the agreement was filled with overzealous terms in favour of the investors as tsikata submit in other to entice foreign investors due to the hunting of their past ideological positioning and stance then came the era of we shall not pay yentua declaration which sought to repudiate the country external debts with private investors as well as bilateral and multilateral agencies during the over throw of democratically elected government dr abrefa busia by then colonel acheampong with the country driven under a socialist based programme and dubious nationalization of foreign capital making ghana pariah in terms of foreign direct investment until the insurrection by flight lieut jerry john rawlings in 1979 in all this period the monetary economy of ghana is bulky of foreign direct investment inflows why because the marxist leninist thinkers governing the country then has emotionally developed disdain to domestic private productions which really has a strong response to currency stabilization power of any sovereign economy hence citizens in these regimes has become an addict to state dependency for easy manipulation and at the mercy of foreign direct investors up to date the average ghanaian still do not understand there is nothing like free in any economic compositions it purely deceit and a manipulative weapon we still have an estimate of 82 of the population in ghana who still thinks government owes them the responsibility to address all their needs including their irresponsibility in managing their own welfare to basic life because of the treat from the old overzealous socialists movement currently the movement has progressed into a stylish left intellectual fascism promoting and orienting the mindset of the masses on equality of outcomes everyone should have the same level of living or of income should finish the race the same time without considering individual choices preferences interest capacity ability desires etc in such an attempt in promoting these trends of policies as government has led to bigger government size and burden of imposing restrictions on the liberty of citizens for instance the overzealous in promoting free package initiatives of current government without a reliable financial engineered sources of funding as well as policies of empathy instead of precision has now become a cost and a burden to the liberty of other citizens with government resorting to rampant borrowing to satisfy most of it wishful thinking and political campaign promises projecting a national debts antithetical to cedi value stabilization promise as a result frustrating domestic enterprises growth and expansion all in the name of making the economy strong through infrastructural investment let us remind ourselves money like figures do not understand the

includes extensive land and property interests through ayala land telecom companies through globe telecom and consumer industries and banking through its ownership of the bank of the philippine islands in the first nine months of 2018 ayala reported revenues of us 4 1 billion philippine pesos 223 billion the corporation and its listed subsidiaries account for about 20 percent of the philippine stock exchange index s total capitalization much of its recent growth has been helped by buoyancy in the philippine economy which has been a star performer in the 10 nation association of southeast asian nations asean recently ayala has been expanding into high tech automotive supplies in europe with the 2017 acquisition of mt misslbeck technologies a german company that makes plastic parts and tools jaime augusto zobel de ayala chairman and chief executive of ayala wants the business to expand further overseas and has said that he expects the company to be generating around 10 percent of its equity earnings from outside the philippines up from 7 percent in 2018 he sat down with strategy business and discussed how the standoff between the u s and china can benefit his region the advantages conglomerates have in the asean region that they don t in the west and why it is crucial to invest in talent now to prepare for the future s b from your vantage point in asia what do you think has been the fallout from trade tensions between the u s and china in the region zobel de ayala the escalation of trade tensions that has taken place between china and the united states is actually leading to renewed opportunities within asean we are seeing an emerging realignment of supply chains as people look to a china plus one model or perhaps even move out of china to be able to continue selling to the u s from an acceptable country of origin the escalation that s taken place between china and the united states is actually leading to renewed opportunities within asean asean countries the philippines included will be beneficiaries of this shift we are seeing this development have an impact on our own businesses in our electronics business integrated micro electronics inc imi we have had two or three american companies that were china based move their operation to the philippines the other trend is a significant change in the competitive landscape of southeast asia vietnam is relatively well placed geographically to receive a boost from increased exports at the expense of china to a lesser extent malaysia thailand and the philippines are also better positioned than many other countries in the region to benefit s b have you seen any impact of this on your business at ayala zobel de ayala yes one of our subsidiaries imi is technology enabled for the automotive industrial and aerospace sectors and is our most global business with manufacturing sites in china bulgaria serbia germany mexico and the u s its philippine site has been the direct beneficiary of companies realignment of supply chains two north american customers of imi recently decided to move part of their operations from china to the philippines to mitigate the impact of trade war tariffs imi is in discussions with several more customers that are looking to move their china operations to other operating sites of imi get the strategy business newsletter delivered to your inbox sample email email address interestingly on the real estate front at ayala land we ve received increased commitments from chinese companies for our industrial parks with most to be situated in our pampanga site north of manila this includes a ceramics company that wants to build its largest facility globally in the philippines ayala land expects more chinese companies to relocate their operations in the coming months as a result of the trade war so it s a very interesting phenomenon and i don t think the philippines is the only one in this situation i see us as just a proxy for what s happening in vietnam thailand and indonesia so out of the negative trend of tension on trade come the positives of supply chain realignment to southeast asia s b asean economies have collectively outpaced many other national economies in recent years with the philippines growing at more than 6 percent in 2018 what threats to growth are you most concerned about geopolitical uncertainty the speed of technological change climate change zobel de ayala i am most sensitive to anything that affects employment from a broad perspective if we look at the issues that have negatively affected the world from political discontent to immigration and inequality they all revolve around employment related issues and the resulting inequalities that are generated people either not finding work losing their jobs or finding alternative employment add to that the fact that you ve got new technology shifts beginning to take place because of artificial intelligence or digitization people s employment options are changing at ayala we have started to invest in education because i believe that there is an increasing disconnect between the skills of people coming out of school and the skills needed for the range of jobs that are emerging this dynamic is even more pronounced in a country like ours where the vast majority don t make it through college essentially many people end their education in high school if they even manage to get that far and it is only a very small percentage who go on to further their education in college or aim for a post college degree i have always argued in policy discussions that we ve got to prepare young people in high school to be able to get jobs countries like germany and switzerland have had this great tradition of apprenticeship models which we have not had in our part of the world so we decided to invest quite heavily in the primary and secondary education space on a for profit basis because we believe that there has to be this closer link between educational outcomes and the changing needs of the workplace there have to be some new models s b many asian economies have relied on manufacturing to create entry level jobs for people moving into cities as urbanization has swept the region is artificial intelligence a threat to this trend zobel de ayala yes in asean manufacturing is a major provider of employment and industry 4 0 will have a crucial impact on jobs in the region it is imperative that we help our workforce prepare and adjust to the changing landscape by retooling and re skilling them while also reexamining current educational curricula the onus is on government the private sector and academia to work together to ensure that people reach a required proficiency in technology science engineering and mathematics and there must also be an emphasis on creativity and critical thinking embedded in the curriculum businesses are best positioned to identify the impact that ai and automation will have on their industries the responsibility to implement the required re skilling program for our current workforce lies with us but policymakers in the philippines must consider creating an enabling policy framework that will incentivize research and development and innovation to encourage progressive thinking among enterprises s b how fast do you think ai will affect jobs zobel de ayala i do not think ai is going to have as rapid an effect over the short term as people fear over 10 years say it will have a bigger effect we have a couple of key industries in the philippines that could be susceptible to ai for example one of the big drivers of our country s economy is the business process outsourcing bpo sector at ayala we have a window into that because we run and rent space to service centers not only for clients but for our businesses also much of it is already driven by ai these days when you either call or write an email to a center you are getting answered by machines people are having trouble telling the difference that said i remain an optimist i do believe that jobs change and shift and just because one series of jobs changes it doesn t mean new ones won t crop up the philippines is an extraordinary place one of our strengths is that we are very imaginative and incredibly resilient we are also flexible we also have a strong creative side you will find filipinos around the world providing leadership and unique skills to the creative industries we create music we make film we draw and design take a look at any film and you ll find many filipinos in the credits it s a natural strength that i think we haven t fully developed in addition to our investments in schools from our perspective at ayala we are investing much more now in reeducating our workforce our human resources and education teams are currently in discussion with various educational institutions for the up skilling of our people to ensure their relevance for the future asia rising s b ayala is one of a new breed of groups in the region many of them family owned businesses that have started to expand beyond their domestic markets and asean has the de globalization trend that we are seeing elsewhere caused you to focus more at home zobel de ayala no we are in expansion mode over the last decade we ve overweighted in the philippines because the growth story here has been quite compelling and the have paid off handsomely the increasing scale of our operations here has led us to also build up some solid regional expertise the increasing scale of our projects the growing abilities of our management teams the stronger the balance sheet we have and the increasing size of the capital we are allocating have led us to start saying maybe we could extend this expertise outside our country we have some companies that already have global footprints our electronics company imi has always been a global company and has kept expanding beyond that for the first time in recent history our real estate company has begun to look at buying companies abroad and has bought a medium sized company in malaysia most people do not know this but about 50 percent of the water supply of ho chi minh city in vietnam is generated from an ayala project the list goes on in energy we started just seven years ago we had zero capacity in the philippines but now as we have built up some expertise particularly on the renewables side we have begun to deploy capital into projects in vietnam indonesia and australia we have put up wind farms in indonesia and invested in a geothermal facility we are also developing solar farms in vietnam where the government similar to australia s is in a hurry to deploy renewable energy just last january our ac energy tapped the capital market for the first time with the issuance of a 410 million green bond we are proud to say that this is the first climate bond certified and publicly listed u s dollar green bond in southeast asia the asian development bank and the international finance corporation have invested a combined 95 million this highlights ayala s ability to grow its renewables portfolio so we are beginning to stretch beyond our national shores and although we are still in the early stages i see this as a successful model that we ll continue to build on over the next 10 to 20 years s b your business is essentially a conglomerate model some might argue that it s gone out of fashion in western economies but it seems to be thriving in emerging markets including in asia zobel de ayala i would differentiate between the conglomerate in a country like the u s and a conglomerate in southeast asia the reason conglomerates at least the bigger ones have been successful in an asian setting is that in many cases we are living in emerging market environments where the foundations and institutions necessary for economic growth are not there conglomerates have taken up the slack and filled many gaps take the philippines back in the ramos administration the water distribution system in the city of manila was falling into massive disrepair rather than allocate more government funds to it the ramos government encouraged privatization ayala won one of the concessions and we have invested heavily in modernizing it was only because we were a conglomerate and understood the various linkages that we were able to move into a business like that with the right resources people and partners this model could be a proxy for other conglomerates in southeast asia where governments have failed to build the infrastructure needed for progressive development fast enough s b there are examples of this in india where conglomerates have stepped in and built airports for example zobel de ayala yes we have been very frustrated for a long time now that our international airport in the city of manila is behind where it should be in terms of accessibility and capacity we have pleaded with past governments to upgrade our airport infrastructure finally seven of the philippine groups who generally do not work together formed a consortium and we made an unsolicited offer to renovate the airport we drew in changi from singapore to be a partner and submitted a plan to upgrade the facilities for ninoy aquino international airport in manila to date the government has given us original proponent status and allowed us to move forward with the process again it s only because we are multi business groups that we ve been able to get together and allocate funds for an infrastructure project of this nature whether it s thailand indonesia or one of the more emerging countries there s been a very strong proposition for conglomerates to use their balance sheets and their expertise to fill in some massive gaps on the economic development side some are better than others but generally conglomerates have been a positive force in our economy author profile jeremy grant a former financial times correspondent is an editor with
