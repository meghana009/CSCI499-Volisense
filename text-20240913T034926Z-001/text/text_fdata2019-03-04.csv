last week we told our readers to brace for big breakouts and while not every currency saw big moves rose to its strongest level in two months rose to its highest level in seven months and jumped nearly a percent on friday what s surprising is that the us report which is usually not a big market mover had a far greater impact on the than china s tariff extension or federal reserve chairman powell s testimony to congress with usd jpy hovering just under 111 for more than two weeks investors were desperate for good news which they found in q4 gdp however that positive sentiment may not last with downside risks to the three monetary policy announcements and two key employment reports on the calendar china may be close to a trade deal with the us but until an agreement is signed sealed and delivered central bankers will remain skeptical the european central bank also cannot assume that when it comes down to the wire and it has uk prime minister may will forgo a no deal brexit caution will be the buzzword for all central bankers especially the ecb and rba who are the most sensitive to brexit and chinese trade uncertainties with that in mind continues to be the best performer as the and dollars lag behind data review 1078k vs 1256k expected 1326k vs 1290 expected s p case shiller 0 19 vs 0 3 expected 16 vs 5 expected conference board 131 4 vs 124 9 expected

manufacturing ism and existing home sales potential for downside surprise given unexpected strength last month likely to remain weak given the softness of manufacturing fed there have been some improvements in the economy but fed districts could still report weakness potential for downside surprise given last month s unexpected strength key levels support 110 00 resistance 113 00 us dollar post gdp high how much further can it rise the is coasting on a post gdp high and is enjoying one of the strongest rallies but better than expected growth was not the only reason for the pair s gains here s a quick look at the reasons why usd jpy hit 112 better than expected us q4 gdp us hit 1 month highs trump extends china trade deadline tensions between india pakistan ease fed chair powell expresses optimism on the us economy boj talks easing last week kicked off with president trump s decision to delay the next round of chinese tariffs then came fed chair powell who could have focused on the red flags in the economy or the possibility of no rate hike this year but he didn t say anything damaging during his testimony on capitol hill instead he highlighted the positive outlook for the economy and overall strength of the labor market during the week the bank of japan talked about being open to additional stimulus which hurt the japanese yen and us q4 gdp beat expectations driving the greenback higher tensions between india and pakistan which could have escalated quickly eased with the return of an indian pilot it was a busy week for us data and while other economic reports were not as positive as the q4 gdp report it was good enough for the fed fund futures to price in a greater chance of a rate hike than a rate cut this year something that we haven t seen for a few weeks now 10 year treasury yields also rose to their highest level in a month the fundamentals are not in favor of the dollar at least in the near term gdp growth did not slow as much as economists anticipated in the last three months of the year but it still slowed and growth in the first quarter should be worse as it includes the impact of the government shutdown we also can t ignore the fact that many of the other economic reports released this past week reflected weakness in the us economy this includes housing data personal income spending the trade balance and the ism manufacturing index and the revisions the conference board consumer confidence index was higher and manufacturing activity in the chicago region improved but next week s employment report won t be so kind to the dollar job growth was unexpectedly strong in the month of january and as a result could pare back in february and the january numbers could also be revised lower if the ism and adp nasdaq report flash warning signs for the labor market usd jpy could fall back quickly however if the job market continues to power on usd jpy will make its way up to 114 technically 111 has been an important resistance level for usd jpy for more than two weeks and finally on the back of slower but better than expected growth in the fourth quarter the pair hit a high of 112 a level not seen since december of last year this move is important because it also takes the pair above all major moving averages opening the door for a move to 113 114 zone data review australia au 54 vs 52 5 previous new

cautious comments from the central bank potential upside surprise given an improvement in ivey pmi job growth last month signals potential recovery will have to see how ivey fares but pullback likely after a strong month key levels support aud 7000 nzd 6700 cad 1 3200 resistance aud 7200 nzd 6900 cad 1 3400 counting on australia and canada rate decisions last week was a challenging one for all three of the commodity currencies the australian dollar led the decline but the new zealand and canadian dollars also moved in a way that favors further losses ahead this upcoming week will be an important one for the australian dollar that could take aud usd out its 3 week 7057 to 7207 range the manufacturing pmi index was the only piece of market moving data on australia s calendar and the better than expected report should have helped the australian dollar however with interest rate hikes by local banks and rate cut predictions by economists the fundamental forces were skewed against gains in the currency underlying demand for the greenback was also strong and combined with the sell off in gold prices took aud usd to the bottom of its 3 week range if the reserve bank ignores the improvements in the economy or gdp and retail sales falls short of expectations we could see aud usd break 70 cents looking ahead to the rba we recall that when they last met governor lowe sent aud usd tumbling lower by lowering their growth and inflation forecast highlighting the risks abroad expressing concerns about housing market consumption and describing the interest rate outlook as more evenly balanced these comments led investors to rule out a 2019 rate hike and left the rba with a dovish slant so while the following table which compares data changes from the last meeting show an economy that is starting to improve we believe that the rba will remain cautious behind the scenes they ll be happy that the march 1st deadline passed with no additional tariffs on china but before a deal is signed their economic assumptions won t be changed with a rate hike off the table for this year the path of least resistance for aud usd is lower but there could be support at 70 cents if gdp growth or retail sales beat expectations the new zealand dollar on the other hand has fundamental support for its decline despite the recovery in dairy prices the country s trade surplus turned into a deficit in the month of january the balance was three times worse than expected and accompanied by a significant downward revision to the january figures although a large part of the deterioration was caused by higher crude prices blowing out the import balance business and consumer suffered as a result these numbers reinforce governor orr s warning earlier last month that continued data deterioration could lead to a rate cut nzd usd erased all of its beginning of the week gains and is at risk of testing the february 22nd 6758 low with no new zealand data on this week s calendar nzd should move in lockstep with aud and take its cue from the market s appetite for us dollars technically ending the week at its lows is not good for the currency so while the 68 cent support still holds for now a move to 6750 is likely the bank of canada also has a lot to consider the labor market is strong but the rest of the economy is weak when the central bank last met they lowered their gdp and inflation forecasts these changes were validated by the latest reports which showed quarterly gdp growth slowing to 0 4 from 2 annualized cpi growth also dropped to its weakest level in more than a year at the same time oil prices are recovering and the federal reserve appears to be slowing their pace of tightening we don t expect the bank of canada to change their policy stance which is no rate hikes at this time but eventually they will need to move higher what could be more important than the boc will be the upcoming ivey pmi and employment reports given the strength of the last release a pullback is likely technically usd cad traded sharply higher on friday and there s a good possibility the pair will see 1 34 this week data review brc 0 7 vs 0 3 expected gfk 13 vs 15

and if jeremy corbyn has his way there will be a second referendum that could put the whole notion of brexit behind us and while these are still the two most likely outcomes with less than a month to go investors are getting more nervous than ever theresa may s ongoing negotiations with the eu and other parties in the government have yielded very little she s promised another meaningful vote in parliament on march 12 and she s likely to concede to an extension of article 50 which would delay brexit there s already been talk of a 2 year extension in brussels last week the trump administration gave the uk a taste of the trade agreements they can expect when they leave the european union they want barriers on us exports to be removed particularly on agricultural goods and warned that they could take appropriate action if they negotiate a trade deal with a non market country like china this will certainly be problematic for the uk as it shows the challenges of negotiating from their weakened stance the economy is also suffering from boe governor carney s warning about a big hit to business investment manufacturing activity also slowed last month for the second month in a row we expect this same weakness in next week s pmi services report but the main focus will still be brexit and any headlines on extending article 50 a no deal brexit or a second referendum data review mom 0

1300 resistance 1 1450 euro german yields bottom but 1 14 still caps gains is being tugged in two directions and it may be up to this week s european central bank rate decision to decide where the pair heads next on the one hand german bond yields are finally bottoming as inflation turns higher and retail sales recover unemployment rolls also declined further fueling the improvement in confidence but with a stronger us gdp report and the ecb talking about another targeted long term refinancing operation tltro the rally has been capped at 1 14 if the central bank decides to provide another round of cheap loans the stimulative action will extend the period of cheap money and delay a rate hike from the central bank if they decide not to make a decision until june which could be possible as they may want to avoid liquidity shortages from past tltros maturing the market sees this as slightly positive for the currency while there have been both improvements and deterioration in the eurozone economy since the january meeting the decline in inflation should keep the central bank dovish
published monday 4 march 2019 print disqus a generation from now americans may marvel at the complacency that assumed the dollar s dominance would never end floyd norris chief financial correspondent new york times 2 2 2007 capitalism without bankruptcy is like christianity without hell frank borman nasa astronaut gemini 7 cdr apollo ceo eastern airlines april 1986 the generally accepted view is that markets are always right that is market prices tend to discount future developments accurately even when it is unclear what those developments are i start with the opposite point of view i believe that market prices are always wrong in that they present a biased view of the future george soros 1987 financier philanthropist political activist author philosopher b 1930 i was a fool but he was a cheat so exclaimed president trump s former lawyer and fixer mickey cohen in a dramatic public testimony into trump s personal and business affairs here in canada the words were different but the effect was the same the testimonies of mickey cohen and judy wilson raybould were riveting and dramatic threatening a president and a prime minister then there was another summit between trump and korean leader kim jong un that ended abruptly the love affair is over india and pakistan are threatening each other are they on the brink of nuclear war and just when we thought things couldn t get more interesting prime minister netanyahu of israel was charged with bribery fraud and breach of trust oh the drama and lest we forget fed chairman jerome powell spoke and negotiations continued with the chinese over trade all in all a dramatic and unforgettable week who cares about markets when the best shows are the ones being played out on c span but alas our focus is markets and unless the drama in congress ottawa and hanoi on the pakistani india border and in tel aviv are impacting markets then they are just a lot of sideline noise the clash between pakistan and india was cited as a reason the markets wobbled earlier in the week and don t forget the drama going on in venezuela but it too has had little impact on markets it may all be noise but one can t ignore it as many suggest because that noise can suddenly with little warning impact markets trade negotiations with china can have an impact on markets if they succeed the markets will rally but if they fail the markets will fall trump had previously announced a march 1 deadline but the reality is working on a deal with china is complicated oh a deal is being prepared but if the u s pushes china too hard china will walk away that is just what north korean leader kim jong un did although it was made out it was trump that walked away the two failed to agree on the lifting of sanctions so it was pointless to continue north korea wants an easing of sanctions as incentive to denuclearize the markets wobbled on the failure of the summit china u s trade negotiations are far more important than the north korea u s dickering over sanctions and nuclear weapons everybody wants a resolution the question is is one forthcoming not immediately the u s won a little battle at the wto over china providing farm subsidies but china s retaliation for trump s tariffs is hitting u s exporters it is estimated by some that u s exporters could lose upwards of 40 billion a year because of chinese tariffs tariffs work both ways nobody wins source www iif com www bloomberg com u s q4 gdp came in at 2 6 that in many respects was higher than expected it was thought that poor retail sales in december would drag the number down for the year the u s came in as a gain of 3 1 that is the highest since a 3 5 gain in 2005 it will be crowed by trump it is higher than the euro area 1 9 japan 1 0 u k 1 3 and canada 2 1 german gdp is estimated to be 1 5 for 2018 and france is anticipated to also gain 1 5 the u s gdp is exceeded only by china 6 4 but china is following a downward trajectory we can t help but note that china s factory pmi for february came in at 49 2 it was the third consecutive month under 50 readings under 50 are indicative of a possible recession but the gdp gain is coming at a cost of sharply increased debt consider that since trump took office gdp has grown by roughly 3 1 trillion but u s national debt is up 2 1 trillion when trump took office the u s national debt stood at 19 9 trillion now it is almost 22 1 trillion when one considers all debt securities in the u s that includes government corporations and the consumer debt has grown by 6 2 trillion since trump took office we have consistently said that one cannot grow gdp by debt alone at some point debt hits its limits make america great again how about make america debt bigger again take student loans in the u s as an example since 2010 student loans have more than doubled to almost 1 6 trillion apparently that is divided up between roughly 44 million students or nearly 36 thousand per student it is estimated that some 11 4 of the debt is delinquent automobile loans are lower with a total of around 1 2 trillion the delinquency rate is around 4 but a large proportion of that is in what one refers to as sub prime auto loans with sub prime auto loans the delinquency rate is around 16 sub prime auto loans make up roughly 25 of all auto loans with china faltering it is also no surprise that the eurozone is faltering as well the u k appears headed for a train wreck because of a no deal brexit there is a lot of maneuvering but the reality is they are unable to secure a deal that will satisfy everybody in the eurozone factory orders are faltering because of the tariff stand off with china and the u s and because of brexit the chart below shows the decline in the eurozone pmi a note that this can reverberate back on the u s and by extension canada as well source www ihsmarkit com www bloomberg com all of this brings us around to fed chair jerome powell and what the fed is doing remember the greenspan put the bernanke put and the yellen put well now we may have the powell put powell spoke in the capital this week and he continued to preach patience markets had faltered on the fed trying to reduce their balance sheet now powell is preaching that the fed will end its balance sheet reduction this year that s good news for the markets and that may yet help push the markets to new highs now the hints are not quite the same on rate hikes but it is becoming widely accepted that the fed will not hike at its march 19 20 fomc but they could still hike later the fed is becoming concerned about slowing in china and the eurozone the fed is becoming concerned about the global economy storm clouds are gathering but the stock markets keep going higher fear of missing out we are approaching a crossroads and in the background a lot of drama source www stockcharts com www elliottwave com don t get too excited about the fed cutting interest rates as some have mused if cutting interest rates were a panacea then you would think that the stock market would steady and rise but no as this chart shows the fed cut rates 13 times in 2000 2003 and yet the stock market still fell 50 in 2007 2008 the fed cut rates to effectively zero but that didn t stop the s p 500 from falling 58 only with huge injections of liquidity quantitative easing qe did the stock market react to the upside as we have noted it was also fueled by a huge debt binge the fed has hiked rates 9 times from 2015 to date but the market kept rising thanks to a huge trump tax cut however the effects of that should be falling off a reminder that the fed also cut rates several times in 1929 but it didn t stop the market from falling 89 in 1929 1932 the stock market is rebounding because of expectations of a positive outcome on the china u s trade front and the fed moving from a hawkish to a dovish tone the economy reporting good numbers as was seen in the recent gdp numbers is also fueling the stock market there is also a considerable amount of cash on the sidelines thanks to the recent downside gyrations fear of missing out on a rally can be a big motivator in moving that cash into the stock markets and a realization that there might now be a powell put markets and trends gains losses trends close dec 31 18 close mar 1 19 week ytd daily short term weekly intermediate monthly long term stock market

com stock markets continue to rise but there are some signs that this rise is slowing the first thing we note is the waning volume as the stock market moves higher suggesting to us that there are fewer and fewer participants this past week the dow jones industrials dji actually slipped 0 02 so it was essentially flat the s p 500 rose 0 4 while the nasdaq jumped a solid 0 9 but in a potentially negative divergence the dow jones transportations djt fell 1 2 the small cap russell 2000 was also pretty flat on the week as it rose a paltry 0 03 elsewhere the tsx composite was up 0 3 as was the tsx venture exchange cdnx in overseas markets the msci world index rose just under 0 5 the london ftse 100 faltered brexit woes falling 0 7 but the paris cac 40 rose almost 1 and the german dax was up 1 3 seemingly shrugging off potential recession woes in asia china s shanghai index ssec rose 4 9 continuing its recent winning ways and the tokyo nikkei dow tkn slipped 0 4 a rising dji against the backdrop of signs that the u s economy could be slowing suggests that this rally could soon be running out of steam building permits have been falling now for the past year housing starts are falling thus weakening in construction unemployment claims appear to have bottomed as they been rising for the past several weeks and recent retail sales numbers were flat to negative consumer confidence has slipped from its highs all in all the numbers suggest a slowing economy the latest gdp numbers also slowed from the previous quarter but overall they remained robust for the year as the u s economy grew by 3 1 the best in years despite this the stock markets keep on rising there was as we noted some divergences this past week as the nasdaq actually made new highs for the move up but the other indices did not confirm as they did not make new highs we also noted the drop in the djt the stock markets are just under potential major breakout points that could spark a buying panic and a melt up 30 000 dji here we come but maybe not the high so far for the dji on this up move has been at 26 241 that was just shy of our major breakout level of 26 300 the s p 500 also sits under its major breakout level of 2 825 the nasdaq s major breakout level is at 7 700 the nasdaq also sits just under that level so these markets are at important crossroads some indicators suggest that the markets will break those key levels and go on a melt up on the other hand a pullback could occur but it might be shallow before they regroup and then burst through the melt up levels we could make an argument for a head and shoulders pattern if the dji were to pull back and gyrate in a somewhat similar manner as it did in october november 2018 before breaking down a dji break under 25 000 would be negative and suggest that this rally is over confirmation would come on a breakdown under 24 000 for the s p 500 the points are at 2 700 and 2 600 the high for the s p 500 so far is 2 813 just shy of our 2 825 major breakout level source www stockcharts com a reminder that our long term chart of the s p 500 suggests that we have most likely completed five waves up from the march 2009 low wave 2 was the eu greek debt crisis of 2011 and wave 4 was the end of qe in 2015 wave 5 got underway with the election of president trump and expectations of tax cuts fulfilled and other very business friendly legislation wave 5 was also as we see in our chart of the week fueled by record corporate stock buybacks source www stockcharts com we continue to watch with some fascination the advance decline line that continues to soar to record highs we note that the s p 500 continues to lag the advance in the advance decline line trying to interpret it as the market continues to rise is difficult it suggests that the stock market should also continue to rise a top would be seen when the advance decline makes a lower high while the stock market makes a higher high this was seen at the top in august to september of 2018 source www dshort com with the recent rise in the stock market we thought we would look at the what is known as the buffett indicator that compares corporate equities to gdp this indicator is often prescient of a market top it hit an absolute high of 161 1 in 2000 before the high tech dot com collapse of 2000 2002 oddly it came nowhere near that at the high in 2007 before the 2008 financial crisis now the buffett indicator has soared to 151 the highest level seen since the 2000 top the buffett indicator is a great measure of stock market valuations no the current levels do not suggest that a top is in but it is a powerful indicator that one should be extremely cautious about buying at these levels note how back at the time of the 1987 stock market crash the buffett indicator was actually quite low suggesting that the panic should be bought source www stockcharts com the vix volatility indicator has been on a downward trajectory of late a rising vix suggests fear in the market while a falling vix suggests that there is no fear and all is good the vix however remains well above its lows of 2017 the vix s all time high was seen in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis hitting an unheard of level of 80 86 the recent mini panics in february 2019 and december 2019 saw the vix only reach to half that level the december collapse saw a lower low for the s p 500 but also a lower high for the vix suggesting a divergence that might resolve itself with a strong rally in the stock market now the vix is approaching that uptrend line from the record low seen in early 2018 an ideal divergence would be for the vix to make a higher low while the s p 500 soars to a new all time high that would set up a potential collapse source www stockcharts com the tsx composite appears to have hit a wall with the downtrend line from the july 2018 top a firm break above 16 200 would however suggest that the tsx composite could see new highs above the 16 586 seen in july 2018 the tsx composite could test back to 15 700 without causing any ripples that a deeper drop was in store under 15 700 there is potential to fall to 15 200 with an rsi that continues to hover above 70 the odds are that the tsx composite is overdue for a pullback however if this really is a melt up the rsi over 70 won t matter much as these overbought conditions can persist for some time as we have seen before shallow pullbacks are sufficient to at least ease some of the overbought conditions and even take the rsi back under 70 all this is occurring against the backdrop of a potentially slowing canadian economy and the ongoing snc lavalin affair canada s gdp source www tradingeconomics com www statcan gc ca the canadian economy grew at a paltry 0 1 quarter on quarter in q4 of 2018 the previous period saw growth of 0 5 on the year the canadian economy only grew 1 6 ongoing declines in construction and manufacturing are hurting canadian gdp growth rates it was the weakest growth since q2 of 2016 falling oil prices lower oil exports and final domestic demand all fell odds are pretty good that canada will not see any further interest rate hikes for the time being the canadian dollar however did not fare as well and fell canada s unemployment rate source www tradingeconomics com www statcan gc ca despite the weak gdp numbers for q4 canada s unemployment rate is at the lowest level in years at levels seen back in the 1970s at 5 8 the unemployment rate is above its recent lows of 5 6 one of the prime reasons the unemployment rate jumped recently was that more people entered the labour force looking for work the labour force participation rate rose to 65 6 from 65 4 it is noteworthy that the canadian unemployment rate is higher than the u s unemployment rate one of the prime reasons is the labour force participation rate in canada as noted it is 65 6 but in the u s it is only 63 2 that lower participation rate helps to lower the overall unemployment rate the canadian economy added 66 800 jobs in january after adding 9 300 in december the jobs in january were roughly evenly split between full time and part time the february employment numbers are due next week with signs that the canadian economy could be slowing the question is will the unemployment rate hold up canada s disposable personal income source www tradingeconomics com www statcan

its downtrend this past week as it rose to 2 76 from 2 65 the previous week we expect this is merely a part of the correction that began when yields hit a low of 2 56 in december as the stock market plunged the 10 year would have to rise to over 3 00 to suggest that even higher yields are ahead this correction has the potential to rise as high as 2 95 even as we believe the real target could be around 2 84 higher bond yields of sovereigns in the eurozone helped push the u s 10 year higher recession watch spread source www stockcharts com the recession watch spread known as the 2 year u s treasury note 10 year u s treasury note spread or the 2 10 spread broke out of the down channel this past week rising to 21 bp up from 17 bp the previous week clearly the 2 10 spread is not signaling a recession any time soon a recession warning usually only occurs when the 2 10 spread turns negative for a period of about six months technically we could argue that the 2 10 spread is merely correcting the downward pattern that got under at 78 bp way back in february 2018 if correct then the 2 10 spread could rise to at least 26 bp further potential lies up to 35 37 bp a break back under 14 bp would signal that the 2 10 is poised to move lower none of this suggests to us that the long term decline in the 2 10 spread is over with signs of a slowing u s economy the 2 10 should resume its downward trek once this pop up is over source www tradingeconomics com www canada ca treasury board secretariat the canadian 10 year government of canada bond cgb has fallen under 2 this is in keeping with what appears to be a slowing canadian economy the cgb did rebound this past week as it rose to 1 93 up from 1 88 the cgb is at levels last seen in early 2018 the cgb is taking on the potential shape of a large head and shoulders bottom pattern as long as the lows of 2012 are not taken out then this pattern could develop further if correct then we could see higher interest rates into 2020 the breakout point would be around 2 50 source www stockcharts com the us index continues to trace out what appears to be a large topping pattern the topping pattern is obviously quite complex it also has the appearance of a potential large head and shoulders top the breakdown point is around 95 25 with confirmation on a breakdown under 94 50 minimum targets appear to be around 90 50 with potential down to 89 80 the us index is being held up because the u s economy continues to outperform the eurozone and japan the euro and the japanese yen are the major components of the us index the others are the pound sterling the canadian dollar the swiss franc and the swedish krona source www stockcharts com gold broke trendline support this past week plunging about 17 on friday march 1 given that cash gold sold off further on friday following the close of the futures we anticipate that gold could open lower on monday possibly down around 1 290 while gold is pleased with the dovish tone coming out of the fed the fed also gave little hint as to whether they were finished with rate hikes gold futures found support initially at the rising 50 day ma near 1 300 a more likely target for gold is the 200 day ma currently near 1 250 we note major support down to 1 220 so in a worst case scenario we could test that level major resistance for gold remains from 1 350 to 1 370 once above 1 370 gold could swiftly move to 1 400 and higher it is probably not surprising that trader sentiment hit around 90 at the recent highs of 1 350 even as of friday s close trader sentiment remained around 65 typically trader sentiment needs to get down to 10 or lower before a low is possible source www cotpricecharts com the commercial cot for gold slipped this past week to 32 from 36 this suggests to us that gold has some more downside potential long open interest fell over 13 000 contracts while short open interest rose roughly 27 000 contracts not surprisingly the large speculators cot hedge funds managed futures etc rose to 70 from 66 that suggests they have been buying into this drop even as the commercials have been selling the commercial cot remains bearish we would like to see the commercial cot nicely above 40 to suggest that a low might be in source www stockcharts com gold began its bear market rally from the december 2015 low of 1 045 the first wave up topped in july 2016 at 1 377 50 we labeled that the a wave of a potential huge abc type correction to the decline seen from 2011 to 2015 when gold prices fell from over 1 900 to the december 2015 low of 1 045 following the july 2016 top gold prices appear to be unfolding in a classic consolidation symmetrical triangle to be labeled abcde the a wave bottomed in december 2016 at 1 124 following that low gold rose irregularly to a final top in may 2018 at 1 369 the c wave down bottomed in august 2018 at 1 167 we believe the d wave made its top on february 20 2019 at 1 350 the e wave down is now in progress the e wave tends to be the shortest of the abcde wave pattern target zones appear to range anywhere from a low of 1 220 to 1 280 the most likely target zone is probably somewhere between 1 240 to 1 280 we d be concerned if gold fell under 1 220 new lows would be possible under 1 200 once the e wave is complete gold should embark on the c wave up this wave should unfold in five waves and our target zones range from a minimum of 1 455 to as high as 1 725 above 1 725 higher targets are possible including new highs above 1 923 the 2011 all time high source www stockcharts com silver prices fell 66 bp this past week losing 4 1 it was not a pleasant week for the junior precious metals note that silver prices took out the lows seen on february 14 at 15 45 and the low seen on january 20 at 15 20 the low on the week was friday at 15 16 our expectations are that following a bounce silver prices should work their way lower we note considerable support down around 14 75 and that could be our target only below 14 40 could silver test the november low of 13 86 resistance is seen at 15 45 15 50 and again at 16 above 16 new highs are probable source www cotpricecharts com the silver commercial cot was unchanged this past week at 34 we can interpret this as positive as the commercial cot for silver is off the recent lows of 32 on the week long open interest rose about 1 000 contracts while short open interest fell about 500 contracts the large speculators cot slipped to 70 from 71 there is nothing bullish seen yet in the commercial cot our expectations are that silver prices might consolidate at current levels or correct higher for a short period to become bullish we need to see the commercial cot rise towards 50 once again source www stockcharts com gold stock prices followed gold and silver lower this past week the tsx gold index tgd fell 4 1 while the gold bugs index hui dropped 5 6 this should come as no surprise especially with the 20 down day seen for gold on friday march 1 the tgd may have completed five waves up from the november 2018 low if this is correct then the tgd could correct the entire wave up from 147 33 seen in september 2018 the tgd achieved minimum objectives of 188 50 this past week the next target could be down to around 180 major support can be seen at 176 a break under the january 2019 low of 171 42 would be more negative and the tgd could fall to 168 under 160 would suggest a test of 147 the september 2018 low and possibly lower our best call here is that the tgd tests down to 176 180 for a low that drop from december to january saw the tgd lose 8 6 a similar drop now would see the tgd fall to 184 based on that a target zone of 176 180 seems quite reasonable we note that the drop seen from october to november 2018 saw the tgd lose roughly 12 a similar drop today again keeps the tgd in the 176 180 zone source www stockcharts com have oil prices reached their limit that s the question we are asking as oil prices faltered this past week and wti oil closed the week lower off 2 6 energy stock prices however bucked the downward trend of oil as the u s oil gas index xoi was up a small 0 1 on the week and the tsx energy index rose 1 7 despite the small gain for the xoi the index is wedged in a triangular box just the same as that seen for wti oil if we create a bear channel for both wti oil and the xoi by joining up the lows indicated above then by drawing a parallel line off the top we can see that both oil and the xoi have some potential to move a little higher in the channel failure to do so would actually be bearish wti oil needs to break out over 60 to suggest that higher prices are possible while the xoi needs to breakout over 1375 a breakdown under 52 for wti oil would be negative under 51 would suggest that wti oil could go back down to test the lows at 42 35 chart of the week source www visualcapitalist com visual capitalist featured this rather interesting chart about stock buybacks this past week we are afraid the quality of the chart does not translate well when we took it from them and pasted it into our article the entire chart is available at highlights are as follows stock buybacks shot to over 1 trillion in 2018 stock buybacks have been rising over time they were not a significant factor during the 1980s nor the 1990s they rose sharply in the early 2000s especially from 2005 to 2009 peaking in 2007 at over 800 billion by 2009 stock buybacks had dwindled to less than 200 billion given the record amount of stock buybacks that occurred in 2018 they were almost the only thing keeping the stock market afloat when president trump signed the tax cuts and jobs act companies repatriated some 2 6 trillion of cash that was being held in foreign countries outside the u s the funds were largely used to buy back stocks as a result of the corporate stock buybacks the main beneficiaries were shareholders as few jobs were created as a result of the buybacks shareholders received over 60 of the benefits from stock buybacks while only 20 went to job creation workers received a paltry 6 of the distributions companies that bought back their stocks outperformed the s p 500 the pros of stock buybacks are that if they are done rationally buybacks like dividends are just another way to return cash to shareholders stock prices for companies that have bought back shares are also higher in general than other companies on major indices like the s p 500 the cons of stock buybacks are that they increase inequality and that executives make short term oriented decisions around buybacks that allow them to maximize personal gain in other words when a company probably should be investing in its people or its business the company is instead giving money back to the wealthy owners and only they benefit companies not only used repatriated funds to buy back their stocks but they also borrowed heavily to buy back shares when the market tops and their stock begins to fall they still have to pay back the debt many companies are now finding themselves in that situation having spent all the repatriated funds along with borrowed funds companies are now running out of

04 03 2019 listen there have been many debates on radio and tv as to why the cedi has fallen sharply over the last 7 months or so many of the commentators who have appeared have blamed everything under the sun from the so called trade war between the us and china through to mis management of the economy through to the change in government both the ndc and npp since the re denomination of the cedi in 2007 have failed to manage the economy adequately and both have been inconpetent in managing the economy that has led to the cedi spiralling dangerously out of control both point to low inflation and interest rates and so called foreign direct investment but these do not necessarily put food on the table of the average ghanaian nor do they make the standard of living any better for the ghanaian as a whole in terms of real wage increase and quality of life there are many reasons why the cedi is experiencing such extreme difficulties and will continue to do so unless radical measures like scrapping tax exemptions and eradicating the dollarization of the economy are put in place from my humble perspective as someone who predicted the 5 cedi to a dollar years ago here are some of the reasons why the cedi is falling the first reason why the cedi is falling is because of the serious balance of payments deficit that is facing the nation briefly the balance of payments is the difference between what ghana imports and what it exports because of the free market policies that have been adopted by governments since the late 1980 s ghana is a net importer what this means in simple terms is that ghana now imports everything under the sun from toothpaste to tomato paste through to rice luxury cars and crucially oil oil is the main import expenditure that ghana faces but before we tackle the oil issue food for thought ghana used to be a rice producer but due to free market policies ghana has abandoned its once thriving rice industry in the process leaving thousands unemployed and is now a chief importer of rice worth up to 1 billion us dollars a year just imagine what a fraction of that could do to the economy of ghana if it was invested into the local rice industry now oil ghana is supposedly an oil producing country but because of greed and corruption of the highest order please watch if you can a very powerful documentary called big men that looks into corruption in the oil industry in ghana ghana has to import billions of dollars worth of oil annually in order to support both commercial and domestic use oil is a major chunk of the importation bill and because oil is priced in us it puts a huge strain on the value of the local currency but the oil has become a burden rather than a blessing as the vast receipts from oil go outside the country ghana s main exports i e what it sells to the rest of the world are gold timber cocoa bauxite and some agriculture products which as the twin result of low commodity prices and low royalty payments based on biased and greedy one sided deals by western multi national means that ghana receives very little in export earnings so since we import virtually everything that has to be paid in us dollars it is having an enormous strain on the economy because ghana has to buy us dollars with its cedis to pay the importer therefore unless we reduce significantly our balance of trade deficit that is currently in the tens of billions of us dollars the cedi will always fall reducing our import bill will also help the local economy because it will create self reliance by creating jobs at home for the ordinary ghanaian in the case of producing our own rice rather than giving other people jobs by importing rice nana akufo addo s one district one factory policy won t work either because most of the factories being built are going to owned by non ghanaians who will take their profits outside of the country where if the factories were owned by ghanaians the profits would stay in ghana and thus boost the coffers of the ghanaian treasury perhaps the biggest reason why the cedi is falling and this is not what a single commentator has said is that as a country we do not have any gold bars in reserves in economics it is common that when a country s currency is under attack the first thing that a country does to protect its currency is to use its gold reserves during the financial crisis of 2008 in the uk the uk had to bailout the banks like royal bank of scotland rbs to the tune of tens of billions of pounds the then prime minster gordon brown used some of the uk s huge gold reserves as collateral to bail out some of the biggest british banks like royal bank of scotland barclays and lloyds if britain under gordon brown had not done this the british economy would have been bankrupt and this shows you the power of having gold bars in reserve in actual fact how many ghanaians are aware that before this paper money system i e pounds dollars euros etc gold was the main standard of currency and because in europe and america there is a lack of gold they invented paper money to ensure they were able to control the global economic system that now prevails it was because of the enormous gold reserves that libya had that made the late general gaddafi think of setting up the african gold dinar and central reserve bank as mechanism for african self development self determination and economic freedom and this is the real reason why gaddafi was taken out by the white man because the african gold dinar and central reserve bank was a big threat to the white man s survival and dominance over african countries in the case of ghana again as a result of free market policies adopted by the previous rawlings atta mills and mahama ndc governments and the npp kufuor administration ghana virtually sold off all its gold reserves to foreign multi national gold mining companies as a result of this ill advised policy ghana virtually has no gold reserves this lack of gold reserves is the chief reason why the cedi is in free fall because gold is used to strengthen a country s currency in difficult periods such as what the cedi is currently facing in the absence of gold bar reserves to prop up the cedi the government has taken steps such as acquiring finance from the imf world bank to buy us dollars to prop up the cedi another reason why the cedi is falling rapidly is that as a country we do not make anything in the days of ghana s first president osagyefo dr kwame nkrumah ghana had over 500 factories that was producing radio s televisions fridges toothpicks watches floor tiles tyres shoes and so forth because of the inability by ghanaians to manage these industries properly coupled with nefarious so called trade liberalization economic policies imposed on ghana by the breton woods institutions post 1966 ghana is now a net importer of these very goods that it was once making so as a country we must begin the re industrialization process and start to make things that are owned and managed by ghanaians for export that would bring in much needed foreign exchange keep the profits in ghana and more importantly create much needed employment for our people and in the process significantly reduce the teeming unemployed also capital flight is another issue that is affecting our currency this capital flight is when multi national companies take their massive profits outside of ghana and put them in off shore accounts thus denying the government of ghana urgent foreign exchange revenue to combat this ghana should have a policy that restricts money going out of the country so this is the crisis that is facing the ghanaian economy which is why the cedi is in free fall and this is the reality both the npp and ndc have failed to solve due to their incompetence unless as a nation we curve our importation of foreign goods start to re industrialize ghana by producing goods and services owned and managed by us stop capital flight by taxing some of these multi national companies and take active steps to acquire substantive gold reserves by getting more revenue from our gold our currency will always be at the mercy of currency speculators in the money markets and be in terminal decline and there is nothing the bank of ghana can do about it
we have written numerous articles about capital consumption our monetary system has a falling interest rate which causes both capital churn and conversion of one party s wealth into another s income it also has too low interest which encourages borrowing to consume which as everyone knows adds to gross domestic product gdp what is capital at the same time of course entrepreneurs are creating new capital keith wrote an article for forbes showing the incredible drop in wages from 1965 to 2011 there was not a revolution because prices of goods such as milk dropped at nearly the same rate the real price of milk dropped as much as it did because of increased efficiency in production the word for that which enables an increase in efficiency is capital or to put it another way capital provides leverage for productive human effort we don t work any harder today than they did in the ancient world probably less hard but we are much richer we produce a lot more the difference is capital they had not accumulated much capital so they were limited to brute labor to a degree which we would find shocking today we have long had machine power to do most of the heavy lifting for a few decades we have had computers to perform much of the tedious number crunching you would be surprised how much number crunching is involved in typing an article in a word processor and computers also automate everything from manufacturing lines to business processes more recently mobile computers and wireless networks have allowed us to efficiently organize markets index a big fraction of everything ever published and allocate resources such as cars to pick us up wherever we may be and drop us off somewhere else related italy s 1 7 trillion debt could threaten the eu capital allows us to do more with less this principle applies to commodities as well as labor a smartphone is a supercomputer but it requires very little silicon and copper compared to the original generation for example the cray 1 weighed over 5 tons and consumed 115kw that s over 30 000 times heavier than a samsung galaxy s9 and over 200 000 times as much power consumption and for comparison the s9 can perform over 4 500 times as many calculations per second dairy production underwent a similar if smaller revolution more cows could be supported on the same land with more milk from each cow and less labor per cow this is all thanks to better breeding computer tracking customized individual feed control and even automated rotating milk stations in the barn the race we have just described what computer software developers would call a race condition two processes capital destruction and capital creation are both running in the economy the outcome of a race conditions will either be great or terrible depending on which process is faster there is method to our madness in formulating it this way we will get to that below we want to first observe another problem with gdp who cares about the overall size of the economy it s not the gross size that matters to anyone of what benefit is it to know that aggregate size is up 10 percent what if the population is up 11 percent it could mean that each person is slightly worse off than before but there are more people and folks it is by such low resolution pictures that central planners attempt to perform their magic once again we see the breakdown of a macroeconomic statistic it does not even tell us what it nominally pun intended promises and it is useless as a planning tool anyways so how would one look at economic growth and to get back to our theme how would one measure whether capital creation or capital destruction is winning the problem with gdp a naïve first attempt might be to divide gdp by population there that addresses keith s complaint that population growth could mask a per capita decline maybe but we cannot just assume a quantity theory of economic activity eating the seed corn does indeed add to gdp borrowing to consume borrowing to finance ultimately unproductive assets adds to gdp at least for a time we could also partially address the concern that gdp overstates consumption by using a relatively new measure called gross output proposed by economist mark skousen gross output is a broader measure that also includes sales of goods which are used as inputs by other industries here is a graph showing gdp and gross output as gross output is considerably greater than gdp we have scaled them to fill the vertical space in the graph click to enlarge it looks a lot like gdp with more volatility which skousen acknowledges therefore for our purposes measuring true economic growth without distortion from malinvestment it is not helpful perhaps someone would study the spread of gross output gdp a cursory look below shows it to be generally growing except for a big dip around the global financial crisis and a smaller dip around 2015 click to enlarge we have not given it a great deal of thought but if we had to guess we would assume that this is showing another view of the long term falling interest rate trend that is lower interest rates stimulate investment in higher order goods which are intermediate goods used to produce consumer goods or goods used to produce goods which are used to produce goods which produce consumer goods etc if a business does not want to borrow at 10 percent it may be tempted by 9 percent 8 percent or 7 percent and when it borrows it buys the sorts of goods that are included in gross output but excluded from gdp anyways to look at true economic growth stripped of the faux growth fueled by dirt cheap credit made dirtier cheaper by ongoing central bank policy we need another approach this will help us answer the question of whether creation or destruction is winning carl menger the founder of the austrian school taught us to look for a change at the margin marginal productivity of debt change in what that is the key question keith has proposed marginal productivity of debt this does not look at gross economic activity nor does it divide it by population nor even debt it looks at the marginal increase of gdp we could use gross output but gdp data is available for many more decades compared to marginal increase in total not just government debt how much additional economic activity does a newly borrowed dollar buy here is the graph click to enlarge what is this graph telling us yes the slope is down and it is a very long term trend we mean our question in the context of economic growth and the race between capital creation and capital destruction it is directly saying that we get less and less economic activity juice for every newly borrowed dollar of debt squeeze this is alarming and we ve written about it before but today we have another focus this shows the results of the race alas capital creation is losing to understand why we need to introduce a new concept which we will do next week supply and demand fundamentals the prices of gold and silver fell 35 and 70 respectively but what does that mean other than woe unto anyone who owned silver futures with leverage the s p 500 index and the euro was up a bit though the yuan was flat and copper was down most notably the spread between treasury and junk yields fell if the central banks can lower the risk of default premium they can make everything unicorns and rainbows again extend the aging boom a while longer related tech giants lead renewable push the bank for international settlements defines a zombie corporation as one that s been around for at least 10 years and which has an interest coverage ratio less than one for three years in a row in other words mature firms with profits interest expense as of 2016 zombies were over 12 percent of all public nonfinancial firms the central planners think to get gdp to go up well zombie firms certainly consume so keeping them alive would seem to support this goal plus they employ people wall street certainly does not object partisans of whichever party has sent its leader to the white house also want rising gdp so the fed finds ways to keep zombies alive since zombies exist only by the grace of ever lower interest rates and ever more promiscuous credit conditions the central bank must find a way to lower rates and push investors out on the risk curve they succeeded this week short term interest rates were down rates on junk bonds fell also but treasury yields and aaa corporate bond yields were up oh well you can t have it all actually the absolute level is not the only thing that matters the spread between junk and aaa or treasuries also matters this is a measure of stress at the margin and also the penalty that junk firms must pay compared to competing firms one of the perennial criticisms of the austrian school is that we don t offer a precise prediction of timing and a number of folks have tried to predict timing and have been wrong we think this criticism misses the point if a process is destructive of firms there is value in identifying it clearly of shining a spotlight on it of bellowing from the rooftops sure it would be good to be able to say june 4 at 11 22am is when it will begin but absent that kind of precise timing we can still be sure that a destructive process is ongoing and the response but rising gdp is no response to this allegation we also think that the fed is in a pickle to keep the zombies adequately fed with the blood of the savers it can never be said too often it has to lower rates however what conventional theory can justify this we have heard some noise faint so far that there s no inflation so therefore they have more latitude etc and we are not even talking about the so called modern monetary theory now being pushed from the left of course there are scant signs of rising prices other than where tax and regulation force up retail prices lower rates means hamburger chains can borrow more to open up more hamburger restaurants manufacturers of kitchen equipment can borrow more to expand production of hamburger grills the result is greater supply of burgers soft prices and falling profit margins not inflation we saw a discussion amongst austrian economists recently about whether or not one should own gold yes gold is not an investment so why own it if the fed has driven the risk yield of all investments down where is your line where do you choose not to be invested we have said many times that the fed cares not about the price of gold its officials would have no reason to incur career risk or prison time to manipulate the price even if they had the means but here is one area where they care about not price of gold per se but attractiveness of investment if investors expect flat to negative returns then they must turn to gold as the only alternative if you cannot get return on capital then you at least want return of capital this is not what the fed wants what wall street wants what warren buffet wants or what most investors want it s a scenario where few firms make money many lose money and increasing numbers at the margin go under and few investors stay even it will be a scenario like 2008 when it comes we have a tool to help predict it the gold basis is it a good thing or a bad thing that our indicator is not now flashing red alert let s look at the only true picture of the supply and demand fundamentals of gold and silver but first here is the chart of the prices of gold and silver click to enlarge next this is a graph of the gold price measured in silver otherwise known as the gold to silver ratio see here for an explanation of bid and offer prices for the ratio it was up a point and a half this week click to enlarge here is the gold graph showing gold basis cobasis and the price of the dollar in terms of gold price click to enlarge well we broke a month long streak of rising gold prices this week actually starting midweek last week the price of gold began falling along with this we see a big rise in the scarcity of the metal i e cobasis at least in the april contract the gold basis continuous is up only slightly this shows a selloff of both metal and futures the monetary metals gold fundamental price is up marginally to 1 421 now let s look at silver the price of silver dropped by a much greater percentage we can see the dollar rose from 1 93g silver to 2 01 grams and we see a big rise in the cobasis along with the price move but as with gold the silver basis continuous shows no real move still the monetary metals silver fundamental price is down 29 to 16 16 by keith weiner more top reads from safehaven com

depending on which process is faster there is method to our madness in formulating it this way we will get to that below we want to first observe another problem with gdp who cares about the overall size of the economy it s not the gross size that matters to anyone of what benefit is it to know that aggregate size is up 10 what if population is up 11 it could mean that each person is slightly worse off than before but there are more people and folks it is by such low resolution pictures that central planners attempt to perform their magic once again we see the breakdown of a macroeconomic statistic it does not even tell us what it nominally pun intended promises and it is useless as a planning tool anyways so how would one look at economic growth and to get back to our theme how would one measure whether capital creation or capital destruction is winning the problem with gdp a na ve first attempt might be to divide gdp by population there that addresses keith s complaint that population growth could mask a per capita decline maybe but we cannot just assume a quantity theory of economic activity eating the seed corn does indeed add to gdp borrowing to consume borrowing to finance ultimately unproductive assets adds to gdp at least for a time we could also partially address the concern that gdp overstates consumption by using a relatively new measure called gross output proposed by economist mark skousen gross output is a broader measure that also includes sales of goods which are used as inputs by other industries here is a graph showing gdp and gross output as gross output is considerably greater than gdp we have scaled them to fill the vertical space in the graph it looks a lot like gdp with more volatility which skousen acknowledges therefore for our purposes measuring true economic growth without distortion from malinvestment it is not helpful perhaps someone would study the spread of gross output gdp a cursory look below shows it to be generally growing except for a big dip around the global financial crisis and a smaller dip around 2015 we have not given it a great deal of thought but if we had to guess we would assume that this is showing another view of the long term falling interest rate trend that is lower interest rates stimulate investment in higher order goods which are intermediate goods used to produce consumer goods or goods used to produce goods which are used to produce goods which produce consumer goods etc if a business does not want to borrow at 10 it may be tempted by 9 8 or 7 and when it borrows it buys the sorts of goods that are included in gross output but excluded from gdp anyways to look at true economic growth stripped of the faux growth fueled by dirt cheap credit made dirtier cheaper by ongoing central bank policy we need another approach this will help us answer the question of whether creation or destruction is winning carl menger the founder of the austrian school taught us to look for change at the margin marginal productivity of debt change in what that is the key question keith has proposed marginal productivity of debt this does not look at gross economic activity nor does it divide it by population nor even debt it looks at the marginal increase of gdp we could use gross output but gdp data is available for many more decades compared to marginal increase in total not just government debt how much additional economic activity does a newly borrowed dollar buy here is the graph what is this graph telling us yes the slope is down and it is a very long term trend we mean our question in the context of economic growth and the race between capital creation and capital destruction it is directly saying that we get less and less economic activity juice for every newly borrowed dollar of debt squeeze this is alarming and we ve written about it before but today we have another focus this grow shows the results of the race alas capital creation is losing to understand why we need to introduce a new concept which we will do next week supply and demand fundamentals the prices of gold and silver fell 35 and 70 respectively but what does that mean other than woe unto anyone who owned silver futures with leverage the s p 500 index and the euro was up a bit though the yuan was flat and copper was down most notably the spread between treasury and junk yields fell if the central banks can lower the risk of default premium they can make everything unicorns and rainbows again extend the aging boom a while longer the bank for international settlements defines a zombie corporation as one that s been around for at least 10 years and which has an interest coverage ratio less than one for three years in a row in other words mature firms with profits interest expense as of 2016 zombies were over 12 of all public nonfinancial firms the central planners think to get gdp to go up well zombie firms certainly consume so keeping them alive would seem to support this goal plus they employ people wall street certainly does not object partisans of whichever party has sent its leader to the white house also want rising gdp so the fed finds ways to keep zombies alive since zombies exist only by the grace of ever lower interest rates and ever more promiscuous credit conditions the central bank must find a way to lower rates and push investors out on the risk curve they succeeded this week short term interest rates were down rates on junk bonds fell also but treasury yields and aaa corporate bond yields were up oh well you can t have it all actually the absolute level is not the only thing that matters the spread between junk and aaa or treasurys also matters this is a measure of stress at the margin and also the penalty that junk firms must pay compared to competing firms one of the perennial criticisms of the austrian school is that we don t offer a precise prediction of timing and a number of folks have tried to predict timing and have been wrong we think this criticism misses the point if a process is destructive of firms there is value in identifying it clearly of shining a spotlight on it of bellowing from the rooftops sure it would be good to be able to say june 4 at 11 22am is when it will begin but absent that kind of precise timing we can still be sure that a destructive process is ongoing and the response but rising gdp is no response to this allegation we also think that the fed is in a pickle to keep the zombies adequately fed with the blood of the savers it can never be said too often it has to lower rates however what conventional theory can justify this we have heard some noise faint so far that there s no inflation so therefore they have more latitude etc and we are not even talking about the so called modern monetary theory now being pushed from the left of course there s scant signs of rising prices other than where tax and regulation force up retail prices lower rates means hamburger chains can borrow more to open up more hamburger restaurants manufacturers of kitchen equipment can borrow more to expand production of hamburger grills the result is greater supply of burgers soft prices and falling profit margins not inflation we saw a discussion amongst austrian economists recently about whether or not one should own gold yes gold is not an investment so why own it if the fed has driven the risk yield of all investments down where is your line where do you choose not to be invested we have said many times that the fed cares not about the price of gold its officials would have no reason to incur career risk or prison time to manipulate the price even if they had the means but here is one area where they care about not price of gold per se but attractiveness of investment if investors expect flat to negative returns then they must turn to gold as the only alternative if you cannot get return on capital then you at least want return of capital this is not what the fed wants what wall street wants what warren buffet wants or what most investors want it s a scenario where few firms make money many lose money and increasing numbers at the margin go under and few investors stay even it will be a scenario like 2008 when it comes we have a tool to help predict it the gold basis is it a good thing or a bad thing that our indicator is not now flashing red alert let s look at the only true picture of the supply and demand fundamentals of gold and silver but first here is the chart of the prices of gold and silver next this is a graph of the gold price measured in silver otherwise known as the gold to silver ratio see here for an explanation of bid and offer prices for the ratio it was up a point and a half this week here is the gold graph showing gold basis cobasis and the price of the dollar in terms of gold price well we broke a month long streak of rising gold prices this week actually starting midweek last week the price of gold began falling along with this we see a big rise in the scarcity of the metal i e cobasis at least in the april contract the gold basis continuous is up only slightly this shows a selloff of both metal and futures the monetary metals gold fundamental price is up marginally to 1 421 now let s look at silver the price of silver dropped by a much greater percentage we can see the dollar rose from 1 93g silver to 2 01 grams and we see a big rise in the cobasis along with the price move but as with gold the silver basis continuous shows no real move still the monetary metals silver fundamental price is down 29 to 16 16 2019 monetary metals digg

briefing highlights canadian dollar bulls crushed what to expect from bank of canada markets at a glance newmont rejects barrick bid what to expect in jobs trade reports what else to watch for this week from today s globe and mail crushed canadian dollar bulls open a new week having been crushed by friday s economic numbers and they re likely to get little support from the bank of canada when it releases its mid week rate decision the loonie tumbled friday when statistics canada reported a mild contraction in gross domestic product in december and exceptionally weak fourth quarter economic growth at an annual pace of just 0 4 per cent adding a little spice was the fact that as the globe and mail s david parkinson reports the federal statistics agency accidentally released some of the key numbers before the set time meaning the loonie sank earlier than it otherwise would have economists don t believe the current quarter is shaping up to be all that great either for that matter as bank of nova scotia currency strategists put it the loonie bulls got slaughtered by the awful fourth quarter measure and ahead of the bank of canada s rate decision wednesday when it s expected to hold its benchmark at 1 75 per cent in this soft economic climate the currency s fortunes will rest on what the central bank says in its accompanying statement specifically in what it suggests for its rate path as higher rates make the loonie more attractive open this photo in gallery bank of canada governor stephen polozsean kilpatrick the canadian press governor stephen poloz and his bank of canada colleagues have signalled a pause in their rate hiking cycle but have still suggested that the benchmark will have to rise down the road observers meanwhile have scaled back their expectations for increases some even suggesting the central bank may have to trim its key overnight rate so the tone of wednesday s statement and a speech to a business audience thursday by central bank deputy governor lynn patterson will be widely watched a boc hold is widely anticipated on wednesday and the statement tone will need to balance the recovery in crude prices and the moderation in global growth concerns against a weaker domestic story said shaun osborne scotiabank s chief foreign exchange strategist and his colleague strategist eric theoret the bank s cautiously optimistic message is at risk however the characterization of growth will be key as policy makers speak to their outlook they added in a report on friday s loonie action boc deputy governor patterson s economic progress report will be critical benjamin reitzes bank of montreal s canadian rates and macro strategist expects the central bank to sound a bit more cautious this week however don t expect poloz to be overly negative as growth is expected to rebound in q2 he added given the weaker growth backdrop with the trade and housing uncertainties unlikely to be resolved we look for the boc to be on hold through most of this year capital economics in turn believes the central central bank is done raising rates and indeed will have to backtrack on its earlier increases despite poloz s pledge we do not expect any more rate hikes in this cycle its economists said in a report market pricing implies that investors agree although they have yet to come round to our view that the bank s next move will be a cut we ve pencilled this in for the end of the year and thus it becomes a key period for the canadian dollar scotiabank s fair value estimate puts the loonie versus the u s dollar at just over 74 us cents and reflects the tug of war between supportive commodity prices and a bearish outlook for relative central bank policy besides interest rates crude prices can be key to the loonie s value given the importance of oil to the canadian economy the currency is in a vortex said analysts at bank of america merrill lynch who recently revised their forecast for the loonie which they now expect to sit at about 73 5 us cents at the end of the year this new view from carlos capistran the bank s canada and mexico economist foreign exchange strategist ben randol and rates strategist olivia lima is based on expectations of a contentious path to bringing the proposed new north american free trade pact into force which will speed up capital outflow from the country but also at play is the possibility that central bank rates in canada and the u s could diverge further over all with canada being vulnerable to multiple negative shocks and given the continuously deteriorating balance of payments flow

overall economic growth targets they added the legislature is also scheduled to review a draft law protecting the intellectual property of foreign investors and banning forced technology transfers which are two of washington s key demands in its trade dispute with beijing and it s always worth watching what australia s central bank has to say particularly given the similarities in the canadian and australian economies the reserve bank of australia is expected to hold its key rate at 1 5 per cent having already warned of global trade threats the country did well during the commodity supercycle and benefited greatly from china s enormous appetite for minerals said cmc markets analyst david madden now that china appears to be slowing australian growth has also cooled he added the rba trimmed rates in recent years to adjust to the slowdown in growth but that sent house prices in australia s major cities sky high house prices have fallen in the past year so a rate hike is the last thing the australian property market needs and the rba is all too aware of this hey talk about similarities also on tap are quarterly results from aecon group inc and great canadian gaming corp

germany faces the risk of steep us tariffs on cars and a no deal brexit a double whammy which could bring a golden decade of growth in europe s powerhouse economy to an end chancellor angela merkel and her ministers are working behind the scenes to mitigate the impact should the worst case scenario come to pass a stagnating german economy or even a recession would hold back the euro zone as a whole and cast uncertainty over the european central bank s planned exit from its loose monetary policy the berlin government is already facing a budget shortfall of up to 25 billion euros by 2023 as the economic slowdown means tax revenues will come in below previous estimates according to a finance ministry document nonetheless faced with the threat of a recession finance minister olaf scholz is prepared to bend germany s strict debt rules a senior government official told reuters on condition of anonymity if the double whammy should materialise we want to pull something out of the hat the official said suggesting that the government is working on a fiscal stimulus package this will be a test to our policy of no new debt and germany s debt brake the official added the finance ministry declined to comment on this germany which barely avoided a recession last year is especially vulnerable to both the risks of us tariffs of up to 25 per cent on cars and britain sliding out of the eu on march 29 without a deal to govern future trade relations with the bloc exports make up nearly half of its economic output and cars are by far its main export with annual sales worth 230 billion euros 263 billion data from the federal statistics office showed the most important export destination for german cars last year was the united states with revenues of 27 2 billion euros followed by china with 24 7 billion euros and britain with 22 5 billion euros the data showed in terms of the number of exported cars britain tops the list with 666 000 and the united states is second with 470 000 according to data from the vda industry association president donald trump pursuing an america first agenda has repeatedly criticised germany s bumper trade surplus and warned that washington will impose tariffs on european cars if it is unable to reach a trade deal with the european union a confidential report by the us commerce department sent to president trump in mid february is widely expected to pave the way to impose duties on imported autos and auto parts by designating them a threat to american national security trump had 90 days to decide whether to act upon the recommendations until mid may a no deal brexit meanwhile would see britain falling back to the status of a third country under the rules of the world trade organisation wto this would push up british import tariffs for german cars to roughly 10pc for trucks and pick ups tariffs of up to 22pc would apply customs inspections at ports and borders are likely to disrupt just in time delivery chains a no deal scenario would be serious and entail significant risks for companies and employees in the eu 27 a vda spokesman said massive impairments in logistics and high customs costs would be the result vicious cycle if both scenarios become reality the combined impact could chop off up to 0 7 percentage points from germany s gross domestic product gdp growth in the long term separate estimates from commerzbank and the ifo institute show the german government already expects gdp growth to slow to 1pc this year from 1 4pc in 2018 but this forecast is built on the assumption that an escalation of the us trade dispute and a no deal brexit can be avoided in case of a disorderly brexit there will be short term negative effects such as increased uncertainty and adjustment processes though these are hard to quantify an economy ministry spokesman said however studies estimate that a no deal brexit would cost germany 0 2 percentage points of growth a year in the long term the spokesman added he declined to quantify the expected damage of higher us tariffs for german cars the goal of the eu and the german government is to seal a trade deal with the us that lowers tariffs for industrial goods on both sides the spokesman said volkswagen s chief executive herbert diess said in a financial times interview last week that higher us tariffs could cost the automaker up to 2 5bn euros a year this would be roughly 13pc of vw s expected earnings in 2019 german car exports to the united states could fall by almost 50pc in the long term if trump was to impose car tariffs of 25pc the ifo institute has estimated this would reduce german gdp growth by roughly 0 5 percentage points commerzbank economist joerg kraemer said for the german economy as a whole higher us tariffs and a no deal brexit together would also hit business sentiment and consumer morale which could throw the economy into a vicious cycle economists say household spending the most important pillar of the domestic economy could falter if uncertainty about the economy spilled over onto the labour market rolf buerkl from the gfk research group warned if employees get the impression during the course of the year that their jobs are no longer secure this would have a direct negative effect on the consumer mood buerkl said less growth also means less tax revenues which limits the government s ability to put together a huge fiscal stimulus package that could pull the economy out of a downward spiral scholz is currently working on a draft law that aims to support companies investing in research and development with 5bn euros 5 7bn in tax incentives over four years coalition sources told reuters on thursday the plan will be financed through the expected budget surplus narrowing the room for any additional measures if the government wants to present new fiscal measures to counter a recession then it only has two options either hiking taxes or taking on new debt a lawmaker in merkel s ruling coalition said on condition of anonymity published in dawn the business and finance weekly march 4th 2019
march 4 2019 the streets of haiti may be quiet for now but as ashley smith explains the desire to hold haiti s rulers accountable is felt intensely by millions of people the haitian masses have mobilized a new wave of protest against the corrupt government of president jovenel moïse it began with demonstrations last summer in july and august re emerged in november and december and exploded again in the first two weeks of february when hundreds of thousands marched in all the major cities of the country from the capital of port au prince to the northern city of cap haïtien the demonstrators demanded an investigation into what happened to billions of dollars of funds from venezuela an end to austerity measures and price increases for basic goods and the resignation of moïse and his prime minister jean henry céant the government predictably responded with a combination of concessions and repression it rescinded the price increases and promised investigations into corruption but neither moïse nor céant agreed to step down protesters take part in anti government demonstrations in port au prince at the same time the police and army backed up by the un forces nominally in haiti to ensure peace cracked down on the protests killing 26 people and injuring 77 since february 7 taking the long view of this crisis the uprising is the latest example of revolt against the strategies pursued by great empires since haiti s birth as an independent nation state more than two centuries ago in the more recent past american imperialism s imposition of neoliberal structural adjustment programs on haiti in the 1980s followed by two u s backed coups against former president jean bertrand aristide undermined the project of social reform to address the country s deep social inequality now those grievances are again bursting out into the open the slave revolution led by toussaint l ouverture succeeded in driving out haiti s french masters in 1804 and fending off britain and spain and yet imperialism would not leave haiti alone though the world s imperial powers couldn t directly colonize haiti they could compel the free black republic to pay an enormous price for its liberation isolating it from the world economy and in the case of france forcing haiti to pay 21 billion in today s dollars for the loss of its slaves these powers also meddled in haitian politics backing different factions of the ruling class that has exploited and oppressed the country s peasantry and small working class for the last two centuries the u s repeatedly invaded the country to back up its handpicked autocrats occupying from 1915 to 1934 and creating a domestic military force with the sole purpose of repressing the haitian masses during the cold war the u s supported the brutal regime of françois papa doc duvalier as an ally against castro s cuba he ruled the country through terror enforced by his own paramilitary force the ton ton macoutes after papa doc s death in 1971 the u s backed his son and anointed successor jean claude baby doc duvalier this father son dictatorship killed between 30 000 and 60 000 people in order to cement its rule over the course of nearly 30 years under the influence of washington in the 1980s baby doc implemented a neoliberal economic program with the aim of turning the country into a giant export processing zone based on exploitation of workers drawn out of the peasant majority and into the cities these plans for sweatshop development failed triggering a mass movement called lavalas that drove baby doc from the country and eventually led to elections in 1991 won by liberation theologist and leader of the struggle jean bertrand aristide he and his party fanmi lavalas hoped to implement a program of social democratic reforms to alleviate the country s desperate poverty but the u s and haiti s ruling class united against him with the military staging a coup that drove aristide into exile after protests within haiti and internationally the u s returned aristide to power but on the condition that he agree to implement washington s neoliberal program count years lost to the coup as part of his term and agree to step down in 1996 while aristide succeeded in abolishing the despised haitian army and did resist some of washington s neoliberal dictates he implemented other parts of them and so did his successor and ally rené préval who governed until aristide won re election in 2001 back in office he continued to advocate redistribution of wealth and demand reparations from france for the debt imposed on haiti after the revolution but he was unable to implement many reforms and many in his government became corrupt leading to mass disillusionment with his rule the haitian ruling class and the right took advantage of this to stage a campaign of destabilization then in 2004 with the country reeling the u s kidnapped aristide and forced him into exile after this second coup washington and its allies deployed un forces to occupy the country from 2004 until 2017 when they were replaced with a smaller force assigned supposedly to ensure the rule of law when new elections were held in 2006 préval again won but he at best implemented neoliberalism with a human face failing to enact any significant reforms in the interests of the masses as a result the country s workers the urban poor and peasants have suffered ever worsening poverty the world bank estimates that 59 percent of the nation s 10 5 million people live below the official poverty line of 2 41 a day while a shocking 24 percent survive in extreme poverty defined as less than 1 23 a day and with such poverty comes hunger so pervasive that usaid estimates half the population is undernourished then in 2010 a devastating earthquake struck flattening whole sections of port au prince where housing had been built with next to no regulation in accordance with neoliberal doctrine the haitian government estimated that the quake killed 300 000 people while other analysts put the total at about 100 000 more than 1 3 million people were displaced and close to 40 000 were still living in camps as of 18 months ago on top of that three hurricanes thomas in 2010 sandy in 2012 and matthew in 2016 swept through the country destroying villages farmlands and whole sections of cities with devastating floods matthew was the worst it killed 546 people displaced 175 500 and pushed 806 000 into extreme food insecurity the social conditions wrought by imperialism and the haitian ruling class turned a series of natural disasters into a social catastrophe the u s and other international donors disbursed 10 billion in foreign assistance and promised in the words of bill clinton to build back better instead they betrayed the country and its people the biggest scandal centered on the red cross which raised half a billion dollars from appeals and claimed to have built homes for 130 000 people after the earthquake but as an investigation by propublica and npr proved only six permanent homes were built aid largely bypassed the haitian state and ended up in the coffers of international ngos most based in washington and other imperial cities as a result the haitian state was incapacitated and private services provided by international and local agencies proliferated to such an extent that haiti has been called the republic of ngos the development that did happen merely laid out the red carpet for the predatory tourist industry and established new sweatshop complexes even much of that failed to materialize and the un which had promised to provide disaster relief behaved as its critics predicted like an occupying army repressing protests by a desperate population worst of all un troops introduced cholera into the country for the first time a fact the un denied until 2016 the ensuing epidemic killed 10 000 people and only recently subsided abandoned betrayed and disillusioned the haitian masses largely sat out a series of elections that brought american backed neoliberal puppets to power michel martelly a former kompa singer nicknamed sweet micky narrowly won an election riddled with controversy ruled as a neoliberal technocrat and restored the dreaded haitian army with the sole purpose of domestic repression he handpicked his successor moïse a businessman whose most recent enterprise is a failed export oriented banana plantation moïse won the presidency in 2016 with only 18 percent of voters participating in the election martelly and moïse proved themselves venal rulers who plundered the state coffers for their own enrichment they saw an opportunity in venezuela s petrocaribe alliance flush with money from high oil prices at the time hugo chávez launched it in 2005 to promote a regional reformist strategy of state led capitalist development as an alternative to washington s neoliberal consensus venezuela sold oil to 12 caribbean countries at 60 percent of the market rate with the remaining 40 percent paid for by long term low interest loans to the consternation of the u s haiti joined petrocaribe in 2007 then president préval promised to use the 4 billion in credit to build hospitals schools and roads however the corrupt governments led by martelly and moïse gobbled up more than 2 billion of the funds for themselves and their cronies the scandal became public when a haitian senate commission published a 650 page investigative report on the petrocaribe program according to the new york times it implicated much of haiti s political class in inflating government contracts funneling money to ghost companies and a host of other financial improprieties after oil prices collapsed venezuela entered a crisis of its own which was further compounded by u s sanctions the crisis brought the petrocaribe program to a close and left haiti billions of dollars in debt to venezuela desperate for funds the haitian state turned to the imf last year for a 96 million loan which unsurprisingly came with neoliberal strings attached it required haiti to cut its fuel subsidy and sell it at prevailing market prices immediately jacking up gas prices by 50 percent predictably this inflamed an already rising inflation rate with prices increasing by double digit percentages each year since 2014 putting all kinds of basic necessities out of reach for many households desperate and enraged the people of haiti want answers and they have been flooding into the streets in repeated waves of protest since last summer in february protests shut down most of the country s cities and marchers converged on moïse s house in the elite suburb of pétion ville after a guard beat a woman protester the crowd pelted his property with stones protesters are calling for the president and prime minister to resign an end to austerity measures and an investigation into the theft of the petrocaribe funds with the backing of the u s and un the haitian state responded with brutality deploying the police and army against the february demonstrations moïse refused to resign i jovenel moïse head of state will not give the country up to armed gangs and drug traffickers he declared he and céant did offer to trim their perks promised further investigations into the misspending of the petrocaribe funds increased the minimum wage and lowered prices of basic goods but who would trust this utterly corrupt regime either to investigate itself for its crimes or enact reforms in the interests of its people the rising against the government has precipitated an even deeper crisis in haitian society as imports of food distribution of water and shipments of fuel have been interrupted disgracefully novum energy which has a contract to supply fuel to the country stopped its tankers from unloading 60 000 barrels of gas and 260 000 barrels of diesel because the government was behind in payments thereby exacerbating shortages of fuel while the protests have subsided for now the haitian masses face big challenges ahead various reformists have attempted to position themselves as a credible alternative but their strategy blazed by aristide and his party fanmi lavalas hit the inevitable contradictions of trying to run capitalism with a human face under the thumb of american imperialism ominously the haitian right is also re emerging and putting itself forward as an alternative to the corrupt neoliberal rulers baby doc s son nicolas duvalier is even rumored to be considering a run for the presidency in the next election meanwhile the haitian left which struggled to position itself as a force independent of aristide s reformism is trying to rebuild itself amid the new wave of protests one thing is for sure the u s is part of the problem perhaps the most important part facing the haitian people the trump administration has proven itself utterly hypocritical it backed the current venal regime to the hilt and betrayed promises to haitians in the u s in a blatantly racist fashion trump s double standards are brazen on the one hand his administration denounces nicolás maduro in venezuela on wildly exaggerated claims while the u s plots a coup to overthrow him on the other it supports moïse s brutal and corrupt rule in haiti and thus only calls for new elections which it will rig in favor of neoliberal candidates as a face saving solution why because moïse and his ilk are useful puppets for washington s imperial ambitions including against venezuela moïse s government for example joined the u s and 17 other countries in the organization of american states in passing a resolution refusing to recognize maduro s government trump has also betrayed promises to haitians in the u s and on its border in mexico during the 2016 campaign he promised haitians that he wanted to be your greatest champion but in office he has proved himself their greatest enemy infamously in a meeting in the oval office he complained about immigrants coming from shithole countries like haiti trump rescinded temporary protected status tps to haitians which had allowed 59 000 to stay in the country since the earthquake that led to an exodus of haitians crossing into canada in the hopes of finding safe haven there while the courts have put a stay on that order those with tps still face an uncertain future moreover amid the spiraling crisis in haiti thousands have left the country for latin america and many of those have attempted to enter the u s through mexico only to be denied entry at the border haitians have become the target of anti migrant xenophobia and racism throughout the region most horrifically in the dominican republic which deported 120 000 haitians last year haiti and its people are thus caught in an organic crisis precipitated by imperialism neoliberal capitalism and the failure and collapse of reformism within the country and region nevertheless the haitian masses have yet again demonstrated their determination to fight for democracy and equality their resistance offers the country s left the opportunity to rebuild and lead a new wave of struggle amid this crisis activists in the u s must defend the right of haitians to determine their own fate including overthrowing and replacing the current corrupt neoliberal government and we must oppose the u s its imperialist allies and the un from interfering in their fight for liberation instead the u s and france should be forced to pay reparations to haiti for the debt trap in which they ensnared the country and for the neoliberal program they imposed on it so that the people have the resources to rebuild society in their own interests and we must agitate for the indefinite extension of tps for any haitians requesting it and open u s borders for haitians and all other migrants seeking safe haven we should see the haitian struggle as part of our revolutionary struggle for a new internationalist socialist society that puts people and the environment before profit

negotiator michel barnier ahead of that the telegraph reported that cox has given up the request on a time limit on the irish backstop or unilateral exit mechanism cox wanted to push for an independent arbitration mechanism which both uk and eu could give formal notice to end the backstop but such independent arbitration would be outside the jurisdiction of the european court of justice

he said the european union does not want britain to fight the european elections fox added it s still entirely possible for leave eu on march 29 but a short extension to article 50 may be needed to

time to achieve the 2 inflation target for now boj will patiently maintain current monetary easing while the economy is sustaining momentum for achieving the boj s price target though he acknowledged that to ensure markets remain stable it s important to come up with a strategy and guidance at an appropriate timing on how to proceed with an exit and when the appropriate time comes we will debate at our policy meetings an exit strategy and guidance and communicate them appropriately on the side effect of monetary easing kuroda said there s a concern low rate environment and competition will

the reserve bank of australia is scheduled to set monetary policy on tuesday at 0030 gmt but economic uncertainty at home and in the global economy more generally are currently giving little flexibility to policymakers to adjust interest rates potentially leading to another uneventful meeting the next day australian gdp growth figures for the final quarter of 2018 will likely endorse the decision as analysts forecast further economic moderation after slowing for two consecutive quarters australian gdp growth is said to have inched up by 0 1 percentage points to 0 4 quarter on quarter in the last three months of the year to december in yearly terms though expansion is expected to have flipped back to 2 6 from 2 8 in q3 and down from the strong 3 4 increase registered in q2 ending the year almost where growth was at its beginning while last week s q4 private new capital expenditure data advanced more rapidly than analysts projected brushing some worries over the business sector aside new data on monday indicated that firms profits and wages rose modestly in the three months to december a sign that companies are struggling to make money consumption remained a concern and therefore a potential headwind for growth as well as home prices nationally continued to fall in february the numbers also revealed that the downturn in the housing sector was more widespread raising questions about whether the discounting would bottom out anytime soon with the cooling property market hitting household wealth at a time when debt to disposable income is still uncomfortably high 190 the rba will certainly avoid hiking rates above the current level of 1 5 on tuesday the central bank s governor philip lowe is also planning to stretch its record spell of steady rates throughout the year but at some point next year he is optimistic that borrowing costs will go up if the unemployment rate drops further and inflation moves higher in line with the bank s projections saying that the property downturn is unlikely to derail the economy lowe s recent upbeat tone however did little to convince markets that the next move in rates will be up as the overnight indexed swaps keep displaying an 84 probability of a 25 bps rate cut by november 2019 it is reasonable to say that policymakers have still a lot to consider before taking the decision to tighten monetary policy if wage growth doesn t kick into higher gear consumption and hence inflation might take longer to pick up delaying any rate rise that would make household debt unsustainable economic developments outside the country should be watched carefully as well despite the latest headlines reporting that the us and china are close to agreeing on a deal that would end the tariff war the story has taken many surprising turns lately and hence more needs to be done from both sides to convince markets that the trade war might be finally approaching an end more specifically new laws on foreign investment during china s annual national people s congress in the next two weeks might signal that an agreement is close at hand if parliamentary members decide to limit technology transfer and increase intellectual property protection as the white house desires yet beijing will weigh the cons and pros of such a decision as more protection for outsiders could lead to less favorable conditions for domestic businesses note that in any case all australia wants is its major export partner china to keep growing in a healthy way in the fx space monday s encouraging trade headlines did not help the risk sensitive australian dollar much as investors turned their focus on weak business data which lowered gdp growth prospects a little should the rba shift its tone to the downside in the rate statement from the neutral currently expected potentially heightening worries over the housing slowdown audusd could slip towards the 0 7070 0 7060 support area in case gdp growth figures disappoint too a stronger sell off could emerge between 0 70 and 0 69 in the alternative scenario if the rba messages that a rate hike is more likely than a rate cut in the next year and or gdp readings beat expectations the pair could jump into the 0 7120 0 7160 zone higher a break above the 0 7200 level could prove even more significant to the market it is also worth noting that the rba governor will be speaking at the australian financial review s 2019 business summit on tuesday at 2210 gmt
santosh kumar mohapatra trade plays an important role in the economic development of a country over the last two centuries trade has multiplied amazingly completely transforming the global economy but now this has changed due to trade war a fall out of protectionism currency war and dumping a quarterly leading indicator of world merchandise trade slumped to its lowest reading in nine years february 9 according to the united nations trade agency unctad international trade tensions could spike if the united states and china escalate their tariff war recent developments suggest that it is not only the us china or europe but india may also be hit hard by the growing tide of protectionism it means nobody stands to gain from trade war the trade war is a situation wherein countries try to damage each other s trade by imposing tariffs on imports this usually happens when a country wants to save its own industries and create enough job opportunities for its own people and shrink trade deficit similarly protectionism refers to government actions and policies that restrict or restrain international trade often with the intent of protecting local businesses and jobs from foreign competition the world s top economies especially china and the us have been locked in an escalating trade war since early 2018 for example last year trump imposed tariff hikes of up to 25 per cent on chinese goods worth 250 billion the move prompted china to raise tariffs on 110 billion worth us goods this puts the world s largest economies at each other s throats the genesis of trade war lies in the fact that for decades china has sold a far greater volume of goods to the us than it bought leading to highest trade deficit of the us with china amounting 375 billion in 2017 this spurred donald trump to wage an all out tariff war against china in july 2018 in a bid to force beijing to make sweeping economic changes that would benefit us firms end to forced technology transfer and the abolition of intellectual property theft the us alleges that the chinese are stealing its firms technology and using it to help chinese companies compete with the same firms in china and around the world however china claims to have advantages of producing goods at cheaper rate because of efficiency of labour and its sophisticated and flexible supply chain china s biggest advantage is the availability of most raw materials required to manufacture a given product e g electronic components domestically however china pursues an anti trade strategy called dumping this happens when a manufacturer in one country exports a product to another country at a price that is either below the price it charges in its home market or its production cost the objective of dumping is to capture the market or obliterate competition which china does so efficiently however there are many countries including the us which have been imposing anti dumping tariff on china to nullify its effect china also indulges in contentious currency manipulation otherwise known as currency war currency war known as competitive devaluations is a situation when countries seek to gain a trade advantage over other countries by making the exchange rate of their currency fall vis à vis other currencies as the exchange rate of a country s currency falls exports become more competitive while imports become more and more expensive the chinese yuan is manipulated and undervalued to the us dollar hence trump blames china for manipulating currencies and keeping them low against the dollar snatching export advantages from the us this leads to rise of us imports and thereby a trade deficit america is also to be blamed for resorting to policy of protectionism in violation of globalisation that aims at the free movement of goods services and people across the world in a seamless and integrated manner the us has never been a truly free trade country and trump s protectionism is a continuation of a long history of us rejection of free trade and true globalisation trump s imposition of tariffs on the eu chinese and most recently turkish imports has cast a shadow over global trading patterns and precipitated a financial crisis in turkey the revised norms on the issuance of h1 b visas by us have also made it harder for indians to secure h ib visa america also enjoys advantages by taking recourse to quantitative easing to increase money supply and weaponising the dollar to preserve its global economic and geopolitical position while the us accounts for about 20 per cent of the world s economic output more than half of all global currency reserves and trade is in dollars however the recent trade tensions with continued political risks and financial volatility threaten world economy with a big economic downturn hence chinese president xi jinping and his us counterpart donald trump had agreed to a 90 day truce in the ongoing trade war beginning january 2019 america has threatened that if any settlement is not reached by march 1 it would increase the tariffs it imposed on chinese goods worth 200 billion in september from 10 per cent to 25 per cent however trump has realised that if china retaliates trade war will have a more detrimental impact on his own country than china today the us china trade relationship actually supports roughly 2 6 million jobs in the us across a range of industries us companies face large opportunities to harness new and lucrative customer base in china that can further enhance employment and economic growth economic data show that nations trading closely with china outperform those with less integrated trade ties hence trump has delayed march 1 deadline to unspecified period to escalate tariffs however that does not mean trade war is over both countries should eliminate punitive tariffs first they have imposed however no solution is feasible unless top countries relinquish the beggar thy neighbour policy which is mother of trade war and other evils the writer is an odisha based economist e mail

zimbabwe introduces a new currency for maxi devaluation until february 20th zimbabwe produced a quasi currency it was dubbed a zollar on the 20th the quasi currency became zimbabwe s official currency this new currency is called rtgs dollars and consists of bond notes and rtgs electronic money the rtgs dollars possess legal tender status and will serve as the unit of account for the government s books the official exchange rate for zollar quasi currency had been set at a one to one rate with the u s dollar but now the rtgs dollar will trade at a managed floating exchange rate the rate today is 2 50 per u s dollar not par as it used to be so zimbabwe s official exchange rate has experienced a maxi devaluation of 60 that however is not the end of zimbabwe s exchange rate story zimbabwe imposes a plethora of exchange and capital controls on its citizens under these exchange controls private individuals traders and companies must seek permission from the government to buy sell and hold foreign currencies so neither the old zollar nor the new rtgs dollar is freely convertible into a foreign currency in consequence a black market read free market exists indeed whenever there are exchange controls and restrictions on free convertibility black markets always appear at present the black market rate is 5 75 which represents a considerable premium over the official rate of 2 50 rtgs usd the black market usually yields a premium over the official rate as it does zimbabwe in some cases the premiums can reach staggering levels for example in 1982 ghana s cedi carried a premium of over 2 000 these premiums are known as black market premiums the black market premium indicates among other things the severity of the controls and restrictions a country imposes on its citizens in the case of zimbabwe the official currency devaluation caused the black market premium to shrink from 456 to 130 as the official rate moved from 1 rtgs usd to 2 50 so as of now the markets deem that the introduction of the new currency and the maxi devaluation have reduced the severity of controls that drive a wedge between the official and black market exchange rate moreover since the black market premium on foreign exchange is an implicit tax on exports the reduction in the premium means that the export tax resulting from exchange controls has been reduced the chart below contains 22 countries that have black markets in foreign exchange and for which data are available north korea tops the list with a black market premium of 811 this suggests that controls are severe and that an official devaluation will eventually be in the cards venezuela is at the bottom of the list with an unusual negative black market premium this negative premium suggests that market participants think the bolivar will appreciate relative to the greenback and that individuals are willing to pay a premium to obtain bolivars on the black market prof steve h hanke just why do countries impose restrictions and controls on foreign exchange markets and restrict free convertibility in most cases controls are seen as a way to cool off hot money and conserve official foreign exchange reserves the pedigree of exchange controls can be traced back to plato the father of statism inspired by lycurgus of sparta plato embraced the idea of an inconvertible currency as a means to preserve the autonomy of the state from outside interference so the temptation to turn to exchange controls in the face of disruptions caused by hot money flows is hardly new in the modern era tsar nicholas ii was the first to pioneer limitations on convertibility in 1905 he ordered the state bank of russia to introduce a limited form of exchange control to discourage speculative purchases of foreign exchange the bank did so by refusing to sell foreign exchange except where it could be shown that it was required to buy imported goods otherwise foreign exchange was limited to 50 000 german marks per person the tsar s rationale for exchange controls was that of limiting hot money flows so that foreign reserves and the exchange rate could be maintained as we move to reflect on zimbabwe or any of the other countries in the hanke quarterly black market review we must lift a page from nobel laureate friedrich hayek s 1944 classic the road to serfdom the extent of the control over all life that economic control confers is nowhere better illustrated than in the field of foreign exchanges nothing would at first seem to affect private life less than a state control of the dealings in foreign exchange and most people will regard its introduction with complete indifference yet the experience of most continental countries has taught thoughtful people to regard this step as the decisive advance on the path to totalitarianism and the suppression of individual liberty it is in fact the complete delivery of the individual to the tyranny of the state the final suppression of all means of escape not merely for the rich but for everybody hayek s message about convertibility has regrettably been overlooked by many contemporary economists exchange controls are nothing more than a ring fence within which governments can expropriate their subjects property open exchange and capital markets in fact protect the individual from exactions because governments must reckon with the possibility of capital flight from this it follows that the imposition of exchange controls leads to an instantaneous reduction in the wealth of the country because all assets decline in value to see why it is important to understand how assets are priced the value of any asset is the sum of the expected future installments of income it generates discounted to the present value for example the price of a stock represents the value to the investor now of his share of the company s future cash flows whether issued as dividends or reinvested the present value of future income is calculated using an appropriate interest rate that is adjusted for the various risks that the income may not materialize when convertibility is restricted risk increases because property is held hostage and is subject to a potential ransom through expropriation as a result the risk adjusted interest rate employed to value assets is higher than it would be with full convertibility investors are willing to pay less for each dollar of prospective income and the value of property is less than it would be with full convertibility president emmerson mnangagwa has proclaimed that zimbabwe is open for business this refrain rings hollow in the face of zimbabwe s exchange controls and its new currency the rtgs dollar if zimbabwe wants to be open for business and wants its own sound currency it should adopt a currency board that would make zimbabwe s currency a clone of the u s dollar or some other suitable anchor such as gold a currency board would mandate that exchange controls be thrown in the dustbin free convertibility would reign and so would low inflation rates and higher asset valuations the open for business sign would be the real deal by steve h hanke www cato org people hanke html twitter

uhlenbruch our base case view is that the rba remains on hold until late 2020 early 2021 before gradually winding back the amount of monetary policy accommodation such a view allows for a sharp fall in dwelling investment as the amount of building falls back to longer run levels but the drag from this is offset by strong public sector demand and a recovery in business investment housing prices should find a floor towards the end of the year as lower prices improve affordability and household formation a stabilisation in housing prices removes the drag from negative wealth effects on the consumption outlook we see the risks to our base case view as tilted to the downside and would need to see signs of sustained labour market weakening before shifting our base case view unlike current market pricing for just one easing we would expect that in such a scenario the rba would ease by 50bps rather than by the 25bps of easing currently priced in we currently see three year government bond yields at 1 66 at the time of writing as being mildly expensive with risks of significant sell off low given that we have yet to weather a period of falling housing construction the longer end of

keeping inflation in check amidst tension on the eastern border has become a big challenge depending on the success of islamabad s peace gestures including the release of a captured indian air force pilot the return of normalcy will take time so keeping the rupee stable and taming inflation can be challenging in coming months already the year on year rise in consumer inflation shot up to 8 2 per cent in february from 7 2pc in january according to the pakistan bureau of statistics if we keep this inflation number in mind and then recall that the rupee has also lost about 26pc value in the past one year we realise inflationary pressure is building up in the economy at the end of february 2018 the interbank value of the dollar was rs110 76 at the end of last month it was to rs139 66 interest rate tightening has yet to help rein in galloping inflation because it will take more time to contract consumer demand besides the fact that currency in circulation keeps growing currency in circulation has expanded to rs390bn in the past seven and a half months as opposed to rs177bn in the year ago period besides massive government borrowing from the state bank of pakistan sbp fresh currency printing in plainer terms continues to fuel inflation between july 1 2018 and feb 15 the government borrowed rs1 9 trillion rupees from the sbp up from rs575bn in the year ago period attempts to tame inflation and keep the local currency stable will become difficult if the security situation does not improve dramatically with strong inflationary expectations created after the recent pak india hostile engagement its impact on fiscal management and commodity markets and the overall increased level of uncertainty you can figure out the future pace of price movements from march 1 the government has raised fuel prices by up to 4 85pc that too is going to keep inflation up in the near future even if we see a downward revision in april for the simple reason that businesses are quicker in factoring in the impact of higher fuel prices but slower in adjusting for lower prices expecting local fuel prices to come down in the next quarter of the fiscal year april june would be naïve keeping in mind the kind of fiscal disarray that the country was in even before the security situation became serious the fiscal deficit in the first half of this fiscal year i e july december 2018 stood at 2 7pc of gdp the highest after 2 9pc seen in the first half of 2010 11 according to a recent dawn report the fiscal deficit is sure to grow faster in the second half of the fiscal year due to less than targeted revenue generation rising cost of domestic and foreign debt servicing and a possible increase in defence spending the current account deficit might take longer than expected to decline if securing a 12bn imf package gets delayed the impact of the twin deficits on the rupee and inflation might be quite challenging can the central bank go for further rate tightening and that too at a time when large scale manufacturing growth has turned negative this really is an important point to ponder another important moot point for policymakers is whether they can continue pursuing political bigwigs allegedly involved in cases of mega financial corruption capital flight and money laundering as effectively as in the recent past during a challenging security situation we should not forget that while the united states china russia turkey saudi arabia and the united arab emirates are playing their roles in defusing heightened tensions between pakistan and india new delhi is yet to show a substantially positive response besides the fact that defusing this tension requires a serious crackdown against militant outfits makes the task of avoiding the economic fallout of any delay on this count quite difficult attempts to tame inflation and keep the local currency stable are two things that will become very difficult in case the security situation does not improve dramatically at present inflation dynamics of pakistan have a couple of elements that are not so easy to handle it s not just consumer inflation that is accelerating inflation for the poor measured through the sensitive price index spi and core inflation are also high annualised core inflation was 5 2pc in february 2018 but it rose to 8 8pc last month during the week that ended on feb 28 the spi showing the average change in the prices of 53 essential items shot up to 10 63pc it was 5 52pc only 10 weeks ago whereas keeping the spi low requires higher agricultural productivity and smooth operations in the commodity markets a high core inflation calls for the further tightening of interest rates greater fiscal discipline and quicker fixing of external sector imbalances one silver lining is an apparent increase in the level of provincial harmony which is so crucial for agricultural productivity but will increased harmony obtained in the current security situation last permanently won t further actions against top political leaders facing cases of corruption capital flight and money laundering jeopardise it another thing that remains to be seen amid the evolving geopolitical situation is the future course of dollar pumping into the national coffers by china saudi arabia and united arab emirates in case an imf bailout gets further delayed the pti government has got 7bn in total from these countries to keep foreign exchange reserves from falling too low pakistan s decision to boycott the recent organisation of islamic cooperation meeting in protest against inviting india as a guest of honour has already created an unusual diplomatic situation one can only hope that things will not take an ugly turn taming inflation and keeping the rupee stabile must be a priority as peace prevails published in dawn the business and finance weekly march 4th 2019

last july i started asking prominent democrats their views on substantive policy questions sen elizabeth warren d mass who actually initiated the exercise with her sua sponte answers and los angeles mayor eric garcetti both have participated so has sen chris murphy d conn this time i asked former maryland congressman john delaney the first democrat to declare for president about some top domestic policy issues delaney is a moderate and a successful entrepreneur and he has a big staff in iowa it s critical for him to make the debates requiring 1 percent in three polls or 65 000 donors which he claims to have he ll get a chance to introduce himself to the country in a march 10 town hall in the meantime here are his answers to our questions followed by a few observations what s the right balance of taxes spending and debt advertisement the right balance of taxes and spending would produce deficits of about 2 percent across the long term under my economic policies i believe the economy can consistently grow at least 2 5 percent per year and if we can manage long term annual deficits to be less than the level of annual economic growth then the debt as a percentage of our economy will go down which is what matters the key metric is debt as a percentage of gross domestic product and i would like to start slowly lowering that ratio to be more in line with historical averages to achieve this we need to increase revenue which i would do by 1 implementing a form of the buffet rule which involves synchronizing capital gains tax rates with ordinary income tax rates we do not need a lower capital gains rate that is an outdated incentive and contributes meaningfully to the structural unfairness in the tax code as investors pay lower taxes than workers 2 by rolling back the tax cuts on high earners from the gop tax reform and 3 by raising corporate tax rates not to where they were but to about 27 percent on the spending side we have to lower long term spending growth which should be focused on fixing health care health care is the main long term driver of our spending problems and i have proposed a fully paid for universal health care plan that can do this after we fix the affordable care act we also have to address social security tom cole and i have introduced a commission bill similar to the greenspan commission to address the long term solvency of social security follow this author jennifer rubin s opinions follow if the trans pacific partnership and other trade deals have economic and geopolitical benefits what do you say to workers who are displaced i tell workers that we have let them down by failing to respond to globalization and technology which have been enormously positive for society and the world but not for many of them as my dad the union electrician used to say a good job is everything i want to keep positioning the united states to compete globally with deals like tpp but i will not forget about workers that are hurt by globalization my approach is to think globally and invest locally i would pair trade deals with domestic economic programs like infrastructure and with an agenda for turning around distressed communities i was a leader on the opportunity zone legislation in the house which created a federal tax incentive for investors to invest in opportunity zones i would pair that with an incentive for government contractors to locate in opportunity zones building more infrastructure in them and increasing the earned income tax credit which should be the center of our tax policy we also need an agenda to address changes in work driven by artificial intelligence and automation this involves changes in public education creating ongoing training capabilities and developing creative compensation structures for jobs that are currently being done in society like caregivers that add meaningful societal value but are not currently compensated working together these polices would cause investment capital and jobs to flow to communities left behind and help workers prepare for change advertisement facebook and other tech companies have become the equivalent of utilities yet they are essentially unregulated how should we regulate them to address problems such as privacy and foreign interference in elections we should pass federal privacy legislation similar to what california passed we should require full disclosure of who buys campaign ads on digital platforms as part of a national ai strategy we should address tech addiction and programming bias we should harness the best in innovation but also protect our citizens my wife is the washington director of common sense media and is a leader in these areas big companies engage in bidding wars to open or expand facilities in exchange for tax and other incentives what problems do you have with this and does it perpetuate inequality advertisement this practice does not help net u s job growth it is a race to the bottom and it is effectively a form of corporate subsidies many of which but not all have proved to have very low returns on investment relative to other investments for example i found the amazon process unseemly but at the same time i believe new york city made a mistake rejecting them it is my sense that the package nyc offered was justified based on the assurances amazon provided the dynamic exists for these auctions because so many areas are hungry for economic development last year 80 percent of venture capital funding went to 50 counties in the united states this has created massive inequality of opportunity and is turning the country into a nation of birthright instead of a country of opportunity we need real polices that foster broader economic development so that fewer locations show up with bids the next time a corporation wants to run a national auction what s your solution to skyrocketing college tuition costs and student debt post high school graduation every american should be able to attend community college or obtain career and technical training at no cost the eligible programs should meet quality and graduation metrics in order to qualify we should also have more creative loan repayment programs tied to income and work to lower the payments on student loans working together this would allow a student to obtain two years of college at no cost and then finish the last two years at a lower cost i have also called for a national service program that gives all high school graduates the opportunity but not the obligation to serve their country either in the military by doing community service or through a new infrastructure program to rebuild parks and federal assets in addition to all the unifying benefits and skill building associated with this we could provide discounted student loans to students who serve which would create another avenue for lower college costs advertisement my responses as a preliminary matter delaney should get credit for direct substantive answers especially on the debt he s the first democrat who s answered these questions to specify how much debt we can carry and to address reform of social security on trade delaney seems to have hit upon an economically and politically viable solution open up foreign markets and use domestic legislation not tariffs to address the adverse effect on american workers he and other democrats should also be forthright about the availability of the world trade organization to address foreign unfair competition if that body needs reform we should push forward so countries have viable remedies and need not resort to unwinnable trade wars delaney makes a smart point about the concentration of venture capital in relatively few places we d like to hear him expound more on the trail about what to do about this it s the chicken or egg problem without investment and the promise of good jobs it s hard to set up a world class university or make huge expenditures in infrastructure which are needed to attract investment we d like to see candidates address an unpopular but perhaps necessary solution namely moving people from distressed areas to where the high tech jobs are instead of moving the high tech jobs to distressed areas advertisement on education delaney and other candidates rightly stress alternatives to four year schools however four year college tuition even at public schools has skyrocketed to the dismay of middle class families it would be interesting to see if college presidents were treated like oil company executives hauled before congress to explain the price gouging and whether there is any price fixing going on moreover should uber expensive universities with billions in endowment money get to keep their nonprofit status especially if they continue charging students ungodly amounts for a diploma no there s a way to raise revenue or pressure universities to start lowering their prices
keeping inflation in check amidst tension on the eastern border has become a big challenge depending on the success of islamabad s peace gestures including the release of a captured indian air force pilot the return of normalcy will take time so keeping the rupee stable and taming inflation can be challenging in coming months already the year on year rise in consumer inflation shot up to 8 2 per cent in february from 7 2pc in january according to the pakistan bureau of statistics if we keep this inflation number in mind and then recall that the rupee has also lost about 26pc value in the past one year we realise inflationary pressure is building up in the economy at the end of february 2018 the interbank value of the dollar was rs110 76 at the end of last month it was to rs139 66 interest rate tightening has yet to help rein in galloping inflation because it will take more time to contract consumer demand besides the fact that currency in circulation keeps growing currency in circulation has expanded to rs390bn in the past seven and a half months as opposed to rs177bn in the year ago period besides massive government borrowing from the state bank of pakistan sbp fresh currency printing in plainer terms continues to fuel inflation between july 1 2018 and feb 15 the government borrowed rs1 9 trillion rupees from the sbp up from rs575bn in the year ago period attempts to tame inflation and keep the local currency stable will become difficult if the security situation does not improve dramatically with strong inflationary expectations created after the recent pak india hostile engagement its impact on fiscal management and commodity markets and the overall increased level of uncertainty you can figure out the future pace of price movements from march 1 the government has raised fuel prices by up to 4 85pc that too is going to keep inflation up in the near future even if we see a downward revision in april for the simple reason that businesses are quicker in factoring in the impact of higher fuel prices but slower in adjusting for lower prices expecting local fuel prices to come down in the next quarter of the fiscal year april june would be naïve keeping in mind the kind of fiscal disarray that the country was in even before the security situation became serious the fiscal deficit in the first half of this fiscal year i e july december 2018 stood at 2 7pc of gdp the highest after 2 9pc seen in the first half of 2010 11 according to a recent dawn report the fiscal deficit is sure to grow faster in the second half of the fiscal year due to less than targeted revenue generation rising cost of domestic and foreign debt servicing and a possible increase in defence spending the current account deficit might take longer than expected to decline if securing a 12bn imf package gets delayed the impact of the twin deficits on the rupee and inflation might be quite challenging can the central bank go for further rate tightening and that too at a time when large scale manufacturing growth has turned negative this really is an important point to ponder another important moot point for policymakers is whether they can continue pursuing political bigwigs allegedly involved in cases of mega financial corruption capital flight and money laundering as effectively as in the recent past during a challenging security situation we should not forget that while the united states china russia turkey saudi arabia and the united arab emirates are playing their roles in defusing heightened tensions between pakistan and india new delhi is yet to show a substantially positive response besides the fact that defusing this tension requires a serious crackdown against militant outfits makes the task of avoiding the economic fallout of any delay on this count quite difficult attempts to tame inflation and keep the local currency stable are two things that will become very difficult in case the security situation does not improve dramatically at present inflation dynamics of pakistan have a couple of elements that are not so easy to handle it s not just consumer inflation that is accelerating inflation for the poor measured through the sensitive price index spi and core inflation are also high annualised core inflation was 5 2pc in february 2018 but it rose to 8 8pc last month during the week that ended on feb 28 the spi showing the average change in the prices of 53 essential items shot up to 10 63pc it was 5 52pc only 10 weeks ago whereas keeping the spi low requires higher agricultural productivity and smooth operations in the commodity markets a high core inflation calls for the further tightening of interest rates greater fiscal discipline and quicker fixing of external sector imbalances one silver lining is an apparent increase in the level of provincial harmony which is so crucial for agricultural productivity but will increased harmony obtained in the current security situation last permanently won t further actions against top political leaders facing cases of corruption capital flight and money laundering jeopardise it another thing that remains to be seen amid the evolving geopolitical situation is the future course of dollar pumping into the national coffers by china saudi arabia and united arab emirates in case an imf bailout gets further delayed the pti government has got 7bn in total from these countries to keep foreign exchange reserves from falling too low pakistan s decision to boycott the recent organisation of islamic cooperation meeting in protest against inviting india as a guest of honour has already created an unusual diplomatic situation one can only hope that things will not take an ugly turn taming inflation and keeping the rupee stabile must be a priority as peace prevails published in dawn the business and finance weekly march 4th 2019

president trump set his sights on reducing mammoth u s trade deficits in the coming week the census bureau will report the u s last year registered the largest trade deficit in its history how that happened is a lesson in the economics of imbalances in this case the president s tax policies were as much in play as his trade policies large fiscal deficits had the side effect of enabling businesses and consumers to purchase more goods from abroad driving down overall u s saving and driving up the trade imbalance the evolution of the trade balance over trump s first two years is a good illustration of the basic principles that led most economists to predict the trade deficit would continue to widen with trump s policies said brad setser a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations it has been a year since mr trump s trade agenda shifted into high gear it was march 1 2018 when the president announced he would move forward with global tariffs on steel and aluminum and on march 22 he began the process of slapping china with the first 50 billion of tariffs throughout 2018 more and more of these tariffs went into effect and by september the tariffs had been imposed on around 300 billion of goods or about 12 of all u s imports tariffs were successful in one sense they brought china to the table for detailed negotiations mexico and canada agreed to rewrite the north american free trade agreement and south korea agreed to revise its free trade deal with the u s as well those negotiations were all accelerated at least in part by the imposition or threat of tariffs but tariff policies so far have fallen well short of the president s oft stated goal of narrowing the trade deficit the commerce department s report on fourth quarter gross domestic product released thursday showed imports exceeded exports by a record 914 billion in 2018 up from 859 billion the year before and topping the previous record of 905 billion from 2006 the deficit is now about 16 larger than when mr trump took office for the year the economy grew 2 9 a trade deficit subtracts from the calculation of gdp growth last year the growth in the trade deficit subtracted 0 2 percentage point from gdp so by that metric the trade deficit is what kept the economy from reaching mr trump s other goal of 3 growth a separate commerce department report focusing just on merchandise trade showed the deficit in goods widening by 10 in december from a year earlier the nation s main trade report from the census bureau which will show the detailed breakdown of trade in goods and services for 2018 will be released wednesday the point is the overall trade deficit is not determined by commodity trade it s determined by macro said sherman robinson a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics over the past year macroeconomic factors have overwhelmed any attempts to target specific trade deficits most powerfully the combination of tax cuts and increased federal spending provided immense fiscal stimulus the fiscal stimulus had two effects first it provided an abrupt jolt to u s consumption companies imported more to satisfy the demand u s imports averaged 24 of total consumer spending between 2000 and 2016 meaning every 100 of new consumption translated to roughly 24 of imports if u s factories and service providers can t ramp up production even more of that money might flow abroad in 2018 imports were nearly 27 of consumption second the fiscal boost to the u s economy happened when much of the rest of the world was slowing that contributed to an environment in which the fed was raising interest rates and the dollar was strengthening when the dollar is strong it s cheaper for americans to import and more expensive for the rest of the world to buy u s exports widening the trade gap the latest deal with china seeks to boost u s exports directly by getting the chinese to agree to large purchases of american goods like soybeans or energy this strategy may not be particularly effective either said megan greene global chief economist of john hancock asset management even if china agrees to buy more of our stuff it doesn t seem like u s firms can produce that much extra stuff it just means we d have to divert it from somewhere else she said more soybeans purchased by china could simply mean fewer purchased by indonesia and taiwan for example leaving the u s not much better off overall to mr setser large u s trade deficits are a problem worthy of tackling i don t think it is healthy for the u s to persistently run large trade deficits i think that does weaken the manufacturing side of the u s economy and weaken those parts of the country that are reliant on manufacturing he said but tariffs lead countries to retaliate almost all u s tariffs were met with corresponding tariffs from trading partners the level of u s exports which had been steadily climbing for two years began to decline in may i would be thrilled if the deficit came down because of strong growth in u s exports over this year mr setser said i just don t think it s terribly likely source dow jones

the following is part ii of this article c secondary sanctions requirements on non u s parties that have no contacts with the u s ofac also has adopted sanctions that specifically apply to non u s companies and individuals even if such parties do not fit within the definition of u s person and even if they have no contacts whatsoever with the united states these are commonly referred to as secondary sanctions or extraterritorial sanctions while only used in limited instances prior to 2016 after enactment of caatsa and other recent events the incidence of secondary sanctions has been increasing and is set to expand even further in the coming year the term secondary sanctions is a broad term that covers a wide array of restrictions on foreign companies these are typically imposed under an existing u s sanctions program to bring additional leverage on the country that is the target of the sanctions the most typical secondary sanctions prohibit non u s companies from engaging in business activities that benefit a sanctioned country such as purchasing oil from iran or selling luxury goods to n korea but they can also be applied to restrict foreign parties from engaging in many other types of business transactions as discussed further below the legal implications of secondary sanctions are significant as they impose u s restrictions on non u s parties with absolutely no contacts with or presence in the u s the most recognized secondary sanctions are under the iran sanctions program prior to entering the iran nuclear accord in july 14 2015 the joint comprehensive plan of action the u s had imposed a number of secondary sanctions on non u s persons for dealing with iran to apply pressure on iran in the nuclear negotiations these included restrictions on non u s companies engaging in certain transactions with iran involving i insurance ii petroleum products iii shipping iv trade in gold and certain other precious metals v trade in metals and industrial materials vi trade in software for integrating industrial processes vi transactions involving the iranian automobile industry and vii certain financial and banking activities clearly restrictions on dealing in basic industrial commodities such as coal oil metals and software were aimed at crippling the iranian economy once the jcpoa was implemented in january 2016 many of the u s secondary sanctions on iran were lifted or waived however when president trump announced the u s withdrawal from the jcpoa on may 8 2018 these secondary sanctions snapped back and the u s re imposed a wide array of secondary sanctions on iran subject to 90 day and 180 day wind down periods at the time of this writing the u s just completed the process of re imposing the secondary sanctions across a wide array of industries in iran including involving i u s dollar banknotes ii gold and precious metals iii graphite raw and semi finished metals coal and software for integrating industrial processes iv dealing in iranian rial and sovereign debt v the iranian automotive sector vi ports and shipping vii the petroleum industry viii transactions by foreign financial institutions and ix insurance as part of this the u s listed over 700 iranian persons entities aircraft and vessels on the sdn list and has prohibited foreign countries from purchasing iranian crude oil under these actions non u s parties that engage in these prohibited activities involving iran will be subject to a number of potential consequences including a menu of additional sanctions discussed below in announcing the re imposition of the iran secondary sanctions treasury secretary mnuchin stated treasury s imposition of unprecedented financial pressure on iran should make clear to the iranian regime that they will face mounting financial isolation and economic stagnation until they fundamentally change their destabilizing behavior similarly during the past three years the u s has imposed a number of secondary sanctions involving n korea in 2016 and 2017 presidents obama and trump issued a series of executive orders that authorized an array of secondary sanctions on foreign companies that engage in transactions with n korea and foreign financial institutions that finance trade with n korea to apply pressure on the n korean regime in the nuclear negotiations these included for example the authority to designate for sanctions any person including foreign companies that engage in at least one significant importation from or exportation to n korea of any goods services or technologies following these executive orders the u s then designated numerous private companies based in china singapore hong kong panama and other countries for sanctions for engaging in transactions with n korea this included trading companies oil companies transportation companies and financial intermediaries the u s placed a high priority on foreign financial institutions in the effort to cut off financial transactions with n korea in addition ofac even designated individual shipping vessels on the sdn list these designations of non korean companies were in addition to designations of n korean companies government organizations and individuals the purpose was simple to isolate the n korean regime and cut it off from the rest of the world economy thus through the imposition of secondary sanctions the u s announced to the world that non u s companies can choose to do business with the u s or countries targeted for sanctions but not both prior to 2017 the use of secondary sanctions such as described for iran and n korea were limited however caatsa enacted in august 2017 specifically addresses secondary sanctions providing not just increased authorization for secondary sanctions but also requiring the president to impose them in certain situations d _ assisting others in violating sanctions law s a fourth category in which non u s parties can be subject to u s sanctions is assisting others in sanctions violations this covers a number of restrictions including providing material assistance and support to sanctioned parties and knowingly facilitating significant transactions with such parties this is perhaps the broadest category of potential liability and presents the greatest level of risk for foreign companies the rule here is simple if you provide assistance to a party that is designated for sanctions you run the risk of being designated for sanctions yourself it is important to note that these restrictions apply not just to entering transactions with a rogue regime such as iran or n korea but also entering transactions with individual parties that are designated for sanctions including parties listed on the sdn list in many cases in addition there is no definition of material assistance and many types of business transactions can theoretically fit within this term thus merely entering significant business transactions with certain parties designated for sanctions opens a foreign company up to potential sanctions liability as well this became clearly evident under ofac s russian oligarch sanctions designations in april 2018 in these designations the sanctions were not just aimed at the 38 russian parties that were added to the sdn list but also other u s and foreign companies that conducted business with such parties thus when the sdn listings of the russian oligarchs and their companies were announced other companies including non u s companies quickly ceased conducting business with the designated parties out of fear of being designated as sdn s themselves this issue was addressed in the treasury department s april 6 2018 press release accompanying the new sanctions additionally non u s persons could face sanctions for knowingly facilitating significant transactions for or on behalf of the individuals or entities blocked today many of the secondary sanctions are aimed at parties that provide direct support to a sanctioned regime however they are also aimed at parties that play a secondary or tertiary role in dealing with sanctioned parties in targeting the shipping companies insurance companies financial intermediaries and business advisors that provide services to support transactions with sanctioned parties this is a subset of secondary sanctions broadening the net from those who are primary actors to those in the background that provide an indirect level of support once again under ofac s 50 rule these risks arise not just in entering transactions with parties that are listed as sdns but also with companies that are owned 50 or more by sdns so the complex web of sanctions restrictions extends even farther many of the parties that provide assistance and support may not have a direct business relationship with the sanctions regime and may not even know that there is any sanctions involvement for example they might not recognize that sdns own the stock of a company with which they are dealing this creates perhaps the greatest risk for foreign companies when they are not aware of any sanctions involvement in the transaction the legal authority for imposing sanctions on persons that provide material support to sanctions parties or who knowingly facilitate significant transactions with sanctioned parties arises from a number of sources first many of the recent executive orders issued in connection with various sanctions programs authorize sanctions not just on the party that is the primary target of the sanctions but also on others who aid and assist such parties for example executive order 13662 one of the three executive orders used to authorize the april 2018 designations of the russian oligarchs authorizes the president to impose sanctions on the targeted russian parties and also on any other person determined by the secretary of the treasury and state to have materially assisted sponsored or provided financial material or technological support for or goods or services to or in support of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order or to be owned or controlled by or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of directly or indirectly any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order this language was drafted quite broadly to capture a wide array of activities in addition caatsa provides legal authority for sanctions on foreign parties that knowingly facilitate a significant transaction with parties designated for sanctions under certain of the sanctions programs and actually requires the president to impose them in certain instances for example 228 of caatsa provides that the president shall impose sanctions on foreign persons if the president determines that the person knowingly facilitates a significant transaction or transactions including deceptive or structured transactions for or on behalf of any person subject to sanctions imposed by the u s with respect to the russian federation or any child spouse parent or sibling of such party similarly 226 of caatsa amended 5 of the ukraine freedom support act of 2014 ufsa to impose mandatory sanctions on foreign financial institutions if treasury determines that they knowingly facilitate significant financial transactions on behalf of any russian person who is listed on the sdn list pursuant to the ufsa or executive orders 13660 13661 13662 13685 or any other executive order addressing the crisis in ukraine other examples of potential liability for foreign companies providing assistance to sanctioned parties include under ofac s foreign sanctions evaders list and the state department s section 231 list the exact restrictions on providing material support and facilitation vary under the different sanctions programs and sometimes within the same program thus one must look at the specific legal authority behind a particular sanctions designation to assess if restrictions also apply to providing support or facilitation to the sanctioned party these legal authorities provide a number of qualifiers which must be satisfied in order for a violation to occur for support and assistance the support must be material hence insignificant transactions might be excluded similarly under 228 of caatsa a person must knowingly facilitate a significant transaction thus there are some limitations on these provisions however they are still quite broad and provide significant discretion to u s regulatory officials the following are examples of parties that have been designated by ofac for sanctions solely because they provided some form of material support or assistance to the primary target of the sanctions designation of the russian port service agency profinet pte ltd that provides port loading bunkering and departure arrangements for vessels calling at various russian ports the designation was for providing port loading services for vessels listed on the sdn list including chon myong 1 and rye song gang 1 profinet s director general vasili kolchanov was also designated august 15 2018 designation of the russian bank agrosoyuz commercial bank for knowingly conducting or facilitating a significant transactions on behalf of han jang su the moscow based chief representative of n korean foreign trade bank ri jong won the moscow based deputy representative of foreign trade bank was also personally designated august 3 2018 designation of velmur management pte ltd a singapore company for having materially assisted sponsored or provided financial material or technological support for another sdn transatlantic partners pte ltd on the same day the u s justice department filed a complaint against velmure management in the u s district court for the district of columbia for money laundering violations august 22 2017 designation of lebanon based nasco polymers and uae based sonex investments for chartering vessels and serving as consignee for syrian company oil transport which is the port authority for the ports of baniyas and tartus in syria also designation of adnan al ali for providing financial material or technological support and serving as advisor to abar petroleum which was designated as an sdn september 6 2018 designation of russian born south african vladlen amtchentsev pursuant to executive order 13722 for having acted on behalf of and advised another sdn velmur management pte ltd in evasion of the n korean sanctions november 19 2018 designation of the chinese entity equipment development department and its director li shangfu for engaging in significant transactions with persons on the caatsa section 231 list of specified persons lsp september 20 2018 to date parties designated for sanctions for providing material support or assistance to parties on the sdn list generally appear to have engaged in egregious activities to assist other parties in circumventing sanctions requirements the u s effort to curtail material assistance and support has targeted entire industries such as the worldwide shipping industry for example ofac has issued numerous shipping industry advisories warning foreign companies to avoid providing support for shipments to sanctioned countries or parties or face u s penalties in one recent release ofac stated treasury reminds the shipping industry including flag states ship owners and operators crew members and captains insurance companies brokers oil companies ports classification service providers and others of the significant risks posed by n korea s shipping practices thus if you are operating a foreign shipping company insurance company cargo inspection company port facility or freight forwarder ofac wants you to verify that your customers are not engaging in activities that evade u s sanctions similarly if your company sells any other types of products services software or other resources ofac wants you to verify that these will not be sold to parties that are evading u s sanctions another major industry focus has been on foreign financial institutions for example executive order 13810 related to the n korea sanctions provides specific authorization to the secretary of the treasury to impose secondary sanctions on foreign financial institutions if the institution has i knowingly conducted or facilitated any significant transaction on behalf of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to executive order 13551 of august 30 2010 executive order 13687 of january 2 2015 executive order 13722 of march 15 2016 or this order or of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to executive order 13382 in connection with north korea related activities or ii knowingly conducted or facilitated any significant transaction in connection with trade with north korea the u s is effectively saying if the foreign banks do not comply with u s sanctions laws they can be cut off from dollar based transactions and the u s financial system a death sentence for most international financial institutions thus in this fourth category of requirements for foreign companies if your company knowingly facilitates significant transactions with parties subject to sanctions or provides material support and assistance for such parties this opens the door to your company being designated for sanctions as well while the transactions must meet certain thresholds such as being material knowing and or significant the authority is still quite broad it is not clear how far the u s will go in enforcing these restrictions but the legal authority is now in place for it to do so the above is not necessarily an exhaustive list of all areas of potential sanctions liability for foreign companies others may also exist either under current authorities or new ones adopted in the future e _ penalties for violations of secondary sanctions if a non u s party violates u s secondary sanctions it becomes subject to a number of significant consequences the exact penalties for such violations will depend on the legal authority behind the secondary sanction in question in most cases the most significant consequence is that the foreign company runs the risk of being placed on the sdn list in addition in certain instances the president has the option to impose other sanctions under a menu of options such as denial of the target party s right to obtain u s visas to obtain access to u s government sponsored export financing to receive export licenses and to sell goods and services to the u s government the penalties for secondary sanctions are technically different from those under civil enforcement actions or criminal prosecution for sanctions violations civil enforcement actions would typically be used for a direct sanctions violation especially if the respondent had sufficient contacts in the u s such as the b whale corporation cases discussed in section 2 a above or assets subject to u s jurisdiction however the u s government could certainly pursue multiple remedies to bring maximum leverage on the target party and has done so on multiple occasions for example following ofac s designation of tan wee beng on the sdn list on october 5 2018 for financing shipments of goods to n korea he was indicted in the southern district of new york for sanctions evasions and money laundering similarly following velmur management pte ltd s designation to the sdn list referenced above the u s justice department simultaneously filed a complaint against velmure management for money laundering violations there are additional examples of simultaneous sanctions designations and law enforcement actions and these will most likely continue in the future it is not clear how aggressive the u s will be in enforcing secondary sanctions either alone or in conjunctions with conventional law enforcement actions the u s is still in the early stages in the use of this practice and details are still evolving however due to the importance of the sanctions programs to the u s government it will likely take secondary sanctions very seriously world events are moving quickly we will likely find out very soon 3 steps to mitigate risk foreign companies face growing challenges and legal risks under the u s sanctions laws in response many are taking heightened precautions in dealing with these laws in their business activities questions for foreign companies to consider in addressing these risks include i is your company engaged in transactions with u s parties u s products u s technologies or u s software or does your company have a presence in the u s ii is your company doing business in countries subject to the u s sanctions laws such as iran n korea cuba syria russia ukraine and venezuela are there secondary sanctions involving those countries that affect your company iii if your company is doing business in countries subject to u s sanctions laws are you conducting a heightened level of due diligence review in such transactions to understand the applicable legal requirements and parties with whom you are dealing iv is your company engaged in transactions with persons or entities listed as an sdn or other ofac restricted party lists v is your company engaged in transactions with entities that are owned 50 or more by parties listed on the sdn list vi does your company own shares in companies that are listed on the sdn list or their subsidiaries are officers and or directors of your company subsidiaries or joint ventures sdns does your company have shareholders that are sdns vii are sdns investors in your investment private equity or real estate funds or partnerships viii does your company have contacts with the u s financial system and if so are these sufficient to subject your company to u s sanctions jurisdiction ix is your company engaged in transactions that could be viewed as providing material support or assistance to sdns or knowingly facilitating significant transactions with such parties there are a variety of compliance practices that foreign companies can use to address these issues and help reduce potential liabilities and we can advise further on these sanctions laws have become a major focal point for the united states in dealing with some of its most important foreign policy issues as a result ofac takes enforcement of these laws extremely seriously companies should use care to understand these requirements so they do not get caught in the cross fire february 21 2019 exhibit a list of u s

image european union 2018 european parliament reproduced under cc licensing eur slips usd rises on reports u s china tariffs to come down trump xi headed for end march summit to sign a trade peace deal eur is damned regardless investors to use as a funding currency the euro underperformed most g10 rivals in a risk on market monday as investors responded to a report from the wall street journal claiming negotiators are close to reaching a deal that ends the u s china trade war but the single currency could be damned if the talks succeed and damned if they don t europe s single currency is in a mire because investors are once again beginning to view it as a funding currency of choice given the eurozone s economy is slowing so rapidly the european central bank ecb has already been knocked off its policy normalisation course and there s still a litany of risks lurking on the path up ahead with the ecb s record low interest rates now set to prevail for a while longer analysts are feeling more confident about advocating that clients use the euro as tool to fund speculative bets on other assets which requires them to borrow euros sell them on the market and use the proceeds to buy other currencies if this practice continues then it could ensure a steady supply of euros is drip fed onto the market over the coming weeks and months which would prevent the single currency from regaining higher ground that was recently lost to the dollar an analyst from thomson reuters wrote to subscribers of the firm s professional service monday explaining why this scenario could still leave the euro damned risk appetite is soaring on the heightened chance that the united states and china will agree a trade deal and lift tariffs underpinning stocks and supporting high yielding currencies as a result the euro which is the most liquid of any of the popularly used funding currencies should come under more pressure the soft euro zone economy is increasing the chance that the european central bank adds liquidity at the some stage and speculation surrounding tltro s will boost the risk on feel in fx markets further weighing on the euro says jeremy boulton an analyst with thomson reuters dealing room fx community the wall street journal claimed monday that negotiators are close to finalising a trade deal that could see white house tariffs removed from chinese goods exported to the u s which suported the greenback and prompted a fresh bid for so called risk assets the paper says that a formal agreement could be signed at a march 27 summit between presidents donald trump and xi jingping but qualified this with a warning stating that hurdles remain and each side faces possible resistance at home due to perceptions on both sides that the terms of the agreement are too favourable for the opposite party above euro to dollar rate shown at daily intervals the euro to dollar rate was 0 19 lower at 1 1342 monday and has declined 1 07 this year while the pound to dollar rate was 0 36 higher at 1 3242 and is up 3 94 for 2019 the dollar index was 0 20 higher at 96 58 and has gained 0 56 in 2019 stock markets closed higher in asia after a bouyant overnight session while most european indices were quoted above their friday closing levels during the morning on monday oil prices were also higher while yields u s and german 10 year yields were lower above u s dollar index dxy shown at daily intervals the view outlined by reuters boulton on monday is similar to that put forward by analysts at ing group who say an end to the trade war could give the federal reserve fed the excuse it needs in order to lift u s interest rates this year that would widen the gap between u s and european bond yields which could heap further downward pressure on the euro so long as markets see an ecb rate rise as only a distant prospect the eventual resolution of the trade despite should provide the fed with the room to hike interest rates in q3 this year which is not priced in says petr krpata a bond and currency strategist at ing even if the risk environment continues improving usd should stay supported against low yielders such as eur and jpy particularly for usd jpy we see more upside ahead given the mix of rising stock markets and scope for higher ust yields this leaves the dollar in a bit of a sweet spot that could ultimately see it remain bid for a while yet regardless of what happens with china it could also be said that it leaves the euro in a situation where it s damned if negotiators do reach a deal and damned if they don t that s because the u s trade fight with china is one of the key drivers behind the economic slowdown seen on the continent over the last six months homegrown headwinds such as new regulations that have stymied production in the automotive sector were a big part of last year s economic cooling but not the only part by any stretch of the imagination the european and particularly german manufacturing sectors are sensitive to changes in demand from china whose economy has been hobbled by the trade war with the u s most economists see growth in the world s second largest economy continuing to decelerate in 2019 even if the trade conflict is brought to an amicable end the us and china seem to be inching towards an agreement on trade but while the dampening down of trade tensions between the world s two largest economies would clearly be a positive development it is unlikely to provide much of a boost to global growth this year meanwhile it seems that most of the good news on trade is now priced into asset markets says neil shearing chief economist at capital economics the european central bank will on thursday adjust its economic forecasts for 2019 following the latest data and potentiall set out details of any measures it intends to implement in order to support the eurozone economy this year as it grapples with after effects of the trade war and political headwinds brexit and the looming european union parliament elections in may may continue to undermine appetite for the euro and eurozone economic growth during the months ahead these will also be key concerns for the ecb although it might not want to be seen to acknowledge that

advertisment the foreign exchange market forex for international currencies is the largest and most liquid market in the world according to the bank of international settlements the forex market accounts for more than 5 trillion in trading volume per day dwarfing other markets like major stock markets the forex market consists of trading pairs of international fiat currencies pegged against each other where traders speculate and hedge risk on the price of a specific national currency appreciating or depreciating relative to another currency interestingly there is no central forex exchange and all trading is open 24 hours a day more than 5 days a week with otc financial trading centers operating in major cities around the world a brief history of the contemporary forex market the origins of money are complicated and have consistently evolved throughout human history money exchanging services of various currencies date back to ancient egypt and have continued in various forms since then historically most currencies were pegged to a stable financial asset considered to be sound money primarily gold or silver however that all changed following the onset of ww1 where many countries abandoned the gold standard that had been prevalent among international trade and exchange for decades several forex markets emerged following ww1 in the run up to ww2 notably the kleinwort family who led the way in the foreign exchange market in london at the end of ww2 the bretton woods accord was signed in 1944 in bretton woods new hampshire and paved the way for a series of developments that have come to define the international monetary system in its contemporary iteration the bretton woods accord was an international monetary agreement between sovereign nations to institute a governing monetary order between the u s canada western europe japan and australia the order required that governments tie their national currencies to gold prescribing that exchange rates must be maintained within 1 percent absence of banking crises during the period of the bretton woods agreement 1945 to 1971 wikipedia the accord also formed the international monetary fund imf and stipulated the system rely on the u s financial system u s president richard nixon s nullification of the bretton woods accord in 1971 effectively ended the fixed price peg of the us dollar and by extension many other world currencies to gold the us dollar officially became a floating fiat currency and was adopted as a reserve currency by many foreign nations who continue to use it as a reserve currency today a system of free floating currencies eventually materialized and is the modern international system of currencies that has allowed the forex market to flourish into the behemoth that it has become with no stable price mechanism i e gold national currencies consistently fluctuate in value relative to each other creating ideal opportunities for major market participants to profit and hedge risk on the spread between currencies how forex markets work there are three primary forex markets spot forwards and futures markets the spot market is by far the most popular and consists of the real asset that both the futures and forwards markets are based on forex market participants range from international banks to enterprises that deal in various countries who are looking to hedge risk on the exchange rates they use for dealing in multiple currencies the spot market is where currencies are bought and sold at their current market price the prices of currencies fluctuate consistently many times by only a tiny fraction of their current value a mixture of economic political and supply demand affect the price of currencies and markets are exceptionally liquid for primary trading pairs around the world for instance the eur usd trading pair is the most traded currency pair in the world listed as eur usd makes the eur the base currency and usd the counter the price in the spot market next to this pair indicates the price of one euro in usd there will be a buy and a sell price and the difference between the two is commonly referred to as the spread eur usd chart tradingview spreads leverage the spread between currencies is often minuscule and price quote changes are typically measured to the fourth decimal place known as a pip traders are always buying or selling the first currency in a pair and can profit or sustain losses from the resulting movement of the spread obviously with such tiny spreads profiting from forex trading often requires trading high volumes or trading on margin due to the massive liquidity of the forex market banks allow for significant leverage for traders to buy currencies on margin trades on the spot market are settled in cash and are comprised of an agreement between counter parties to buy a specific amount of one currency in exchange for a fixed amount of another currency at the current market price forwards markets in forex trading deal in contracts that specify explicit parameters for buying or selling currencies in an otc transaction futures contracts are settled on major commodities exchanges like cboe and cme and contain specific delivery dates and standard sizes futures and forwards contracts are typically settled in cash also and are often used for hedging risk on future price movements market participants numerous entities participate in the forex market and it is a primary reason for the enormous liquidity of the market the forex market is divided into tiers based on the amount of money being traded the upper layer consists of major commercial banks and securities dealers who account for 51 percent of all transactions in the market citigroup inc is the leading currency trader in the foreign exchange market accounting for 12 9 percent of the overall market in 2016 the subsequent layers are comprised of smaller banks corporations market makers insurance companies mutual funds and more in particular one of the primary applications of the forex market is for companies that deal in multiple international currencies to hedge risk they may need to pay employees located in numerous countries or reduce the adverse consequences of price fluctuations during business transactions for example if company a is based in the u s and wishes to use the eur usd trading pair to buy euros to pay employees located in europe they would tap the forex market however if the price quote rapidly changes between several hours and company a is set to exchange a large sum of usd for eur then a small adverse price fluctuation could have a significant impact on their bottom line companies may also leverage futures or forwards contracts to hedge against adverse price movements on predetermined transaction dates which is a widespread practice among international corporations another major participant is central banks of countries who use foreign exchange fixing as a specific indicator for market trends and evaluating their own currencies similarly central banks tap foreign exchange services with reserve currencies i e the us dollar to attempt to stabilize markets forex trading a growing portion of forex market participants is retail traders who invest through banks or brokers the two primary types of brokers for retail traders are brokers and market makers brokers take a fee from customers for finding the best price and trading on behalf of them while market makers are the principal in a transaction against a retail trader the demand for social trading services has become more prevalent as retail investors also seek to become more prudent in their broker selection following endemic fraud that many retail traders have historically faced regulation has also increased noticeably in forex markets over the last decade and many smaller brokerage companies employing questionable operational practices have been removed from the market other forex participants include money remittance companies remittance companies provide a highly practical service for migrant workers sending money home but have been justly criticized for their exorbitant fees and inefficient services forex brokers we have covered quite a few forex brokers here on blockonomi these brokers are open to retail traders or professionals and offer a wide range of trading instruments such as forex cryptocurrencies commodities shares and so on they typically use contracts for difference cfds which means you don t own the underlying asset but they are essentially a bet between the opening and closing prices of a specified financial instrument digital assets and the future of forex trading the sheer size of the forex market is astounding driven by an ecosystem of floating fiat currencies without a stable price peg the forex market has come to dominate global financial markets as the most liquid asset class in the world interestingly the emergence of cryptocurrencies and digital assets have provided a viable alternative to traditional foreign exchange services like remittances digital assets are also expected to become more ingratiated with the conventional financial system and the expansion of trading pairs of many digital assets serves as a stark indicator of their inclusion within the financial portfolio and investment services of brokers the forex market is a unique financial ecosystem that has been referenced as the closest market to perfect competition due to its massive size and continual operation however proponents of sound money like bitcoin and gold take a hesitant outlook on the long term sustainability of floating fiat currencies the forex market s size and complexity are a direct result of the dissolution of bretton woods and are indicative of the challenges required for an international monetary order of various national floating currencies to persist without the potential for black swan events the post what is forex trading complete

amortization of acquisition related intangibles and previously the net amortization of debt discount on the company s convertible senior notes as well as income tax adjustments these items are excluded because the decisions that give rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period but instead for the company s long term benefit over multiple periods specifically management is excluding the following items from its non gaap earnings per share as applicable for the periods presented in the q4 fy19 financial statements and for its non gaap estimates for q1 and fy20 stock based expenses the company s compensation strategy includes the use of stock based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives it is principally aimed at aligning their

executive summary in the first of a series of reports examining how the fed s framework and toolkit may evolve in the coming years we look at potential changes to the fed s current inflation target after watching inflation average less than 2 over the past two decades officials would like to see it run slightly higher in order to provide more space to cut real interest rates during future recessions to facilitate 2 inflation on a more sustained basis fed officials are assessing the merits of average inflation targeting or price level targeting with past misses on inflation no longer treated as bygones actual inflation and inflation expectations should run higher as a result nominal interest rates should be higher the yield curve should steepen and the dollar should depreciate all else equal monetary policy review underway at the fed by most measures the current economic expansion in the united states which is currently in its tenth year is on solid footing nevertheless officials at the fed are starting to think about strategies to better achieve its dual mandates of price stability and maximum employment throughout the business cycle and to combat future downturns for example richard clarida the vice chairman of the federal reserve board discussed the fed s ongoing review of its policy strategy and tools in a recent speech 1 clarida noted that the neutral interest rate so called r appears to have fallen in the united states over the past decade or so in that regard the mid point of the fed s target range for the fed funds rate is only 2 38 at present and it appears that the federal open market committee fomc may be nearing the end of its tightening cycle if it has not been reached already with only 200 bps or so of room to cut rates would the fed have enough traditional ammunition to combat the next recession the limited capacity to stimulate growth is unlikely to be an issue unique to the current business cycle in this series of reports we will look at some of the new strategies and policy tools that the fed may employ in the future as well as the implications of some of those potential changes future reports will analyze negative interest rates renewed asset purchases i e quantitative easing and the fed s output gap framework we should stress that the strategy review at the fed is ongoing and that the fomc has not yet made any changes to its monetary strategy or policy toolkit but we think it is prudent to discuss some potential changes to the way the fed may operate going forward so that readers are prepared for those changes if and when they occur is the fed s current inflation target broken the united states congress has tasked the fed with a mandate of promoting stable prices although congress did not explicitly define the term congress also gave the fed the goals of full employment and moderating long term interest rates in contrast the government of new zealand in 1989 gave its central bank a single mandate of an explicit inflation target midpoint of a 1 to 3 target range and governments in canada and the united kingdom gave their respective central banks similar inflation targets in the following decade the fed did not adopt an explicit inflation target of 2 until 2012 2 broadly speaking the proliferation of inflation targets for central banks at the end of the 20th century was for the most part a means for them to bring inflation lower the pioneers of explicit inflation targeting including governments in new zealand canada and the united kingdom introduced inflation targeting during periods when inflation was high and authorities wanted to reduce it an explicit target was thought to demonstrate a central bank s commitment to low inflation and improve its ability to do so by reining in inflation expectations for the most part central banks the federal reserve included were successful in their efforts to reduce inflation from the rates that prevailed throughout the 1990s and the early years of the current century but some observers could reasonably argue that central banks have been too successful in reducing inflation in the wake of the great recession the risks to stable prices have generally been skewed toward mild deflation rather than unacceptably high inflation for example cpi inflation in japan has averaged just 0 5 even though the bank of japan currently has a price stability target of 2 the primary objective of the european central bank is price stability which it defines as an inflation rate that is below but close to 2 over the medium term yet the core rate of cpi inflation which is a good measure of underlying inflationary pressures in an economy has not been close to 2 for a decade figure 1 in the united states core pce inflation has been running below the fed s 2 target for almost the entirety of the current cycle and has averaged just 1 6 since the end of the great recession figure 2 an extended undershoot of a central bank s inflation target can lead to depressed inflationary expectations that can make it difficult for the central bank to raise the realized inflation rate the practical issue of depressed inflationary expectations and abnormally low inflation is that it limits the central bank s ability to reduce real interest rates to stimulate economic activity during a downturn a central bank can run out of conventional ammunition when its policy rate nears the effective lower bound elb near 0 consequently the fed s policy review is intended to identify ways to strengthen its credibility in generating 2 inflation over the business cycle and give the fomc more recession fighting capability when future downturns arrive we now turn to four potential changes that the fed could make to its inflation target leading contenders average inflation rate and price level targeting traditionally the fed and almost all other central banks has taken a forward looking approach to inflation past misses on inflation whether to the upside or downside are not considered when setting policy in other words the fed lets bygones be bygones however average inflation rate targeting and price level targeting plt would challenge that convention average inflation targeting involves an explicit aim for inflation to average a given rate over time for example if the fed adopted this framework with its current 2 target it would aim for 2 inflation on average over the medium or longer term if inflation were to undershoot for a given period of time then overshoots would be tolerated with the specific aim of raising the mean rate of inflation over a multiyear period with the explicit aim for inflation to average a given rate over time inflation expectations and realized inflation should be higher consequently reducing the time monetary policy is constrained by the elb 3 under a strategy of average inflation targeting the fed could choose the length of the lookback period or the number of years in which inflation s prior performance was factored into policy decisions that would limit the potential for inflation expectations to become unglued policymakers would continue to emphasize price stability in terms of the rate of inflation making it only a moderate departure from the current single target framework implicitly the fomc already has moved toward average inflation targeting through its recent emphasis on the symmetric nature of the 2 target 4 a more radical but similar approach in our view would be price level targeting plt with plt the fed would attempt to keep the level of prices rising at a steady rate similar to average inflation targeting there would also be a makeup period for times when policy was constrained by the elb yet with plt the makeup period could be quite long for example if the fomc set the price level in 2006 to be consistent with 2 trend inflation the fomc would still be waiting to raise interest rates figure 3 the built in makeup period would be a form of forward guidance because the fomc would be committing to keeping monetary policy accommodative until the price level as opposed to the inflation rate returned to target because inflation would need to rise measurably to return the price level to target inflation expectations would be higher especially in periods of low inflation 5 in short monetary policy should be constrained by the elb less frequently 6 a downside to plt is its potential to lead to monetary tightening if prices rise faster than the fed s desired path due to temporary factors like a spike in gasoline prices this potential disadvantage to plt is why some central bankers tend to favor it only temporarily 7 once the price level catches up to its targeted path the fed would revert back to its current 2 inflation target if history is a useful guide the fomc likely would look through temporary deviations of the inflation rate from target that were caused by significant changes in energy prices yet even on a temporary basis plt has some disadvantages first communicating such a regime shift to the public is not likely to be easy after a prolonged undershoot of the price level it may take an extended period of high inflation to bring prices up to the desired level if not well understood temporary plt would not stimulate the economy during downturns and it also risks a marked unmooring of inflation expectations during the makeup period financial imbalances may also accumulate during this lower for longer period 8 but the explicit price level goal could inhibit the fomc s flexibility to address such imbalances if more targeted macro prudential policies are deemed inadequate because congress has tasked the fed with managing multiple priorities the fed has historically shied away from adopting explicit policy rules such as the taylor rule so as not to be constrained in its flexibility other approaches raise the inflation target or use an inflation range a more straightforward solution for generating more room to reduce real rates would be for the fomc to raise its current 2 inflation target a higher inflation target would signal the central bank s willingness to tolerate greater inflation thereby lifting inflation expectations and presumably realized inflation however the fed has all but ruled out a shift to a higher inflation target in its recent communications while it would be a relatively simple change to the framework it could de anchor inflation expectations and lead to political concerns around the impact of higher inflation on the public thus we see this as a low probability option for the fed moving forward switching to a target range for inflation may be more feasible boston fed president eric rosengren and former new york fed president william dudley have previously advocated for specifying a range of acceptable inflation outcomes say from 1 5 3 0 or a bit narrower at 1 5 2 5 9 the upper end of the range would give the fomc greater flexibility in remaining accommodative after periods at the elb alternatively the lower end of the range would give the fomc cover to tighten policy for financial stability reasons similar to average inflation targeting the fomc s emphasis on the symmetric nature of its target could also be considered a step toward an inflation range yet the adoption of specific range would give more clarity on the degree to which an under shoot or an over shoot would be tolerated by the fomc before triggering a policy change while we acknowledge the potential merits of this framework fed policymakers have seemingly not been as keen on adopting an inflation range in recent communications it could resurface as an option if policymakers do not choose to adopt average inflation rate targeting or plt but for now we see it as a relatively unlikely option implications for financial markets all of the options discussed above with the possible exception of an inflation range should lead to higher inflation expectations and consequently higher realized rates of inflation although these potential changes to the fed s inflation targeting framework should not have any effects on real variables such as the economy s long run potential growth rate and the natural unemployment rate they could have implications for nominal variables for starters higher inflation expectations should lead to higher bond yields everything else equal consequently the neutral fed funds rate should be higher on a nominal basis although the neutral rate on a real basis so called r should remain largely unaffected furthermore higher inflation expectations could lead to a steeper yield curve everything else equal it is also possible that higher inflation leads to a more active treasury inflation protected securities tips market although that is not a given since some analysis suggests that while higher inflation would be less variable 10 changing the inflation target could also have implications for the value of the u s dollar if the policy change leads to higher inflation expectations and realized rates of inflation in the united states that should lead to a weaker greenback all else equal meanwhile the dollar could also face headwinds to the extent that u s rates are lower for longer in the next cycle as the fed tries to stoke higher inflation conclusion of the four potential changes to the fed s current 2 inflation target framework we view average inflation targeting and price level targeting as the leading contenders both regimes look to generate inflation more closely in line with the fed s goal and suggest policy would be constrained by the elb less frequently however we give a slight edge to average inflation targeting since it continues to focus on the inflation rate rather than the price level and therefore could be viewed as a less radical policy shift and easier to communicate in fact the fomc has already implicitly moved toward an average inflation target by more frequently describing its 2 target as symmetric an inflation range may also be relatively easy to communicate but may not be successful in driving inflation expectations higher since sub 2 would still be tolerated a higher inflation target is very unlikely given the political pushback it would receive as well as the fact that inflation would likely be higher all the time not just during makeup periods importantly the successful transition to any of the proposed frameworks depends on the fed credibly communicating the change if businesses and households do not fully understand the changes or do not believe the policy is credible inflation may continue to come in lower than target if that is the case policy would still likely be encumbered by the effective lower bound on a more regular basis which would cause the fomc to stay lower for longer and potentially spur financial imbalances in light of these challenges the fomc may need to do more than alter its inflation framework to mitigate the next downturn in our next reports we look at some of the tools the fomc could possibly employ to better achieve its policy goals beginning with negative rates 1 see clarida richard h

by lee kah whyesingapore march 4 ani the global consumer confidence in india is at peak this was revealed in the latest conference board global consumer confidence survey which is conducted in collaboration with nielsen the survey which was conducted over the internet polls more than 32 000 consumers in 64 countries across asia pacific europe latin america the middle east africa and north america india had a consumer confidence index cci score of 133 in the fourth quarter of 2018 edging past the philippines 131 and indonesia 127 india maintain its number one position from the third quarter when it scored 130 on the index whereas philippines and indonesia were joint fourthin q3 of 2018 with an identical score of 126 south korea has the most pessimistic consumers in the world people there are worried about rising inflation lower wage growth a weak stock market unemployment and global trade uncertainties meanwhile the global consumer confidence index increased one point to 107 in fourth quarter of 2018 the highest in 14 years the main indicators measured by conference board cci are optimism towards job prospects health of personal finances and spending intentions in the next 12 months globally consumers perceptions towards job prospects and personal finances remain positive but consumer sentiment towards spending remain low and less optimistic because of anticipated higher prices due to higher oil prices creating inflationary pressures uncertainty with regards to global trade falling currency and rising interest rates affecting borrowing costs with the exception of north america where consumer confidence is at its highest for years developed economies are generally less optimistic with a reading of 100 on the cci considered positive european consumers tended to be the least optimistic with an average score below 90 whereas their asian and north american counterparts tended to be more upbeat consumers in the latin america middle east and africa are considered to be cautiously optimistic with a score in the nineties but all regions have seen improvements in consumer confidence in the last year the survey shows the cci in the asia pacific increased three points to 117 major markets such as china india indonesia and japan all improved although the cci for asia pacific is generally good people in the more mature economics like australia new zealand singapore and hong kong are more cautious abouttheir spending but these countries continue to offer good opportunities for consumer businesses while consumer confidence remains high in china there are signs from retail spending data that consumers are spending less an impact as a result of trade tensions with the us the residents in the second largest economy in the world are also beginning to be less positive about jobs on balance consumers globally are somewhat more confident compared with a year ago the global uptick in confidence is a positive sign for economic and business growth in 2019 consumer confidence surveys are seen as a proxy measure to gauge short term demand by assessing people s views on the economy a positive trend indicates the possibility of higher spending by consumers in the short term and thatmay boost economic growth however several economic headwinds are expected to affect global gdp like the yet unresolved trade dispute between china and the us rising interest rates inflationary pressures and uncertain oil prices indeed some economists expect that gdp growth will moderate in 2019 fears of significant pullback of global trade could undermine growth outlook for both emerging and mature economies particularly those that depend on global trade this is after a steady rise in gdp in recent years despite trade fears fluctuating oil prices and worries about the impact of brexit according to international monetary fund data real global gdp growth has been inching up since 2015 at a rate of between 3 3 percent in 2016 to 3 7 percent in 2018 however growth is not even with emerging markets growing at a higher rate of 4 7 percent in 2018 compared with 2 4 percent in the advanced economies for india the results of this survey mirrors a reserve bank of india rbi survey released in early february which indicates that consumer confidence in india is at a two year high the rbi survey was conducted across 13 major indian cities the rise in consumer sentiment is likely due to inflation hitting an 18 month low in december as oil prices stabilised and the rupee appreciated although 76 percent of respondents in the rbi

singapore march 4 ani the global consumer confidence in india is at peak this was revealed in the latest conference board global consumer confidence survey which is conducted in collaboration with nielsen the survey which was conducted over the internet polls more than 32 000 consumers in 64 countries across asia pacific europe latin america the middle east africa and north america india had a consumer confidence index cci score of 133 in the fourth quarter of 2018 edging past the philippines 131 and indonesia 127 india maintain its number one position from the third quarter when it scored 130 on the index whereas philippines and indonesia were joint fourth in q3 of 2018 with an identical score of 126 south korea has the most pessimistic consumers in the world people there are worried about rising inflation lower wage growth a weak stock market unemployment and global trade uncertainties meanwhile the global consumer confidence index increased one point to 107 in fourth quarter of 2018 the highest in 14 years the main indicators measured by conference board cci are optimism towards job prospects health of personal finances and spending intentions in the next 12 months globally consumers perceptions towards job prospects and personal finances remain positive but consumer sentiment towards spending remain low and less optimistic because of anticipated higher prices due to higher oil prices creating inflationary pressures uncertainty with regards to global trade falling currency and rising interest rates affecting borrowing costs with the exception of north america where consumer confidence is at its highest for years developed economies are generally less optimistic with a reading of 100 on the cci considered positive european consumers tended to be the least optimistic with an average score below 90 whereas their asian and north american counterparts tended to be more upbeat consumers in the latin america middle east and africa are considered to be cautiously optimistic with a score in the nineties but all regions have seen improvements in consumer confidence in the last year the survey shows the cci in the asia pacific increased three points to 117 major markets such as china india indonesia and japan all improved although the cci for asia pacific is generally good people in the more mature economics like australia new zealand singapore and hong kong are more cautious about their spending but these countries continue to offer good opportunities for consumer businesses while consumer confidence remains high in china there are signs from retail spending data that consumers are spending less an impact as a result of trade tensions with the us the residents in the second largest economy in the world are also beginning to be less positive about jobs on balance consumers globally are somewhat more confident compared with a year ago the global uptick in confidence is a positive sign for economic and business growth in 2019 consumer confidence surveys are seen as a proxy measure to gauge short term demand by assessing people s views on the economy a positive trend indicates the possibility of higher spending by consumers in the short term and that may boost economic growth however several economic headwinds are expected to affect global gdp like the yet unresolved trade dispute between china and the us rising interest rates inflationary pressures and uncertain oil prices indeed some economists expect that gdp growth will moderate in 2019 fears of significant pullback of global trade could undermine growth outlook for both emerging and mature economies particularly those that depend on global trade this is after a steady rise in gdp in recent years despite trade fears fluctuating oil prices and worries about the impact of brexit according to international monetary fund data real global gdp growth has been inching up since 2015 at a rate of between 3 3 percent in 2016 to 3 7 percent in 2018 however growth is not even with emerging markets growing at a higher rate of 4 7 percent in 2018 compared with 2 4 percent in the advanced economies for india the results of this survey mirrors a reserve bank of india rbi survey released in early february which indicates that consumer confidence in india is at a two year high the rbi survey was conducted across 13 major indian cities the rise in consumer sentiment is likely due to inflation hitting an 18 month low in december as oil prices stabilised and the rupee appreciated although 76 percent of respondents in the rbi survey expect inflation to rise in 2019 consumers say they expect a rise in income and employment opportunities in the same period the results of this survey come at a time when pm modi s government is facing criticism due to a lower job creation rate resulting in unemployment touching a 45 year high in 2017 18 according to the national sample survey office s periodic labour force survey released recently going forward india s consumer confidence may be dampened by poorer macroeconomic fundamentals like a weak currency widening deficits rising prices mounting bad loans and stricter credit conditions however this impact is

nordic fx nok sek weekly outlook nok sek eyeing ecb rate decision and fed chairman s speech norwegian krone focused on domestic gdp and industrial orders swedish krona waiting for comments from key riksbank officials see our free guide to learn how to use economic news in your trading strategy how may ecb fed affect nok sek the norwegian krone and swedish krona may be thrown around this week by central bank related events on thursday the ecb will announce what many are expecting to be a hold on rates what eur sek traders will likely be paying attention to are comments from ecb president mario draghi following the rate decision growth in europe has been decelerating unexpectedly quickly which may in turn force the central bank to revise down its inflation forecast the already gloomy outlook may be further dampened by the upcoming european parliament ep elections which may hit markets particularly hard this year given the economic and political state of the eu the ecb has repeatedly cited political risk in europe as a factor influencing monetary policy because so much of sweden s and norway s economic activity depends on strong eu growth comments from ecb officials that signal a worse than expected outlook may weaken the export heavy nordic currencies this in large part has to do with the unique political economy of eu nordic relations adding to the european front bank of england boe governor mark carney will be testifying to the house of lords which will almost certainly include comments and questions on brexit many riksbank officials have commented that risks from abroad namely the eu uk divorce have been a key concern for swedish monetary policymakers in the united states a round of key economic data releases may give key insight on the fed s intentions and outlook that has scope to influence the spectrum of dollar based currency pairs including usd sek fed chairman jerome powell will be giving a speech on monetary policy normalization saturday but that is likely to show up in the subsequent week s price action outcomes carrying dovish implications may initially cause usd sek to fall it may then seesaw higher however if worries about slower growth induce risk aversion and cause investors to dump sek and instead flock to the anti risk us dollar last week the chairman went through several congressional testimonies which didn t appear to have a significant impact on the pair this may be in large part due to the comments being broadly in line with his previous commentary better than expected us gdp and disappointing ism data did inspire volatility however with usd rising in both cases indicators to watch out for in sweden norway in sweden the economic calendar remains relatively light which means the export driven currency may be on particularly high alert on risks from abroad sek may move on commentary from riksbank officials on thursday and friday but could be overshadowed by global macroeconomic themes this is opposite to last week s schedule when better than expected gdp caused usd sek to plunge and temporarily reverse its upward trend in norway gdp and industrial production may be points of interest for nok traders in addition to the events from abroad due to the country s strong reliance on the petroleum sector the oil linked currency may be particularly sensitive to changes in market sentiment particularly if it is coming out of europe despite only contributing a small portion to the world s total output for crude oil norway is one of the top exporters of natural gas with the eu as its biggest client any change in demand in the european continent will be quickly reflected in the country s exports and may therefore impact the krone and obx norway s benchmark equity index usd sek usd nok omx obx since the start of the year usd sek is up over four percent with the peak on february 19 when the pair extended past 9 4066 after various measures of cpi data in sweden all fell short of expectations the monthly chart shows usd sek up for the month and is now reaching heights not touched since december 2016 and march 2009 usd sek monthly chart sweden s benchmark omx equity index has risen over 15 percent since the start of the year but recently broke its steep support line after negative rsi divergence signaled weakening upside momentum this steep incline appears to be the result of the riksbank s loose monetary policy and investors expectations that rates will remain low and conducive for countering downtrends in the business cycle omx equity index daily chart usd nok also appears to be aiming for new heights not tested since 2016 given the slower growth in europe it possible this upward trend will continue as exports to the continent weaken and impact the krone the norges bank has stated it will most likely raise rates this month but if the outlook weakens and domestic economic data underperforms it could be pushed further into the year since the start of 2019 norway s obx stock index has risen a little over 10 percent but is struggling to consistently trade above 805 00 the movement in the benchmark index very closely mirrors the movement in crude oil prices demonstrating norway s strong reliance on the petroleum sector when overlaid with a krona weighted index the three move in almost perfect harmony because oil is a sentiment linked asset which frequently responds to changes in global demand monitoring events which may sour risk on behavior might be a prudent approach when trading nok however it is not guaranteed that one will always predict

silver equivalent ounces including 1 4 million silver ounces compared to production of 4 7 million consolidated silver equivalent ounces including 2 1 million silver ounces during 2017 the significant increase in consolidated silver equivalent production with a corresponding decrease in silver production relative to 2017 was primarily the result of the san rafael mine experiencing its first full year of operation after declaring commercial production in december 2017 san rafael contributed over 190 greater zinc production and over 125 greater lead production with approximately 50 lower silver production at the cosalá operations due to mine sequencing in the part of the san rafael deposit with the lowest silver grades operations at the galena complex were also negatively impacted by two separate operational issues in the first of half of 2018 involving its no 3 shaft that inhibited normal hoisting for approximately 27 days in total as previously disclosed that also caused reductions in silver and lead production in 2018 as a result of the increased silver equivalent production revenues increased by 14 1 million or 26 from 54 3 million during 2017 to 68 4 million during 2018 despite low metal prices in the second half of the year net loss increased by 7 8 million from 3 5 million during 2017 to 11 3 million during 2018 largely due to non cash and non reoccurring items the increase in net loss was primarily attributable to higher cost of sales as san rafael ramped up to full production in q4 2018 higher depletion and amortization reflecting a full year of production from san rafael pershing gold transaction costs the write down of an asset a contingency on value added taxes and higher income tax expense offset by higher net revenue from increased silver equivalent production a gain on the disposal of assets and gains on derivative instruments consolidated costs of sales were 8 29 oz equivalent silver by product cash costs were negative 0 63 oz silver and aisc were 9 80 oz silver representing year over year decreases of 18 107 and 26 respectively the improvement in cash costs was a result of the significant increase in zinc and lead production primarily from the san rafael mine compared to 2017 when the company s previous mine nuestra señora was in production the base metal production increases were offset by decreases in the realized prices for zinc and lead during the year which negatively impacted by product cash costs and aisc further information concerning the consolidated and individual mine operations is included in the

budgeted capital of 10 11 million the increase in silver production is due to greater expected mill throughput at san rafael in 2019 as the initial ramp up in 2018 has been completed the increase in cash cost and all in sustaining cost per ounce is due to the lower assumed metal prices affecting estimated by product metal revenue from the san rafael and galena mines the company assumed 14 50 per

in silver and lead production in 2018 as a result of the increased silver equivalent production revenues increased by 14 1 million or 26 from 54 3 million during 2017 to 68 4 million during 2018 despite low metal prices in the second half of the year net loss increased by 7 8 million from 3 5 million during 2017 to 11 3 million during 2018 largely due to non cash and non reoccurring items the increase in net loss was primarily attributable to higher cost of sales as san rafael ramped up to full production in q4 2018 higher depletion and amortization reflecting a full year of production from san rafael pershing gold transaction costs the write down of an asset a contingency on value added taxes and higher income tax expense offset by higher net revenue from increased silver

and aisc were 9 80 oz silver representing year over year decreases of 18 107 and 26 respectively the improvement in cash costs was a result of the significant increase in zinc and lead production primarily from the san rafael mine compared to 2017 when the company s previous mine nuestra señora was in production the base metal production increases were offset by decreases in the realized prices for zinc and lead during the year which negatively impacted by product cash costs and aisc further information concerning the consolidated and individual mine operations is included in the

singapore march 4 ani the global consumer confidence in india is at peak this was revealed in the latest conference board global consumer confidence survey which is conducted in collaboration with nielsen the survey which was conducted over the internet polls more than 32 000 consumers in 64 countries across asia pacific europe latin america the middle east africa and north america india had a consumer confidence index cci score of 133 in the fourth quarter of 2018 edging past the philippines 131 and indonesia 127 india maintain its number one position from the third quarter when it scored 130 on the index whereas philippines and indonesia were joint fourth in q3 of 2018 with an identical score of 126 south korea has the most pessimistic consumers in the world people there are worried about rising inflation lower wage growth a weak stock market unemployment and global trade uncertainties meanwhile the global consumer confidence index increased one point to 107 in fourth quarter of 2018 the highest in 14 years the main indicators measured by conference board cci are optimism towards job prospects health of personal finances and spending intentions in the next 12 months globally consumers perceptions towards job prospects and personal finances remain positive but consumer sentiment towards spending remain low and less optimistic because of anticipated higher prices due to higher oil prices creating inflationary pressures uncertainty with regards to global trade falling currency and rising interest rates affecting borrowing costs with the exception of north america where consumer confidence is at its highest for years developed economies are generally less optimistic with a reading of 100 on the cci considered positive european consumers tended to be the least optimistic with an average score below 90 whereas their asian and north american counterparts tended to be more upbeat consumers in the latin america middle east and africa are considered to be cautiously optimistic with a score in the nineties but all regions have seen improvements in consumer confidence in the last year the survey shows the cci in the asia pacific increased three points to 117 major markets such as china india indonesia and japan all improved although the cci for asia pacific is generally good people in the more mature economics like australia new zealand singapore and hong kong are more cautious about their spending but these countries continue to offer good opportunities for consumer businesses while consumer confidence remains high in china there are signs from retail spending data that consumers are spending less an impact as a result of trade tensions with the us the residents in the second largest economy in the world are also beginning to be less positive about jobs on balance consumers globally are somewhat more confident compared with a year ago the global uptick in confidence is a positive sign for economic and business growth in 2019 consumer confidence surveys are seen as a proxy measure to gauge short term demand by assessing people s views on the economy a positive trend indicates the possibility of higher spending by consumers in the short term and that may boost economic growth however several economic headwinds are expected to affect global gdp like the yet unresolved trade dispute between china and the us rising interest rates inflationary pressures and uncertain oil prices indeed some economists expect that gdp growth will moderate in 2019 fears of significant pullback of global trade could undermine growth outlook for both emerging and mature economies particularly those that depend on global trade this is after a steady rise in gdp in recent years despite trade fears fluctuating oil prices and worries about the impact of brexit according to international monetary fund data real global gdp growth has been inching up since 2015 at a rate of between 3 3 percent in 2016 to 3 7 percent in 2018 however growth is not even with emerging markets growing at a higher rate of 4 7 percent in 2018 compared with 2 4 percent in the advanced economies for india the results of this survey mirrors a reserve bank of india rbi survey released in early february which indicates that consumer confidence in india is at a two year high the rbi survey was conducted across 13 major indian cities the rise in consumer sentiment is likely due to inflation hitting an 18 month low in december as oil prices stabilised and the rupee appreciated although 76 percent of respondents in the rbi survey expect inflation to rise in 2019 consumers say they expect a rise in income and employment opportunities in the same period the results of this survey come at a time when pm modi s government is facing criticism due to a lower job creation rate resulting in unemployment touching a 45 year high in 2017 18 according to the national sample survey office s periodic labour force survey released recently going forward india s consumer confidence may be dampened by poorer macroeconomic fundamentals like a weak currency widening deficits rising prices mounting bad loans and stricter credit conditions however this impact is expected to be buffered by ramped up government spending and social programmes leading to the general elections ani
the sky didn t fall armageddon didn t arrive society didn t collapse but 10 years ago with the nation trying to emerge from the worst recession in decades all that wasn t obvious it was against that numbingly negative backdrop that investors on balance finally decided they would start bidding up stock prices rather than pulling them down hence was born on march 9 2009 one of the strongest bull markets ever people who exited the stock market around march 2009 and never re entered paid a huge price in terms of missed opportunities the subsequent rebound has been one of the strongest ever with the broad wilshire 5000 index up more than 300 percent including dividends hiring the right lawyer need to sue someone here s how to find the right lawyer here are some lessons we might have learned in the aftermath the market didn t wait for an all clear signal stocks began their rally against a bleak economic backdrop back in march 2009 nobody rang a bell that the worst was over unemployment stood at 8 7 percent and would continue rising for seven more months the nation s gdp gains were anemic housing prices still hadn t hit bottom and there were many other signs of lingering economic weakness but focusing too much on the negative headlines likely convinced many investors to get out at what turned out be a bottom noted michael grosso of tci wealth advisors in scottsdale arizona doing nothing at such times while perhaps feeling unsatisfying if not paralyzing often is the best move to make it all comes back to tuning out the noise and focusing on your goals grosso said market bottoms and tops don t become obvious except in hindsight safety seeking investors paid a big price the rebounding stock market tells only part of the story of missed opportunities sitting on the sidelines would not have been so bad if savers earned decent yields for parking their cash in money market funds bank certificates of deposit and other ultrasafe instruments but they didn t yields dropped sharply and remained depressed for a lengthy period in fact yields paid to savers still really haven t bounced back in a decisive way despite nine rate hikes by the federal reserve over the past couple years if you had parked 100 000 in six month cds in 2006 you would have earned more than 5 200 in interest that year according to jp morgan asset management that same scenario in 2018 would have generated less than 600 in interest banks and other lenders have been able to attract enough cash that they haven t needed to pay enticing yields or even decent ones so many people were traumatized by the 2007 2008 plunge when the stock market lost more than 50 percent that they were willing to accept dismal yields on cash investments every time since then when there was a sharp drop in the market people thought it was 2008 all over again said david daughtrey a financial adviser at copperwynd financial in scottsdale they were fighting the last battle some economic theory got thrown out with the wash one reason the past 10 years have been so baffling if not outright frustrating is that some of the economic principles that we learned in textbooks just didn t pan out for example daughtrey cites efforts by the federal reserve to cut interest rates close to zero then to embark on an unprecedented pump priming effort known as quantitative easing those measures and others should have triggered inflation and pushed up interest rates but the impact was modest at best those policies didn t have much impact on inflation said daughtrey economic theory says they should have as another example the federal government got its credit rating cut for the first time ever yet investors just shrugged treasury bonds and other government debt remained as popular as ever and their yields stayed low meanwhile the dollar appreciated against most other leading currencies also defying textbook explanations nor has the yawning federal debt which has climbed to unprecedented levels over the past dozen or so years done much to boost inflation or interest rates eventually the impact of these trends might be felt more decisively but for now persistently low inflation and interest rates at this point in the economic cycle given all the stimulus measures in place have been a conundrum americans haven t shared equally in the rebound the economy clearly is in a better place than it was 10 years ago but that doesn t mean the prosperity is widely shared despite the lowest unemployment rates in decades and substantial minimum wage bumps in arizona and other places many americans continue to struggle to make ends meet they lack access to credit or have jobs that pay inconsistent income the homeownership rate has barely budged from its recession lows an estimated 40 percent of families are living paycheck to paycheck and there are other signs of financial stress that you wouldn t expect 10 years into a recovery many of the positive headlines about our economy focus on low unemployment and rebounding incomes said progressive research group prosperity now in a january report on financial vulnerability having a job does not guarantee financial stability particularly if it doesn t pay enough to cover your living expenses or offer consistent pay and good benefits affluent americans have prospered partly because they have owned investments all along and thus were positioned to benefit from the housing and stock market rebounds other americans were left behind in part because they didn t own appreciating assets investors learned some lessons missed others while many americans still don t have stock market investments and paid the price the past decade was marked by a continuing rise of investor friendly products and services to which many people gravitated harry papp of l roy papp associates points to the advent of low cost index and exchange traded funds which gained popularity over the past 10 years or so these portfolios typically are widely diversified and feature lower investor borne fees all else the same you ll get better results with them he said however jonathan clements author of the humbledollar com financial blog said he s concerned that some people might have learned the wrong things from the past 10 years for example he points to those who assume u s stocks always will lead the pack simply because they have in recent years looking back over the past decade many folks have concluded that u s stocks always outperform foreign shares that bonds are for losers and that all you need to own are large company stocks especially large technology companies he said yet over the prior decade from roughly 1999 to 2009 much of the reverse was true the lesson here is that markets and investments move in cycles and no investments or asset classes perform well all the time that s why it s important to build and stick with a broadly and globally diversified portfolio that includes stocks bonds cash and various

monrovia charles sirleaf the son of former president ellen johnson sirleaf and the former executive governor milton weeks spent the weekend behind bars moments following the release of two major reports an independent review report funded by the u s government and prepared by kroll associates inc and the special presidential task force regarding allegations of the disappearance of new liberian dollar banknotes and the controversy surrounding the disbursement of us 25 million intended to mop up excess liberian dollars on the market in stabilize the rapidly increasing exchange note between the liberian dollar and the united states dollars report by rodney d sieh mr abraham darius dillon chair of political affairs in the opposition liberty party says while the arrest of sirleaf weeks and others is welcomed any form of selective justice should be rejected there should be no sacred cows whilst we support the arrest of past govt officials linked to the missing money report we demand arrest of current govt officials that are also linked to mishandling and squandering of the us25 million as revealed in the same report we demand the arrest of finance minister samuel tweah central bank governor nat patray and all others involved for further investigation and prosecution where necessary risks cited in both reports both reports point discrepancies in the handling of both funds which have been the subject of massive security over the past year since the administration of president george manneh weah assumed office last january the kroll analysis of delivery documentation provided by the central bank of liberia cbl confirmed that new banknotes totaling l 15 506 billion were received into the cbl s reserve vaults while the kroll report found no information to support allegations that a container of banknotes went missing it does point out several discrepancies the report raises concerns regarding the overall accuracy and completeness of the cbl s internal records and identifies systemic and procedural weaknesses at the cbl and identifies shortcomings in liberia s fiscal and monetary management processes that are longstanding and continue to the present day kroll found 1 9 billion or us 12 million discrepancy on december 10 and december 28 2017 delivery additionally 55 000 and 160 000 discrepancy between what is confirmed received by the money changer and what is reported given by cbl a huge disparity analysts say warrants an investigation section 3 2 7 of the kroll report captioned discrepancies in relation to mop up exercise vividly placed a three count indictment on president weah s technical economic management team temt headed by samuel d tweh and old man nathaniel patray finance and development planning minister samuel tweah the report noted the approach taken by the cbl to implement the usd mop up exercise whereby small teams of bank personnel directly purchased ldr from local businesses and foreign exchange bureaus in exchange for usd notes created an enhanced level of risks with respect to i potential misappropriation of banknotes ii potential opportunity for money laundering and iii potential execution of transactions with illegal businesses consequently there is a risk that significant funds were unaccounted for by the cbl and kroll therefore recommends that this matter merits further understanding the detailed report by the special presidential investigation team pit on the infusion of us 25 million to mop up excess liberian dollars recommended that given the many discrepancies noted in the manner in which the mop up exercise was conducted in relation to the infusion of the us 25 million into the liberian economy and the time and resource limitations of the pit tc the investigation that the temt and cbl put a halt to the exercise and that a forensic investigation of the entire mop up exercise be conducted finance and development planning minister samuel tweah was head of the economic management team that designed the process which involves direct mop up through the direct engagement with businesses and nonbanking institutions to directly exchange united states dollars with liberian dollars president weah on july 16 2018 announced the infusion of us 25 million to mop up excess liberian dollars on the market in stabilize the rapidly increasing exchange note between the liberian dollar and the united states dollars and mandated the technical economic management team temt and cbl to implement the exercise the direct mop up exercise targeted three categories of businesses nonbanking institutions namely major importers small business holders and major foreign exchange bureaus temp cbl deviated from practice according to the pit analysis of the implementation report submitted by the temt cbl institutions businesses participated and received from cbl a total of us 14 million in exchange for a total of l 2 151 363 99 00 from july 17 2018 to september 18 2018 refer to exhibit 42 for temt cbl implementation report the pit report breaks down the disbursements of the us 14 million is as follows a total of us 5 6 million was sold to institutions businesses to the major importers category a total of us 1 4 million was sold to institutions businesses in the small business holders category and a total of us 7 million was sold to institutions businesses in the major foreign exchange bureaus category the investigations established through review of documents interviews and physical verification that the temt cbl deviated from best practice which calls for the use of legitimate banking institutions and licensed foreign exchange bureaus or sae auction for said exercise instead the temt cbl carried out direct mop up by engaging foreign exchange bureaus and local businesses other than the commercial banks the report also revealed that the temt cbl demarcated monrovia and its environs into 6 zones and assigned team to each zone as follows team 1 5 these teams were not given any lists but randomly visited the premises of businesses and foreign exchange bureaus in their assigned area for the exercise team 6 central monrovia major importers this team was given a lot of major importers members of the team visited the premises of these businesses and collected their liberian dollars in exchange for united states dollars at the exchange rate provided by cbl this team was stationed at cbl and served businesses and foreign exchange bureaus within central monrovia the investigation established that here were no standard criteria set for the participation of businesses and foreign exchange bureaus in terms of their legitimacy e g legally registered licensed tax compliant etc the investigation also established that the principle of know your customer kyc was not observed throughout the mop up exercise thereby creating room for illicit exchange or money laundering the pit also reported that a review of the report submitted to the investigation by the six 6 teams responsible for the disbursement exchange of the united states dollars with the liberian dollars whom that some foreign exchange bureau and businesses were not duly registered while other businesses received cash without proper identification for example report submitted by the leader of team 2 mr kontar richards shows that there was no evidence of transactions with business entities such as business registration document and address of these entities there are several summary sheets in hand writing which do not have any indication that these vendors money and or signed for it according to pit some businesses institutions in the three categories mentioned above received lesser amounts then what was reported by cbl for example the union local forex bureau located on carey street received a total of us 5 500 00 on two separate occasions us 3 000 on july 17 2017 and us 2 300 00 on august 16 22017 then what was reported by cbl in its report as the total amount received us 161 900 00 us 103 720 00 on july 17 2018 and us 58 400 00 on august 16 2018 refer to exhibit 44 for union local forex bureau administrator response regarding the accounting for foreign currency banknotes the investigation determined that the temt cbl sold the total of us 14 million in exchange for the total of l 2 151 363 898 00 between the periods july 17 2018 to september 18 2018 and that the temt cbl deviated from the conventional best practice which calls for the use of legitimate banking institutions and licensed foreign exchange bureaus or sale auction instead pit reported that the temt cbl carried out direct mop up process by engaging some foreign exchange bureaus and some local businesses other than the commercial banks the temt cbl failed to set standard criteria for the participation of businesses in terms of their legitimacy e g duly registered businesses and or tax compliance etc and the principle of know your customer kyc was not observed throughout the mopped up exercise thereby creating the platform for illegal business dealers to clean their illegal money reports offer reason for president to act mr mo ali assistant secretary general of the former ruling unity party told frontpageafrica sunday that the damning findings of the pit and kroll report particularly involving temt headed by minister tweah is more than enough reason president weah should act said ali minister tweah designed directed and implemented the unorthodox and corrupt system of direct mop up exercise of lrd that led to thievery and possible money laundering as indicated in both the local and international reports hon tweah therefore bears culpability because his actions and inactions opened up a flawed gate of frauds min tweah should therefore face justice just as others are in his own defense minister tweah interviewed by pit on october 19 2018 at the headquarters of the liberian anti corruption commission lacc offered the following response as documented by the pit in reference to the utilization and infusion of the us 25 million into the economy to stabilize the exchange rate hon tweah told the investigation that the total of us 14 million has been used to mop up the total of l 2 2 billion from the market hon tweah said the temt chaired by him did not use the conventional auction method by using the commercial banks according to him the aim of the exercise was to target monies in the hand of business people and not monies already in the banking system he said this was the reason his team targeted business people and major forex bureaus and not to go through the commercial banks hon tweah said the category of businesses that benefited from the mop up exercise are major importers small business holders and major forex bureaus contradicting explanations minister tweah s explanation contradicts what president weah told the nation when he delivered his annual message in january the president said as a short term quick fix the government approved 25 million united states dollars to enable the central bank to intervene in the foreign exchange market as of december 2018 a total of 17 million united states dollars was used for the intervention which significantly contributed to the general stability in the exchange rate for the past six months july to december 2018 the balance 8 million united states dollars is reserved by the cbl as a precautionary intervention fund questions and unanswered questions resulting from the two reports have prompted calls for the weah led government to ensure that the issues cited in both findings are addressed in a statement sunday the liberia council of churches while welcoming the release of the ld16b missing money reports by the government of liberia and the united states embassy through usaid last week said commended the presidential investigation team pit set up by the president of liberia and the usaid sponsored kroll international financial firm for the tireless efforts put into compiling and releasing the investigative reports head of the liberia council of churches rev kortu brown the lcc acknowledges several outstanding and concerning issues presented by the investigative reports to include the whereabouts of the reported ld2 6 billion excess printed materials reflecting a strong difference between new banknotes reportedly received at the cbl to the tune of ld15 506 billion and documented printed volumes of ld18 1 billion the extremely troubling us 25 million mop up exercise transactions poor documentation of financial transactions at the central bank of liberia cbl the differences in three 3 cbl operational vaults balances and the lack of full legislative approval for printing the approximately ld18 1 billion banknotes to replace the legacy or old bank notes from the market amongst others lcc probe all implicated in reports the statement noted the liberia council of churches calls on the government of liberia to ensure that the fight against impunity and or sleaze is profound and comprehensive by ensuring that everything is done to bring to justice all implicated in the two investigative reports the lcc calls on liberians and the public in general to remain calm and engage in orderly manners as this financial drama of enormous consequence unfolds before our eyes we assume that all accused are innocent until proven guilty mr george wisner mr george wisner a former assistant minister for afro asian affairs at the ministry of foreign affairs and former executive director of the national investment commission said in a recent op ed that both reports point to endemic corruption institutional failure lack of patriotism and entrenched patronage these indictments go beyond narrow political considerations religious creed or philosophical persuasion and should put a scar on the conscience of all of us politicians civil society religious community and parents the damning conclusions reached by the reports indict many of our leaders past and present of doing more for themselves and their parochial interests to the exclusion of the vast majority of the liberian people who are shackled in destitution and continue to languish in poverty and misery they exploit the ignorance and vulnerability of our people and create an illusion of redemption only to feed on the sweat blood and tears of the very people

monrovia a weak internal control system and massive discrepancies uncovered in two major investigative scope studies have prompted calls for massive restructuring at the central bank of liberia report by rodney d sieh president george manneh weah in his first response to the report s release has expressed thanks to the united states government for responding positively to his call to assist with the inquest and for funding the coping done by kroll as he pledged that his government would take the necessary actions as required based on the findings of both reports while reiterating his administration s commitment to the rule of law red flag for us federal reserves last weekend s arrest of sirleaf created a void which could prove costly depending how fast president weah can fill it to avoid a scary reminiscence of what happened last october when the us federal reserve system put a freeze on transaction with the central bank of liberia owing to the high level of uncertainty surrounding the ongoing investigation into the missing billions controversy the key issue there was the fact that several senior central bank of liberia officials milton a weeks former governor of the cbl and charles sirleaf deputy governor responsible for finance banking and general services departments were under investigation in connection with the missing billions currency and have been barred from leaving the country a major reason for the feds action at the time was that sirleaf who is the lead signature on the cbl s account with the feds was under investigation creating an atmosphere of distrust as the feds reportedly felt uncomfortable dealing with liberia without a legitimate signatory at the time several of liberia s stakeholders including the international monetary fund imf raised red flags amid concerns that those under investigation should not be involved in the day to day operations of the cbl particularly regarding the us federal reserves about 250 official account holders maintain approximately 3 trillion in us dollar denominated assets in custody at the new york fed which represents about half of the world s overall official us dollar reserves economists say the us 25 million withdrawn from the federal reserve is accountable to the us banking system now linked to alleged fraud and possible money laundering using the us federal reserve system it is clear from the usaid kroll report and the government s own report that fraud has been committed in how the funds withdrawn from the federal reserve bank of ny was used it is therefore prudent that the bank itself demands a full explanation on the transaction under know your customer kyc standards and practices the federal reserve bank as custodian of the nation s foreign exchange must take action when a country s officials use the bank s products and services to commit outright fraud and illegally launder money withdrawn from the bank there are laws in the us that governs banks and the role they should play in preventing financial crimes central bank of liberia the scenario from last october is likely to play out once more following the arrest of both sirleaf and weeks in the wake of the findings by kroll and pit both sirleaf and weeks were detained just hours after independent us investigators from the firm kroll associates raised concerns regarding the overall accuracy and completeness of the bank s internal records and found evidence of systemic and procedural weaknesses the investigation came after hundreds of protestors hit the streets of monrovia following rumors that a container load of newly printed banknotes worth 102m had disappeared shortly after being delivered from abroad the house of representatives passed a resolution for the order of ld5 billion to remove and replace old banknotes on the market an additional request by the cbl for ld10 billion was denied by the senate but the bank went ahead and engaged the swedish company crane to print the additional banknotes cbl central bank of liberia management subsequently explained to kroll that due to the urgency for new banknotes the cbl did not follow its own internal tendering policies for the procurement of crane ab the report says kroll explain in the 67 page report that despite repeated requests the bank did not provide any explanation as to who had approved the injection of new banknotes into the liberian economy without first removing the equivalent quantity from circulation a separate report by the special presidential investigation team pit documented that both the economic management team and the cbl failed to set standard criteria for the participation of businesses in terms of their legitimacy e g duly registered businesses and or tax compliance etc the report also notes that the principle of know your customer kyc was not observed throughout the mop up exercise thereby creating the platform for illegal business dealers to clean their illegal money in the wake of the many lapses uncovered and the vacuum created as a result of the arrest of the country s key signatory mr sirleaf the race to fill the void left by the ongoing saga has led to numerous speculations about who is likely to fill the void frontpageafrica takes a look at some of the names being thrown around to replace mr sirleaf amid chatters of massive shake up at the cbl jay

mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome in gerald celente publisher of the renowned trends journal mr celente is perhaps most well known trends forecaster in the world and it s always a joy to speak with him mr celente thanks for the time again today and welcome back gerald celente oh thanks for having me on mike mike gleason well gerald the trends journal is forecasting economic 9 11 as one of the big trends for 2019 there are plenty of indicators which just support your thesis for a major slowdown debt levels both public and private have exploded china is slowing down and all the stimulus in europe has failed to generate results there higher interest rates are hurting everything from real estate to auto sales et cetera but none of this is reflected in the stock markets which are roaring higher once again it looks like the fed is up to its old tricks promising to stop the rate hikes they had planned and end the program for selling bonds the constant intervention of the fed has always been one of the major wildcards when trying to predict where things are headed in recent years what do you think can the central bankers kick the can one more time to avoid a recession or are they finally going to lose control in the months ahead gerald celente well i think you ve summed everything up pretty well in analyzing it and the general situation when we made that forecast of an economic 9 11 remember how trends for the new year go out in december in december we just saw the dow have its worst month since the great depression and all of a sudden on january 4th 2019 it all turned around what happened was the federal reserve chairman bent over to trump and he backtracked on his aggressive stance of 2018 where they raised interest rates four times and they were scheduled to raise them three to four more times in 2019 he said he would be patient in late january they said it again that they would be patient they were in no hurry raising interest rates that changed our forecast because what they ve done is they ve injected more monetary methadone into the bull to keep it running you can see what was happening when they were going to pull the needle out the bull was dying it was od ing already and now they just got it going once again and you mentioned wildcard and that s exactly why nobody could predict the future there are too many wildcards whether they re man made or made by mother nature well of course now i have to be proper and politically correct whether women made or made by father nature what happened was they played the wildcard and the fact is whether it was fear of a fed audit or just pressure from trump we listed all the times he called the fed loco and crazy and how disgusted he was with them throughout 2018 beginning in july until they did a backtrack so now what we re looking at mike it s the presidential reality show s already heating up and trump is going to do everything he can to keep the economy pumping along or i should say trumping along remember the cat s in the real estate business to his son in law the family the cushners it s real estate you mentioned about real estate prices going down i mean what happened in december we saw southern california home sales plunge 20 in december to the lowest pace in 11 years so when those interest rates got around 5 for a 30 year mortgage you could see the big reversal not only do we see the fed not raising interest rates in 2019 we could see them aggressively bringing them down if the economy starts to slow down they raised them nine times since 2015 they could lower them nine times mike gleason this year certainly has the potential to be one for the history books in europe we spoke when you were last with us in december about the yellow jacket protests in france they are ongoing and there is reason to think they may be a bigger deal than the conventional media is letting on it is possible that president macron may be forced out which would be quite a populous victory there should also be finally a resolution with regards to brexit in the months ahead what is your take on the events in europe gerald will the populous and anti eu forces be able to win this year or will establishment forces be able to fend off these attacks for a while longer yet gerald celente well they re doing the best to fend them off you mentioned macron and you had his popularity rating was down to 27 now it s moved back up a bit to a 32 they are really really doing everything they can to stop the protest from going you know with hypocrisy by the way in the way the media covers what s going on in venezuela when a few people were killed a week or so ago when they were trying to bring in that so called humanitarian aid and then you look what s going on in france and how many people have been killed and the violence with the rubber bullets being shot out at them and people losing their eyes and on and on and how the difference in the coverage is in france it s okay in venezuela it s terrible so we think what s going to happen in europe is they re going to do everything they can to suppress any kind of populous movements and we re going to see what happens with the elections coming up for the european parliament later this year and that s going to give us the indicator of how deeply the populous movement are moving in right now it s a war between those that want more globalism and those don t want to retain their culture their nationality and their ethnic identity mike gleason you touched on it there but how about venezuela gerald what is your take on what s happening there as the u s looks to exert some of its influence to overthrow the maduro regime and then let s also get your comments about venezuela not being able to get its gold back what do you make of events there gerald celente well again you know this is the perfect example of what america has been doing in central america for over a hundred years you could not be clearer than it s a coup attempt and i love the language they used by the way you know this guy guaido he all of a sudden declares himself and says i m the interim president of venezuela and of course we covered this very deeply in our trends journal that he was brought to the united states prior to that a number of times and this is an outright coup attempt in our november trends journal remember this didn t happen until january late january our november trends journal there as a keynote story it s called the triangle of death and we had forecasted that brazil colombia and argentina would form a triangle of death aimed at venezuela with the united states behind the movement and that s precisely what has happened that s what the trends journal is about you can t make this stuff up where you ve got a bunch of clowns out there talking about bringing democracy to venezuela how many times have i heard that bs in my life oh yeah you re going to do it in iraq right no no it was libya i got it syria assad has to go we need democracy one time after another it s all about oil if their major export was broccoli and not oil there d be no demands by america s presidents obama and bush to spill blood and destroy those oil rich sovereign nations that i named and the same thing about venezuela and if you don t believe me ask the clown that s playing our national security adviser john bolton quote we re in conversation with major american companies now it would make a difference if we could have american companies produce the oil in venezuela it would be good for the people of the united states end quote mike gleason it s kind of what it s all about it s always about oil just follow the oil and sure enough there you go conflict seems to surround it switching gears here a little bit gold and silver prices are certainly holding up well here given the rally in the stock markets and the relative strength in the us dollar it s hard to have too much confidence in the paper prices of metals as we ve talked about before there s been a too much evidence of rigging and cheating by the bullion banks with the tacit blessing of the regulators including the fed we don t think they can control the markets forever particularly the physical bullion markets there is an ongoing investigation by the department of justice into the metals rigging and the fbi is getting cooperation from a former jp morgan trader as well as the documents and recordings turned over by deutsche bank a couple of years ago and there are some civil class action suits pending attorneys there are watching the progress for the criminal investigation licking their chops so this is new territory please give us your thoughts if you would if you ve been following the story at all and then please tell us what you think generally about the metals markets here gerald gerald celente it will be like everything else you know what i mean look at the bankers that were convicted of fraud outright fraud five major banks did you see any heads roll did anything change nothing will change it ll come in and go out however what the central banks are doing as you well know is they bought more gold in 2018 than they did in a half century so they know this whole ponzi scheme of a 250 trillion debt bubble is going to explode the reality is no one knows when we can make the forecast based on the current events forming future trends but again what happened was out of nowhere the federal reserve chairman comes out on a day where the employment numbers come out on january 4th and we created over 300 000 jobs and it showed that the yearly increases of wages was the best in 10 years two reasons not to be patient with interest rates they should have raised them with that kind of data what i m saying mike is you never know what s going to bring this market down as we see it is a wildcard event that s what s going to do it something that you can t predict be it a war with well look at the war now you know the war talk going on and the bombing runs committed by pakistan and india what if those two nuclear armed countries go at it what happens if the push for war with iran that keeps heating up is ignited you ll see oil prices go 100 a barrel you kiss the markets and world economies goodbye so that s where gold comes in it s the safe haven asset i ve been on your show a lot of times and i ve been saying for i don t know how long that the bottom price of gold is 1 200 i said it all of 2018 i believe it hit 1 185 for a day or two and now it s over 1 300 an ounce we keep saying it has to break over 1 385 to gain strength and the breakout point is 1 450 i ve been saying that for nearly it s going on six years almost and it hasn t done that when it breaks over the 1 450 mark we believe it will spike to the 2 000 mark mike gleason getting back to something you touched on earlier with the federal reserve likely not looking to raise interest rates this year at all maybe even cutting when the markets sort of start to realize that that s what s happening is that maybe one of those kind of explosive situations for precious metals once the real interest rates actually turn negative gerald celente it ll put more cheap money into the system but it will be positive for gold because the more expensive that dollar gets the opportunity holding of course of gold becomes less attractive the cheaper the dollar the lower the dollar the lower interest rates the more attractive gold becomes again we don t see at this point despite the pressures going on globally with japan and europe and china and an economic slowdown we don t see a recession right now in the united states particularly because they are going to do everything they can to generate a moderately strong economy prior to the 2020 elections mike gleason well finally as we close here do you have any final thoughts for investors about any other trends that you may be watching that we perhaps didn t touch on then also anything else that you care to mention as we wrap up here today gerald celente well yeah the things to look at where the markets are also going of course are copper prices doctor copper it s called in the trade that means that copper is an indicator of the health of the global economy right now we re seeing copper having about a 12 increase this year it s still relatively low but it s up from july 2018 again at 12 hit this year and it s showing strength and china is one of the largest purchases of copper they get over 50 of the new stuff developed so it shows us that yes there s going to be a slowdown again but not a decline one of the big trends that we keep watching and we ve been on this one of the first with the trends journal and that s the whole cannabis trend this is just the beginning of it we re in 1933 and they just lifted prohibition and everybody s getting any alcohol business but this is even much bigger because not only the cannabis in terms of hemp being legalized and all the medical benefits of cannabis are going to be explored more and more as i say if the planet could feed us could it heal us the irony of all this by the way is the same criminals that criminalized it that ruined the lives of millions of people for smoking a joint to getting caught selling an ounce and throwing them in jail and three strikes they re out the millions when you add up the families that were destroyed probably the tens of millions if not hundreds of millions over the decades these are the same criminals now that are giving us the regulations to de legalize god s plant and of course the only reason this political mafia is involved in it is because they want their cut that s called taxes you have places like new jersey over here where they re going to put 42 an ounce tax on it it s a criminal operation and that s the only reason they re legalizing it should have always been legal but the reason they re legalizing it is just to get more money from taxes because we re talking about that debt bubble and you got one blowing up everywhere they need more money and will do anything they can to get it you re going to see this whole cannabis trend continuing to explode globally mike gleason well we ll leave it there for now gerald we really appreciate the time once again today and before we let you go please fill folks in on what s going on there at the trends journal and the trends research institute what they need know and how they can start getting the wonderful information that you put out there on a regular basis gerald celente well they can go to trendsjournal com and of course we

suppress any kind of populous movements and we re going to see what happens with the elections coming up for the european parliament later this year and that s going to give us the indicator of how deeply the populous movement are moving in right now it s a war between those that want more globalism and those don t want to retain their culture their nationality and their ethnic identity mike gleason you touched on it there but how about venezuela gerald what is your take on what s happening there as the u s looks to exert some of its influence to overthrow the maduro regime and then let s also get your comments about venezuela not being able to get its gold back what do you make of events there gerald celente well again you know this is the perfect example of what america has been doing in central america for over a hundred years you could not be clearer than it s a coup attempt and i love the language they used by the way you know this guy guaido he all of a sudden declares himself and says i m the interim president of venezuela and of course we covered this very deeply in our trends journal that he was brought to the united states prior to that a number of times and this is an outright coup attempt in our november trends journal remember this didn t happen until january late january our november trends journal there as a keynote story it s called the triangle of death and we had forecasted that brazil colombia and argentina would form a triangle of death aimed at venezuela with the united states behind the movement and that s precisely what has happened that s what the trends journal is about you can t make this stuff up where you ve got a bunch of clowns out there talking about bringing democracy to venezuela how many times have i heard that bs in my life oh yeah you re going to do it in iraq right no no it was libya i got it syria assad has to go we need democracy one time after another it s all about oil if their major export was broccoli and not oil there d be no demands by america s presidents obama and bush to spill blood and destroy those oil rich sovereign nations that i named and the same thing about venezuela and if you don t believe me ask the clown that s playing our national security adviser john bolton quote we re in conversation with major american companies now it would make a difference if we could have american companies produce the oil in venezuela it would be good for the people of the united states end quote mike gleason it s kind of what it s all about it s always about oil just follow the oil and sure enough there you go conflict seems to surround it switching gears here a little bit gold and silver prices are certainly holding up well here given the rally in the stock markets and the relative strength in the us dollar it s hard to have too much confidence in the paper prices of metals as we ve talked about before there s been a too much evidence of rigging and cheating by the bullion banks with the tacit blessing of the regulators including the fed we don t think they can control the markets forever particularly the physical bullion markets there is an ongoing investigation by the department of justice into the metals rigging and the fbi is getting cooperation from a former jp morgan trader as well as the documents and recordings turned over by deutsche bank a couple of years ago and there are some civil class action suits pending attorneys there are watching the progress for the criminal investigation licking their chops so this is new territory please give us your thoughts if you would if you ve been following the story at all and then please tell us what you think generally about the metals markets here gerald gerald celente it will be like everything else you know what i mean look at the bankers that were convicted of fraud outright fraud five major banks did you see any heads roll did anything change nothing will change it ll come in and go out however what the central banks are doing as you well know is they bought more gold in 2018 than they did in a half century so they know this whole ponzi scheme of a 250 trillion debt bubble is going to explode the reality is no one knows when we can make the forecast based on the current events forming future trends but again what happened was out of nowhere the federal reserve chairman comes out on a day where the employment numbers come out on january 4th and we created over 300 000 jobs and it showed that the yearly increases of wages was the best in 10 years two reasons not to be patient with interest rates they should have raised them with that kind of data what i m saying mike is you never know what s going to bring this market down as we see it is a wildcard event that s what s going to do it something that you can t predict be it a war with well look at the war now you know the war talk going on and the bombing runs committed by pakistan and india what if those two nuclear armed countries go at it what happens if the push for war with iran that keeps heating up is ignited you ll see oil prices go 100 a barrel you kiss the markets and world economies goodbye so that s where gold comes in it s the safe haven asset i ve been on your show a lot of times and i ve been saying for i don t know how long that the bottom price of gold is 1 200 i said it all of 2018 i believe it hit 1 185 for a day or two and now it s over 1 300 an ounce we keep saying it has to break over 1 385 to gain strength and the breakout point is 1 450 i ve been saying that for nearly it s going on six years almost and it hasn t done that when it breaks over the 1 450 mark we believe it will spike to the 2 000 mark mike gleason getting back to something you touched on earlier with the federal reserve likely not looking to raise interest rates this year at all maybe even cutting when the markets sort of start to realize that that s what s happening is that maybe one of those kind of explosive situations for precious metals once the real interest rates actually turn negative gerald celente it ll put more cheap money into the system but it will be positive for gold because the more expensive that dollar gets the opportunity holding of course of gold becomes less attractive the cheaper the dollar the lower the dollar the lower interest rates the more attractive gold becomes again we don t see at this point despite the pressures going on globally with japan and europe and china and an economic slowdown we don t see a recession right now in the united states particularly because they are going to do everything they can to generate a moderately strong economy prior to the 2020 elections mike gleason well finally as we close here do you have any final thoughts for investors about any other trends that you may be watching that we perhaps didn t touch on then also anything else that you care to mention as we wrap up here today gerald celente well yeah the things to look at where the markets are also going of course are copper prices doctor copper it s called in the trade that means that copper is an indicator of the health of the global economy right now we re seeing copper having about a 12 increase this year it s still relatively low but it s up from july 2018 again at 12 hit this year and it s showing strength and china is one of the largest purchases of copper they get over 50 of the new stuff developed so it shows us that yes there s going to be a slowdown again but not a decline one of the big trends that we keep watching and we ve been on this one of the first with the trends journal and that s the whole cannabis trend this is just the beginning of it we re in 1933 and they just lifted prohibition and everybody s getting any alcohol business but this is even much bigger because not only the cannabis in terms of hemp being legalized and all the medical benefits of cannabis are going to be explored more and more as i say if the planet could feed us could it heal us the irony of all this by the way is the same criminals that criminalized it that ruined the lives of millions of people for smoking a joint to getting caught selling an ounce and throwing them in jail and three strikes they re out the millions when you add up the families that were destroyed probably the tens of millions if not hundreds of millions over the decades these are the same criminals now that are giving us the regulations to de legalize god s plant and of course the only reason this political mafia is involved in it is because they want their cut that s called taxes you have places like new jersey over here where they re going to put 42 an ounce tax on it it s a criminal operation and that s the only reason they re legalizing it should have always been legal but the reason they re legalizing it is just to get more money from taxes because we re talking about that debt bubble and you got one blowing up everywhere they need more money and will do anything they can to get it you re going to see this whole cannabis trend continuing to explode globally mike gleason well we ll leave it there for now gerald we really appreciate the time once again today and before we let you go please fill folks in on what s going on there at the trends journal and the trends research institute what they need know and how they can start getting the wonderful

will be announced before the meaningful vote the meaningful vote she is referring to is the mp s next opportunity to vote on her deal a deal they have already rejected before but she is hoping that with minor changes and little time left they might be willing to accept it her proposal is to have up to three consecutive votes each depending on the result of the vote preceding it the meaningful vote is set to be taken by the 12th of march and if it passes the uk will leave the eu with the deal she has negotiated if not then by the 13th of march at the latest the uk parliament will vote on whether or not to leave the eu without an agreement if the vote passes the uk will leave the eu without a deal on the table having a no deal brexit if that vote is rejected then on the 14th of march the house will vote on whether to have a short extension to article 50 s deadline by 3 months she made it clear that this is an outcome that she does not favor and does not want to happen the government also published a paper that outlined the uk s readiness for a no deal brexit the report outlines that the uk s economic growth would be 6 3 percent 9 percent lower in the long term in a no deal scenario the 15 page document then goes on to state the following british citizens will be treated as third country nationals by the bloc s member states both the eu and the uk would need to impose vat and customs on goods traveling between the uk and the eu it stated that 240 000 businesses would need to interact with the customs process for the first time predicting that this will cost businesses in the uk 13 billion pounds per year in administrative fees the document also recognizes that there will be delays in supplies like food 30 percent of which comes from the eu but continues to make clear that this does not mean that there will be a food shortage in the uk the effects of a no deal brexit will be more severe in northern ireland and those effects will last longer a no deal brexit will affect the viability of many businesses across northern ireland this is because there are a lot of small and medium enterprises and many of these businesses rely on cross border supply chains the service sector which accounts for 80 percent of the uk s gdp would also be affected as there will be an increase on non tariff barriers on the other side of the equation the labor party represented by its leader jeremy corbyn stated that the party is to support a second referendum provided that their own brexit plan fails the labor party plan did fail in a parliamentary vote on wednesday by 323 votes to 240 the result means that at some point in the next 12 days almost certainly march 12 labor will formally table an amendment demanding a second brexit referendum the sterling s gaining streak was subdued by the end of the week the cable closed the week at 1 3212 us uk trade talks in an aggressive posture from the trump administration towards the uk on post brexit talks the administration demanded greater access to the uk market for its agricultural products and guarantees that london would not manipulate its currency an 18 page document was released on thursday from the office of the us trade representative the document labeled as negotiating objectives for a possible trade agreement with the uk suggested that britain is unlikely to get softer treatment than other us allies the us is looking for the uk to remove unwarranted barriers related to sanitary and physio sanitary standards in the farm industry for years us agricultural groups have complained that european countries have unnecessarily limited american exports of meat and grains based on fears they are unsafe for consumers other demands also have the potential to be problematic for london on currency the us wants to ensure that the uk avoids manipulating exchange rates in order to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitive advantage currency matters have traditionally been excluded from trade negotiations but the trump administration has injected them into talks including with china and japan a patient fed in a testimony to a us senate committee federal reserve chair jeremy powell said that slowing growth in europe and china and elevated uncertainty over brexit is continuing to weigh on the fed s policy outlook in his testimony mr powell repeated the central bank s patient approach to interest rate changes vowing to carefully monitor a host of unsolved questions including the direction of brexit talks and ongoing us china trade negotiations us growth loses stream the rebound of the us economy lost some of its potency in the final quarter of 2018 as consumers restrained their spending growth and with residential investment shrinking for the fourth quarter in a row gdp rose at an annualized pace on 2 6 percent during the fourth quarter of 2018 although a solid reading it is slower than the robust 3 4 percent and 4 2 percent expansions measured respectively in the previous two quarters the full year growth rate of 2 9 percent marginally missed the 3 percent target promoted by president donald trump it looks that the commerce department s report will leave the federal reserve determined to keep rates unchanged as it gauges how heavily slowing growth in china and europe combined with diminishing fiscal stimulus that will drag on the us in 2019 inventory investment the supporter of growth in the final quarter has the possibility of unwinding in the coming months pulling down growth early this year in addition to that fiscal stimulus approved by the congress in late 2017 and early 2018 will begin to decline further weighing on the expansion rising consumer confidence american consumers felt more confident this month after the end of the longest ever government shutdown a rally in the stock market and a solid job market the consumer confidence index rose to 131 4 up from 121 7 reached in january the federal reserve s pledge to be patient on raising interest rates may have also been a factor in supporting the economic outlook trump and kim fail to reach a deal the last summit between the us and north korea designed as an effort to revive the path to denuclearization was cut short as president donald trump failed to secure a deal with leader kim jong un the us president said at a press conference following his talks with the north korean leader that the leaders had made progress since they met in singapore in june of last year but he said that the us could not accept a north korean demand that it lift all sanctions at this point this outcome came as a disappointment to the white house which had told reporters that trump and kim would hold a signing ceremony on thursday announcing a deal this ceremony was canceled after the talks hit turbulence over the question of sanctions a slowdown in japanese economy the japanese economy saw a contractionary phase since the beginning of the year where manufacturing production contracted for the first time in nearly three years in february japanese exports declined amid slower sales to china according to the final readings from industry gauges the nikkei markit pmi fell to 48 9 in february down from the final reading of 50 3 in january and dipping below the 50 point line separating expansion from contraction for the first time since august 2016 in addition japan s industrial production fell at its fastest pace in a year in january as the motor vehicle and electronics sectors posted declines while retail sales growth missed estimates according to the japanese ministry of economy industrial production fell 3 7 percent y y in january coming short of a forecasted drop of 2 5 percent retail sales grew 0 6

the official purchasing managers index pmi fell to 49 2 in february from 49 5 in january pointing to a contraction in activity for the third straight month the figure reinforces concerns that china

the u s chamber of commerce a corporate member of the world government promoting council on foreign relations cfr has launched a massive new lobbying effort called the usmca coalition to garner congressional and public support for the united states mexico canada agreement integration scheme over the coming weeks and months the usmca coalition will make the case for expeditious passage of the agreement to members of congress and it will work to educate the american public about the benefits of the new deal the chamber of commerce stated in its february 26 press release announcing the launch of the new coalition the effort will harness the advocacy strength of a broad membership of companies trade associations and chambers of commerce including many that operate outside of washington d c the usmca coalition is composed over 200 companies and associations representing farmers and ranchers manufacturers service providers and technology companies led by the chamber of commerce however on the usmca coalition s website only 84 company members were listed of those 84 company members listed the following 14 are also corporate members of the cfr amgen inc at t chubb limited citigroup citi general electric google ibm corporation johnson johnson jpmorgan chase co mastercard metlife microsoft pfizer inc toyota motor company the press release also quoted devry boughner vorwerk the corporate vice president of cargill incorporated and co chair of the usmca coalition saying the united states mexico and canada have been transformed by nearly 25 years of open agricultural trade creating a level of economic integration that has made north america one of the world s most competitive and successful trading blocs emphasis added and that is exactly what the usmca is all about trading blocs vorwerk s comments underscore the usmca s importance to the cfr and other promoters of global government who seek economic integration of north america into a trading bloc similar to the european union rather than 195 countries as they presently exist each having its own government and economy the goal is for there to be only a handful of regional and in some cases overlapping supranational union states these can best be observed today in forms of such regional trading blocs as the eu african economic community mercosur eurasian economic union asean china free trade area comprehensive agreement on trans pacific partnership cptpp and nafta north america and world order in fact nafta s true place in this proposed world arrangement was admitted by former secretary of state henry kissinger a leading globalist and member of the cfr s board of directors in an op ed piece published in both the los angeles times and the washington post on july 20 1993 about the then proposed nafta kissinger wrote the revolution sweeping the western hemisphere can point the way to an international order based on cooperation it is this revolution that is at stake in the ratification of nafta what congress will soon have before it is not a conventional trade agreement but the hopeful architecture of a new international system defining what he meant by new international system kissinger further wrote a regional western hemisphere organization dedicated to democracy and free trade would be a first step toward the new world order that is so frequently cited but so rarely implemented emphasis added this new world order as advocated by kissinger and many in the cfr is one in which national sovereignty and nation states would be replaced with a new international system made up of competing yet interconnected trading blocs or regional unions like plasma it is a transitory state toward the solidification of one world government by default it is the end of nationhood patriotism and americanism organizations dedicated to the preservation of american sovereignty such as the john birch society the parent organization of the new american are not opposed to trade and commerce in their classical liberal sense nor do they advocate a policy of isolationism america has never been an isolationist country even during eras of high tariffs in america s past such as during the 1830s when u s tariffs on imported goods reached their highest at 62 percent on dutiable imports between the 1860s and 1900s when the average tariff was about 45 percent and between 1920 and 1932 when tariffs reached as high as 59 percent in 1932 america still traded with other countries this is not to suggest that the average tariffs on imported goods should be subject to over 45 percent instead congress should embrace a smart tariff one that is flexible and adjusts to satisfy the demands of both domestic consumers and manufactures while also not impairing our domestic access to extracting strategic raw minerals and metals that would be vital during a time of war tariffs are also far less intrusive than a progressive individual income tax a world without tariffs the perpetual drive toward zero tariffs commenced with the trade agreements act of 1934 and was followed by america s subsequent entry into both the general agreements on tariffs and trade gatt by executive decree in 1947 and then to the world trade organization in 1995 this drive has placed a greater reliance on domestic income taxes or debt either to the federal reserve which loans the money that it creates to the u s government on interest or to foreign countries such as communist china to whom the united states currently owes 1 12 trillion in order to finance the federal government and its ever growing laundry list of unconstitutional big spending projects and programs zero tariffs as desired by the advocates of world trade and world government would harm small businesses unable to compete with large multinational corporations that largely benefit from wto approved free trade agreements and that are also cfr corporate members such as exxonmobil chevron goldman sachs pepsico boeing walmart and johnson johnson just to name a few no tariffs would also compromise u s national security with cheap foreign made steel aluminum and other vital metals the modern international relations theory of free trade breeding world peace is predicated on the notion of interdependence the very cornerstone for the establishment of a one world economy and government or new world order this is why the usmca is so crucial to both chamber of commerce and the council on foreign relations not only does the usmca reafirm the importance of the economic integration of north america as then mexican president enrique peña nieto touted at the usmca signing ceremonyin buenos aires argentina it s also a stepping stone and pillar for their emerging new world order cfr for usmca richard n haass the president of the cfr and author of the book a world in disarray which unabashedly promotes the new world order or world order 2 0 as he dubbed it tweeted his enthusiasm for the usmca following the initial release of the text the usmca looks to be the trade pact formerly known as nafta plus 10 20 haass said on twitter the next day haass followed up with another glowing endorsement usmca is nafta plus tpp plus a few tweaks whatever if realdonaldtrump and the congress are now prepared to embrace a pro trade agenda it is all to the good haass tweeted ideally us participation in tpp by another name would be next failing that a us japan fta would be second best the chamber of commerce s press release also quoted candi wolff the executive vice president for global government affairs at citi and also a co chair for the usmca coalition usmca has key improvements for the services sector including a modernized financial services chapter that for the first time prohibits data localization requirements in the region wolff said further stating it s critical that new trade agreements account for the fact that 75 of jobs in the private sector in the u s are now in services and usmca does that citi is the largest bank in the united states and is one of the big four banks which also include jp morgan chase bank of america and wells fargo all four of which are corporate members of the cfr building a north american community in may 2005 the cfr in conjunction with the canadian council of chief executives and the consejo mexicano de asuntos internacionales mexican council on international affairs published a report entitled building a north american community the controversial 175 page report was produced by a self styled independent task force chaired by the late robert pastor regarded as the father of the north american union and a former professor of international relations at american university pastor wrote extensively about the need to integrate north america even more than what nafta could offer of this proposed north american community page 3 of the report stated its boundaries will be defined by a common external tariff and an outer security perimeter within which the movement of people products and capital will be legal orderly and safe its goal will be to guarantee a free secure just and prosperous north america in other words replace nafta with a kind of eu lite its other recommendations included the harmonization of visa requirements the development of a north american border pass with biometric identifiers which is observable today in the form of the western hemisphere travel initiative compliant passport card and enhanced driver licenses for land and sea travel within north america not yet approved for air travel sharing data about the entry and exit of foreign nationals harmonizing entry screening and tracking procedures for people goods and vessels law enforcement cooperation across all three countries enhancing the current north american development bank and the establishment of a north american investment fund to encourage private capital flow into mexico before passing away pastor credited the john birch society for having killed his globalist ambitions for an eu style north america prior to pastor s death the john birch society had led successful campaigns exposing and stopping both president bill clinton s proposed free trade area of america ftaa which would have extended nafta beyond north america to the entire western hemisphere except cuba and president george w bush s proposed security and prosperity partnership of north america spp which would have included many of the recommendations proposed in the cfr s task force report the same globalists who pushed for the ftaa and spp are the same ones now backing the usmca and they do not want a repeat of those results this is why the chamber of commerce has created the usmca coalition its main objective is to serve as a propaganda drive for the usmca the usmca coalition is their biggest lobbying effort meanwhile congress is currently waiting on a report from the u s international trade commission itc about the usmca s expected impact on the economy before formally introducing a usmca implementation act the itc s report was originally expected to be completed in march however the deadline was extended due to the temporary partial government shutdown the itc report is now slated to come in around april 20 2019 the chamber of commerce s usmca coalition and other efforts by the cfr to promote this new north american integration scheme underscore the urgency for patriotic americans who love their country and are zealous for its national sovereignty and independence to urge congress to both withdraw from nafta and to stop the usmca in fact the john birch society has launched an action project called get us out of nafta stop the usmca which as its title suggests is intended to accomplish just that and in turn eliminating the blueprint and framework for a north american community as proposed by the cfr concerned citizens should consider joining the john birch society and taking part in its action project to help save american liberty and independence graphic evgeny gromov istock getty images plus

presentation we will conduct a question and answer session instructions will be provided at that time operator instructions i will now turn the meeting over to your host for today s call david lim vice president of corporate development and investor relations at univar david please go ahead david lim vice president of corporate development and investor relations thank you and good morning welcome to univar s solutions investor conference call and webcast joining our call today are david jukes president and chief executive officer and carl lukach executive vice president and chief financial officer on february 8th we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended december 31st 2018 as well as our first quarter and full year 2019 guidance excluding the acquisition of nexeo on february 21 we filed our 10 k for the fiscal year ending december 31st 2018 and last thursday february 28th we closed on the acquisition of nexeo solution today we released a supplemental slide presentation that should be viewed along with the news release covering the comments on this call both have been posted on our website at univarsolutions com during this call we

referenced on slide two we will make statements about our estimates projections outlook forecasts and expectations for the future all such statements are forward looking and while they reflect our current estimates they involve risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance please see our sec filings for a more complete listing of the risks and uncertainties inherent in our business and our expectations for the future with that i ll now turn the call over to david for his opening remarks david jukes president and chief executive officer thank you david and good morning everyone and welcome to our first conference call as univar solutions as many of you have seen we closed our acquisition of nexeo solutions on february 28th and we ll doing business as univar solutions going forward reflects a new company that combines the best of the best of univar and nexeo solutions i ll have more to say on that later but first let me briefly summarize univar s fourth quarter and full year 2018 results and the stand alone univar guidance that we provided to you three weeks ago we made the decision to give you stand alone guidance to be transparent with our projections provide investors with a detailed update on how we re seeing the year progressing as you saw in that report 2018 was a year of progress and challenges as we move toward our goal to be the most valued chemicals and ingredient distributor in the world in 2018 we grew sales 4 6 to 8 6 billion and expanded our gross profits and adjusted ebitda margins adjusted earnings per share grew 16 5 and adjusted ebitda increased by 7 8 to 614 million our asset lite resilient business model allowed us to report another year of solid profitability growth free cash flow generation and cash return on capital whilst our 2018 financial results were solid they were modest compared to our goals this is due and part to a number of challenges we faced throughout the year which our teams worked hard to successfully manage capacity constraints in the transportation markets lead to higher costs and lower availability whilst an uncertain economic environment especially from september through december led to cautious customers and oscillating demand during the latter part of the year through these challenges our supply chain teams performed well as they focused on keeping our customers in stock by delivering product safely and on time in canada adverse weather conditions in our agriculture business and softness in the western canadian energy markets led to an 8 decline in segment ebitda for the year our outlook for 2019 includes an expectation to uncertainty and sluggish demand for most of our end markets will persist as customers remain wary of building that finished product inventory in the fourth quarter demand fluctuated in the u s sometimes on a weekly basis as a soft october was followed by relatively solid november only to see december soften again in europe we saw business conditions weaken progressively as uncertainty in the economy led to cautious behavior from customers we ve seen this uncertainty in many markets continue into january and february and as a result are being restrained and prudent with our discretionary spending and measured in our outlook however against this tepid economic backdrop we remain excited and focused on executing against our strategy and successfully integrating nexeo we have made significant progress on numerous fronts and have clear plans in place to address areas that are taking longer to advance one of the places where we have been most successful is the optimization of our supply chain we ve made significant improvements since embarking on our transformation plan under jennifer mcintyre leadership we have implemented lean programs and indirect procurement optimized our logistics network and reduced warehouse costs we closed the number of univar sites utilizing a well developed playbook created over the past two years to execute on our site consolidation plan since 2016 these improvements have continued to contribute to a 200 basis point increase in our usa segment conversion ratio defined as adjusted ebitda divided by gross profits as we look forward we see even greater opportunity to drive efficiencies as univar solutions over the past few years you ve heard us talk about digitizing our business moving from manual processes the technology enabled company that can provide unparalleled service while lowering transaction costs we have made meaningful progress and with the acquisition of nexeo we expect a significant jump forward the nexeo platform allows us to accelerate our digital transformation by providing an erp system optimized for chemical distribution that we know and understand well that it s almost identical to the univar system in europe the familiarity and efficiency of the systems design allows us to migrate the legacy univar business on to nexeo s platform in a seamless and efficient manner significant reducing a key risk inherent in any erp upgrade the global chemical supply chain is digitally immature integrating univar s industry leading e commerce capability onto nexeo s advanced erp systems opens the door for us to create sustainable competitive advantage by making it easier for customers and supplier partners to do business with us and lower our transaction costs it will allow us to redefine the supply chain with our partners forming an optimized ecosystem that will accelerate growth opportunities the u s sales transformation which we embarked upon in 2017 is advancing so it s taking longer than expected as we track our internal performance metrics by line of business and individual seller there is no denying we had hoped for a faster pace of improvement similarly to us nexeo started a sales force transformation program in mid 2015 18 months before we began our own the nexeo team is in many respects further along in their journey and we intend to take the learning s from their experience to accelerate growth moving forward our combined product portfolio which is stronger which gives us greater strength in our focus industries for food ingredients personal care pharmaceutical ingredients and case in addition we now have the scale to stand up two new focused industries in the u s home care and industrial cleaning and lubricants and metal working in conjunction with our greater reach we will relentlessly drive our sales force execution succeeding on each of these fronts accelerates our opportunity for growth and profitability now let me turn the call over to carl who will walk you through our 2018 results and 2019 guidance in detail and then i will close some comments about the nexeo transaction and where the combined company is headed carl lukach executive vice president chief financial officer thanks david and good morning everyone while we reported three weeks ago our fourth quarter and full year results let me start by briefly giving you a refresher on those results as a baseline for understanding our revised 2019 guidance that now includes nexeo chemicals in the fourth quarter last year we reported net income of 1 2 million and gaap earnings per share of 0 01 this included a non cash pension mark to market loss of 0 24 per share and acquisition related expenses of 0 10 a share adjusted earnings per share of 0 33 and adjusted ebitda of 144 million were essentially flat with the prior year fourth quarter pricing trend lines and profitability per transaction continued upwards in the fourth quarter but were offset by a significant decrease in earnings from canada and lower demand from global industrial markets for the full year consolidated gross margin expanded by 10 basis points improving gross profit by 95 million compared to last year this combined with disciplined cost management led to an adjusted ebitda increase of 8 in the u s 2018 was a year of measured progress our adjusted ebitda grew by 7 5 and the segment increased it s volumes for the first time since 2014 our focus on sales force effectiveness continued as more than 300 sales team members completed advanced training courses designed to increase their selling skill set and know how after significant change and reorganization in 2017 we were successful in stabilizing and transforming our sales team into a more effective motivated growth force yet we know there is much more to do for the full year nearly 80 of our growth in delivery gross profit dollars flowed through to adjusted ebitda and our conversion ratio increased 80 basis points to 33 4 of solid improvement in canada 2018 was a very challenging year for us particularly in the fourth quarter double digit growth in our core industrial chemicals business for the year was more than offset by a second consecutive year of adverse weather conditions that significantly reduced demand for agrochemicals in addition reduction in demand from the canadian energy sector led to an overall decline in adjusted ebitda of 23 in the fourth quarter and down 8 for the year recognizing the challenging market conditions our teams in canada prudently reduced spending and working capital by comparison our europe middle east and africa segment had a very strong year and grew adjusted ebitda by 17 customer and supplier acceptance of our go to market strategy remained strong and our focused industry approach has been well received our supplier partners trust our ability to drive higher customer engagement and sales in the fourth quarter emea was our strongest growth region as adjusted ebitda grew 8 currency neutral despite some signs of economic slowdown as a result of brexit worries and tempered macro growth expectations for the eurozone our rest of the world segment grew adjusted ebitda by 16 in 2018 as our leadership team executed well with mexico showing improvement and brazil posting a solid year in the fourth quarter however strong performance in mexico was offset by softness particularly late in the quarter in brazil adjusted ebitda grew 4 on a currency neutral basis but fell 6 on a reported basis due to change in fx translation rates versus last year moving now to cash flow net working capital was a cash inflow in the fourth quarter of 197 million reflecting our usual back end of the year release of working capital excluding canadian agriculture our 13 month average net working capital as a percentage of sales was an industry leading 12 3 in line with the third quarter and the prior year capex was 35 million in the quarter and 95 million for the year an increase of about 12 million from 2017 our effective tax rate for adjusted eps in the fourth quarter of 28 was higher than the prior year fourth quarter of 18 largely due to recognizing for book purposes more benefit in 2017 from utilization of net operating loss carryforwards than in 2018 along with certain impacts from the 2017 u s tax act the higher tax rate was a headwind of 0 05 per share in the quarter and 0 27 per share for the full year we continue to earn a superior return on investment our return on assets deployed increased 190 basis points to 24 7 from 22 8 a year ago other return on capital metrics like roic croic and our internal univar value added metric also improved from last year we expect these metrics to continue to increase as we implement our plan and proceed with our integration and value capture activities associated with the nexeo acquisition we continue to allocate cash flow heavily toward deleveraging and univar s ipo in 2015 our leverage ratio has declined from around five times to 3 5 times at the end of last year as a reminder we paid approximately 1 8 billion for nexeo in cash and stock consistent with our focus on our core strengths in chemical and ingredients distribution we latter process to evaluate strategic alternatives for nexeo s plastics business which resulted in an agreement on february 8th sell the business for 640 million subject to customary closing conditions we expect the transaction will close sometime in the second quarter and we will use the net proceeds of approximately 615 million before transaction costs to immediately pay down debt we expect our consolidated net debt to be approximately 2 9 billion after the acquisition of nexeo and the sale of plastics following that announcement on february 8th moody s and standard poor s both upgraded our credit rating in addition fitch launched its review of univar with the rating comparable to s p including the acquisition of nexeo and the sale of plastics we now see leverage at around 3 5 times by the end of this year we plan on delevering to below 3 0 times and we ll reassess at that time our capital deployment priorities to maximize value for shareholders whether it is through increased investment in digitization sales force effectiveness additional smaller scale bolt on acquisitions further reducing our debt or directly returning cash to shareholders our focus will be on achieving the highest risk adjusted return let me finish them by addressing our revised outlook for 2019 which now includes 10 months of earnings from nexeo chemicals as a reminder three weeks ago we provided our forecast for univar on a stand alone basis to generate adjusted ebitda about in line with 2018 results of 640 million with the next year transaction closed we have begun the integration now of customers suppliers and products and we will lose the ability to track historic univar or historic nexeo results therefore we will not provide updates on stand alone guidance going forward we laid out our assumptions in the earnings press release on february 8th so i won t go through them one by one but i do want to highlight a few key points first we are forecasting slower flattish industrial production demand for chemicals across all of our segments down from the historical projections of 1 to 2 growth based on what we ve seen from customer ordering patterns in the fourth quarter and now again in the first quarter we think it s prudent to expect continued malaise ph in demand secondly and as david mentioned we are forecasting modest improvement in sales force efficiency we see positive signs of improvement and remain confident in our ability to improve the effectiveness of our sales force but we have more work to do as we make progress here we are mindful of the challenges our sales force will face from an uncertain demand environment thirdly higher transportation costs were a meaningful challenge to us in 2018 and we are estimating sustained high outbound freight cost per pound for this year as well we ve undertaken a range of actions to mitigate the impact of these costs and while we have already seen improvements in the fourth quarter as a result of these actions progress was partially offset by a shift in mix to more bulk chemicals where we rely heavily on common carriers for transportation with these assumptions in mind we expect to earn adjusted ebitda in a range of 740 million to 760 million in 2019 this reflects 10 months of earnings from the nexeo chemicals business and approximately 10 million in realized synergies we expect to generate 300 million to 350 million in free cash flow excluding one time integration costs of approximately 70 million as a reminder we expect one time cost to be approximately 150 million over the three year period 2019 through 2021 however we also expect to largely offset these costs with one time gains from the sale of excess real estate and working capital improvements regarding adjusted earnings per share we are in the early stages of measuring the impact of purchase accounting on gaap eps for 2019 and therefore are not providing eps guidance at this time we expect the first quarter of 2019 to be the weakest comparison quarter of the year reflecting continued sluggish demand from most end markets different fx translation impact and tougher comparisons due to a one time benefit in the first quarter of last year that we call to your attention at that time our management team is fully cognizant of the challenges that can arise in the downturn we have to find the right actions to take if that scenario develops and we will move quickly while simultaneously reaping the benefits of the nexeo acquisition david i ll turn it back to you david jukes president and chief executive officer thank you carl in 2018 we made significant strides on our journey to become the world s most valuable chemical and ingredient distributor and the acquisition of nexeo is a major milestone for us since announcing the deal on september the 17th joined univar and nexeo teams have worked hard to prepare for the close and plan for integration we created an integration managements office staffed with senior proven executives with complementary skills in cross functional expertise from both companies laying out detailed plans and timetables so we could hit the ground running to ensure that we are building sound comprehensive plans we hired world leading consultants in mergers and acquisitions human resources and supply chain managements further the compensation committee of our board has evaluated senior management compensation and it s linking variable incentive compensation the success of this integration including our capture of the synergies and importantly our return on invested capital as carl mentioned earlier we completed our evaluation of strategic alternatives for nexeo s plastics business and have reached an agreement to sell it to focus on our core chemical ingredient distribution business our team continues to evaluate the possibility of further divestitures to accentuate this focus and ensure we maintain the appropriate business mix long term over the past few months we have developed detailed plans summoned leaders to work streams to capture the 100 million in net annual operating synergies net of any customer and supplied synergies these synergies were identified and confirmed through a detailed bottoms up analysis on a function by function line by line basis where our integration team has been able to lay out the specific tasks and time lines to achieve them with nexeo officially a part of univar let me walk you through the plans we have in place to integrate the business in many respects the nexeo integration is an extension of programs we already have in place our chief integration officer is jen mcintyre to several years now jen has led univar s extensive internal operational improvements and site ph consolidation programs in her chief integration officer role she now has drawn on her experience at univar and her earlier career in the chemical industry and has been supported in schools by the senior partners of on the world s leaders in acquisition integration to ensure we have a robust pressure tested and proven execution plan as i mentioned earlier jen also oversaw the efficient closure of a number of univare s sites over recent years and now have the benefit of a proven team and playbook to execute on our site consolidation plans nexeo provides another significant opportunity to further optimize our overall supply chain footprint we estimate over a course of our combined sites in north america our candidates for closure our plan is to start with some smaller sites first and work in manageable waves over the next two years to do this in a methodical way but in full transparency with our employees with jen s leadership and expertise in this area we are confident we will achieve this we also see the ability to reduce transportation costs by increasing the density of our routes and utilization of our our enlarged fleets and we will implement on lean programs across the combined organization i have every confidence in jen s ability to lead this integration well we ve already made meaningful progress on our int integration we completed a roadmap the systems integration that ensures business continuity manages migration risk and meets the needs of the combined business we are well into the process of analyzing and mapping master data in preparation to the load univar s data onto nexeo s platform we expect this process to take a few months and it will run concurrently with our training and change management work streams that we re preparing univar employees to convert to the nexeo systems the nexeo it team also has prior experience successfully integrating acquisitions onto their systems platform including cst archway and ultrachem for our current situation we ll be rolling the univar locations onto the platform in multiple ways of manageable groups of univar districts and branches our commercial integration is also under way brian harrington who previously led nexeo s chemical business has taken a leadership role as univar solutions chief commercial officer in this new role brian will lead product management salesforce excellence and programs to work with our suppliers on a global basis brian has been leading integration planning for our commercial organization leveraging his prior experience successfully integrating the large scale acquisition one which combine a 1 000 person sales force and we ve been clear all along during this process with the sales force is one area we are not looking at the synergies and we will manage our sales force transition carefully we spent the first part of this year and mapping up a sales leadership and have announced changes deep into the organization to align for growth and success using the robust data driven selection process to ensure we have leaders who epitomized the values of univar s solutions and bring together the best of the best we expect to have our remaining organizational changes completed by the end of the second quarter once our key leaders have a chance to work in their new roles in the combined organization when the claim seems analyzed our combined customer data we found there are minimal overlaps in customers who purchases the same products at the same locations from univar and nexeo we have created processes to resolve any potential conflicts to reduce the risk of disruption in our sales force most importantly the efficiencies we create will result in significant additional capacity within our combined sales force to prospect the new business and deliver growth we are encouraged so far by the excitement we re seeing from our sellers and i m pleased to report the sales force churn in both companies has declined since we announced the transaction our sellers see the power of the combined platform and are excited about the opportunity for each of them to grow their carrier and their business finally i must make comments we are acutely aware of the magnitude of asset this integration is going to take and are not taking that challenge lightly as i previously said we have been supported by recognized leaders in acquisition integration to make sure we have the most thorough detailed and robust plan and the work with our team has been outstanding together with them this team is committed to getting it right and it s intensely focused on achieving an efficient and thorough integration with nexeo with the absolute minimum of disruption to customers and suppliers of course this will not be completed overnight we will update you each quarter on our progress overall 2018 was an exciting year and the fundamental elements of our strategy is stronger than ever with nexeo we have even greater line of sight and even more levers to create value for our customers suppliers and shareholders while there has been and will be bumps along the way we are making meaningful progress in our initiatives and our model is proving its ability to generate cash flow through the cycle now with univar solutions we have the ability to streamline and further reduce our costs to innovate and lead the digitization of the industry and grow and creating long term sustainable advantage thank you for your attention and with that we ll open it up to questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of robert koort with goldman sachs your line is open robert koort goldman sachs analyst thank you good morning two questions if i could david first you mentioned that the sales force effectiveness has been maybe behind plan can you give us some more specifics on what measurables or what symptoms you see that are causing those conclusions and how to rectify it and then secondly it seems your outlook on the economy the chemical economy seems far more dour than maybe some of your suppliers and so i guess i m wondering can you characterize it is careful and prudent conservatism or do you think maybe the rest of the world s not seeing things that you guys see more on the front lines as a distributor maybe help me reconcile what seems to be maybe a little bit of a parallax in views thanks david jukes president and chief executive officer thanks and good morning bob let stress the sales force first i mean i think what we ve got evidence that our plan is working and we ve made significant progress on a number of the key metrics the financial metrics over the last couple of years we ve said before i think the u s transformations lagging probably a couple of quarters behind where it where it needs to be we faced a number of challenges on that i think firstly the velocity of price changes last year that sellers really have to deal with price rather than i m talking about an extra product to sell or seeing a new customer and i think also the legacy univar internal processes and systems were more complicated than probably i appreciated a couple of years ago and that sets up time from our sellers to go prospect having said that we did improve the quality of the sellers we turned over the almost all the sales force and our retention levels have been good we trained several 100 of them i think 300 went through the development program last year we ve increased the call rates for the sellers by around 20 25 and that s all trending in the right direction and very positive i think as far as the new organization is concerned nexeo allows us to streamline those back end processes which will create more capacity in the sales organization that will allow us to grow and i think secondly with the degree of overlap that we re seeing between the legacy nexeo and legacy univar customers given that we are committed to maintaining the size of the sales force where it is today the combined companies we re going to create i don t know 20 25 free capacity in that sales organization to go grow and go sell to new customers and i think most encouragingly since we announced the deal we have seen a reduction in the attrition of the sales force on both sides so we have a lot of engagement from all our people i mean just a huge amount of optimism and huge amount of engagement from all our people and particularly our sellers are excited about the opportunities that univar solution brings and the ability for them to grow their business and to grow the paycheck as far as the demand is concerned i mean demand is up and down demand is apparently right across right across the globe i don t know whether we re seeing something before other people or not i think certainly looking through a producer lens they see different things then we see typically but the markets are getting more difficult because of uncertainty in the market for the european markets our trick here with brexit ji li jiong ph italy spain germany that they re all more difficult market then they were this time last year and the u s some weeks are good some weeks are less good this is certain amount of uncertainty in the u s market as well we have good strategies to approach that we have good strategies to deliver on that and what we are seeing with the big bulk chemical supplies our customers slowing down a little we re seeing good mix enrichment from the focused industry starting to pick up and we re seeing that reflecting in our margins in the first quarter so far so i think that we will ride the market the best where we possibly can and are pretty encouraged by how we are doing that i think the other thing to say is we re going to pretty prudent about how we outlook i think that our previous outlook were based on us running at ten tenths ph i don t think we re going to run at ten tenths things happened and we re going to factor those ends so you ll see us being very prudent in our forecast going forward robert koort goldman sachs analyst got it thanks for the help operator your next question comes from the line of david begleiter with deutsche bank your line is open david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you good morning hi david just on how does the implied nexeo guidance compared to what they did last year and are you expecting any business loss at nexeo or univar in the combination david jukes president and chief executive officer well let s address the business loss first and i think their outlook is pretty their outlook is pretty flat with last year but in terms of the customer and supplier reaction we re seeing we just now getting first sight of the data the data has been in a clean room so we re seeing first light of the data and the de synergy risk that we see in that is about what we expected in the due diligence on our supply side we have been out and we surveyed 30 something suppliers as part of the due diligence to see what they wanted to see what they were looking for to see what their thought was that has been at the upper end of our expectations so most suppliers are optimistic about the new company and believe that the enhanced capabilities of both organizations really provide a compelling opportunity they are excited about the digitalization of the business and what that can bring and the ability that we re going to have to bring them transparency through the supply chain something that they longed look forward and it s been inhibitory of growth so from what we ve seen so far it s pretty much in line with where we expected in due diligence and the outlook for nexeo is roughly flat with last year carl lukach executive vice president chief financial officer yes i ll add on to that david it s carl where we see this inaudible the industrial production outlook at nexeo prior to the acquisition was very comparable to what we see going forward in terms of this oscillating demand that we have seen month by month so very much aligned there david begleiter deutsche bank analyst very good and just on the synergies 10 billion this year how should they ramp up in 2020 and 2021 carl lukach executive vice president chief financial officer well we i ll just repeat what we said i guess back in september we re very much on track with what we said back in september when we signed the contract on september 17th ramping up to 100 we should be cumulatively at in your savings of about 60 million 2020 that was our previous guidance we stick with that and then in year 2021 about 90 million to 100 million so and i think as david said everything we ve seen since september gives us even higher confidence in achieving that david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you very much david lim vice president of corporate development and investor relations thanks dave operator your next question comes from the line of kevin mccarthy with vertical research partners your line is open kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst yes good morning trying to bridge to your new guidance you put out the 640 million on february 8th and you re calling out 10 million of synergies so is it correct to say that you re baking in about 90 million to 110 million for the 10 months period you ll own nexeo in 2019 carl lukach executive vice president chief financial officer yes that s exactly right kevin it s carl that s about 100 million for the nexeo chemical operations just to remind everyone that excludes your plastics business which will report as a discontinued operations and about 10 million in synergies between now and the end of 2019 kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst okay and then would you comment on what you are baking in for a volume growth forecast in 2019 david jukes president and chief executive officer generally flattish kevin i mean based on what we ve seen in the fourth quarter and continuing in january february in that zero to 1 range which is a notch down from where we were so as we were saying earlier we think customers we sell to the manufacturing sector of the economy people that makes things add versus the headlines in the media and we think people are playing a cautious and adjusting their inventory levels kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst okay then last one would be in the housekeeping category on slide number 15 in the second footnote that appears there i think you indicated about 92 million nexeo shares i was under the impression that would be tracking closer to 90 million and so i m wondering if you could refresh us on what happens with the warrants and how those are being treated in the share count if there s any change there or otherwise that would cause a little bit of upward tension in that number carl lukach executive vice president chief financial officer yeah ok the 92 million versus 90 million kevin let me get back to you on that i think it s 92 million the warrants we ve reserved 7 6 million univar shares to account for or be prepared for the potential exercise of those warrants today those warrants to remind you have a limited term to expire in june of 2011 and 2021 i m sorry 2021 so that two and half years out and on an equivalent univar strike price are around 27 80 as the strike price kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst okay i ll circle back thank you so much david lim vice president of corporate development and investor relations okay thanks operator your next question comes from the line of jim sheehan with suntrust your line is open jim your line is open jim sheehan suntrust analyst thank you sorry about that in talking about your outlook for flattish industrial production could you just talk about what you re seeing currently and what you ve seen over the past couple of years in terms of an outsourcing tailwinds for your business david jukes president and chief executive officer sure i think that s this is one of the questions that we address fairly frequently i think across the course of my career in the chemical industry the outsourcing trend has been inexorable sometimes it just feels glacial one of the things that is really inhibited to outsourcing is the ability to execute consistently well across a range of geographies and secondly the visibility of the business wants business passes across to distribution one of the things that we have seen is because we are now more able to execute or consistently across a range of regions and geographies becoming more attractive to suppliers and that s driving the supplier authorizations and secondly with the digitization that we re about to bring unable to bring we are able to bring a transparency along the supply chain which is something which supply is really value because they can see exactly what s happening to that business it doesn t disappear into a black hole so we think that s going to be a source of competitive advantage for us as we continue to grow and develop and will help us win more than our fair share of the outsourcing trend jim sheehan suntrust analyst thank you and carl lukach executive vice president chief financial officer jim in terms of the impact on our guidance we are pursuing new authorization some of those are outsourcing taking business that was previously sold by the supplier directly into the market and some it s winning business from other distributors but we have dialed into our guidance a modest increase in earnings from new authorizations including that factor of additional outsource jim sheehan suntrust analyst thanks carl and also on your free cash flow guidance does that include debt amortization carl lukach executive vice president chief financial officer that does not include debt amortization we have about 6 million of debt amortization to pay under the new debt structure in 2019 jim sheehan suntrust analyst thanks carl carl lukach executive vice president chief financial officer inaudible it s about 6 million for this calendar year operator your next question comes from the line of steve byrne with bank of montreal your line is open steve byrne bank of montreal analyst david i have question for you on your comment about a quarter of the distribution the stories were tentative for closure did i hear that correctly and is that just based on the overlap of the footprint of the two sector distribution facilities and maybe what would you see an optimal number of closures to achieve ph a highest throughput in utilization efficiency of the existing facilities david jukes president and chief executive officer so what we ve done is looked what we are giving is looking at the each facility and the capabilities of each facility the technical capabilities of each facility the capacity of each facility the customer density around those facilities the permitting around those facilities and so if it makes sense to combine facilities and not disrupt service in fact if we can enhance service then that s what we ll that s what s we will do and so the the 25 of the sites that we considering i mean we re looking at all the sites that we have and then deciding which ones are going to be key anchor sites for us to drive growth for the future and that just some of the things that we re looking around that some of them will require some capital expenditure if we want to do that but some sites will have some unique capability which we want to retain if the business through there is profitable i think going forward i don t know what the ultimate number is i think that as we as we we what we look to do is to provide a differentially high level of service to customers so our on time and full rates are roughly in the high 90s and we want to keep them there that service requirement that reliability that easy to buy from is core parts of our value offerings for customers so i don t have a number that s an optimal in mind but we ll continue to invest in those key sites now we ll be able to afford to invest in really making them technically more competent and digitally more capable which allow us to capture a lot more growth at a higher service level steve byrne bank of montreal analyst and can you comment on how much cost synergy you could achieve from some fraction of those closures and i assume none of that is in your 100 million guidance david jukes president and chief executive officer well i think it is carl lukach executive vice president chief financial officer it is in there david jukes president and chief executive officer so in a 100 million of synergy guidance there is a proportion around asset closures i think it s a little under a third of the 100 million is around asset closures so that s what we ve disclosed multiple speakers i m sorry go ahead carl lukach executive vice president chief financial officer it s one of our top three areas of synergy capture cost capture yes steve byrne bank of montreal analyst how much of that is in that quarter of the facilities can you comment on how many facilities that is david jukes president and chief executive officer well we said that we have round numbers about 100 facilities in the united states and the nexeo has about 40 x plastics when we re done we should have about 100 facilities and i think that it s important to recognize that we also we ve got great density we don t need to add to any territories and we also operate generally one shift a day that we have plenty of capacity to increase volume in this business plan and we intend to do so steve byrne bank of montreal analyst okay just one last one are you considering the merits of staying in that canadian ag business given the potential for disintermediation by some e commerce platforms that are in development in ag david jukes president and chief executive officer well i know this is one that you have been keen on for a while look i mean i think that we re really laser focused on being the most valued chemical ingredient distributor on the planet that s our focus the new device solutions mission is to redefine distribution and be the most valuable chemical ingredient distributor on the planet and so that s what we re going to be laser focused on and to the degree that that any of our businesses that s all we ll traction that then we ll look at what the future of those businesses are based on their profitability their growth and the return on capital carl lukach executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i would add to it i know that you referenced there i wouldn t attributed to disintermediation that s a great business that we have in ag that earns a wonderful return on capital and provides a great service to the consumers of agrochemicals in canada and so we continue to focus on that and we will continuously evaluate our portfolio of all businesses including ag steve byrne bank of montreal analyst thank you carl lukach executive vice president chief financial officer thanks steve operator opeator instructions your next question comes from duffy fischer with barclays your line is open duffy fischer barclays analyst yeah good morning first question is just around free cash flow in the change in guidance from original your ebitda went up 100 million at the midpoint but the free cash flow only went up 50 million at the midpoint why is the conversion so poor on that incremental new ebitda because you re excluding the cash cost for restructuring carl lukach executive vice president chief financial officer yeah that s right duffy we re adding about 50 million we don t have a good field sense yet for the working capital ups and downs of that added chemical business from nexeo once as of friday these two businesses emerged and there is no longer historical nexeo and historical univar so we ll get a better handle on the workings of their receivables and payables and steady cash flow your observation is correct it s a bit lower than what we would expect from our chemicals business but we ll work through that in the coming months duffy fischer barclays analyst okay and then could you bucket for me if you go back to the original 208 million of ltm ebitda that you got with nexeo how much of that goes in the sale how much of that is kind of in the pro forma and then how much of that gets eaten up by say stranded costs when you made the plastic sale carl lukach executive vice president chief financial officer okay roundly roundly duffy is that one third two third is the split of that ltm between plastics and chemicals as far as training costs go we ve got a we ve got with the buyers of plastics we ve got a transitional services agreement in place that will provide what s needed to the buyer and our management of those services in the cost to deliver them will be very focused on eliminating or avoiding stranded costs maybe the most difficult area will be it the it area where it s hard to really a step disengaged from the fixed costs associated with it but for the other services provided they re much more people related and we ve got a dedicated resources in place to provide those services and we ll adjust as that tsa agreement expires duffy fischer barclays analyst so ok just to clarify so if you use your two thirds of the original that would be about 135 million of ebitda that s pro forma still with you but if you back into the guide like we did a little bit earlier in the call you re kind of running at a 110 rate this year is that 25 million delta that s come down is that the stranded cost is that the way we should think about it and that will go away over time carl lukach executive vice president chief financial officer no that s just two months you re dealing with 12 month numbers and we bought it last friday so that s we re just including in our guidance 10 months worth of nexeo accounts duffy fischer barclays analyst no but the two months of the two smallest months of the year and you re getting 10 million of synergies so i d argue that those roughly offset that the run rate for nexeo in your number it sure looks like 110 million to 115 million carl lukach executive vice president chief financial officer i think it little high but it s we re really just prorating 10 months of the year into our guidance duffy fischer barclays analyst okay thank you operator there are no further questions at this time i will now turn the call back to the presenters david lim vice president of corporate development and investor relations thank you ladies and gentlemen for your interest in univar solutions this does conclude today s call if you have any follow up questions

image adobe stock nzd advances as wsj says u s china close to lifting tariffs mufg says to rise further against usd fall against gbp in 2019 as rbnz to defy market pricing by not cutting interest rates at all the new zealand dollar advanced across the board on monday and could go on trending gently higher throughout 2019 according to the latest forecasts from analysts at mufg who say there s little prospect of a reserve bank of new zealand rbnz rate cut this year or next a position that puts them at odds with the broader market new zealand s dollar is up 1 44 against the u s greenback but that performance disguises a number of steep ups and downs to have already been seen by the kiwi currency thus far in the 2019 and is a world away from the losses encountered back in 2018 monday s positive price action came after the wall street journal reported that negotiators are close to sealing a deal to end the u s china trade war claiming that an accord could be signed by presidents donald trump and xi jingping before the end of march the nzd and the aud are benefitting from headlines which suggested that us china talks are nearing a deal that would involve the rollback of tariffs remarks stephen gallo european head of fx strategy at bmo capital markets a complete rollback of tariffs in the near future would come as a complete shock to us monday s headlines lifted the kiwi because new zealand has a substantial trade relationship with china and the latter s economy was hobbled last year by white house tariffs targetting around 250 bn of goods it exports to the u s each year the journal claimed monday those tariffs might be removed this month with the trade war aside speculation over the direction of the rbnz s main interest rate explains most of the other peaks and troughs seen by the kiwi dollar exchange rates in recent times and mufg says the market s view of the rbnz outlook is far too pessimistic we view the new zealand rates market priced with a rate cut probability as overdone and while inflation risks remain muted the economy is set to continue expanding by 3 0 this year the rbnz did lower its rate hike projection modestly in the monetary policy statement in february but absent of an external shock we see little prospect of a rate cut a modestly stronger nzd throughout this year appears likely says derek halpenny head of research at mufg interest rates matter for currencies as expectations for higher interest rates in the future tends to act as a magnet for international capital seeking out superior returns the new zealand dollar has benefited for many years as the country s basic interest rate at the rbnz has been higher than the rate on offer at other developed market central banks however with other central banks now raising rates the kiwi s advantage on the interest rate front has started to wane an interest rate cut at the rbnz would therefore prove to be a negative for the currency above nzd usd rate shown at daily intervals halpenny says that recent downgrades by statistics new zealand of its earlier estimates for net migration into new zealand mean that kiwi wages should be more responsive to each incremental fall in the unemployment rate over the coming quarters kiwi unemployment actually rose by almost 9 during the final quarter of 2018 taking the unemployment rate up to 5 3 so there are few grounds for thinking that kiwi wage growth will lead a pick up in inflation pressures any time soon but mufg says lower migration will keep rbnz hopes of meeting its inflation target alive for timebeing this and healthy rates of economic growth in 2019 should be enough for policymakers to feel confident that an interest rate cut will not be necessary a gradual realisation on the part of the market that kiwi interest rates will not be cut this year or next should provide the new zealand dollar with a boost over the coming months that s because the cash rate implied in the overnight index swap market for wednesday 13 november this year was just 1 6 on monday suggesting investors currently see a high probability of a rate cut coming before year end the rbnz s current cash rate is 1 75 the labour cost index increased 2 0 on an annual basis in q4 a downgrade to net immigration over the past four years of 45 000 will reinforce the potential for wages to pick up from here says halpenny halpenny and the mufg team say the nzd usd rate will likely finish the 2019 year up around 0 71 which is almost 5 above monday s level of 0 68 however mufg forecasts steep losses for the kiwi relative to pound sterling due to an anticipated resolution of the brexit saga playing out in the uk they say the pound to kiwi rate will hit 2 01 by year end which has been rarified territory on the charts ever since the brexit referendum of june 2016 and would be up from the 1 93 level that prevailed on monday above pound to new zealand dollar rate shown at daily intervals

why on earth would politicians seeking to deliver an independent scotland believe it should have its own currency it is a question worth asking for while i believe a scottish currency is a perfectly rational economic position to take politics must come into it and this is far from settled even in the minds of nationalists if you think brexit has shown that leaving our 42 year old relationship with the european union is difficult then just imagine how problematic it would be for scotland leaving the 312 year old united kingdom that has included a currency union with england for three centuries that little difficulty explains why the snp has had more positions on a scottish currency nicola sturgeon has had foreign trips advertisement hide ad advertisement hide ad sign up to our

country will need a new central bank with no track record and carrying a huge share of uk public debt even the snp s growth commission report admits but underestimates the scottish government annual deficit will require severe austerity like nothing seen before to bring it under control gone will be the annual transfer of give or take 10bn from the uk local councils are crying now under snp cuts but they will be screaming until hoarse after scexit the euro currency project has been an economic catastrophe writes brian monteith picture damien meyer afp getty images then there s the unhelpful low price of oil providing little in the way of revenues the chances of the scottish currency appreciating in value are not good a scottish currency will need a central bank with access to currency reserves probably of at least 40bn to help economist and former snp mp george kerevan suggests all scots deposits in scottish bank accounts be converted to the new currency if as is highly likely the currency then depreciates against sterling the value of those deposits depreciate too we are talking here about life savings losing value overnight and from then on that s not a clever way to sell independence similarly all mortgages loans and purchases made in the uk by scots using sterling before independence shall need to be paid back in the equivalent sterling value to avoid default again as the scottish currency depreciates the amount that has to be paid back rises that s not a smart way to sell independence of course the new scottish currency could appreciate and the reverse of these examples would be true making scots more prosperous but is that a risk voters will be willing to take why then is the snp leadership banging this particular drum now the first reason is to kick into the long grass the currency issue that has never been answered adequately in the past the second is to set up a reasonably quick route back into the eu which it knows will entail scotland eventually joining the euro and schengen et al to join the euro you first need to have a central bank and currency to convert from you cannot convert from sterling another country s currency so creating a new currency smooths the path to eu membership and the adoption of the euro a new report published tomorrow demonstrates how beyond any doubt and using the eu s own statistical output the euro currency project has been an economic catastrophe in the mid nineties the eurozone countries and united states enjoyed roughly the same share of world gdp in 1994 the us economy accounted for 24 9 per cent of global gdp compared with the eurozone s 24 5 per cent today the us economy is some 30 per cent larger having broadly held its global share at 22 per cent of global gdp while the eurozone share has declined considerably to 15 1 per cent the us experience shows advanced economies can perform strongly that decline is not inevitable because of the emergence of developing countries but more the product of poor policy choices advertisement hide ad advertisement hide ad the massive scale of the lost opportunity that the eu s economic failure has cost the uk can be gauged by comparing the trade the uk enjoys with the eu now with what it could have been if the eurozone economy had grown at the same rate as the us over the last 20 years estimated by global britain economist ewen stewart at around 355bn last year not the 273bn it achieved put bluntly the eu s economic failure over the last 20 years cost the uk 82bn in lost exports between 1997 2017 or around 3 5 per cent lost gdp each and every year far from being the catalyst for uk prosperity the eu has been a dragweight this lost eu demand is a major factor behind the uk s massive 96bn trade deficit with the eu it largely explains why the uk manages to trade at a small surplus with the rest of the world excluding the eu but performs so disastrously with the eu now the us is pulling away even more annualised growth in the eurozone for 2018 against 2017 was 1 6 per cent uk 1 4 per cent while in the us it was 2 9 per cent worse still the trend is quickening with the quarter 4 comparison being 0 2 per cent for the eurozone 1 3 per cent for the uk and 3 1 per cent for the us there can be no doubt from the evidence that the eu s poor performance is a drag on the uk s exports it therefore makes no economic sense for scotland independent or within the uk to bind itself to the eu and the eurozone scotland firstly needs to make the most of its close and highly beneficial relationship with the rest of the uk and secondly needs like the whole of the uk to focus upon and exploit the opportunities that lie with doing business in the emerging economies scotland s best approach is to remain in the uk with the pound sterling and to trade with the wider world focusing on growth in the emerging markets rather than the declining eurozone independence represents a triple whammy of creating significant barriers to our social and business relationships with england our most important trading partner then switching to a sub optimal currency that is highly likely to lead to immediate impoverishment for scots and worse then adopting another currency that comes laden with controls and regulations that are the antithesis of independence and bring even slower economic growth just when scotland needs rapid growth to save it from a bad decision to leave the uk currency will remain a problem for the snp until the good politics of controlling public expenditure makes sound economics possible

firms in many countries especially in europe are heavily dependent on banks to finance investment and so allocating credit to its best use is a major function of the banking sector by terminating credit lines to firms with poor prospects banks release capital that would otherwise be locked up in unproductive uses and make it available to invest in new or expanding firms when they do this banks support the schumpeterian process of creative destruction given the dominant role of banks in financing aggregate investment the banking system s structural parameters importantly influence the flow of credit and capital for a long time research has suggested that a well functioning financial system is important to support the efficient allocation of capital for example wurgler 2000 established that countries with a developed financial sector are better able to reallocate investment towards more productive and fast growing industries and away from declining sectors evidence from the us acharya et al 2011 and france bertrand et al 2007 shows that banking reforms can render capital allocation more efficient conversely a weak financial sector blocks reallocation troubled banks fear they will violate regulatory standards if they write off non performing loans and so often delay the liquidation of loans to unproductive or quasi insolvent zombie firms japan s lost decade in the 1990s after the collapse of asset prices and collateral values is a prominent example peek and rosengren 2005 caballero et al 2008 it locked up capital in unprofitable uses creating investment distortions and delaying the recovery productivity growth was significantly lower in industries with many such zombie firms figure 1 figure 1 productivity growth and share of zombie firms asset weighted for industries in japan source caballero et al 2008 schumpeterian banks recent evidence points to similar problems in the euro area after the financial crisis acharya et al 2016 schivardi et al 2017 gopinath et al 2017 relate low productivity growth in southern europe spain portugal and italy to large capital inflows a relatively weak financial sector and large capital misallocation they do not find a similar increase of misallocation in countries with more robust banking sectors such as germany france and norway the recapitalisation of banks has become a priority for euro area policy to speed up recovery from the recent crisis and strengthen long term growth these policies focus on financial stability but also connect to the role of finance in schumpeterian creative destruction to foster innovation and growth but only strong and well capitalised banks can adequately fulfil their schumpeterian role on 13 march 2014 mario draghi received the schumpeter award from the austrian national bank in vienna in his speech he emphasised frontloading banking sector repairs should in turn facilitate the schumpeterian process of creative destruction in the economy at large and not only by helping credit flow to younger firms but also by facilitating debt resolution for older ones in our theoretical work keuschnigg and kogler 2018 we argue that the efficiency of credit reallocation will continue to be important long after the crisis and it depends on more than just the capital ratio of banks capital reallocation is a permanent challenge in an economy driven by creative destruction it boils down to the efficiency of credit reallocation when the financing of firms depends on banks rather than capital markets clearly banks must play a critical role in making trade induced structural change possible that necessarily rests on capital and labour flowing from shrinking to expanding sectors mussa 1978 emphasised that this process has frictions consumes resources and may result in permanent changes to industry structure domestic institutions that mitigate or overcome financial frictions therefore become important determinants of specialisation and trade nunn and trefler 2014 in spite of banks importance in financing aggregate investment research in trade has largely neglected their role in factor reallocation our research focuses on the role of banks as the rate of credit reallocation depends on endogenous liquidation and investment decisions by banks our analysis identifies novel bank related and institutional determinants of trade and comparative advantage we investigate the consequences of changes in regulatory capital standards the cost of equity capital of banks and in the efficiency of bankruptcy procedures low bank capitalisation creates zombie firms the liquidation decision and the capital structure of banks drive credit reallocation when banks terminate poor loans they typical recover between 50 and 80 reflecting to some extent differences in bankruptcy procedures across countries the proceeds of liquidation become available to lend to new firms but banks must sell liquidated assets at a discount their losses shrink bank equity and could lead them to violate regulatory capital standards banks are typically not able to raise new capital if they are in financial distress due to large write offs anticipating this they must raise costly voluntary capital buffers in advance and the higher the liquidation rate the larger the voluntary buffer but if bank capital is too low banks must postpone the liquidation of bad loans and with no reserves to absorb losses they continue on existing credit lines when they do this they create zombie firms our analysis has four main results more efficient insolvency laws help banks to extract more capital when liquidating non performing loans this creates an incentive to reallocate credit and shifts final investment and output to more profitable firms in the expanding sector thereby facilitating specialisation in this sector tighter capital standards boosts credit reallocation when the regulatory capital ratio is high banks can more easily absorb loan write offs and in consequence can liquidate non performing loans more frequently by speeding up credit reallocation strong banks shape comparative advantage by shifting investment and output to more innovative firms with better prospects institutional reforms can make bank equity cheaper relative to debt deposit financing the reforms include better investor protection or corporate tax reform tax reform could eliminate the debt bias by introducing a tax deduction for the notional interest on equity capital when equity becomes relatively cheaper banks choose larger voluntary capital buffers schepens 2016 found that belgian banks raised their equity ratios by about 13 compared to other european banks after belgium introduced a tax deduction like this with larger buffers banks can absorb liquidation losses more easily without violating regulatory standards and accordingly liquidate and reallocate more aggressively regulatory and institutional reform can ease the process of creative destruction and help to establish a comparative advantage in innovative industries we also consider reverse causation and analyse the consequences of a trade liberalisation scenario which facilitates specialisation by accelerating reallocation and encouraging entry and exit a strong banking sector magnifies the gains from trade liberalisation it supports the process of credit reallocation from declining to expanding firms and so facilitates the productive specialisation of the economy we believe that free trade can yield larger benefits if complementary policies can ease the process of

there is a palpable feeling that the equities market will face very difficult times this year 2019 and beyond and this perceived discomfort has become pervasive on broad and marina streets of lagos since president buhari emerged winner in the 2019 election which will enable him rule the country for another four years in fact the capital market community s hopes for a shift in fortunes seems to have been dashed as atiku abubakar s seeming loss in the just concluded election appears to dampen their earlier optimism that brighter days would yet come before the elections the business community had hoped that a different leader who is more disposed to delivering on policies that will grow the economy would emerge and ease the persisting tough macro economic environment that would then give a boost to businesses the capital market which has remained bearish even after closing the year 2018 by 17 per cent negative is further rattled by the perception that the buhari presidency whose economic policies appear antithetic to the growth of equities market will further be agitated given his unfavourable disposition to business in nigeria since 2015 after gravitating significantly to the red zone 17 per cent at the close of business in 2018 the equities market has continued to suffer from the weakness of an economy in which gross domestic product gdp grew by a paltry 1 9 per cent last year already the market is still very weak at 0 93 gains year to date friday march 1 2019 while the major index asi reveals a year on year 22 57 per cent negative as at march 1 2019 at the close of business friday march 1 2019 the market asi gained 1 26 per cent or 522 48 to close at 31 721 76 basis points the negative trend recorded this far in the year seems to be taking a cue from the equally discomforting end of 2018 figures industry analysts who are familiar with the market terrain in nigeria are aware that the market closed the year 2018 in about 17 per cent negative from the 42 per cent gains of 2017 this contrasts with the giant leap of the equities market in 2017 when asi closed at 38 243 19 basis points its capitalisation also closed on a high at n13 609tn in the same 2017 but the story was different in 2018 as investors in the equities market lost n1 89tn last year amid instability in the market whereas the market started 2019 on a positive note gaining 1 27 per cent on the first trading day that has since been eroded leaving it with a paltry 0 93 percent growth already not even the banking sector which is not only the dominant sector but also the most actively traded could buck the weak trend this development generated serious concern from investors who seem to be looking for clarity despite the seeming calm after president buhari s return in the 2019 elections particularly worrisome was the fact that the market had developed a niggling volatility that reversed the seeming hopes that had prevailed in the first and second quarters of last year a bevy of stocks have also been reeling from their unprecedented heights to lower levels experts believe that the weakness in the market at the end of 2018 emanated from election jitters which compelled foreign portfolio investors to pull out their resources while others wait on the fringes pending the outcome of the coming elections analysts at meristem securities limited had traced the bearish performance of the equity market in 2018 to negative investor sentiment ahead of the general elections this year in addition to capital flow reversals caused by higher interest rates in the united states which is expected to be 2 50 per cent at the end of this quarter this affected investors participation in the stock market and this was worsened by unimpressive earnings performance by companies on the bourse said meristem securities limited analysts although no one is able to predict the market with accuracy many industry analysts do not think the market can rebound in the short term while there is a consensus that nigeria is endowed with great potentials to be a great economy its capital market is rated among the worst performing in 2018 sentiment to invest in equities this year will be low a financial analyst who pleaded anonymity told business hallmark the economy with a dismal growth of 1 9 per cent in 2018 the nigerian economy unimpressively lost out on meeting the set target of about 3 per cent in a mono economy that is substantially dependent on the vagaries of the price of crude oil for revenues not much has been put in place to galvanise productivity in other sectors for significant growth sadly this is even when the country s population growth rate is put at above 3 per cent annually alongside a corresponding unemployment rate of 23 per cent these continue then to defy the economic recovery and growth plan ergp which industry analysts also doubt is not even being implemented even as it betrays no clear vision whereas agriculture the services and manufacturing sectors inched up in q4 there are still challenges ahead said market observers who also noted that even these have hardly eased the continuing threats of the rising unemployment wave among the youths both international and domestic investors have also complained about multiple exchange rates and multiple taxation and even higher taxation on tobacco and alcohol that have bruised firms in that sector among others whereas the government under president buhari believes it has delivered on its three major promises namely security tackling corruption and growing the economy analysts are quick to point out that there are still mounting incidents of escalating acts of aggression by the islamist sect boko haram alongside the menace of the fulani herdsmen which has barely been tamed in addition they observed the economy still lacks the deserved propulsion to grow evenly while the anti corruption war is just a surface move in all the central bank of nigeria cbn has also noted that the economy recording a 1 9 growth in 2018 signalled that it was still standing on the edge of a cliff which any little indiscretion could easily up turn despite president buhari s controversial victory experts believe that foreign investors cannot easily forget the threat by the president s strong ally on foreign influencers of the election going back in body bags others also argued that the president s failing health has indirectly left the management of the economy in the hands of a faceless cabal with perceived self interest earning the president the label from both reputable domestic and international organisations of being clueless and incompetent again nigeria s rising debt stock which stood at n22trillion is surging back to the unmanageable level that had forced nigeria to ask for debt forgiveness during former president obasanjo s era in office this is not being helped by the reality that there will be new borrowings of about n3trillion to close the year which will correspondingly then shift attention to treasury bills and draw investors away from the equities market all of these conduced to create huge doubts in the minds of many that for a government that beats its chest over its presumed great achievements even when the country has become the poverty capital of the world there is almost no hope of its willingness to change its perceived winning strategy and team united capital believes the buhari administration would engender positive economic fireworks given that it will continue the policies that yielded the small recovery that has been recorded so far but the united capital analysts noted that the budget may depend heavily on borrowing adding that private the sector s ability to drive the economy may drag due to lack of far reaching and illiberal policies hsbc a reputable international financial institution had before the presidential election said although the president s approval ratings sits near all time lows a development it noted largely reflects the impact of nigeria s painful recession in 2016 17 and the sustained economic hardship that has accompanied his presidency including rapidly rising joblessness and poverty the president will once again lead the apc into the 2019 elections a second term for mr buhari raises the risk of limited economic progress and further fiscal deterioration prolonging the stagnation of his first term particularly if there is no move towards completing reform of the exchange rate system or fiscal adjustments that diversify government revenues away from oil it also said joblessness continues to rise up almost three fold in three years to 19 per cent in q3 2017 pushing the number in poverty to 87 million meanwhile current account improvements may have pivoted on higher oil prices but they also derive from on going import restrictions and limited fx access for many sectors of the economy it also said in a strong voice dr godwin owoh executive chairman society for analytical economics expressed concern over the drift of the economy saying the economy was still flat the economy is flat and down with suppressed fundamentals the forex regime has been artificial and will trigger inflation soon i am not sure that even atiku abubakar knows how empty the economic fundamentals are but things will become clearer in the short to medium term said dr owoh however md ceo bic consultancy services dr boniface chizea believes that the uncertainties which have affected investments are no longer there as election fears are now over chizea says the president was expected to build on the momentum and must now adjust some of his policies to run an inclusive government he should do something about the killings and be open to anybody who can help with good ideas to turn the economy around there is a consensus that the capital market cannot thrive in a weak economy will a rebound happen in the market it is difficult to predict with accuracy the nigerian capital market however analysts can make projections based on the macro and micro economic environment within any country a lagos based financial analyst david adonri fears that equities may not be very attractive this year given that investors will do more of money and debt securities he based this on the fact that the government will necessarily borrow more to fund its budget deficit and crowd out the private sector dr afolabi olowokere of financial derivatives company ltd believes that human beings will always be optimistic however he noted that investors are already not expecting to earn much from the capital market given that the markets closed the year in the negative olowokere also argues that the long term trajectory for the market is not dark given that there would be a better direction for the market after the elections he added that it becomes a psychological phenomenon when people take decisions based on developments around them dr adi bongo of lagos business school said the price of crude would play a vital role in what shapes the economy in 2019 this according to him will determine how every other sector of the economy is shaped or affected of course a strong economy has a way of influencing the market positively and a weak economy does otherwise a lagos based financial analyst mr charles iyore believes the nigerian economy lacks what it takes to drive itself he is not alone i am not impressed with the gdp growth at 1 8 per cent it is growing far below the population growth at 3 per cent says dr tunde lemo a former deputy governor at the cbn however though there is a slim chance yet that the market may yet pull a surprise but this does not appear to be the sentiment for many analysts based on extant economic indicators to be sure nigerian investors have always wished to enjoy a repeat of the market era in which market capitalization peaked at about n13 1trillion and the all share index gained a giddy height of 66 551 84 basis points on march 5 2008 bh recalls that in the corresponding period of 2017 the market maintained a bullish disposition and investors smiled to the banks but that was then and this is now and even with wishes being horses do beggars really ride
three thousand teachers are currently on strike in oakland california in the latest in a series of teacher walkouts in the united states involving 71 000 educators during the first eight weeks of 2019 the strike follows last month s walkout in los angeles the nation s second largest school district a strike in denver colorado and a two day statewide walkout in west virginia where the strike a year ago sparked the largest rebellion of teachers across the us in decades teachers and school workers accounted for 380 000 of the nearly half million workers involved in work stoppages in the us last year the largest number since 1986 there have been increasing calls for strikes in many states including oklahoma and arizona where statewide strikes took place last year in são paulo brazil the largest city in the americas teachers have gone on strike for the second time this year against pension cuts in mexico teachers in michoacán and oaxaca struck and set up blockades earlier this month to fight layoffs and government backed school reform earlier this month teachers and child care workers struck in berlin germany educators in portugal joined a general strike teachers in france joined the yellow vest protests against the president of the rich emanuel macron and more than 100 000 teachers from primary school to higher education are set to carry out the first national strike on march 15 in the netherlands teachers have also struck in morocco and zimbabwe amid growing opposition against the reduced education budgets and school privatization throughout africa and tens of thousands of teachers in tamil nadu in southern india struck last month for improved pay and conditions this movement is being driven by record levels of social inequality throughout the world the social counterrevolution which was initiated by uk prime minister margaret thatcher and us president ronald reagan four decades ago was accelerated after the global financial crash of 2008 capitalist governments led by the obama administration in the us spent trillions to buy up the toxic assets of the banks and provide unlimited credit to re inflate the stock markets and the private fortunes of the financial criminals to pay for this political parties of every stripe made austerity the watchword two recent reports highlight the historic transfer of wealth from the bottom to the top in the us since 2008 a new research paper by gabriel zucman an economics professor at the university of california berkeley found that the share of total household wealth controlled by the top 0 1 percent richest adults was at the highest level since 1929 when this tiny elite hoarded 25 percent of the wealth us wealth concentration seems to have returned to levels last seen during the roaring twenties wrote zucman who noted that it could be even higher because of the ability of the super rich to hide their wealth in off shore accounts a report by the us commerce department s bureau of economic analysis found that employee pay and benefits as a percentage of gross domestic income fell to 52 7 percent in last year s third quarter the fourth straight quarterly decline labor s share of domestic income has steadily declined since 1970 when it was 59 percent it continues to be the lowest since the end of world war ii at the same time the share of domestic income going to corporate profits has climbed from less than 12 percent in the 1980s to more than 20 percent today the global economic crisis was also used by the financial elite to loot public assets and get its hands on the world education market which will be worth an estimated 10 trillion by 2030 a recent book pointed to the role of the international monetary fund the world bank usaid and the uk s department for international development dfid in funding school privatization schemes around the world in the us the obama administration which found endless resources to bail out wall street starved the public schools of resources and used the manufactured crisis to expand for profit charter schools by 2016 the latest date available 25 of the 50 us states were still spending less per pupil than they did before the great recession leaving a 19 billion shortfall the number of public school employees today is 170 000 below pre 2008 levels even though student enrollment has risen 1 5 million and in 38 states the average annual salary of teachers is lower than it was in 2009 the universal character of the attack on teachers and public education and what underlies it raises a number of fundamental issues first is the role of the unions throughout the world which are opposed to any struggle because they are aligned with the capitalist parties and accept the entire framework of austerity and social inequality in oakland the union rejected demands by rank and file teachers to include opposition to budget cuts in the strike demands even though the district plans to pay for any pay increases by slashing millions of dollars from educational services and closing schools the oakland education association is colluding with the state democratic party to reach a rotten deal that is entirely acceptable to the corporate and financial elite and like previous strikes across the country betrays the fight to defend the right to public education this is true of the unions throughout the world in the face of the global attack on public education jobs and living standards the nationalist and pro capitalist unions have collaborated with their respective governments and capitalist owners to lower labor costs and corporate taxes in order to make their own countries more competitive that is why the building of new organizations of struggle controlled by workers themselves and independent of the unions is a burning question teachers must form rank and file committees which base themselves on what teachers and students need not what the powers that be say is affordable teachers have won popular support because they are fighting for fundamental rights and because all workers are facing the same conditions declining incomes and skyrocketing living costs precarious employment and endless attacks on social rights including health care and pensions which were won over generations of struggle the developing movement among teachers is an initial expression of a rebellion that will inevitably extend into broader layers of the working class particularly industrial workers in key sectors such as auto steel and other areas of manufacturing it is a movement that will be compelled to address not only the immediate questions of wages and working conditions but the great issues that face workers in every country social inequality the shredding of democratic rights the growth of authoritarian forms of rule and the mounting danger of catastrophic war this article has been excerpted from the global struggle of teachers courtesy wsws org
