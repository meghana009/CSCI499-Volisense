54th legislature we will also be submitting new legislation for your consideration including a revised public health law and a bill to amend the new executive law to create a new chapter to be entitled cooperative development agency 2020 cooperative societies act of liberia 2020 during the period under review four 4 executive orders were issued to address national imperatives executive order no 94 exempting the liberia electricity corporation from customs duties and gst on generation transmission and distribution equipment materials fuel executive order no 95 exempting the liberia water and sewer corporation from customs duties on selected items executive order no 96 instituting certain measures to stimulate economic growth and executive order no 97 suspension of tariff on agriculture products madam vice president and president of the senate mr speaker mr president pro tempore and honorable members of the 54th legislature i am mandated to report on revenues received and expenditure incurred in the year under review total revenue received amounted to four hundred and forty five million united states dollars us 445 million this is thirty five million united states dollars us 35 million less than revenue collected from january to december of 2018 or seven point two percent 7 2 percent total cash expenditure for the period under review amounted to four hundred and six million 406 million united states dollars honorable members of the 54th legislature distinguished ladies and gentlemen the year 2019 was marked by global economic uncertainty recovery of global economic momentum remained slow largely due to trade and geopolitical tensions as well as country specific effects these constraints adversely impacted the performance of our domestic economy the domestic macroeconomic environment was difficult in 2019 it was characterized by low economic growth of less than 1 percent annual inflation of more than 20 percent and depreciation of the liberian dollar by more than 20 percent however in the last quarter of the year under review inflationary pressure was contained reflecting some modest appreciation of the liberian dollar end of period inflation was projected to fall from thirty point six percent 30 6 in may 2019 to twenty point eight percent 25 8 madam vice president mr speaker mr president pro tempore and honorable members of the 54th legislature liberian dollar inflation has undermined the income of the poor and the income of those earning in liberian dollars inflation reduction therefore remains a significant goal of government planning in order to address these macroeconomic challenges the liberian government engaged the international monetary fund in december last year which resulted in the signing of a memorandum of economic and financial policies consequently the executive board of the imf approved an external credit facility of two hundred and thirteen point six million united states dollars us 213 6 million shortly thereafter twenty three million united states dollars us 23 million was disbursed under this facility to the government of liberia through the central bank of liberia the goal of the imf supported program is to stabilize the macro economy through more effective fiscal and monetary policies and through improved governance working in close collaboration with you we were able to pass a credible national budget at five hundred and twenty six million united states dollars us 526 million this budget brings public spending closest to the revenue received in the 2018 19 national budget in executing this budget we have taken steps to control spending so that we significantly reduce the deficit by the end of the fiscal year madam vice president and president of the senate mr speaker mr president pro tempore and honorable members of the 54th legislature for the very first time in our entire legislative history you showed the courage wisdom and determination to trim the government s wage bill and we applaud you for that reducing the public wage bill is a long standing politically sensitive problem that prior administrations were afraid to touch but we had the courage to do so because we believe it will make everyone better off in the long run we therefore appreciate your strong support and cooperation in passing the national remuneration and standardization act which has significantly reformed the public wage we took no pleasure in reducing salaries for government employees through the harmonization process and we fully understand the pain and hardship that this has caused we want to thank all civil servants and government workers for their patience and understanding you are not alone as i was the one who first started the process you will recall that my first announcement as president was the reduction of my salary by 25 and i want you to know that even after i did that my salary was subsequently further reduced during the harmonization exercise this is how it should be because as leaders we should at all times bear the highest burden and lead by example we should be the first to make the cuts and sacrifices since we are elected to serve the people and their interest should always come first the harmonization exercise was necessary to ensure that the government lives within its means during this process we discovered that more than 25 000 public workers were being paid from a general allowance that had no particular grading system for example a secretary in one ministry or agency could be paid 400 dollars while another secretary with the same level of skill or education in another ministry would be paid 1 500 we have now eliminated the general allowance system and have ensured that all public workers have one standardized and harmonized pay one of the outcomes of this process is that it increased the income of almost 15 000 public workers among them teachers and security personnel these reforms are by no means complete and we will continue our efforts to perfect the wage system we are also continuing to remove ghost names from the public payroll and we intend to have all government workers identified with biometric national identification numbers by next budget year we are also working to remove from the public payroll those who have reached retirement age madam vice president and president of the senate mr speaker mr president pro tempore and honorable members of the 54th legislature our government is committed to improving governance and improving the business climate to spur investment last year we launched a twenty seven million united states dollar us 27 million public financial management project supported by the world bank the european union and the government of sweden this project supports better procurement though e procurement stronger revenue collection and better delivery of public goods through higher governance standards madam vice president and president of the senate mr speaker mr president pro tempore and honorable members of the 54th legislature my administration will continue to intensify the fight against corruption which remains prevalent in our society and continues to negatively impact growth and development many believe this to be an unchangeable way of life here in liberia i think otherwise i believe that we will succeed in our fight against corruption and will bring to justice relevant individuals and corporations who have and continue to defraud liberia to this end we have hired the expertise of a world renowned asset recovery firm to assist our local team to carry out a professional excercise to recover liberia s wealth stolen over many decades additionally we will continue to show political will in the fight against waste and abuse of our national resources as we have shown in recent times when a managing director and other high profile officials were dismissed arrested and sent to court to vindicate themselves from accusations of corruption there will be no sacred cows as we take stronger measures to end this societal menace we will therefore introduce new legislation to amend the law creating the liberia anti corruption commission in order to give it more prosecutorial powers and we are working to improve our anti money laundering framework to help spur the business climate this year we will support and re launch the national judiciary conference under the leadership of his honor the chief justice of the supreme court the aim of this conference is to allow the judiciary to play a significant role in business climate reforms this can be done by reforming rules and legal processes and procedures that can increase the confidence of potential investors and the existing business community as well as improve the ease of doing business in liberia distinguished members of the 54th legislature in the year under review we were able to negotiate and sign sixteen 16 financing instruments with various development partners amounting to nearly two hundred and seventy four point thirty five million united states dollars us 274 35 million approximately one hundred and ninety four million united states dollars us 194 million of this amount are loans and about seventy nine million united states dollars us 79 million constitutes grants these loans and grants are allocated as follows one hundred and twenty five point one million united states dollars us 125 1 million for road construction linking barclayville to sasstown voinjama to konia and sanniquellie to loguatuo forty seven million united states dollars us 47 million for improving results in secondary education twenty eight point ninety five million united states dollars us 28 95 million for improving urban water supply in monrovia seventy one point eight million united states dollars us 71 8 million for improving agriculture and six point five million united states dollars us 6 5 million for youth empowerment and employment the government s public debt has increased largely because the country has had to finance major infrastructure projects over the last several years as at end december 2019 the total stock of public debt amounted to one point twenty seven billion united states dollars us 1 27 billion this represents an increase of two hundred and eighty two million united states dollars us 282 million or twenty eight point five percent 28 5 of our debt stock compared to the nine hundred and eighty seven point eight million united states dollars us 987 8 million recorded at the end of 2018 of the total debt stock the share of domestic debt is four hundred and nineteen point eight million united states dollars us 419 8 million while external debt accounts for eight hundred and forty nine point ninety nine million united states dollars us 849 99 million the increase in the debt stock was mainly driven by disbursements from the world bank the african development bank the international fund for agricultural development the saudi development fund and other creditors which totaled one hundred and twenty nine point five million united states dollars us 129 5 million these were loans signed and ratified by the previous administration as part of the imf supported program the government of liberia has now fully reconciled and rationalized all government obligations to the central bank of liberia as of january 1 2020 total government debt to the central bank of liberia has been put at four hundred and eighty seven million united states dollars us 487 million approximately seven point eight percent 7 8 of this amount or thirty eight million united states dollars us 38 million represents borrowing by the current administration in the previous two fiscal years the government has agreed to pay interest at the rate of four percent 4 per annum to the central bank on the principal amount owed with a grace period of 10 years on principal payment another major driver of the increase in debt stock was the effort by our administration to consolidate accrued obligations by state owned enterprises and exposure to local commercial banks totaling one hundred and eighteen point five million united states dollars us 118 5 million these include nasscorp and seven commercial banks including lbdi afriland bank ecobank ib bank uba gn bank and gt bank debts owed to the commercial banks include longstanding government obligations of sixty five point two million united states dollars us 65 2 million which was the result of pre financing of government s heavy fuel oil infrastructure projects government s guarantee to the rubber planters association of liberia in 2014 direct payments made on behalf of the government and loans given to companies for pre financing of various government infrastructure projects last year the africa export import bank approved a bond discount facility that will disburse some fifty two million united states dollars us 52 million to commercial banks as settlement of the sixty five point two million united states dollars us 65 2 million owed by the government this flow will provide strong relief for commercial banks which faced serious liquidity challenges in the year under review madam vice president mr speaker mr president pro tempore and honorable members of the 54th legislature the domestic debt profile given above does not include domestic debt owed to vendors and businesses who have supplied goods and services to the government over the years i am reliably informed that as far back as 2006 the government of liberia conducted an audit of domestic debt owed to vendors yet up to today this situation remains unclear my administration will conduct a new round of audits in 2020 to determine a rationalized and fully reconciled domestic debt figure to complete our domestic debt profile a payment framework will be developed after this reconciliation which may include packaging the debt as a bond for issuance to local and international financial markets distinguished members of the 54th legislature unless domestic revenue significantly improves meeting our debt service obligations will remain a challenge this is because many of our external concessional loans have a 5 year grace period on payment of principal these principal payments are coming due in the next year since the grace period has expired as such our debt service burden will increase in the next few years total debt service over the course of fiscal year 2019 20 is projected at sixty five million united states dollars us 65 million in the next fiscal year this number will increase to ninety eight million united states dollars us 98 million the large stock of public debt places limits on our ability to borrow to finance new investments we are committed to keeping our non concessional borrowing within limits under the imf supported program and are working towards public private financing arrangements to ease the burden on public debt distinguished members of the 54th legislature with these foundations in place we see no reason why the year 2020 cannot see positive growth we will work with determination vigor and focus to stabilize the macroeconomy reduce inflation and put liberians to work in agriculture and other key sectors madam vice president and president of the senate mr speaker mr president pro tempore and honorable members of the 54th legislature the year 2019 was marked by global economic uncertainty and recovery in global economic momentum remained slow largely due to trade and geopolitical tensions as well as country specific effects these constraints adversely impacted the performance of our domestic economy the foreign reserve position of less than three 3 months of import cover was not strong enough to support the regular financing of essential imports of goods and services this was largely explained by limited inflows of foreign exchange due to low export earnings declining aid flows slow direct foreign investment and lower than expected inflows of remittances consequently the liberian dollar has persistently weakened in recent years stabilizing only briefly during november and december of 2019 due largely to a scarcity of liberian dollars in the banking system and weak business activity the large amount of currency held outside the banking system also exacerbated the liquidity situation that was experienced in the latter part of the year in spite of all of these challenges the financial system remained largely sound and stable in response to the challenging liquidity problem the cbl worked with all the relevant stakeholders and swiftly took the following additional measures importation of twenty million united states dollars us 20 million from its account at the federal reserve bank of new york to meet the liberian dollar demand of the commercial banks promotion of the wider usage of electronic payments such as mobile money and point of sales terminals as alternative means of payment as opposed to cash temporary suspension of the remittance split policy to help ease the demand for liberian dollar from commercial banks request legislative approval for the printing of an additional 4 billion liberian dollar banknotes to help mitigate the current liberian dollar liquidity constraints facing the economy to further address the uncertainty in the financial system which is largely attributed to procedural lapses relating to previous printing of liberian dollar banknotes my government has taken several measures aimed at strengthening governance at the central bank of liberia these include the appointment of a new executive governor a new deputy governor for economic policy an acting deputy governor for operations and confirmation of all non executive members of the board of governors additionally in my economic speech last year i announced a policy of no government borrowing from the central bank of liberia i am pleased to report that despite salary delays and a tight fiscal situation in fiscal year 2019 2020 the government of liberia remained firm in this commitment and did not borrow from the central bank of liberia this defines the separation between fiscal and monetary policy and we will build on it as a cornerstone to developing an independent central bank of liberia to further strengthen the independence of the institution i hereby announce that the central bank will no longer be a part of the economic management team the emt will hereafter discuss all but monetary policy issues leaving monetary policy fully to the board and management of the central bank of liberia the cbl act has also been revised and submitted to your august body for your favorable consideration and passage into law this is intended to strengthen the operational independence of the bank and reinforce its newly developed monetary policy framework aimed at promoting price stability also to ensure the effective operations of modern payment instruments in the country the cbl has developed regulations and guidelines for the provision of digital financial services as well as initiated sensitization and awareness campaign on the use of digital financial services especially the mobile money payments systems the payment systems act is being reviewed with the objective of enhancing the enabling legal framework to support the payments ecosystem the bank is working with development partners to fast track its national switch project that would link mobile money to bank accounts and allow for inter operation of the different mobile money platforms in terms of adhering to effective financial management and monetary policy the bank was instrumental in the imf s approval of a program for liberia arrangements have also been concluded between the cbl and usaid to hire the services of kroll consultancy for a six month period to improve the bank s internal control structure they will also supervise the procurement process and logistical arrangements relating to printing transport delivery and release of additional banknotes in the economy through the commercial banks these measures are intended to further improve the credibility of the central bank going forward i want to assure you of an improved monetary condition in 2020 and beyond aimed at promoting a stable macroeconomic environment my government will remain committed to non borrowing from the cbl and non interference in its operations as an assurance of the operational independence of the bank it will work with relevant partners including the imf to strengthen the financial sector by strengthening the operations of commercial banks and fast tracking the digitization of our economy in order to make access to finance easy my government will support the objective of the cbl to build our international foreign reserve which is critical for protecting our economy against external shocks and vulnerabilities madam vice president and president of the senate mr speaker mr president pro tempore and honorable members of the 54th legislature at the inception of our administration we announced to you and the world that infrastructure development with emphasis on roads connectivity will be the principal driver of our pro poor agenda for prosperity development papd consistent with this commitment our development agenda has concentrated on the pavement of five hundred

to elwa junction road have begun of which two kilometers 2 km of asphalt pavement is already completed 9 roberts international airport is the principal gateway to liberia and presents the first impression of our country however we note with dissatisfaction the current state of the road corridor leading from the airport to the elwa junction there have been many unfortunate incidents and accidents which need to claim our attention as national leaders our government has therefore identified the expansion and pavement of the forty five kilometer 45 km ria highway complete with appropriate safety and lighting facilities as a project of national significance towards this end preparations are being concluded to commence construction works on this corridor by march 2020 10 the

feeder roads program which witnessed the rehabilitation and maintenance of over two hundred and forty kilometers 240 km of feeder roads in bong grand bassa lofa and nimba counties 18 similarly the liberian swedish feeder roads project funded by the swedish government has rehabilitated and maintained over four hundred and sixty kilometers 460 km of feeder roads in bong lofa nimba grand gedeh maryland river gee sinoe and grand kru counties prior to and during the period under review 19 while our government is applying every effort to accelerate the full asphalt pavement of major corridors we are also aware that the maintenance of existing laterite corridors is imperative to ensure the unhindered movement of goods and services against this backdrop we have mandated the ministry of public works to ensure that major road corridors in the country are maintained and pliable throughout the year rain or shine 20 the condition of some of our streets in monrovia is very challenging we have therefore initiated a robust maintenance strategy which will see the ministry of public works carry out asphalt maintenance on several inner city roads in monrovia an assessment of traffic lights in the city of monrovia has been concluded a contractor has been hired and our traffic lights will soon be on again 22 as you are aware the executive mansion which is the home to the presidency of our

restoration of the executive mansion by the end of this year towards this end we are providing the needed resources required to complete the executive mansion renovation works madam vice president mr speaker mr pro tempore and honorable members of the 54th legislature infrastructure development especially roads connectivity is cost intensive considering budgetary constraints the rapid development of our roads connectivity program cannot be achieved without the strong support of our international development partners lending institutions and friendly governments it is with this sincere conviction that i on behalf of the government and people of liberia take this opportunity to pay tribute and express our gratitude to our partners including but not limited to the governments of the

dignity of human rights and to the protection of the vulnerable population including women girls children the elderly young people and people living with disabilities to that end i am pleased to inform you today that during the period under review my government has implemented several programs which can serve as testimonies to the fulfilment of the promises we made one of the most important developments in this regard is your passage during your second session of the domestic violence bill i am pleased to report that i signed this landmark bill into law in august last year and it has been printed into handbills to become effective for implementation as liberia s feminist in chief i remain committed to making gender main streaming a matter of priority in the formulation of policies and programs that will drive the development of liberia in the future to that end we intend to establish gender and social inclusion units in all government ministries agencies and commissions we are grateful to have received initial funding for this initiative from the millennium challenge account liberia as a way of ensuring a systematic approach towards protection the gender based violence comprehensive prevention strategy of leaving no one behind was developed and validated to highlight the protection of women girls men and boys against sexual and gender based violence sgbv including marginalized groups a memorandum of understanding has been signed between the ministry of internal affairs the national council of chiefs and elders of liberia and the ministry of gender children and social protection in june last year to suspend all bush schools for a period of one year this period will be used to conduct an inventory of traditional groves and map out traditional practitioners as an agreeable action in ending harmful traditional practices in liberia madam vice president and president of the senate mr speaker mr president pro tempore and members of the 54th legislature two years ago i pledged to accelerate actions towards advancing the nation s aspiration for oil and gas discovery the intention was to ensure that the petroleum sector is managed in a way that promotes efficient institutional governance integrates the principles of accountability and transparency maximizes revenue from potential petroleum resources and supports liberian citizens participation during the year under review significant progress was made towards achieving this objective as required by the new petroleum reform law 2014 separation of the regulatory responsibility from the commercial operations was finalized through the signing of a transfer plan thereby allowing the liberia petroleum regulatory authority lpra and the national oil company of liberia nocal to operate independently but collaboratively in realizing this national objective subsequently a review of the new petroleum law necessitated several changes including systems for granting petroleum rights mandatory liberian business participation adjustment to the maximum size of offshore and onshore blocks amongst others in order to ensure that the law conforms to international standards and best practices these changes were necessary to place government in the position to seek the right investors through the adoption of a predictable flexible and investment attractive regulatory regime following the 2019 amendments to the new petroleum law lpra working in concert with nocal re demarcated the entire liberia offshore blocks layout and sizes to conform to the global grid system in adherence to an ecowas mandate to all member states this exercise has resulted into 33 offshore blocks from the previous 30 blocks it also allows for petroleum rights to be granted through international competitive bidding direct negotiation and executive allocation to nocal my fellow liberians i am pleased to announce to you today that the government of liberia through the liberia petroleum regulatory authority lpra will open up the entire harper basin during the next licensing round beginning in april nine 9 offshore blocks will be put up allowing competent and reputable international oil and gas companies to bid with the hope of recommencing exploration programs following years of inactivity details of the licensing round will be made available in the coming weeks through a partnership between lpra and nocal madam vice president and president of the senate mr speaker mr president pro tempore and members of the 54th legislature liberia cannot realize full economic transformation without a vibrant agriculture program agriculture is critical to the kind of development my government strives to achieve this is why the sector remains a major pillar of the country s development agenda with the program to connect the various communities and counties through quality paved road networks now fully mobilized funded and underway the next big push by my administration this year will be to reorganize the agriculture sector and put it at the front burner of our national development initiatives a greater investment in the sector will not only guarantee food security but will also provide jobs and a source of livelihood for thousands of families across liberia that is why my vetting and selecting of a new agriculture minister was comprehensive and thorough i believe we have found the right person to lead this charge the nominee is a woman whose track record competence and dedication match my vision for agricultural transformation in liberia i hope that you will share my view and grant her speedy confirmation so that she can urgently embark upon the great task that is before her if she cannot do it then i do not know who else we will find to do it over the coming months the government intends to harness both local and international support and resources to lead the new agriculture drive which will focus on the entire value chain from the remote farmlands to the sprawling marketplaces across the country we will exert every effort to subsidize the works of more farmers and local cooperatives with the objective of enhancing productivity whereas the country has traditionally focused on rice production we must begin to work with authorities in the sector and our international counterparts to look at ways we can fully cultivate other cash crops such as cocoa and coffee our neighbors have gained international acclaim for the production and exportation of these products when actually their natural endowment are not that different from ours therefore we will join ongoing efforts by the european union and others to revamp and make the coffee and cocoa sectors viable and profitable we will assist farmers to increase their yields through new farming methods and mechanization over the years millions of dollars were put into agriculture with very little result to show this new drive will tap on available knowledge and experience while working with international partners and local farmers to lead a new program that empowers liberians through agribusinesses in order to grow the economy we expect the new minister if confirmed by the senate to bring harmony to the various efforts in the sector for efficiency and greater productivity we will be seeking the help of your honorable legislature in this regard working with the appropriate committees of both houses we have already secured the commitment of key local and international stakeholders who are supportive of our new drive to upgrade agriculture so that the country can reap its full benefits liberia s comparative advantage lies in its fertile soil vast quantity of arable land and suitable climatic conditions we must therefore make the best of what we are gifted with i therefore invite everyone particularly the youths to join us as we overhaul the agriculture sector madam vice president mr speaker mr pro tempore and members of the 54th legislature traditional economics tell us that agriculture surplus should lead to industrialization but our government plans to leapfrog this process through the special economic zone concept it is our intention to promote labor intensive light manufacturing through the establishment of special economic zones we are cognizant of our infrastructure challenges which pose certain hurdles but with a well organized special economic zone program domestic production by small and medium enterprises will get the needed boost to spur economic growth the special economic zone is a vehicle that will create job opportunities increase personal incomes and add value to unprocessed raw materials for export thanks to our partners feasibility studies have already begun for the development of a special economic zone in buchanan grand bassa county in the meantime we intend to test a pilot project in the free zone area located within the vicinity of the national port authority in monrovia madam vice president mr speaker mr pro

citizens is published in the official gazette of the republic of liberia may their souls and the souls of all the faithful departed rest in perfect peace amen madam vice president and president of the senate mr speaker mr president pro tempore and members of the 54th legislature i would now like to break with tradition and respectfully beg your kind permission to allow me to speak directly to the liberian people i will assume that your silence means consent and so i will proceed accordingly thank you my fellow liberians it has been just over twenty four months since you voted me and the coalition for democratic change into office before that resounding victory we were all out there together in the political wilderness struggling for social justice and for improvement in our economic conditions improvement in our lives and livelihoods and hoping for a brighter future for ourselves and our children it is against this backdrop of social injustice that i out of my love and concern for my country and people was motivated to present myself as a catalyst of hope peace and change to lead a mass movement that would challenge the status quo and become a voice for the voiceless and offer hope to the hopeless it is out of these aspirations that 16 years ago at 38 years of age i was inspired to found the liberia national congress linc which was later to become the congress for democratic change as a political movement with the objective of challenging the existing political order peacefully through the ballot box in order to seek justice for the poor the disadvantaged and the marginalized in our society together we dreamed the impossible dream and after 12 years of non violent struggle our dreams were realized the rest is now a part of liberian political history the now coalition for democratic change was swept into office by a landslide of 61 5 of the popular vote decisively defeating the ruling party that had been in office for 12 years my fellow liberians i am fully aware and will never forget that this resounding victory was born out of trust and confidence that you had in me and was based on a yearning for change and betterment i am sure that you are beginning to see that your confidence in me was well placed and justified as some of the fruits of my labor begin to emerge in just two short years although we have had economic issues the change that i promised can still be felt i know that you would like to see these changes take place more rapidly and this is completely understandable but what is important is that the change has already begun i was very aware when i offered myself for leadership that many things were wrong with this country many things were broken in this economy and many things would need to be corrected revised reversed cancelled and otherwise rectified before real progress could be made there is no doubt in my mind and there has never been any such doubt that i have the ability to meet these challenges head on to deal with them decisively and successfully and thereby justify the confidence that you have reposed in me without trying to make any excuses let me explain that many of the problems that my government has inherited are exogenous and require solutions which must include global and innovative approaches again some of the problems are structural in nature and have been around for many decades we are currently carrying out structural adjustments to our economy but we will not reap the benefits in the short term but rather in the medium to long term i sense your impatience but i would like to tell you today my dear fellow liberians that i am fully pre occupied in the search for lasting solutions to the problems that we have all faced as a nation and as a people for so long development and transformation is a process which takes place over time it is not an overnight event progress and growth always take time however in spite of this i have used the few months that i have been in office to utilize the limited resources that are available to me to implement several projects and programs that are beginning to have a quick and direct impact on the lives of our people in the short term i have already enumerated some of them earlier in this address so there is no need to mention them now but what i am very pleased and excited about is that the confidence that you reposed in me that brought me to the leadership of this nation has been seen and felt by the international community globally both institutionally and bilaterally because of the trust that produced our overwhelming victory our international partners are standing with us to make sure that your hope of a better life becomes a reality they have wholeheartedly embraced me and my government as agents of change during the first trimester of my tenure they have worked closely with my administration and have been convinced of our sincerity and determination to provide a better life for the liberian people and have accordingly responded in a positive manner i have expressed my thanks and gratitude to them earlier in this message and there is no need to do so again but please allow me to do so again anyhow thank you members of the international community our development partners both institutional bilateral and multi lateral for all that you have done for liberia and are still doing to assist my government to bring development growth transformation and prosperity to the liberian people our international partners have fully supported my vision and plans for the transformation and development of liberia and have provided this government with hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and grants professional advice and guidance as well as technical support to make our dreams for you come true accordingly many projects have already been funded and have either started or are about to start these projects represent the seeds of infrastructural development which have been planted in this first season they will soon germinate and become green shoots of progress and many of them are expected to come to full bloom in the next two years and will make a lasting and positive impact on your lives and your future if we continue to work together and avoid the things that can disrupt the economy we will see higher levels of growth in 2022 2023 and beyond but we must work together as liberians to achieve this we must put aside our political differences no matter what your political affiliation we are all liberians we have one country liberia and unless we work together despite our differences our country will not go forward and so i ask you to bear with me and as we say in our liberian way give me small chance yah so i can fix it no one amongst us here is perfect and i am no exception i am sure that since you voted me into office there are some things that i have done that i could have done better or differently but again as we say in our liberian parlance i on it i want you to know that i wake up eagerly every morning to work hard for liberia so that each night i can go to sleep with the satisfaction and confidence that liberia has moved a little higher and a little further through our leadership madam vice president mr speaker mr pro tempore and members of the 54th legislature one of the accomplishments of my administration of which i am most proud is that we have kept the peace in liberia from day one until now by ourselves i want to say to you all liberians congratulations for almost twelve years before we came to office the peace in liberia was maintained by thousands of foreign soldiers on our soil protecting us from each other protecting the people from the government and the government from the people since the departure of the peacekeepers we have kept the peace not by force of arms or military might but by the sheer political will of the government and its calm and professional approach to the management and resolution of conflicts this is a proud achievement especially in view of the fact that there have been many dissident voices and differences of view since we came to office some of which resulted in peaceful street protests our human rights record is pristine clean in two years not a single bullet has been fired in anger by this government at any of our citizens and consequently there have been no deaths from street protests no persons have been arrested for exercising their constitutional rights of peaceable assembly and above all there are no persons who have been jailed because of their political beliefs or associations every citizen has the right under our constitution to have dissenting views and to express them freely and peacefully under the guidelines provided therein and so we welcome these exercises of democratic rights and freedoms and consider them as positive proof of a healthy and functioning democracy we as a government are duty bound by the relevant articles of our constitution to protect the rights of our citizen including those that are not involved in the demonstrations and protests and will continue to do so under the oath that i swore let me assure you that i will always look for ways and opportunities and create the necessary forums for peaceful dialogue among our citizens who may have differing points of view where even if these differences cannot be resolved we can agree amicably to disagree i therefore call upon you my fellow liberians to work with me towards achieving a reconciled united and prosperous nation without peace there can be no progress without peace there can be no development without peace there can be no growth without peace there can be no prosperity whatever we do whatever our differences let us always take the path of peace we want peace in our land and so my fellow liberians this is my pledge that i make to you today under my leadership liberia will prosper i will provide you with quality leadership a leadership of inclusive participation openness and accountability aimed at reducing poverty and improving the quality of life for all this in essence is the true meaning and purpose of the pro poor agenda and so i say to you bravo fellow liberians bravo god bless you all and god bless mama liberia so that she will become a glorious land of liberty by god s command i thank you

interest of national unity and development we say welcome back from your annual recess as you begin this third session of constructive dialogue and deliberations in the interest of our nation and its people madam vice president mr speaker mr pro tempore honorable members of the 54th legislature as you begin this 3rd session of the 54th legislature we urge you to consider the passage of other bills still pending before you which are very essential to our pro poor agenda for prosperity and development we refer to the following the convention of mutual administrative assistance in tax matters an

financing preventive measures and proceeds of crime act 2019 an act to amend and restate an act to authorize the establishment of the central bank of liberia which will enhance the autonomy and independence of the central bank of liberia we also urge you to take another look at our forestry mining and fisheries laws to inject new and innovative thinking to include viable strategies for expansion of productive capacity best practices for better returns and gains as is the case in other jurisdictions madam vice president mr speaker mr president pro tempore and honorable members of the 54th legislature we will also be submitting new legislation for your consideration including a revised public health law and a bill to amend the new executive law to create a new chapter to be entitled cooperative development agency 2020 cooperative societies act of liberia 2020 during the period under review four 4 executive orders were issued to address national imperatives executive order no 94 exempting the liberia electricity corporation from customs duties and gst on generation transmission and distribution equipment materials fuel executive order no 95 exempting the liberia water and sewer corporation from customs duties on selected items executive order no 96 instituting certain measures to stimulate economic growth and executive order no 97 suspension of tariff on agriculture products madam vice president and president of the senate mr speaker mr president pro tempore and honorable members of the 54th legislature i am mandated to report on revenues received and expenditure incurred in the year under review total revenue received amounted to four hundred and forty five million united states dollars us 445 million this is thirty five million united states dollars us 35 million less than revenue collected from january to december of 2018 or seven point two percent 7 2 percent total cash expenditure for the period under review amounted to four hundred and six million 406 million united states dollars honorable members of the 54th legislature distinguished ladies and gentlemen the year 2019 was marked by global economic uncertainty recovery of global economic momentum remained slow largely due to trade and geopolitical tensions as well as country specific effects these constraints adversely impacted the performance of our domestic economy the domestic macroeconomic environment was difficult in 2019 it was characterized by low economic growth of less than 1 percent annual inflation of more than 20 percent and depreciation of the liberian dollar by more than 20 percent however in the last quarter of the year under review inflationary pressure was contained reflecting some modest appreciation of the liberian dollar end of period inflation was projected to fall from thirty point six percent 30 6 in may 2019 to twenty point eight percent 25 8 madam vice president mr speaker mr president pro tempore and honorable members of the 54th legislature liberian dollar inflation has undermined the income of the poor and the income of those earning in liberian dollars inflation reduction therefore remains a significant goal of government planning in order to address these macroeconomic challenges the liberian government engaged the international monetary fund in december last year which resulted in the signing of a memorandum of economic and financial policies consequently the executive board of the imf approved an external credit facility of two hundred and thirteen point six million united states dollars us 213 6 million shortly thereafter twenty three million united states dollars us 23 million was disbursed under this facility to the government of liberia through the central bank of liberia the goal of the imf supported program is to stabilize the macro economy through more effective fiscal and monetary policies and through improved governance working in close collaboration with you we were able to pass a credible national budget at five hundred and twenty six million united states dollars us 526 million this budget brings public spending closest to the revenue received in the 2018 19 national budget in executing this budget we have taken steps to control spending so that we significantly reduce the deficit by the end of the fiscal year madam vice president and president of the senate mr speaker mr president pro tempore and honorable members of the 54th legislature for the very first time in our entire legislative history you showed the courage wisdom and determination to trim the government s wage bill and we applaud you for that reducing the public wage bill is a long standing politically sensitive problem that prior administrations were afraid to touch but we had the courage to do so because we believe it will make everyone better off in the long run we therefore appreciate your strong support and cooperation in passing the national remuneration and standardization act which has significantly reformed the public wage we took no pleasure in reducing salaries for government employees through the harmonization process and we fully understand the pain and hardship that this has caused we want to thank all civil servants and government workers for their patience and understanding you are not alone as i was the one who first started the process you will recall that my first announcement as president was the reduction of my salary by 25 and i want you to know that even after i did that my salary was subsequently further reduced during the harmonization exercise this is how it should be because as leaders we should at all times bear the highest burden and lead by example we should be the first to make the cuts and sacrifices since we are elected to serve the people and their interest should always come first the harmonization exercise was necessary to ensure that the government lives within its means during this process we discovered that more than 25 000 public workers were being paid from a general allowance that had no particular grading system for example a secretary in one ministry or agency could be paid 400 dollars while another secretary with the same level of skill or education in another ministry would be paid 1 500 we have now eliminated the general allowance system and have ensured that all public workers have one standardized and harmonized pay one of the outcomes of this process is that it increased the income of almost 15 000 public workers among them teachers and security personnel these reforms are by no means complete and we will continue our efforts to perfect the wage system we are also continuing to remove ghost names from the public payroll and we intend to have all government workers identified with biometric national identification numbers by next budget year we are also working to remove from the public payroll those who have reached retirement age madam vice president and president of the senate mr speaker mr president pro tempore and honorable members of the 54th legislature our government is committed to improving governance and improving the business climate to spur investment last year we launched a twenty seven million united states dollar us 27 million public financial management project supported by the world bank the european union and the government of sweden this project supports better procurement though e procurement stronger revenue collection and better delivery of public goods through higher governance standards madam vice president and president of the senate mr speaker mr president pro tempore and honorable members of the 54th legislature my administration will continue to intensify the fight against corruption which remains prevalent in our society and continues to negatively impact growth and development many believe this to be an unchangeable way of life here in liberia i think otherwise i believe that we will succeed in our fight against corruption and will bring to justice relevant individuals and corporations who have and continue to defraud liberia to this end we have hired the expertise of a world renowned asset recovery firm to assist our local team to carry out a professional excercise to recover liberia s wealth stolen over many decades additionally we will continue to show political will in the fight against waste and abuse of our national resources as we have shown in recent times when a managing director and other high profile officials were dismissed arrested and sent to court to vindicate themselves from accusations of corruption there will be no sacred cows as we take stronger measures to end this societal menace we will therefore introduce new legislation to amend the law creating the liberia anti corruption commission in order to give it more prosecutorial powers and we are working to improve our anti money laundering framework to help spur the business climate this year we will support and re launch the national judiciary conference under the leadership of his honor the chief justice of the supreme court the aim of this conference is to allow the judiciary to play a significant role in business climate reforms this can be done by reforming rules and legal processes and procedures that can increase the confidence of potential investors and the existing business community as well as improve the ease of doing business in liberia distinguished members of the 54th legislature in the year under review we were able to negotiate and sign sixteen 16 financing instruments with various development partners amounting to nearly two hundred and seventy four point thirty five million united states dollars us 274 35 million approximately one hundred and ninety four million united states dollars us 194 million of this amount are loans and about seventy nine million united states dollars us 79 million constitutes grants these loans and grants are allocated as follows one hundred and twenty five point one million united states dollars us 125 1 million for road construction linking barclayville to sasstown voinjama to konia and sanniquellie to loguatuo forty seven million united states dollars us 47 million for improving results in secondary education twenty eight point ninety five million united states dollars us 28 95 million for improving urban water supply in monrovia seventy one point eight million united states dollars us 71 8 million for improving agriculture and six point five million united states dollars us 6 5 million for youth empowerment and employment the government s public debt has increased largely because the country has had to finance major infrastructure projects over the last several years as at end december 2019 the total stock of public debt amounted to one point twenty seven billion united states dollars us 1 27 billion this represents an increase of two hundred and eighty two million united states dollars us 282 million or twenty eight point five percent 28 5 of our debt stock compared to the nine hundred and eighty seven point eight million united states dollars us 987 8 million recorded at the end of 2018 of the total debt stock the share of domestic debt is four hundred and nineteen point eight million united states dollars us 419 8 million while external debt accounts for eight hundred and forty nine point ninety nine million united states dollars us 849 99 million the increase in the debt stock was mainly driven by disbursements from the world bank the african development bank the international fund for agricultural development the saudi development fund and other creditors which totaled one hundred and twenty nine point five million united states dollars us 129 5 million these were loans signed and ratified by the previous administration as part of the imf supported program the government of liberia has now fully reconciled and rationalized all government obligations to the central bank of liberia as of january 1 2020 total government debt to the central bank of liberia has been put at four hundred and eighty seven million united states dollars us 487 million approximately seven point eight percent 7 8 of this amount or thirty eight million united states dollars us 38 million represents borrowing by the current administration in the previous two fiscal years the government has agreed to pay interest at the rate of four percent 4 per annum to the central bank on the principal amount owed with a grace period of 10 years on principal payment another major driver of the increase in debt stock was the effort by our administration to consolidate accrued obligations by state owned enterprises and exposure to local commercial banks totaling one hundred and eighteen point five million united states dollars us 118 5 million these include nasscorp and seven commercial banks including lbdi afriland bank ecobank ib bank uba gn bank and gt bank debts owed to the commercial banks include longstanding government obligations of sixty five point two million united states dollars us 65 2 million which was the result of pre financing of government s heavy fuel oil infrastructure projects government s guarantee to the rubber planters association of liberia in 2014 direct payments made on behalf of the government and loans given to companies for pre financing of various government infrastructure projects last year the africa export import bank approved a bond discount facility that will disburse some fifty two million united states dollars us 52 million to commercial banks as settlement of the sixty five point two million united states dollars us 65 2 million owed by the government this flow will provide strong relief for commercial banks which faced serious liquidity challenges in the year under review madam vice president mr speaker mr president pro tempore and honorable members of the 54th legislature the domestic debt profile given above does not include domestic debt owed to vendors and businesses who have supplied goods and services to the government over the years i am reliably informed that as far back as 2006 the government of liberia conducted an audit of domestic debt owed to vendors yet up to today this situation remains unclear my administration will conduct a new round of audits in 2020 to determine a rationalized and fully reconciled domestic debt figure to complete our domestic debt profile a payment framework will be developed after this reconciliation which may include packaging the debt as a bond for issuance to local and international financial markets distinguished members of the 54th legislature unless domestic revenue significantly improves meeting our debt service obligations will remain a challenge this is because many of our external concessional loans have a 5 year grace period on payment of principal these principal payments are coming due in the next year since the grace period has expired as such our debt service burden will increase in the next few years total debt service over the course of fiscal year 2019 20 is projected at sixty five million united states dollars us 65 million in the next fiscal year this number will increase to ninety eight million united states dollars us 98 million the large stock of public debt places limits on our ability to borrow to finance new investments we are committed to keeping our non concessional borrowing within limits under the imf supported program and are working towards public private financing arrangements to ease the burden on public debt distinguished members of the 54th legislature with these foundations in place we see no reason why the year 2020 cannot see positive growth we will work with determination vigor and focus to stabilize the macroeconomy reduce inflation and put liberians to work in agriculture and other key sectors madam vice president and president of the senate mr speaker mr president pro tempore and honorable members of the 54th legislature the year 2019 was marked by global economic uncertainty and recovery in global economic momentum remained slow largely due to trade and geopolitical tensions as well as country specific effects these constraints adversely impacted the performance of our domestic economy the foreign reserve position of less than three 3 months of import cover was not strong enough to support the regular financing of essential imports of goods and services this was largely explained by limited inflows of foreign exchange due to low export earnings declining aid flows slow direct foreign investment and lower than expected inflows of remittances consequently the liberian dollar has persistently weakened in recent years stabilizing only briefly during november and december of 2019 due largely to a scarcity of liberian dollars in the banking system and weak business activity the large amount of currency held outside the banking system also exacerbated the liquidity situation that was experienced in the latter part of the year in spite of all of these challenges the financial system remained largely sound and stable in response to the challenging liquidity problem the cbl worked with all the relevant stakeholders and swiftly took the following additional measures importation of twenty million united states dollars us 20 million from its account at the federal reserve bank of new york to meet the liberian dollar demand of the commercial banks promotion of the wider usage of electronic payments such as mobile money and point of sales terminals as alternative means of payment as opposed to cash temporary suspension of the remittance split policy to help ease the demand for liberian dollar from commercial banks request legislative approval for the printing of an additional 4 billion liberian dollar banknotes to help mitigate the current liberian dollar liquidity constraints facing the economy to further address the uncertainty in the financial system which is largely attributed to procedural lapses relating to previous printing of liberian dollar banknotes my government has taken several measures aimed at strengthening governance at the central bank of

to elwa junction road have begun of which two kilometers 2 km of asphalt pavement is already completed 9 roberts international airport is the principal gateway to liberia and presents the first impression of our country however we note with dissatisfaction the current state of the road corridor leading from the airport to the elwa junction there have been many unfortunate incidents and accidents which need to claim our attention as national leaders our government has therefore identified the expansion and pavement of the forty five kilometer 45 km ria highway complete with appropriate safety and lighting facilities as a project of national significance towards this end preparations are being concluded to commence construction works on this corridor by march 2020 10 the

union maintenance works on the st paul bridge to bo waterside road and the elwa to buchanan road are ongoing 17 we also note with satisfaction the positive contribution of the us government to our feeder roads program which witnessed the rehabilitation and maintenance of over two hundred and forty kilometers 240 km of feeder roads in bong grand bassa lofa and nimba counties 18 similarly the liberian swedish feeder roads project funded by the swedish government has rehabilitated and maintained over four hundred and sixty kilometers 460 km of feeder roads in bong lofa nimba grand gedeh maryland river gee sinoe and grand kru counties prior to and during the period under review 19 while our government is applying every effort to accelerate the full asphalt pavement of major corridors we are also aware that the maintenance of existing laterite corridors is imperative to ensure the unhindered movement of goods and services against this backdrop we have mandated the ministry of public works to ensure that major road corridors in the country are maintained and pliable throughout the year rain or shine 20 the condition of some of our streets in monrovia is very challenging we have therefore initiated a robust maintenance strategy which will see the ministry of public works carry out asphalt maintenance on several inner city roads in monrovia an assessment of traffic lights in the city of monrovia has been concluded a contractor has been hired and our traffic lights will soon be on again 22 as you are aware the executive mansion which is the home to the presidency of our country has been under renovation since an unfortunate fire incident about 14 years ago my administration is determined to bring to an end this protracted period of renovation by ensuring the full restoration of the executive mansion by the end of this year towards this end we are providing the needed resources required to complete the executive mansion renovation works madam vice president mr speaker mr pro tempore and honorable members of the 54th legislature infrastructure development especially roads connectivity is cost intensive considering budgetary constraints the rapid development of our roads connectivity program cannot be achieved without the strong support of our international development partners lending institutions and friendly governments it is with this sincere conviction that i on behalf of the government and people of liberia take this opportunity to pay tribute and express our gratitude to our partners including but not limited to the governments of the united states great britain the people s republic of china germany norway sweden india and japan among others we are also grateful to the european union the european investment bank the ecowas bank for investment development ebid the africa export import bank the world bank our arab partners including the saudi fund for development the kuwaiti fund for arab economic development the arab bank for economic development in africa badea and the opec fund for international development ofid kfw and the giz jica sida and most especially the african development bank afdb who currently has the largest road infrastructure financing portfolio in our country permit me to also salute our construction contractors and consultants especially our local liberian construction contractors who are actively participating in the transformation works of our country i am determined to uphold my pledge that under my administration liberians will no longer be spectators in the economy of their country this is why i note with pride and satisfaction the involvement of these local contractors which represents the surest way of ensuring sustainability of these projects in the road sector madam vice president and president of the senate mr speaker mr president pro tempore and honorable members of the 54th legislature when i took the oath of office on january 22 2018 i committed our country to upholding the dignity of human rights and to the protection of the vulnerable population including women girls children the elderly young people and people living with disabilities to that end i am pleased to inform you today that during the period under review my government has implemented several programs which can serve as testimonies to the fulfilment of the promises we made one of the most important developments in this regard is your passage during your second session of the domestic violence bill i am pleased to report that i signed this landmark bill into law in august last year and it has been printed into handbills to become effective for implementation as liberia s feminist in chief i remain committed to making gender main streaming a matter of priority in the formulation of policies and programs that will drive the development of liberia in the future to that end we intend to establish gender and social inclusion units in all government ministries agencies and commissions we are grateful to have received initial funding for this initiative from the millennium challenge account liberia as a way of ensuring a systematic approach towards protection the gender based violence comprehensive prevention strategy of leaving no one behind was developed and validated to highlight the protection of women girls men and boys against sexual and gender based violence sgbv including marginalized groups a memorandum of understanding has been signed between the ministry of internal affairs the national council of chiefs and elders of liberia and the ministry of gender children and social protection in june last year to suspend all bush schools for a period of one year this period will be used to conduct an inventory of traditional groves and map out traditional practitioners as an agreeable action in ending harmful traditional practices in liberia madam vice president and president of the senate mr speaker mr president pro tempore and members of the 54th legislature two years ago i pledged to accelerate actions towards advancing the nation s aspiration for oil and gas discovery the intention was to ensure that the petroleum sector is managed in a way that promotes efficient institutional governance integrates the principles of accountability and transparency maximizes revenue from potential petroleum resources and supports liberian citizens participation during the year under review significant progress was made towards achieving this objective as required by the new petroleum reform law 2014 separation of the regulatory responsibility from the commercial operations was finalized through the signing of a transfer plan thereby allowing the liberia petroleum regulatory authority lpra and the national oil company of liberia nocal to operate independently but collaboratively in realizing this national objective subsequently a review of the new petroleum law necessitated several changes including systems for granting petroleum rights mandatory liberian business participation adjustment to the maximum size of offshore and onshore blocks amongst others in order to ensure that the law conforms to international standards and best practices these changes were necessary to place government in the position to seek the right investors through the adoption of a predictable flexible and investment attractive regulatory regime following the 2019 amendments to the new petroleum law lpra working in concert with nocal re demarcated the entire liberia offshore blocks layout and sizes to conform to the global grid system in adherence to an ecowas mandate to all member states this exercise has resulted into 33 offshore blocks from the previous 30 blocks it also allows for petroleum rights to be granted through international competitive bidding direct negotiation and executive allocation to nocal my fellow liberians i am pleased to announce to you today that the government of liberia through the liberia petroleum regulatory authority lpra will open up the entire harper basin during the next licensing round beginning in april nine 9 offshore blocks will be put up allowing competent and reputable international oil and gas companies to bid with the hope of recommencing exploration programs following years of inactivity details of the licensing round will be made available in the coming weeks through a partnership between lpra and nocal madam vice president and president of the senate mr speaker mr president pro tempore and members of the 54th legislature liberia cannot realize full economic transformation without a vibrant agriculture program agriculture is critical to the kind of development my government strives to achieve this is why the sector remains a major pillar of the country s development agenda with the program to connect the various communities and counties through quality paved road networks now fully mobilized funded and underway the next big push by my administration this year will be to reorganize the agriculture sector and put it at the front burner of our national development initiatives a greater investment in the sector will not only guarantee food security but will also provide jobs and a source of livelihood for thousands of families across liberia that is why my vetting and selecting of a new agriculture minister was comprehensive and thorough i believe we have found the right person to lead this charge the nominee is a woman whose track record competence and dedication match my vision for agricultural transformation in liberia i hope that you will share my view and grant her speedy confirmation so that she can urgently embark upon the great task that is before her if she cannot do it then i do not know who else we will find to do it over the coming months the government intends to harness both local and international support and resources to lead the new agriculture drive which will focus on the entire value chain from the remote farmlands to the sprawling marketplaces across the country we will exert every effort to subsidize the works of more farmers and local cooperatives with the objective of enhancing productivity whereas the country has traditionally focused on rice production we must begin to work with authorities in the sector and our international counterparts to look at ways we can fully cultivate other cash crops such as cocoa and coffee our neighbors have gained international acclaim for the production and exportation of these products when actually their natural endowment are not that different from ours therefore we will join ongoing efforts by the european union and others to revamp and make the coffee and cocoa sectors viable and profitable we will assist farmers to increase their yields through new farming methods and mechanization over the years millions of dollars were put into agriculture with very little result to show this new drive will tap on available knowledge and experience while working with international partners and local farmers to lead a new program that empowers liberians through agribusinesses in order to grow the economy we expect the new minister if confirmed by the senate to bring harmony to the various efforts in the sector for efficiency and greater productivity we will be seeking the help of your honorable legislature in this regard working with the appropriate committees of both houses we have already secured the commitment of key local and international stakeholders who are supportive of our new drive to upgrade agriculture so that the country can reap its full benefits liberia s comparative advantage lies in its fertile soil vast quantity of arable land and suitable climatic conditions we must therefore make the best of what we are gifted with i therefore invite everyone particularly the youths to join us as we overhaul the agriculture sector madam vice president mr speaker mr pro tempore and members of the 54th legislature traditional economics tell us that agriculture surplus should lead to industrialization but our government plans to leapfrog this process through the special economic zone concept it is our intention to promote labor intensive light manufacturing through the establishment of special economic zones we are cognizant of our infrastructure challenges which pose certain hurdles but with a well organized special economic zone program domestic production by small and medium enterprises will get the needed boost to spur economic growth the special economic zone is a vehicle that will create job opportunities increase personal incomes and add value to unprocessed raw materials for export thanks to our partners feasibility studies have already begun for the development of a special economic zone in buchanan grand bassa county in the meantime we intend to test a pilot project in the free zone area located within the vicinity of the national port authority in monrovia madam vice president mr speaker mr pro

citizens is published in the official gazette of the republic of liberia may their souls and the souls of all the faithful departed rest in perfect peace amen madam vice president and president of the senate mr speaker mr president pro tempore and members of the 54th legislature i would now like to break with tradition and respectfully beg your kind permission to allow me to speak directly to the liberian people i will assume that your silence means consent and so i will proceed accordingly thank you my fellow liberians it has been just over twenty four months since you voted me and the coalition for democratic change into office before that resounding victory we were all out there together in the political wilderness struggling for social justice and for improvement in our economic conditions improvement in our lives and livelihoods and hoping for a brighter future for ourselves and our children it is against this backdrop of social injustice that i out of my love and concern for my country and people was motivated to present myself as a catalyst of hope peace and change to lead a mass movement that would challenge the status quo and become a voice for the voiceless and offer hope to the hopeless it is out of these aspirations that 16 years ago at 38 years of age i was inspired to found the liberia national congress linc which was later to become the congress for democratic change as a political movement with the objective of challenging the existing political order peacefully through the ballot box in order to seek justice for the poor the disadvantaged and the marginalized in our society together we dreamed the impossible dream and after 12 years of non violent struggle our dreams were realized the rest is now a part of liberian political history the now coalition for democratic change was swept into office by a landslide of 61 5 of the popular vote decisively defeating the ruling party that had been in office for 12 years my fellow liberians i am fully aware and will never forget that this resounding victory was born out of trust and confidence that you had in me and was based on a yearning for change and betterment i am sure that you are beginning to see that your confidence in me was well placed and justified as some of the fruits of my labor begin to emerge in just two short years although we have had economic issues the change that i promised can still be felt i know that you would like to see these changes take place more rapidly and this is completely understandable but what is important is that the change has already begun i was very aware when i offered myself for leadership that many things were wrong with this country many things were broken in this economy and many things would need to be corrected revised reversed cancelled and otherwise rectified before real progress could be made there is no doubt in my mind and there has never been any such doubt that i have the ability to meet these challenges head on to deal with them decisively and successfully and thereby justify the confidence that you have reposed in me without trying to make any excuses let me explain that many of the problems that my government has inherited are exogenous and require solutions which must include global and innovative approaches again some of the problems are structural in nature and have been around for many decades we are currently carrying out structural adjustments to our economy but we will not reap the benefits in the short term but rather in the medium to long term i sense your impatience but i would like to tell you today my dear fellow liberians that i am fully pre occupied in the search for lasting solutions to the problems that we have all faced as a nation and as a people for so long development and transformation is a process which takes place over time it is not an overnight event progress and growth always take time however in spite of this i have used the few months that i have been in office to utilize the limited resources that are available to me to implement several projects and programs that are beginning to have a quick and direct impact on the lives of our people in the short term i have already enumerated some of them earlier in this address so there is no need to mention them now but what i am very pleased and excited about is that the confidence that you reposed in me that brought me to the leadership of this nation has been seen and felt by the international community globally both institutionally and bilaterally because of the trust that produced our overwhelming victory our international partners are standing with us to make sure that your hope of a better life becomes a reality they have wholeheartedly embraced me and my government as agents of change during the first trimester of my tenure they have worked closely with my administration and have been convinced of our sincerity and determination to provide a better life for the liberian people and have accordingly responded in a positive manner i have expressed my thanks and gratitude to them earlier in this message and there is no need to do so again but please allow me to do so again anyhow thank you members of the international community our development partners both institutional bilateral and multi lateral for all that you have done for liberia and are still doing to assist my government to bring development growth transformation and prosperity to the liberian people our international partners have fully supported my vision and plans for the transformation and development of liberia and have provided this government with hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and grants professional advice and guidance as well as technical support to make our dreams for you come true accordingly many projects have already been funded and have either started or are about to start these projects represent the seeds of infrastructural development which have been planted in this first season they will soon germinate and become green shoots of progress and many of them are expected to come to full bloom in the next two years and will make a lasting and positive impact on your lives and your future if we continue to work together and avoid the things that can disrupt the economy we will see higher levels of growth in 2022 2023 and beyond but we must work together as liberians to achieve this we must put aside our political differences no matter what your political affiliation we are all liberians we have one country liberia and unless we work together despite our differences our country will not go forward and so i ask you to bear with me and as we say in our liberian way give me small chance yah so i can fix it no one amongst us here is perfect and i am no exception i am sure that since you voted me into office there are some things that i have done that i could have done better or differently but again as we say in our liberian parlance i on it i want you to know that i wake up eagerly every morning to work hard for liberia so that each night i can go to sleep with the satisfaction and confidence that liberia has moved a little higher and a little further through our leadership madam vice president mr speaker mr pro tempore and members of the 54th legislature one of the accomplishments of my administration of which i am most proud is that we have kept the peace in liberia from day one until now by ourselves i want to say to you all liberians congratulations for almost twelve years before we came to office the peace in liberia was maintained by thousands of foreign soldiers on our soil protecting us from each other protecting the people from the government and the government from the people since the departure of the peacekeepers we have kept the peace not by force of arms or military might but by the sheer political will of the government and its calm and professional approach to the management and resolution of conflicts this is a proud achievement especially in view of the fact that there have been many dissident voices and differences of view since we came to office some of which resulted in peaceful street protests our human rights record is pristine clean in two years not a single bullet has been fired in anger by this government at any of our citizens and consequently there have been no deaths from street protests no persons have been arrested for exercising their constitutional rights of peaceable assembly and above all there are no persons who have been jailed because of their political beliefs or associations every citizen has the right under our constitution to have dissenting views and to express them freely and peacefully under the guidelines provided therein and so we welcome these exercises of democratic rights and freedoms and consider them as positive proof of a healthy and functioning democracy we as a government are duty bound by the relevant articles of our constitution to protect the rights of our citizen including those that are not involved in the demonstrations and protests and will continue to do so under the oath that i swore let me assure you that i will always look for ways and opportunities and create the necessary forums for peaceful dialogue among our citizens who may have differing points of view where even if these differences cannot be resolved we can agree amicably to disagree i therefore call upon you my fellow liberians to work with me towards achieving a reconciled united and prosperous nation without peace there can be no progress without peace there can be no development without peace there can be no growth without peace there can be no prosperity whatever we do whatever our differences let us always take the path of peace we want peace in our land and so my fellow liberians this is my pledge that i make to you today under my leadership liberia will prosper i will provide you with quality leadership a leadership of inclusive participation openness and accountability aimed at reducing poverty and improving the quality of life for all this in essence is the true meaning and purpose of the pro poor agenda and so i say to you bravo fellow liberians bravo god bless you all and god bless mama liberia so that she will become a glorious land of liberty by god s command i thank you

perhaps the indifference of economists helps fuel the rage against them the toddler s fury at the parent lost in thought the aloofness of economists might also deepen the sense that they are keeping something from us that these mathematic mandarins in their hermetic hermitages spun round with formulae and data are modern day fausts with access to the occult power of numbers that govern our daily lives our fico scores the size of our monthly payments on credit cards and student debt the burden of our rents and our mortgages the size of life insurance payouts and damages for workplace injuries what is the freakonomic clerisy hiding in the last decade it has become ever more acceptable to see this tribe of harmless seeming men and women as not just conversant with the world s ills but responsible for them the west is becoming steadily more oligarchic the financial times recently observed we can thank the chicago school for that the basic proposition is that economists have been midwives of neoliberalism leading the epochal transition from an era characterized by public spending unionization and expansion of social entitlements to our own times of shrinking public budgets precarious labor and personal debt at each step in this journey economists have aided in the reconstruction of capitalist power by delivering policy packages that are the equivalent of macro mail bombs pension reforms constitutions with locks and bolts tax cuts deregulation schemes privatization plans justifications for monopolies and volatile money markets currency reforms self help schemes and handouts to big business recall the scene from ferris bueller s day off where ben stein tries to rouse his catatonic class to complete the phrase voodoo economics apparently that man now runs the world colossus wears tweed the claim seems outrageous on its face how has it been supported the power of economists has been easiest to see beyond europe and north america from the 1960s through the 1990s authoritarianism and academic economics often went hand in mailed glove with advice about suppressing organized labor and beating inflation used in service of projects of export led development one scholar describes the berkeley mafia in suharto s indonesia as economists with guns the signature case of economics as an accessory to terror is augusto pinochet s chile milton friedman friedrich hayek and james m buchanan all traveled to the country after the 1973 coup against the democratically elected salvador allende even if scholarly opinions vary wildly about the influence of these meetings the pinochet moment has become a set piece in books criticizing the role of economists in public life including david harvey s a brief history of neoliberalism 2005 naomi klein s the shock doctrine 2007 and nancy maclean s democracy in chains 2017 we have read time and again how los chicago boys were emissaries from the global north sent to destroy social democracy and the power of the working class the combination of authoritarianism and privatization was brought back north in the 1980s and 1990s ushering in an era of austerity debt and dog eat dog economic darwinism law professor james kwak calls the new religion economism the premise that people companies and markets behave according to the abstract two dimensional illustrations of an economics 101 textbook what united left

rise of derivative markets and subprime mortgages appelbaum is an able storyteller and he does a valuable service by covering all of these issues in a single volume he offers a striking arc from the marginality of economists in state service in the 1930s to their centrality by the 1980s underwriting high stakes decisions that reverberate across people s lives as workers and consumers the economists hour makes strong normative claims about the corrosive effect of this particular cohort of economists who focused on efficiency and growth without regard to the distribution of the gains thus weaken the fabric of society and the viability of local governance appelbaum s book captures the mood of the more thoughtful sector of the financial press and the attendees of the world economic forum they recognize that capitalism is in trouble by isolating a discrete set of policies and naming and shaming a discrete set of scapegoats they open the door for a new and improved crew of economists to introduce a more effective set of fixes redistributive tweaks to salve the discontent of the hinterland climate patches for the carbon problem diversity quotas for representational imbalance the message is that economists have done wrong but they are not beyond redemption capitalism needs new ones to survive its latest bad run what happens when we subject some of the supervillains of economism to closer inspection how much culpability can a small cast of economists carry with marginal revolutionaries historian janek wasserman offers a path breaking account of the only group to rival the chicago school in accounts of neoliberalism s rise wasserman s book is the first comprehensive and archivally driven history of the austrian school of economics from the late nineteenth century to the present the school s most famous representatives are hayek and his mentor ludwig von mises these sons of the habsburg empire enjoy an almost cult like following in some circles of the libertarian movement from the far right to figures like former house speaker paul ryan who wasserman notes distributed the road to serfdom to his staffers wasserman s book deflates any overstatement of the austrian school s policy influence although appelbaum s title dubs economists false prophets his subjects were more like engineers engaged in the nuts and bolts interventions of antitrust litigators and central bankers hayek and mises by contrast were more literally prophetic writing gnomic and interdisciplinary treatises pored over by their followers wasserman cites some moments of policy influence from the austrians including carl menger s role in changing currency policy under the habsburgs and gottfried haberler and fritz machlup making the case for floating exchange rates alongside friedman decades later but he also notes that the flagship journals of austrian economics rank near the bottom in reputation even of their own category of heterodox economics masters of the universe they are not even masters of the university for a more direct illustration of how political power is exercised consider trumponomics written by stephen moore and arthur b laffer if you and a friend wanted to go as libertarian ghouls for halloween you d pick this duo moore holds an m a in economics from the stronghold of austrian economics george mason university qualification enough to become the chief economist of the heritage foundation in 2014 after stints at the cato institute and the club for growth which he founded laffer advised reagan and was known as the guru of his tax cuts a battle story from the war of ideas trumponomics explains how these two veterans of the conservative industrial complex gambled by supporting trump as a candidate when most of the free market right spurned him swallowing the bitter pill of his protectionism which they attribute to steve bannon they made their idée fixe the tax cuts which served as the dowry to the mainstream of the republican party tax reform was like a rite of passage they recount and trump was at long last admitted into the conservative fold even if on probation moore and laffer praise their deregulator in chief for his forward looking policy they reserve much of the book for paeans to his energy policy of drilling mining and fracking which dispenses with ideas of climate change which they place in scare quotes and obama s grandiose dreams of the government somehow changing the weather of course it is not the government changing the weather but all of us the fact that the authors title a chapter saudi america and mean it like it s a good thing tells us something both about their passion for continued unleashing of carbon led growth as well as their attitude to governance moore has said elsewhere that capitalism is a lot more important than democracy i m not even a big believer in democracy interesting for us is how their story fits with explanations about the power of economists in line with the famous cocktail napkin on which laffer drew the curve justifying tax cuts for the wealthy in 1974 the authors offer the crudest possible example of class warfare from above by means of the discipline of economics yet their success has not been total witness trump s trade policy although economists of nearly all political shades agree that free trade is preferable to protection the present administration has bucked this consensus placing massive tariffs on products from china in particular but also against political allies like canada and the european union simple economism it ain t trade strategy has followed the erratic unilateralism of united states trade representative robert lighthizer commerce secretary wilbur ross and trade adviser peter navarro far more than the free trade orthodoxies of libertania there must be more to the story than friedman s henchmen squatting athwart the world appelbaum wasserman laffer and moore all offer a variation of what could be called the anthrax theory of economic knowledge economists develop cultures in the laboratory of their texts and policies serve as the delivery mechanisms into public life in the conclusion to sorting out the mixed economy her epic and field changing work historian amy c offner identifies a starting point for this mode of argument an article published in this very magazine in 1997 by susan george a storied scholar of international political economy the title of the piece was how to win the war of ideas with the subtitle lessons from the gramscian right in her article george faults the left for falling behind the right in the project of building cultural hegemony as evidence she names many of the people and institutions that populate the works of moore and laffer wasserman and appelbaum keith joseph and the centre for policy studies thatcher and the institute of economic affairs hayek reagan heritage and of course friedman and the chicago boys george was among the first wave of social scientists including french sociologist pierre bourdieu and third way architect anthony giddens to establish a binary between social democracy and neoliberalism one had existed until the 1970s the other reigned up to their and our present one of offner s most important claims is that we do violence to our understanding of history by adopting both this simple before and after story and by accepting on faith the starring role of economists and affiliated intellectuals the burgeoning literature on neoliberalism she writes is to a significant extent the mirror image of policy makers and businessmen s triumphalist accounts of their own careers the idea of a period of state driven economic growth giving way to an era of markets reinforces the aura of the very star economists that were architects of the change while concealing the ways that the seeds of the second era were sown in the first by putting the burden of historical change on friedman and his minions we miss the real storyline drawing on case studies of colombia and the united states offner demonstrates that even at the zenith of social democracy the dominant mode of socioeconomic change was not centralized decision making but decentralized public private partnerships designed to incorporate businesspeople into projects of extraction cultivation manufacturing and construction economists tried to control the process and use private capitalists for their own ends but more often than not they were the ones who ended up being used conomists who considered themselves public minded planners could never disentangle themselves from businessmen pursuing private interest she writes the shape of the state changed as a consequence in her central example of the cauca valley in western colombia offner finds that the state recreated itself in the image of private enterprise decentralizing public functions and vesting public powers in the leaders of a private business association when this model came home to the united states it landed first in marginalized spaces the little colombias of inner cities and indigenous reservations before being generalized the private prison complex the commercial control of educational testing and the for profit provision of job training are bastard children not of neoliberalism but of the new deal because offner s primum mobile is not the academic economist but the capitalist her tack is to shift attention to the business sector itself what she finds time and again is that business interests are ambidextrous happy to work as social democrats one moment if it serves their purposes and neoliberals the next true believers are in far less supply than pragmatists when giddens theorized the third way in the late 1990s he suggested we must stop worrying so much about equality and inequality and begin focusing on exclusion and inclusion crystallized here was a move that many define as economism away from the political language of rights and toward the economic language of opportunities not everybody might end up successful but everybody needed a chance offner s study shows just how long these ideas had been around the state long relied on private providers to expand the penumbra of its provisioning but only by offering ever more latitude and profit to private interests in a manner that undercut the universality of provision in her words the state enlarged its capacity by underwriting the growth of private enterprise what offner calls the parasitism of business mobilization during the heyday of developmentalism meant flexibility it s not an entirely novel insight appelbaum cites one financial lender telling the wall street journal that we foreign bankers are for the free market when we re out to make a buck and believe in the state when we are about to lose a buck but offner shows how the voice of business entered the academy directly rather than portraying the rise of the economists as a smooth ascent she portrays a struggle within the ivory tower s commanding heights between the fields of economics and business administration unlike economists who look down on interdisciplinarity the fields of management and business administration have always been syncretic drawing on insights from across fields while centrally privileging the singular capacity and experience of the entrepreneur offner describes a position that is not seriously entertained by the other three books but accords well with our world from davos to silicon valley the proposition that neither politicians nor economists but corporate managers were the true guardians of the public good and the proper stewards of the state offner brings home her arguments in a final chapter devoted to eduardo wiesner a colombian economist famous for his activity at the imf and world bank at the high point of structural adjustment in the 1980s and 1990s wiesner ended his career acting like a perfect character from susan george s 1997 article or appelbaum s book invoking friedman and buchanan to justify offloading state responsibilities to private actors and tying the hands of policymakers from expanding budgets he would seem to be a great piece of evidence for the validity of the argument that one can track the spread of neoliberalism by following the footprints of the minions of mont pelerin around the world yet offner insists that such a reading would take the bait laid by the libertarian propagandists themselves in fact wiesner had been active in development circles in colombia since the 1960s a time when he sang a different melody but danced to the same rhythm the question he had been asking then was one that everybody including all the expatriate new dealers was asking how to extend state capacity in ways that broaden access to markets without giving rise to pesky questions about equality wiesner s solution then was everyone else s incentivize private capital to participate in state managed projects over the decades private capital flexed its muscles ever more and changing global circumstances made it ever harder for the state to capture revenue by the 1990s wiesner could advocate the deployment of private interests to substitute for the state without moving definitively from one paradigm to another from social democrat to neoliberal in offner s words the mixed economy always a hybrid of public and private forms was simply reshuffled leaving the public ever more subordinate to the demands of the private as she sums it up powerfully wiesner never saw himself as a state killer but as a defender of a state in danger of collapse economic reasoning has infiltrated political party programs and public rhetoric it underpins the supposed objectivity of decisions that shape our lives from state budget assessments to environmental policy to central bank direction it deserves our attention and our careful study yet offner s book reminds us to keep one eye on the economists and the other on the shifting alliances of capitalists that profit from the policy worlds that social scientific knowledge helps create the need for a stereoscopic view is clear when trying to understand the way trump s administration has ruled economically despite apocalyptic pronouncements about the demise of the liberal international rules based order the sectors of the u s economy served by the current administration have changed at the margins rather than at the center trump s trade tax regulation and manufacturing policy is not driven primarily by a theory of economics but by the influence of private interests in fulfilling their agenda through him the title of another recent book argues that economics rules but the evidence would suggest it is still capital that rules to stage an effective opposition it pays to recall offner s point that the most effective campaign against private power in the twentieth century was not mounted by international diplomats nor any kind of economists but by social movements determined in their own ways to refuse to be ruled at all quinn slobodian s most recent book is globalists the end of empire and the birth of neoliberalism harvard

climate change has emerged amongst india s most formidable challenges to sustained gdp growth to accelerate the implementation of the country s commitments under the paris agreement and advance its progress towards the sustainable development goals finance is key india needs to develop a comprehensive strategy and an integrated policy approach that aligns the country s financial systems with the long term needs of the economy while incorporating environmental risks china working closely with the united nations environment program has taken international leadership in this arena as india s financial sector evolves it can take cues from china and other leaders in green finance and embed the green imperative in its investment decisions this brief examines the role of the entire financial system in india s transition to a green economy and presents a case for actors in both the financial markets and banks to develop new financial instruments that deliver both investible returns and environmentally positive outcomes introduction india s aspirations to become a us 5 trillion economy by 2024 is contingent on the steady growth of its gross domestic product gdp to this perhaps the most formidable challenge is runaway climate change anthropogenic activity is eroding human capital education productivity as well as produced infrastructure property and natural air water at an unprecedented pace a study measuring the effects of anthropogenic climate forcing on gdp per capita by country has estimated that global warming has caused the indian economy to be 31 percent smaller than it would have otherwise been indeed india is facing extreme climate conditions from flash floods to droughts and record breaking heatwaves analysts have observed that the 2018 and 2019 floods were the kind that are expected only once in hundred years and cannot be blamed on nature s vagaries alone according to reports from mongabay india at least 1 351 people lost their lives due to floods and heavy rainfall in just two months july august of 2019 compared to ugust 2019 reen bonds ive short termism n of nce standardization off all assets under management declined he list in 2014 an1 562 monsoon related deaths recorded for the entire 2018 in kerala climate induced floods have become increasingly frequent the submergence of many parts of mumbai has become an annual affair too parts of north and central india experience deadly heatwaves that break their own record every year apart from these extreme climate induced natural disasters the natural capital of the country is depleting at an accelerated pace bengaluru for instance india s tech capital is already parched and is among the 21 major indian cities that may run out of groundwater by 2020 new delhi has become the most polluted capital in the world and gurugram which is part of the national capital region ncr is the most polluted city it is estimated that air pollution in delhi is responsible for approximately 10 000 to 30 000 deaths in the city annually india has made a commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas ghg emissions by 33 35 percent from 2005 levels increase the share of non fossil fuel based electricity to 40 percent and enhance forest cover to absorb 2 5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030 these goals are articulated in the government s intended nationally determined contributions indcs under the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc in conference of parties cop 21 in paris in 2015 while the political will may be evident the overarching climate actions to achieve indc goals require massive financial resources preliminary estimates indicate that around us 206 billion at 2014 15 prices would be required between 2015 2030 for implementing adaptation actions in key areas like agriculture forestry fisheries infrastructure water resources and ecosystems beyond these additional investments will be needed for strengthening resilience and disaster management pegging the total fund requirement at us 2 5 trillion between 2015 2030 raising financial resources for climate change adaptation and mitigation actions of this scale is an unprecedented challenge but given the existential crisis failure is not an option success will depend on how effectively policymakers are able to draw a comprehensive map for raising the requisite finance and how quickly the financial sector both public and private is able to respond to the needs on time an implementable finance strategy first imperative india launched the national action plan on climate change in 2008 while the document provides the broad policy even after a decade the plan is yet to be backed by an implementable strategy and in particular a policy framework for the financial sector further climate change planning and financing at the state level is at its early stage of development the people s republic of china prc by most accounts is the country that has taken the lead in the area of green financing its experience can provide lessons to other countries like india that are attempting their own strategies the prc established a green finance task force in 2014 and working closely with the united nations environment program unep initiated an inquiry into the design of a sustainable financial system the unep also led an inquiry into the design of a sustainable financial system in india the recommendations of the report include the development of a national green finance strategy that should be taken up at the highest policymaking level during china s presidency of the g20 in 2016 it made green finance a priority and a g20 green finance study group was established at the beginning of that year the prc then launched the world s first green finance policy framework guidelines for establishing the green financial system to create a finance system that will facilitate the economy s transition to sustainable growth these guidelines lay down the official definition of green finance incentives disclosure requirements development plan for green financial products as well as risk mitigation india needs an implementable action plan comprising of strategy and policy framework to enhance the ability of the financial sector to mainstream climate action into decision making towards green financing next steps expansion of regulatory and incentive mechanisms green finance is a systematic programme involving multiple stakeholders such as government financial institutions and regulatory agencies beyond framing the policy framework and guidelines for green finance to create an appropriate incentive and restrictive mechanism green elements will need to be incorporated into laws and regulations of the countries including fiscal taxation monetary credit and industrial policies this cannot be done in isolation and will need a well coordinated approach amongst various actors including the ministry of finance ministry of environment forest and climate change state governments and regulatory bodies such as the reserve bank of india rbi for laws on commercial banks and financial institutions the securities exchange board of india sebi for securities law and the insurance regulatory and development authority of india irdai for insurance law strengthening institutional framework the climate change finance unit ccfu within the department of economic affairs ministry of finance is the key coordinating agency for climate finance in india it was established in 2011 with the objective of creating a strong platform for conducting analyses on issues related to climate finance so far however most of the activities of the ccfu have focused on representing the finance ministry in all climate change financing related issues in international and domestic forums as well as providing input on issues of climate finance in economic surveys there is no institute that has taken on the role of coordinating climate finance amongst various stakeholders and establishing mechanisms around climate finance as a result multiple processes thrive in the country the role of the ccfu should be expanded to house a specialised committee to design suitable and effective policies and processes as well as coordinate amongst various actors in the financial sector both public and private to ensure effective implementation an example in this regard is the green finance committee gfc of the china society of finance and banking all major banks as well as a number of large and medium sized funds insurance and securities companies have joined the gfc since its inception in april 2015 since its inception gfc and its 200 plus members have played a key role in facilitating the release of new policies promoting the notion of green finance product innovation and capacity building to make the top level design and mechanisms of climate change effective and to promote wide scale adoption of green finance it is necessary to raise the awareness and deepen the understanding of green development amongst governments at all levels gain knowledge about green finance and improve capacities at all levels for governments investees and investors and intermediaries therefore the role of the ccfu coordinating committee can be expanded to include raising awareness about green finance as well as capacity development of the financial sector beyond this india also needs an independent think tank that can conduct specialised research in climate finance to promote innovative mechanisms and international best practices this brief takes the example of prc s international institute of green finance iigf of the central university of finance and economics cufe which has emerged as one of the world s leading financial think tanks the iigf is specialised in green finance as well as climate finance and energy finance it conducts research within a range of areas such as credit bonds insurance carbon trading information disclosure and risk assessment at a national and local level and conducts research in other countries as well iigf is one of the executive member institutions of the green finance committee gfc of the china society of finance and banking and has also built an academic relationship with the ministry of finance measuring the finances deployed for india to effectively fight climate change climate finance needs to be predictable assured and transparent the amounts deployed for both adaptation and mitigation activities should be tracked and measured against the needs and priorities while india tracks ghg emissions through various reporting mechanisms including pat perform achieve trade and rpo renewable purchase obligations it does not have a national mrv measurement reporting and verification through which international and domestic climate finance can be tracked accordingly india s second biennial update report to the unfcc has highlighted an integrated mrv system that measures both ghgs and the finance committed to climate action as a capacity building need for the country thus there is an urgent need to develop unified statistical standards and development assessment systems for green finance such a system could be applicable for green finance standardisation disclosures of project wise environment information and monitoring green finance investments to assist policymakers and regulators in monitoring of implementation and evaluation of policies creating a domestic framework for environmental risks like in many other countries india s financial sector both capital and money markets is fraught with the tragedy of horizon long term risks such as climate change are not recognised by market actors including individual and institutional investors due to pervasive short termism and profit motive mechanisms to price in risks associated with climate change and the premium attributable to climate proofing assets need to be developed and there has to be a proactive approach towards green finance currently in india climate change is not included as a scenario in stress tests even as it is already agreed that it is a plausible event that might occur in the future financial institutions should be encouraged to conduct a periodic climate stress test cst or the evaluation of potential vulnerability of banks and financial institutions capital position to climate related risks such as droughts or extreme weather events referring to china once again for a lesson the industrial and commercial bank of china icbc has developed an environmental stress test in effect incorporating environmental risk into its risk management system such an approach is necessary for india given how according to a cambridge study the country fares poorly when it comes to asking companies to disclose how vulnerable their businesses are to climate related risks the assessment was made based on the recommendations made by the task force on climate related financial disclosures tfcd the report also noted that although the securities exchange board of india has introduced a requirement to produce business responsibility reports for the top 100 listed entities in 2012 which was increased to the 500 largest listed companies in 2016 sebi 2016 we have not been able to find evidence of specific tcfd compliant initiatives it is pertinent for banks to recognise understand measure and provision the financial risks of climate change by doing so they will be able to reflect a more accurate value of their assets and liabilities organisations that understand climate risks to their businesses could also avail better financial terms from financial institutions if they hedge for such risks government supported green bank a green bank is a financial institution typically public or quasi public that uses innovative financing techniques and market development tools in partnership with the private sector to accelerate deployment of clean energy technologies globally countries like australia clean energy finance corporation united kingdom green investment group and japan green finance organization have created nationalised banks to leverage private investments in green technologies the indian renewable energy development agency ireda under the ministry of new and renewable energy is a government backed agency for promoting clean energy investments in may 2016 the ireda announced plans to explore becoming india s first green bank a green bank as part of ireda can leverage limited public funds to attract greater private investment to grow india s clean energy market the transformation will empower ireda to access domestic and international capital as well as better financing terms including lower interest rates with longer lending terms to be sure it remains to be seen if such a mechanism will fulfill its objectives recalibration of financial sector for green finance green finance covers a gamut of financial services institutional arrangements country arrangements country initiatives and policies and products debt insurance or guarantees designed to promote the flow of finance towards economic activities and projects these will actively promote environmental improvement climate change mitigation and adaptation and improve efficiencies in natural capital preservation and mobilisation developing a diverse range of green financial products can be an opportunity for capital and money market institutions to not only centralise the green growth model in each and every investment decision be it agriculture industry or infrastructure but also to improve the market share increase profit create customer loyalty and enhance brand image globally opportunities in the indian capital markets as indian capital markets are still evolving there is an opportunity to leapfrog the development paradigm by pioneering and expanding green solutions for both investments and capital raising both through equity and debt green bonds green bonds have emerged as one of the most prominent financial vehicles catering to climate action specifically for projects requiring long term finances long term investors including pension and insurance funds now prefer bonds which invest in green assets as they understand the catastrophic impacts of climate change on their investments in the past 10 years of their existence green bonds have gone from being an esoteric product to being widely accepted and used in the market in 2018 worldwide labelled green bond issuance amounted to us 167 6 billion led by the united states with 20 percent market share and followed by prc 18 percent france 8 percent germany 5 percent and the netherlands 4 percent the climate bonds initiative estimated that green bond issuance in 2019 could reach a record us 250 billion as of november 2018 india had issued green bonds valued at us 7 15 billion the amount is minuscule given the size of india s economy and when compared to the vastness of green bond issuances by the us us 34 billion and prc us 31 billion one of the key reasons for the small scale of green bonds in india is the underdeveloped domestic bond market project developers in india have largely relied on commercial banks for finance although bank finance is not ideal for funding large scale infrastructure due to inherent asset liability mismatch issues the recent non performing assets npa stress of the banking sector demonstrates this as most defaults are on infrastructure or real estate loans between november 2018 and august 2019 green bond issuances from india shrunk further due to multiple factors including interest rate forex fluctuations and large scale npas in the banking sector it was only in august 2019 that two large issuances greenko us 950 million and adani green us 500 million came in the international market to scale up the green bond market the securities exchange board of india sebi in 2017 issued national level regulatory guidelines for issuance and listing of green bonds the guidelines however fell short in defining the term green the pension fund regulatory authority pfrda has reduced the minimum credit rating for indian pension funds from aa to a this will give a fillip to the green bond market as well going forward to expand the green bond market and bring in local capital the government can consider opening up the market for retail participation however to make the product attractive for investors the incidental expenses associated with green bonds related to the rating of the bond and green certification need to be rationalised this could be done by supporting the development of a robust rating system for risk and the degree of green the underlying asset is credit enhancement schemes partial risk guarantee facilities or credit enhancement can be deployed to improve the credit profile of a structured financial product or transaction through partial credit guarantees the guarantee issuer assumes the lenders default risk on a part amount of the debt thereby improving a project s credit rating and reducing the perceived investment risk one of the first partial risk guarantee facilities in india was the asian development bank s adb india solar generation guarantee facility the india infrastructure finance corporation limited iifcl also launched a dedicated scheme known as the credit enhancement scheme for funding viable infrastructure projects with project bond tenors above five years this scheme addressed the challenges currently faced by the indian banking sector such as asset liability mismatch capital adequacy and exposure norms and supported certain renewable energy infrastructure projects to reduce their cost of debt through refinancing their debt through bonds as the scheme has produced successful outcomes it needs to be mainstreamed and the government could consider setting up a dedicated fund to provide hedging services and partial guarantees specifically for green investments aggregation and securitisation aggregation and securitisation are strategies that work together to finance small ticket projects or assets for which it is difficult to raise finance from banks and capital markets aggregation typically refers to a process whereby smaller assets are bundled together securitisation in this context refers to the process by which the bundled assets are monetised under a financing arrangement which could range from a commercial bank loan facility fund or a tradable security sold on the capital markets aided by the clarity on the participation of foreign investors provided by the finance act 2016 the securitisation market in india has been growing in recent years reaching a high of us 7 08 billion in the first half of 2017 from a low of us 2 16 billion in 2015 as the indian securitisation market has already delivered securitisation products with mortgages and vehicle loans as underlying assets the transition to green assets such as green mortgages and electric vehicle loans should be fairly smooth securitisation can also support india s solar rooftop programme blended finance is a fairly new concept and was identified as a financial investment vehicle only in 2015 during un negotiations for the subsequent years typically multilateral development banks and governments are the main sources of financing green assets as private capital seeks commercial rate of return due to lack of tested business models and other associated risks however green financing cannot be scaled up without private sector financing and blended finance could be a useful modality blended finance means blending concessional public philanthropic multilateral finance that is capital extended below market terms to catalyse private finance through guarantees or grants through blended finance the unique characteristics of each capital type can be leveraged towards the shared objective of scaling up private investment and with it the climate impact india holds huge potential with respect to its philanthropic funding as an increasing number of philanthropists are shifting towards an outcome driven approach special funds can be incubated that can take up blended financing to scale up green investments esg investments and funds in the harvard business review s hbr 2019 ranking of the world s top 100 ceos it increased the weightage of environmental and social governance esg to 30 percent this directly led to the dropping out from the list of amazon ceo jeff bezos after topping it in 2014 and consistently being on the list since then this was because bezos scored low on its esg scales a survey of 500 of the world s largest asset managers by thinking ahead institute shows that while overall assets under management were declining esg bucked the trend with mandates rising by 23 3 percent in 2018 although nascent esg investing in india is growing quickly and options are available for all category of investors for institutional investors high net worth individuals and family offices venture capital and private equity funds have emerged for instance quantum advisors has launched a us 1 billion esg fund to invest small to mid cap companies avendus capital is also launching an esg fund indeed the mutual fund industry has a bouquet of options for retail esg investors kotak mutual fund is india s first asset management company to sign the un supported principles for responsible investment pri a global network of investors that attempts to integrate esg practices into investment practices four more investment management firms from india are signatories to pri the sbi magnum equity fund a mutual fund changed its focus to esg and became sbi magnum equity esg fund real estate infrastructure investment trusts real estate infrastructure investment trusts reits invits are securities linked to real estate that can be traded on the stock exchange once they get listed the structure is similar to that of mutual funds where there are sponsors trustees fund managers and unit holders reits invits invest in income generating physical real estate or infrastructure this income gets distributed amongst the unit holders besides regular income from rents and leases gains from capital appreciation of real estate infrastructure also form an income for the unit holders india s first reit was floated in 2018 by a bengaluru based real estate developer backed by blackstone group lp a global private equity firm globally reits invits are emerging as a great way for conscious investors to take exposure in green real estate in august 2019 uk based real estate firm hendrson park bought irish commercial property investment trust green reit in a deal that values the firm at 1 34 billion euros a 25 percent premium to its share price before the sales process kicked off in april it is noteworthy that when green reit put itself up for sale it was trading at a discount to the value of its property portfolio opportunities in retail banking going green is not only limited to large scale infrastructure projects such as solar and wind energy and water management but also smaller ones such as green buildings and habitats clean transportation pollution prevention and control systems and energy efficiency projects retail banks can support the mass adoption of these projects as they are deeply rooted locally and serve both businesses and individuals moreover as retail customers are becoming more aware of the impact of their actions on the environment it is also an opportunity for banks to fulfill their fiduciary relationships improve their market share increase profit create customer loyalty and enhance their brand image both by adopting green practices such as paperless banking and introducing products that reward clients for going green while a variety of green banking products have emerged globally this brief takes china as a good case study for india in prc banks have been active in promoting green transformation and products innovation in 2014 29 major banks signed the joint undertaking of the chinese banking industry regarding green credit and formulated their own policy framework under which they have developed over 50 green credit products covering services such as accepting green assets as collateral or pledges and financing energy efficiency emission reductions and new energy projects the indian retail banking sector is still evolving and has the opportunity to not only offer a diverse range of green products but also integrate environmental incentives in mainstream offerings such as business or project loans as well as housing and vehicle credit green building finance buildings in india s residential and commercial sector consume over 37 percent of the country s electrical energy and certified green buildings can deliver energy savings between 20 30 percent and water savings of up to 30 50 percent as per the indian green building council igbc green buildings are those that use less water optimise energy efficiency conserve natural resources generate less waste and provide healthier spaces for occupants several green building certification agencies have emerged in recent years the igbc indian green building council was formed in 2011 and has more than 5 400 projects registered with a total footprint of more than 6 92 billion square feet the griha green rating for integrated habitat assessment came up in 2007 and has more than 1 700 registered projects and 507 certified professionals the bee bureau of energy efficiency has also developed an energy performance index for office buildings according to an ifc report which analyses the climate investment opportunities in six urban sectors across asia pacific the greatest investment opportunity in the region lies in green buildings at us 17 8 trillion by 2030 with 70 percent of the buildings housing retail commercial hospitality and health needed by 2030 yet to be constructed india is at the threshold of a construction boom and has the potential to emerge as the world s largest green building market according to anarock a property consultant india s green building market is expected to double by 2022 at 10 billion square feet valuing around us 30 50 billion the ifc estimates an investment opportunity of us 1 4 trillion in green buildings with us 1 25 trillion in the residential and 228 in the commercial sector given the market size and well developed certification mechanism financing green buildings across the housing retail commercial hospitality and health sectors presents a viable market as well as opportunity for banks and financial institutions to support green growth however currently the number and type of products offered by retail banks in india is limited to green home loans or green mortgages and no information on the share of green home loans to total housing credit is available by mainstreaming green value in all construction loans through innovative products and approaches that incentivise the uptake of green buildings retail banks can deliver a major thrust to the green growth agenda green vehicle finance the government of india has announced a big push towards electric vehicles under its faster adoption and manufacturing of hybrid and electric vehicles fame scheme phase 1 of fame was launched in 2015 and phase 2 in march 2019 niti ayog estimates that if fame ii and other measures succeed india could realise ev sales penetration of 30 percent of private cars 70 percent of commercial cars 40 percent of buses and 80 percent of two and three wheelers by 2030 it is estimated the lateral shift would significantly reduce the pollution in cities and lessen india s dependence on oil imports given these dynamics the segment is an unprecedented opportunity for banks and financial institutions to contribute to india s transition to a low carbon economy and reduce the vehicular pollution in the cities however electric mobility in india is still at a nascent stage the high up front cost of acquiring an electric or hybrid vehicle has severely hampered the offtake and the key to resolving the deadlock remains in solving the financial puzzle by providing products which incentivise the purchase of electric vehicles the state bank of india for instance has introduced the country s first green car loan electric vehicle to encourage customers to buy electric vehicles the scheme offers a 20 basis points smaller interest rate than on the existing car loan schemes further the loan comes with the longest repayment period of up to eight years as discussed earlier bundling and securitisation of electric vehicle loans could support lowering the cost of finance and increasing the availability of capital green insurance the united nations environment program describes green insurance thus in the narrow sense green insurance usually refers to environmental pollution liability insurance while in the wider sense it can be extended to cover a variety of insurance schemes related to environmental risk management including climate insurance that highlights environmental risk resilience and innovative insurance products that provide safeguards for low carbon solutions insurance can help prevent the risks of environmental pollution and share the responsibilities of damage compensation from a broader perspective compulsory requirements for environmental pollution liability insurance for polluting companies will reveal future pollution costs and thus restrain investments in high environmental risk products therefore green insurance should be an important element of the green finance system the prc for instance has promulgated a mandatory pollution liability insurance law and the pilot was launched by shenzhen the shenzhen compulsory environmental pollution liability insurance pilot business catalog specifically names 1 066 shenzhen based companies across ten industries including electroplating oil depots dangerous chemicals and printed circuit boards that will be required to purchase environmental pollution liability insurance in june 2016 the rbi financial stability report advocated the green insurance concept green insurance helps in mitigating and managing ecological and environmental risks such insurance policies cover potential liabilities arising from the pollution of water land or air or collateral damages to the ecology and environment by policyholders it also said these policies will help in not only providing indemnities for ecological and environmental losses but will also help in the restoration of ecological damages although not mandatory currently the pollution insurance market is evolving in india and companies like tata aig and icici lombard have introduced green insurance products conclusion india is in a race against time in meeting its climate goals and greening all finance has become an imperative this requires concerted efforts a cohesive approach and the collective vision of policymakers regulators and actors in the financial system the way forward is to accelerate the dialogue at the highest level and initiate a narrative around sustainable finance there should be a unified approach around taxonomy green guidelines financial products as well as defining the roles of private and public sector and bankers and asset managers this will stimulate action to align the financial system with green finance and in turn support the sustainable growth of the country as investments are a function of risk and rewards investments in climate finance will not take off unless the risk criteria is not recalibrated for the long term this means putting a risk

briefing highlights the market economic toll of coronavirus what analysts are saying about the coronavirus what to expect from the fed boe this week what else to watch for this week required reading coronavirus toll analysts are trying to tally the potential economic and market toll of the wuhan coronavirus largely using the 2003 sars crisis as a benchmark the human toll is most important of course and economists say the virus known as 2019 ncov should play out at least somewhat differently it is still very early days with analysts looking back at the sars outbreak in 2003 for guidance said toronto dominion bank senior economist leslie preston however the global health system is now much better prepared to contain an outbreak like this she added in a report the containment restrictions in china will hopefully help but the disruption is likely to hold back economic growth there in the short term the impact will go beyond china but should be temporary the rising number of new cases of the wuhan coronavirus and news of the disease s spread to other countries have gripped markets just when the global economic slump appeared to be easing and trade policy risks were settling down said bank of montreal senior economist sal guatieri like all health scares this one is unpredictable and investors are unlikely to relax until the tail risk is contained but if the outbreak follows the course of past ones this century the global economy faces just a temporary stumble let s hope so the sars like sickness is spreading including to canada which has seen the first presumptive case as the globe and mail s kelly grant and laura stone report about 80 people people have died the outbreak has unfolded as china celebrates the lunar new year and beijing has put in place unprecedented travel restrictions to try to contain the virus from an investors standpoint the virus has clearly recently caused a risk off market tone said derek holt bank of nova scotia s head of capital markets economics he cited the impact of the sars virus on the s p 500 the yield on the 10 year treasury the u s dollar corporate credit spreads and high yield debt markets amid the various findings of the world health organization and the centers for disease control and prevention open this photo in gallery source bank of nova scotia open this photo in gallery source bank of nova scotia in all cases the effects upon markets were fleeting mr holt said while the human toll and dangers are real strained valuations in some markets may just be making room for another leg up although it s likely as premature to sound alarmist as it is to dip in just yet here s how things played out in the past involving sars swine flu and ebola according to bmo s mr guatieri following a standard playbook in the economy and markets share prices of airlines restaurants and hotels get notably slammed safe haven buying lifts the yen and swiss franc at the expense of resource based currencies such as the loonie which plumbed a four week low with no help from the bank of canada s dovish pivot he said government bonds strengthen the 10 year u s treasury rate slid 10 basis points week commodity prices fall in anticipation of weaker global demand oil prices plunged 6 per cent week to six week lows on fears the virus will hammer travel in china the world s largest energy consumer while copper prices rode a six day losing streak in anticipation of weaker global demand this ripples through economies mr guatieri said people shop less delay travel and stay home companies turn cautious and delay investments while some of the adverse economic impact is offset by increased demand for health care services and government measures to control the crisis the economy slows nonetheless the bank of canada mr guatieri noted estimated that sars cost the economy 0 6 of a percentage point in annualized growth in the second quarter of 2003 and it cut annual gross domestic product by just about 0 1 per cent that year as health care authorities work to contain the outbreak and the number of new cases falls financial markets subsequently rally and the economy rebounds after the three earlier viral outbreaks this century u s equities quickly recovered cibc world markets chief economist avery shenfeld agreed when canada was disproportionately hit with sars gdp fell in both march and april and its airline stocks clearly underperformed their u s counterparts he said when it was all over those stocks and the economy had fully rebounded for now we ll use that sort of shortlived shock as our base case in affected areas but this story clearly bears watching as the facts on its spread and fatality rate play out it s all premature added rebekah young scotiabank s director of fiscal and provincial economics and her colleague senior economist nikita perevalov but we estimate that a sars equivalent pandemic today could have a similar impact on the canadian economy with an estimated hit of just over 0 1 per cent on the level of gdp by mid 2020 at which point a pandemic should be contained they said in a report today this estimate is subject to a significant degree of uncertainty with risks skewed to a potentially larger impact they added the effect should not be significant enough to trigger a broader economic malaise but could this finally push poloz over the line to proactively stimulate the economy in his next rate call read more what analysts are saying the coronavirus fears have gripped the markets this morning as all the major european equity benchmarks are nursing big losses the situation in china is particularly bad as at least 80 people have passed away from the virus and there have been more than 2 700 confirmed infections stocks that are connected to china are feeling the pain this morning as traders are afraid the health crisis will curtail economic activity beijing have extended the lunar new year holiday in a bid to help tackle the problem david madden analyst cmc markets the who continues to refer to the coronavirus risk as being moderate at the global level but the tone may change after it meets with officials in beijing today it s a little scary frankly not knowing the extent that this virus has spread jennifer lee senior economist bank of montreal markets have a risk off tone to start the week while some analysts argue the fear will be worse than reality with the coronavirus pointing to the low mortality rate no one is anticipating a spanish flu repeat the bigger worry is the economic impact of containment and quarantine strategies particularly in china elsa lignos global head of foreign exchange strategy royal bank of canada if the current outbreak reaches the severity of the sars it would likely still have a similarly small and transitory impact on the canadian economy assuming peak severity in the first half of 2020 the main impact on canada would likely be indirect from lower commodity prices and a drop off in travel related industries in our simulations using the scotiabank global macroeconomic model the combined impact of a 4 per cent lower oil price and the likely disruption to tourism and air travel could leave the level of canadian gdp lower by just over 0 1 per cent by mid 2020 before the virus is brought under control and commodity prices and growth rebound similar to the boc s estimate for the impact from the sars outbreak the annualized gdp growth is expected to be weaker by about 0 3 of a percentage point in 2020q1 q2 rebekah young director of fiscal and provincial economics and nikita perevalov senior economist bank of nova scotia given the focus on china at the epicentre of this health crisis those same markets that had gained in the wake of the us china trade deal are now being hit hardest thus traders are looking towards the likes of and as potential targets to short in case we see further coronavirus deaths on the flip side we are seeing further demand for traditional

any policy changes but there is some speculation that the latter could cut its benchmark rate recent disappointing economic data has raised expectations that the bank of england could well cut rates this week from 0 75 per cent to 0 5 per cent over concerns that the slowdown in economic data seen at the end of 2019 has spilled into the early part of this year said cmc markets chief analyst michael hewson it is certainly true that some of the data has been disappointing however there have been some signs that we could see a pick up in the weeks ahead with a government budget also coming down in early march it certainly wouldn t hurt for the central bank to stand pat mr hewson said a 25 basis point rate cut at this stage would largely be cosmetic in nature and would probably be the monetary policy equivalent of firing a blank rate cuts for the sake of being seen to be doing something are not the way a central bank should be implementing monetary policy also on tap are two key

president george weah would be delivering his second annual message at a time when the country is challenged with the shortage of gasoline and climbing u s rate as citizens continue to lament the hardship the deterioration of the economy is meting on them monrovia in january 2018 a freshly minted president george manneh weah used his first annual message to toe the line of controversy trumpeting three key issues dual citizenship limitation of citizenship only to black people and restriction of land ownership exclusively to citizens of liberia report by rodney d sieh a year later the president used his 2019 annual message to lay the blame for the economic woes on the doorsteps of his predecessor ellen johnson sirleaf when we came to power we inherited a debt of 878 2 million united states dollars at the end of 2017 the debt stock now stands at 987 8 million in 2018 at the end of 2018 the increase in the debt stock of 109 6 million during the period under review is mainly on account of disbursements from borrowing external loan portfolios including the world bank african development bank badea and saudi arabia which were ratified in 2017 liberians want bread butter issues addressed in the aftermath of a nagging controversy over missing ld16 billion and us 25 million intended for infusion in the economy the president went to great lengths assure liberians that the administration was doing all it could to get to the bottom of the saga hours before the president s third annual message very little has changed the economy is in a freefall and a late intervention by the international monetary fund is poised to offer some semblance of hope of turnaround the us exchange rate to the local currency is rapidly creeping up again and consumers and motorists have been piling up for gasoline over the past few days amid denials from the liberia petroleum refinery company that the shortage is artificial it is such bread and butter issues that the likes of fatoumata konneh a merchant in monrovia believes could go a long way in alleviating some of the problems facing the weah led government and one she hopes the president will tackle when he addresses the nation i want the president to address the economic situation in the country if we want for the economy to be stable and to sustain ourselves agriculture is the key if we are able to maintain ourselves and provide food for ourselves everything will be ok if you hold the stomach of the children you can hold everything if no food at all even your wife at home if there is no food in the home she will have no respect for you this year the economy or president weah s interpretation of it is likely to factor in as a nation bruised by rising inflation and rocketing exchange rate scramble for answers draft bills reforms key spokesman says the government chief spokesman information minister lenn eugene nagbe told frontpageafrica sunday the issues most likely to drive the president s message says nagbe the president will perform his constitutional responsibility and give his legislative agenda this will focus on draft bills which focus more on infrastructure and economic growth reforms in the monetary sector and consolidation of the key fiscal measures additionally the president will focus on agriculture which will also feature prominently as a key priority area for 2020 the president is expected to also speak in democracy peace and national reconciliation coming off a year marred by protests and opposition chatters over the governance lapses many political observers say the administration entering his third year is on the brinks of its honey moon period the argument a year ago was the inheriting of a broken and broke nation left by a predecessor still being blamed for a lot of what is unfolding now even some within the administration acknowledge that patience may be wearing thin fortunately any new government has a two year grace period to step in not in your second tenure but in your first because they realized that there will be some extraordinary things or promises that were made that someone might need to fulfill vice president jewel howard taylor said in an exclusive interview with frontpageafrica last week in the first year or two the vp averred there will be some real false up and down i think in year three going forward whatever the shortfalls and the glitches are must now be corrected so that we put the president s agenda that he brought to the nation on the table and that all of us can work to make it happen much of that agenda is expected to be laid out in the president s annual message presidential aides say the president will unveil what has been in the public domain for months his administration s plans to offer nine 9 blocks in a new bid round later in the year the liberia petroleum regulatory agency lpra created by the exploration production law of 2014 ratified in 2016 has reportedly advised the administration on offering the oil blocks on the bidding block the nine 9 blocks referenced by the authority lpra for sale are located in the highly prospective harper basin and include blocks 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 and 33 the bid rounds or licensing round as its sometimes referred to allows a single oil company or a group of oil companies joint venture to apply for a production sharing agreement petroleum license in a competitive and transparent environment giving them the right to search for commercial deposits of oil liberia s last bid round was concluded december of 2014 with over 60 million dollars in commitments but concluded unsuccessfully due to political wrangling between the executive and legislative branches of government since the departure of exxon and chevron from liberia in 2016 2017 there have been no exploration work offshore liberia and the sector has been hanging on by a thread experts say the importance of liberia s next bid round cannot be overstated and will determine all future successes for liberia s fledgling oil sector the decline of oil prices in 2014 resulted in billions of dollars lost for exploration programs worldwide but with the resurgence of new investment and development monies liberia s bid round will be held in a very competitive environment of over sixty 60 countries offering blocks to only a handful of oil companies liberia will only have one opportunity to put its best foot forward the president will perform his constitutional responsibility and give his legislative agenda this will focus on draft bills which focus more on infrastructure and economic growth reforms in the monetary sector and consolidation of the key fiscal measures additionally the president will focus on agriculture which will also feature prominently as a key priority area for 2020 the president is expected to also speak in democracy peace and national reconciliation lenn eugene nagbe minister of information culture and tourism agriculture likely to have big play on the economy aides say the president will trumpet efforts in the past few weeks to regularize payroll for civil servants a move which saw members of the civil servants union of liberia end their threat to stage protest over unpaid salary arrears earlier this year finance and economic planning minister samuel tweah was hopeful that macroeconomic stability will be assured in the new year the president will likely also stress the point that strong fiscal policy is being contained regarding the deficit particularly in the wake of last year s missing money central bank saga the government has since stopped the accumulation of arrears through a new fiscal regime that forces it to only spend what it has and end the massive borrowing from the cbl aides say the president will also look to assure the nation that new interest rate monetary policy framework and new standards at cbl will improve effectiveness of fighting inflation through exchange rate stability additionally the president is expected to push his agenda on agriculture the appointment of a new minister jeanine cooper will likely be trumpeted as a sign of the president s readiness to turn his government s attention to a sector that has long been ignored aides say the government is planning to release some money through commercial banks to local rice producers the current budget has some 1 7 million for public sector investment in agriculture this money is intended to guarantee flexible lending to local rice and good crop growers the government is working to scale up investment in agriculture beyond the 1 7 million and the world bank has agreed to pull in more money for agriculture aides the say the president will also trumpet and hit home the point that major investments and enhancements are expected in security sector with the current police force is short by some 8000 troops other security institutions also have to be strengthened but the challenge is resources the un peace keeping troops had about 16000 personnel here current levels are too small for present challenges investments in security will be made as the budget is reformed looking ahead much of what the president unravels today will likely be hinged on the forecast of the economy a year ago emphasis on the collapse of the country s major export commodities prices on the global market the unmil withdrawal and the effect of the ebola virus disease in 2014 is still in a struggling state highlighted the woes associated with the economic stalemate a year ago emphasis on the collapse of the country s major export commodities prices on the global market the unmil withdrawal and the effect of the ebola virus disease in 2014 is still in a struggling state highlighted the woes associated with the economic stalemate file photo what s in a promise looking back on the past two annual messages promises made have been somewhat mixed in terms of deliverables the push to end the restriction of land ownership exclusively to citizens remains as daunting as the day the president brought it up leaving many potential investors unsure about liberia s readiness to do business amid restrictions to land ownership so too is the limitation of citizenship only to black people the push since it was announced by the president in his first annual message was greeted harshly in the public domain for president weah the framers of the 1847 constitution may have had every reason and justification to include these restrictions in that historic document in their own words and i quote the great object of forming these colonies being to provide a home for the dispersed and oppressed children of africa and to regenerate and enlighten this benighted continent none but persons of color shall be admitted to citizenship in this republic the president said in 2018 while the framers thinking may have been appropriate for the 19th century and for the threats and conditions that existed at that time here in the 21st century he is of the view that these threats no longer exist and that these conditions have changed in these circumstances it is my view that keeping such a clause in our constitution is unnecessary racist and inappropriate for the place that liberia occupies today in the comity of nations regarding dual citizenship advocates scored major recently when mr alvin teage jalloh a liberian with american citizenship won a landmark dual citizenship case against the government of liberia at the supreme court in liberia jalloh a natural born liberian was denied travel document by the liberian embassy in washington when he sought to travel liberia the embassy had informed him he needed a non immigrant liberian visa before he could be permitted to enter liberia the court ruled wherefore and in view of the foregoing the petition is hereby granted section 22 2 of the aliens and nationality law to the extent that it provides for loss of citizenship solely on account of the performance by a citizenship of acts or fulfillment of the conditions specified in section 22 1 without the institution by the government of any proceedings to nullify or cancel citizenship in violation of the due process clause under article 209 a of the 1986 constitution is hereby null and void without any force and effect of law the ruling from the high court settled a lingering question over the past several years liberians at home and abroad have been engaged in a profound discussion about sections 22 1 and 22 2 of the 1973 aliens and nationality law which purported to automatically deprive a liberian of citizenship when that liberian became a naturalized citizen of another country voted in a foreign election or served in the military of another country without prior approval from the president of liberia it is still unclear whether or not the president will cite the issue when he addresses the nation monday but in his 2018 address he did express his belief that most liberians who are also citizens of another country probably acquired the additional nationality as a means to escape from the terrible atrocities which characterized our civil conflict and for economic survival in their new countries of residence if as a condition precedent for other countries to grant citizenship to these persons they had to dis avow their loyalty to liberia and pledge allegiance to the laws of another country then it could have been out of necessity rather than a matter of the heart

focus on draft bills which focus more on infrastructure and economic growth reforms in the monetary sector and consolidation of the key fiscal measures additionally the president will focus on agriculture which will also feature prominently as a key priority area for 2020 the president is expected to also speak in democracy peace and national reconciliation lenn eugene nagbe minister of information culture and tourism agriculture likely to have big play on the economy aides say the president will trumpet efforts in the past few weeks to regularize payroll for civil servants a move which saw members of the civil servants union of liberia end their threat to stage protest over unpaid salary arrears earlier this year finance and economic planning minister samuel tweah was hopeful that macroeconomic stability will be assured in the new year the president will likely also stress the point that strong fiscal policy is being contained regarding the deficit particularly in the wake of last year s missing money central bank saga the government has since stopped the accumulation of arrears through a new fiscal regime that forces it to only spend what it has and end the massive borrowing from the cbl aides say the president will also look to assure the nation that new interest rate monetary policy framework and new standards at cbl will improve effectiveness of fighting inflation through exchange rate stability additionally the president is expected to push his agenda on agriculture the appointment of a new minister jeanine cooper will likely be trumpeted as a sign of the president s readiness to turn his government s attention to a sector that has long been ignored aides say the government is planning to release some money through commercial banks to local rice producers the current budget has some 1 7 million for public sector investment in agriculture this money is intended to guarantee flexible lending to local rice and good crop growers the government is working to scale up investment in agriculture beyond the 1 7 million and the world bank has agreed to pull in more money for agriculture aides the say the president will also trumpet and hit home the point that major investments and enhancements are expected in security sector with the current police force is short by some 8000 troops other security institutions also have to be strengthened but the challenge is resources the un peace keeping troops had about 16000 personnel here current levels are too small for present challenges investments in security will be made as the budget is reformed looking ahead much of what the president unravels today will likely be hinged on the forecast of the economy a year ago emphasis on the collapse of the country s major export commodities prices on the global market the unmil withdrawal and the effect of the ebola virus disease in 2014 is still in a struggling state highlighted the woes associated with the economic stalemate a year ago emphasis on the collapse of the country s major export commodities prices on the global market the unmil withdrawal and the effect of the ebola virus disease in 2014 is still in a struggling state highlighted the woes associated with the economic stalemate file photo what s in a promise looking back on the past two annual messages promises made have been somewhat mixed in terms of deliverables the push to end the restriction of land ownership exclusively to citizens remains as daunting as the day the president brought it up leaving many potential investors unsure about liberia s readiness to do business amid restrictions to land ownership so too is the limitation of citizenship only to black people the push since it was announced by the president in his first annual message was greeted harshly in the public domain for president weah the framers of the 1847 constitution may have had every reason and justification to include these restrictions in that historic document in their own words and i quote the great object of forming these colonies being to provide a home for the dispersed and oppressed children of africa and to regenerate and enlighten this benighted continent none but persons of color shall be admitted to citizenship in this republic the president said in 2018 while the framers thinking may have been appropriate for the 19th century and for the threats and conditions that existed at that time here in the 21st century he is of the view that these threats no longer exist and that these conditions have changed in these circumstances it is my view that keeping such a clause in our constitution is unnecessary racist and inappropriate for the place that liberia occupies today in the comity of nations regarding dual citizenship advocates scored major recently when mr alvin teage jalloh a liberian with american citizenship won a landmark dual citizenship case against the government of liberia at the supreme court in liberia jalloh a natural born liberian was denied travel document by the liberian embassy in washington when he sought to travel liberia the embassy had informed him he needed a non immigrant liberian visa before he could be permitted to enter liberia the court ruled wherefore and in view of the foregoing the petition is hereby granted section 22 2 of the aliens and nationality law to the extent that it provides for loss of citizenship solely on account of the performance by a citizenship of acts or fulfillment of the conditions specified in section 22 1 without the institution by the government of any proceedings to nullify or cancel citizenship in violation of the due process clause under article 209 a of the 1986 constitution is hereby null and void without any force and effect of law the ruling from the high court settled a lingering question over the past several years liberians at home and abroad have been engaged in a profound discussion about sections 22 1 and 22 2 of the 1973 aliens and nationality law which purported to automatically deprive a liberian of citizenship when that liberian became a naturalized citizen of another country voted in a foreign election or served in the military of another country without prior approval from the president of liberia it is still unclear whether or not the president will cite the issue when he addresses the nation monday but in his 2018 address he did express his belief that most liberians who are also citizens of another country probably acquired the additional nationality as a means to escape from the terrible atrocities which characterized our civil conflict and for economic survival in their new countries of residence if as a condition precedent for other countries to grant citizenship to these persons they had to dis avow their loyalty to liberia and pledge allegiance to the laws of another country then it could have been out of necessity rather than a matter of the heart

the sense of serious concern about the economic effects of the wuhan virus evident on wall street friday has turned into something approaching panic in asia this morning china has taken the unprecedented step of extending the chinese new year holiday until february 2nd as it ramps up efforts to control the spread of the virus although confirmed cases have popped up all over the globe the vast majority still remain confined to the chinese mainland price action across asia thus far today has had a look of panic about it s p 500 futures down 1 0 the nikkei 225 down 1 80 gold up 8 0 dollars and wti futures have also fallen after being crushed on friday meanwhile the usd cnh has risen 250 points to 6 9500 and china proxy the australian dollar has eased 20 points to 0 6810 it is very important to note though that japan is the only major asian market open today mainland china hong kong singapore south korea and australia are all closed for various holidays liquidity is therefore much reduced and at a premium across all asset classes thus any moves especially on monday morning can be exaggerated bitter experience has taught me that strong directional moves in the early hours on monday are often the wrong ones on the day the wuhan virus will off course hang like a shadow over financial markets this week with asset markets pumped up on hopes of a global post trade deal recovery and cheap central bank money an unexpected growth shock leaves them particularly vulnerable to a potentially strong downward correction the world s central banks having slashed rates to the bone in 2019 have a severe ammunition shortage on the monetary policy front to offset a growth shock fortunately for the world two central banks that do are the two most important the us federal reserve and china s pboc wuhan virus aside the week will not be without drama in other corners of the financial markets the federal reserve has its first fomc decision of the year on wednesday evening and the bank of england announces its latest rate decision ahead on thursday we expect the fomc to hold unchanged with us data and us company earnings all tracking in the fed s goldilocks zone a response to the wuhan virus if required will be a story for later meetings the bank of england was probably poised to ease this week but recent uk data has been unexpectedly strong the odds for a 25 basis point cut are probably now only 50 50 at best as the uk formally exits europe this week trade continues to be a concern that hasn t died it just took a vacation europe s proposed digital taxes and carbon taxes have put it on a collision course with president trump s america first white house threats have emanated from washington dc of reprisals along with veiled warnings to britain if huawei is allowed even a nibble of the uk s proposed 5g networks readers may recall that after president trump had finished with china the tariff guns would swivel towards europe which also enjoys a massive surplus with the us in a us election year none of this is likely to subside with america s negotiating approach very much shoot first and not bother asking questions later us earnings reach their peak this week with big tech reporting amongst others we expect earnings to remain strong although fears of a wuhan virus induced global slowdown will probably drown out the celebrations equities the nikkei 225 being the only major index open in asia today has borne the brunt of the wuhan virus rush to safety falling 1 80 this morning china stock futures traded on the sgx are also lower by 5 0 without the underlying indices open though the extremity of the move is driven by a lack of liquidity and panic the extension of the chinese new year holiday in china by the government until february 2nd will add to concerns about just how serious the government is taking the wuhan virus with 40 million people in lock down and the unprecedented extension to the holiday equity markets in europe and the united states are likely to continue lower following the sell off on wall street on friday major indices there falling nearly one per cent and s p mini futures lower by the same this morning in electronic trading it is said that when america sneezes the rest of the world catches a cold the ascendance of china in the world s economy means that now if either the us or china sneeze the rest of the world may well catch a cold that worry will likely drown out any other data points this week currencies unsurprisingly the usual suspects are the centre of attention in a holiday thinned asia this morning the off shore yuan has been clubbed on the head with usd cnh rising 0 50 to 6 9620 the haven japanese yen has strengthened against the us dollar usd jpy falling 0 30 to 108 95 china proxies the australian and new zealand dollars have also suffered aud usd falling o 25 to 0 6890 and nzd usd falling 0 40 to 0 6575 usd cnh aside forex moves have been reasonably orderly this morning despite the much reduced liquidity due to pan apac holidays we would expect asian regional currencies to also come under pressure today as china growth worries spread fortunately those same markets have seen a strong appreciation of their currencies over the past two months a one or two day sell off will not be too much of a concern to the region s central banks heading into europe this afternoon we would expect the us dollar and haven currencies to continue to out perform oil both brent crude and wti have gapped lower by over 2 0 this morning in asia continuing friday s strong sell off with ample supply around the world oil is more vulnerable than most markets to a shock economic growth slow down brent crude fell by 2 0 on friday to 60 50 a barrel and has opened below the key 60 00 a barrel level at 59 20 this morning wti also fell by 2 0 on friday to 54 50 a barrel and gapped lower to 53 00 a barrel this morning brent crude s crash through 60 00 gives opec a headache as the pricing benchmark internationally for crude the only mitigating factor for the falls this morning is that almost all of asia is on holiday and liquidity is exceedingly thin that does leave room for bargain hunters and profit takers to emerge in europe to steady prices that though is a big if and the concerns about the wuhan virus likely mean that any rallies will be met by a wall of sellers oil is unlikely to find many friends until signs of concrete progress have been made on the control of the spread of the coronavirus gold gold rallied on friday as haven assets saw heavy demand in new york rallying 0 55 to 1571 50 an ounce the escalation of growth fears from the wuhan virus saw gold gap higher this morning on thin liquidity jumping 0 60 to 1584 25 an ounce gold s rally has undeniably been driven by classical safe haven flows the technical picture though shows that gold has tested 1550 00 an ounce every day over the last seven trading days and held solidly the 1550 00 region has therefore become the critical daily pivot region for gold and its technical picture is constructive if that holds the continuation of the gold rally will rely on developments for good or for ill of the wuhan virus situation from a resistance point of view the next level to watch is 1600 00 an ounce followed by the january 8th highs at 1611 50 an ounce content is for general

huawei is allowed even a nibble of the uk s proposed 5g networks readers may recall that after president trump had finished with china the tariff guns would swivel towards europe which also enjoys a massive surplus with the us in a us election year none of this is likely to subside with america s negotiating approach very much shoot first and not bother asking questions later us earnings reach their peak this week with big tech reporting amongst others we expect earnings to remain strong although fears of a wuhan virus induced global slowdown will probably drown out the celebrations equities the nikkei 225 being the only major index open in asia today has borne the brunt of the wuhan virus rush to safety falling 1 80 this morning china stock futures traded on the sgx are also lower by 5 0 without the underlying indices open though the extremity of the move is driven by a lack of liquidity and panic the extension of the chinese new year holiday in china by the government until february 2nd will add to concerns about just how serious the government is taking the wuhan virus with 40 million people in lock down and the unprecedented extension to the holiday equity markets in europe and the united states are likely to continue lower following the sell off on wall street on friday major indices there falling nearly one per cent and s p mini futures lower by the same this morning in electronic trading it is said that when america sneezes the rest of the world catches a cold the ascendance of china in the world s economy means that now if either the us or china sneeze the rest of the world may well catch a cold that worry will likely drown out any other data points this week currencies unsurprisingly the usual suspects are the centre of attention in a holiday thinned asia this morning the off shore yuan has been clubbed on the head with usd cnh rising 0 50 to 6 9620 the haven japanese yen has strengthened against the us dollar usd jpy falling 0 30 to 108 95 china proxies the australian and new zealand dollars have also suffered aud usd falling o 25 to 0 6890 and nzd usd falling 0 40 to 0 6575 usd cnh aside forex moves have been reasonably orderly this morning despite the much reduced liquidity due to pan apac holidays we would expect asian regional currencies to also come under pressure today as china growth worries spread fortunately those same markets have seen a strong appreciation of their currencies over the past two months a one or two day sell off will not be too much of a concern to the region s central banks heading into europe this afternoon we would expect the us dollar and haven currencies to continue to out perform oil both brent crude and wti have gapped lower by over 2 0 this morning in asia continuing friday s strong sell off with ample supply around the world oil is more vulnerable than most markets to a shock economic growth slow down brent crude fell by 2 0 on friday to 60 50 a barrel and has opened below the key 60 00 a barrel level at 59 20 this morning wti also fell by 2 0 on friday to 54 50 a barrel and gapped lower to 53 00 a barrel this morning brent crude s crash through 60 00 gives opec a headache as the pricing benchmark internationally for crude the only mitigating factor for the falls this morning is that almost all of asia is on holiday and liquidity is exceedingly thin that does leave room for bargain hunters and profit takers to emerge in europe to steady prices that though is a big if and the concerns about the wuhan virus likely mean that any rallies will be met by a wall of sellers oil is unlikely to find many friends until signs of concrete progress have been made on the control of the spread of the coronavirus gold gold rallied on friday as haven assets saw heavy demand in new york rallying 0 55 to 1571 50 an ounce the escalation of growth fears from the wuhan virus saw gold gap higher this morning on thin liquidity jumping 0 60 to 1584 25 an ounce gold s rally has undeniably been driven by classical safe haven flows the technical picture though shows that gold has tested 1550 00 an ounce every day over the last seven trading days and held solidly the 1550 00 region has therefore become the critical daily pivot region for gold and its technical picture is constructive if that holds the continuation of the gold rally will rely on developments for good or for ill of the wuhan virus situation from a resistance point of view the next level to watch is 1600 00 an ounce followed by the january 8th highs at 1611 50 an ounce

asset price inflation and monetary policy keynote speech by yves mersch member of the executive board of the ecb and vice chair of the supervisory board of the ecb at the celebration of investas 60th anniversary luxembourg 27 january 2020 introduction the outlook for euro area economic activity and inflation at present warrants the highly accommodative monetary policy implemented by the ecb through our package of policy measures nonetheless the governing council remains attentive to the potential side effects of those measures monitoring and analysing those side effects is part and parcel of the governing council s ongoing monetary policy assessment and our recently announced strategy review indeed the prolonged period of substantial accommodation and the unconventional nature of our measures call for vigilance on the efficacy of the policy measures and might affect the strategic calibration and the appropriateness of the monetary policy stance this vigilance is particularly warranted in the light of some signs that monetary policy is encouraging increased risk taking and contributing to elevated asset price inflation and income inequality to my mind this raises two concerns for the long run efficacy of our measures which i wish to discuss today the first is the contribution of stretched asset prices to vulnerabilities in the financial system which may in turn trigger future crises the second is the part they may play in creating a disparity between public perceptions of inflation and official measures that disparity can undermine public support for our unconventional measures and eventually erode trust in the ecb risk taking and asset prices there is substantial evidence that monetary accommodation incentivises financial firms to increase risk taking behaviour with looser policy banks lend more to riskier firms a tendency that is even more pronounced among banks with a high share of retail deposits in periods of negative rates lower interest rates also lead to higher leverage for investment banks greater risk taking extends beyond the traditional banking system when non bank financial institutions for example pension funds and insurance companies target a certain nominal rate of return an environment of lower overall returns means they have to search for yield in other words acquire riskier assets to maintain nominal returns we are already seeing some signs of increased risk taking by non banks such as pension and mutual funds this increased risk taking channel is in part an intended aim of monetary policy greater lending by financial institutions supports consumption and investment generating activity and inflationary pressures within the economy the question is whether the increased risk taking is excessive or not at the moment banking supervision is committed to de risking of the banking system after the global financial crisis and these unusual times call for heightened vigilance regarding the financial stability consequences of our monetary policy actions we have recently seen a marked increase in certain asset prices which in some cases are at historically very elevated levels for example us equities are trading at unprecedented price to earnings ratios residential real estate prices in the euro area are also at historical highs relative to rents notably in large cities residential property prices in the seven largest german cities have doubled since 2010 compared with a nationwide change of around 60 in september 2019 the european systemic risk board issued warnings to five countries including luxembourg that medium term vulnerabilities had been identified in residential real estate markets it also issued stronger recommendations for remedial action to a further six countries to an extent those elevated asset prices are a function of the long running downward trend in interest rates experienced by advanced economies over the past three decades that trend can be explained by a range of potential factors including an ageing population income distribution rising saving in emerging markets and a general rise in risk aversion but concerns remain that the increase in asset and housing prices is excessive and results from the exceptionally long period of extremely accommodative monetary policy as several economists have noted monetary policy is a key determinant of the financial system s ability to create money in their view money creation credit creation and asset price determination are tightly interdependent elevated asset prices relative to fundamentals increase the risk of a future correction in housing or equity markets such a correction would affect banks directly by reducing the value of collateral backing loans and indirectly by affecting confidence leading to weaker overall economic activity there is therefore no clean separation between the pursuit of monetary stability and that of financial stability in the medium term the limits of macroprudential policy the risks to asset prices from loose monetary policy have brought macroprudential policies into sharper focus these policies are exercised at the national level by the relevant competent authority where central banks are supposed to play a leading role the idea here is that macroprudential policies can offset the build up of risk leading to an overall optimal policy mix certainly macroprudential policies can be effective in restraining increases in residential property prices but they are no panacea lending by foreign based banks dilutes the effectiveness of capital based measures moreover our current tools are bank based and therefore exercise little control over the growing role of the non bank financial sector in lending to households for example in the netherlands around a third of mortgage lending to households is now provided by pension funds insurers and mortgage funds given these factors it is worth considering whether the current suite of macroprudential tools remains appropriate capital measures while effective at increasing bank resilience are much less successful at leaning against excessive housing price inflation in part due to the factors i just mentioned loan to value ltv and loan to income lti constraints may be more effective since they act directly on borrowers and are more difficult to circumvent indeed these measures have proven effective in reducing housing price inflation ltv limits increase the resilience of the household sector reducing the risk of households finding themselves with negative equity if housing prices fall lti limits reduce the likelihood that some households will be forced to reduce non housing expenditure if interest rates increase this in turn helps mitigate the potential contagion from falling house prices to a more general economic downturn yet ltv and lti limits are themselves not without difficulties the sharp increases in house prices and rents witnessed in recent years have made it expensive to obtain housing insufficient housebuilding owing to capacity constraints in the construction sector and regulatory restrictions has exacerbated the shortage of housing and the burden is felt most acutely by the poorest in society who spend a larger share of their income on housing costs than richer households while ltv and lti limits are relatively effective in slowing housing booms they work by crowding out marginal borrowers who are precisely those most affected by the housing shortage ltv limits crowd out those without a large enough deposit usually young and or poor households while lti limits exclude low income households this distributional impact of ltv and lti limits can render their use politically controversial and may lead to inaction bias limiting the effective use of policy measures to counter housing price inflation dealing with distributional issues lies beyond the remit of central banks and prudential authorities but we must remain mindful of such consequences arising from our actions furthermore there remains a need to clarify the range of available macroprudential tools and to calibrate the balance between rules and discretion greater clarity is required on governance arrangements both nationally and internationally as well as on the potential interaction with other policy areas these are areas i have discussed on previous occasions a role for monetary policy in supporting financial stability so there are good reasons to believe that macroprudential policy in the euro area is currently constrained in its effectiveness jeremy stein has argued that when macroprudential policy creates leakages to foreign banks or the shadow banking sector monetary policy should be used for financial stability purposes because it gets in all the cracks that would mean using monetary policy at the european level to mitigate the build up of risks in the financial sector using monetary policy for these purposes often termed leaning against the wind brings benefits in terms of reducing the likelihood and severity of financial crises but comes at the price of below target inflation during booms that is a trade off that needs to be balanced carefully taking into account the risks on both sides at the ecb such considerations are incorporated into our monetary policy strategy via our two pillar approach which explicitly includes a role for monetary developments in our policy assessment strong bank credit growth will be reflected in faster growing monetary aggregates which would warrant monetary policy tightening in response house prices and trust in monetary policy the risks arising from strong housing price inflation extend beyond financial stability at present owner occupied housing costs are not included in the harmonised index of consumer prices hicp that is used to formulate our inflation aim of below but close to 2 over the medium term there are a number of technical explanations for this exclusion but it is clear that households view the cost of housing as an important part of their lifetime expenditure rents represent around 6 5 of the basket used for measuring inflation for many rents alone or mortgage payments easily exceed a third of their take home pay so there may be a significant gap between what households perceive to be the increase in their cost of living and what is measured by the hicp research shows that perceptions play an important role in determining economic behaviour incorporating owner occupied housing in the reference rate of inflation for monetary policy would provide a clearer signal for monetary policy to lean against housing price booms indeed the united states japan sweden and norway already integrate owner occupied housing into their reference inflation indices if it were to be included in the hicp it could raise measured inflation rates in the euro area by around 0 2 to 0 5 percentage points in some periods taking that into consideration core inflation would lift from its current 1 3 to its long run trend or even higher thereby having a bearing on the monetary policy stance the gap between perceptions and official measures of inflation can complicate the communication of policy decisions if households believe that inflation is rampant then they will see little justification for unconventional measures in particular negative interest rates trust in the ecb fell markedly following the onset of the crisis according to the eurobarometer poll net trust averaged around 25 percentage points in the years before the crisis but fell to a low of 23 in spring 2014 this fall was in line with that experienced by other eu institutions such as the commission and the parliament but while net trust in the ecb has recovered somewhat and now stands at 2 percentage points trust in those other institutions has recovered more rapidly whereas levels of net trust in the ecb and the commission were historically similar net trust in the commission now stands 10 percentage points higher even more noteworthy is the now quite marked divergence between support for the euro and trust in the ecb prior to the crisis net support for the euro and net trust in the ecb generally moved in line with one another with the currency enjoying a level of support around 20 percentage points higher support for the single currency weathered the crisis fairly well and now stands at its highest ever level but the gap between the two measures now stands at 60 percentage points and has persisted ever since the introduction of unconventional measures although other country specific factors might also have played a role this reduced trust can influence expectations and blunt the effectiveness of policy indeed the low for long policy seems to have had little impact on the aggregate saving rate although the increase in consumption since the beginning of 2019 has lagged behind real income growth the so called reversal rate may kick in at different points across sectors with households more sensitive to the imposition or even the fear of the imposition of negative rates and more likely than market participants to behave in a fashion that counteracts the intended aim of the policy the difference in savings cultures across european countries also plays a role a prolonged loss of trust in the ecb risks undermining the broad public support that is necessary for central bank independence this is of particular concern when the range of non conventional measures brings monetary policy closer to the realm of fiscal policy and the institutional effects of these policies are becoming more pronounced it is vital then that our policy assessment incorporates insights from behavioural economics and political economy rather than relying solely on linear models of the aggregate economy conclusion let me conclude asset prices are currently at very elevated levels in part this is a consequence of long running fundamental trends in interest rates yet there is substantial empirical evidence that monetary policy encourages risk taking in the financial system and the risks of an asset price correction are increasing dealing with such risks solely through macroprudential policy is challenging the effectiveness of macroprudential policies is curtailed by the presence of foreign banks and non bank financial firms lending to households moreover borrower based measures can exacerbate the impact on inequality arising from housing shortages and housing price appreciation in such a situation it is preferable for monetary policy to incorporate financial stability concerns into its policy deliberations this is something that has long been recognised in our two pillar strategy which we would be well advised to maintain if not enhance
stock indices around the world have fallen sharply prompting some to draw comparisons with the reaction to previous outbreaks where next for markets after coronavirus prompts sell off us markets opened in the red as worries over the virus gripped investors sell now ask questions later that appears to be the approach investors are taking as they assess the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak in china and beyond equity markets everywhere have sold off china and hong kong are currently closed for the lunar new year holiday but the nikkei in japan fell by 2 overnight and european stock indices have all fallen sharply all of the main european stock indices are now showing a loss for 2020 as a whole the ftse 100 is the worst affected of the main european indices because of the heavy weighting in it of resources stocks for the miners the likes of rio tinto bhp and anglo american have been hit hard because chinese demand is a significant driver of their earnings please use chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0 52 why oil traders are worried about china virus shares of the oil and gas companies have likewise fallen because concerns over chinese demand have sent brent crude back below 60 a barrel for the first time since 1 november last year on wall street where the s p 500 index on friday suffered its worst one day fall in three months the major indices opened lower having just suffered their worst week since august last year advertisement foreign exchange markets have also seen the concerns over coronavirus dramatically played out the australian dollar and the new zealand dollar have fallen sharply reflecting the dependence of australia and new zealand on the chinese economy as did the canadian dollar currencies to have benefited include the swiss franc and the japanese yen which are traditionally reached for at times of crisis as well as the us dollar in other asset classes there has been buying of traditional safe haven assets most notably us treasury bonds and gold so how bad can it get and where do markets go from here one of the big debating points in markets currently is the extent to which there are parallels with the sars outbreak of 2003 centred on china and hong kong in which 8 000 people were infected and around 700 died on that occasion on an annualised basis chinese gdp fell from 12 during the first three months of 2003 to about 3 5 during july august and september image shares in miners such as rio tinto have been hit hard that would suggest that china s economy which grew at just 6 1 in 2019 its weakest annual growth in 29 years could be in for a severe hit particularly since the coronavirus has struck at a time when millions of people are travelling around the country for new year celebrations that case is supported by the fact that china s economy is more dependent on the services sector consumer spending and activities like travel and tourism than it was 17 years ago moreover china s transport infrastructure has improved immeasurably in that period particularly high speed rail travel chinese people have greater access to travel both inside and outside china than ever before yet there is also a case for saying things may not be as severe gareth leather asia economist at consultancy capital economics argues that while in 2003 the authorities in china were initially slow to respond they have been more open about the spread of the coronavirus and proactive in trying to contain it as shown by the rapid lockdown of major cities where the virus has been identified he said the contrast with 2003 when china s authorities were heavily criticised for trying to conceal the spread of sars is marked ning zhang an economist at investment bank ubs in hong kong agreed china has learnt lessons from sars the government is now working much more proactively and transparently to contain the wuhan pneumonia than sars and china s public health system is now more experienced than before as well given the limited information the mortality rate of wuhan pneumonia seems notably lower than sars the other reason to be slightly wary of drawing too many comparisons with 2003 when it comes to trying to predict where markets go next is that circumstances in the global economy and in markets were very different 17 years ago in early 2003 the markets were only slowly recovering from the bursting of the dot com bubble leading stock indices like the s p 500 and the ftse 100 had just fallen for three consecutive years something that was unprecedented for the footsie and which in the case of the s p had not been seen since the early 1940s in 2020 the s p 500 has suffered only two down years in the last 10 and the footsie just four while both indices entered 2020 as did others either at or close to their all time high major economies like the us and the uk have enjoyed a decade of unbroken economic growth many professional investors are accordingly haunted by the notion that such economies are closer to the next recession than the last one and that equity markets in particular are due a tumble so many have been happy to take profits and sell without thinking too hard about it another big difference between now and early 2003 is that then the world was gripped by the build up to the iraq war image some have drawn parallels with the sars outbreak in 2003 sars was merely one of a number of factors on the minds of investors it may also be the case that with chinese and hong kong markets closed there is no one geography capable of taking a lead and staging a rally on which other markets may build the loss of investors from much of the far east also deprives the markets of liquidity it may be that the magnitude of some of the recent falls merely reflect mark downs in prices rather than actual selling and at some point there will be a time to buy when will that be mixo das head of asia equity strategy and quantitative strategy at investment bank jp morgan in hong kong told clients past experience of market performance around such events suggests that markets tend to bottom with the peak in new cases and news flow given considerations it is likely that we have not seen that yet accordingly anyone trying to call a bottom to the recent sell offs now may be taking a risk many investors will feel it is too early in the jargon to adopt a risk on stance not until the extent to which the coronavirus has spread can be properly established
the sense of serious concern about the economic effects of the wuhan virus evident on wall street friday has turned into something approaching panic in asia this morning china has taken the unprecedented step of extending the chinese new year holiday until february 2nd as it ramps up efforts to control the spread of the virus although confirmed cases have popped up all over the globe the vast majority still remain confined to the chinese mainland price action across asia thus far today has had a look of panic about it s p 500 futures down 1 0 the nikkei 225 down 1 80 gold up 8 0 dollars and wti futures have also fallen after being crushed on friday meanwhile the usd cnh has risen 250 points to 6 9500 and china proxy the australian dollar has eased 20 points to 0 6810 it is very important to note though that japan is the only major asian market open today mainland china hong kong singapore south korea and australia are all closed for various holidays liquidity is therefore much reduced and at a premium across all asset classes thus any moves especially on monday morning can be exaggerated bitter experience has taught me that strong directional moves in the early hours on monday are often the wrong ones on the day the wuhan virus will off course hang like a shadow over financial markets this week with asset markets pumped up on hopes of a global post trade deal recovery and cheap central bank money an unexpected growth shock leaves them particularly vulnerable to a potentially strong downward correction the world s central banks having slashed rates to the bone in 2019 have a severe ammunition shortage on the monetary policy front to offset a growth shock fortunately for the world two central banks that do are the two most important the us federal reserve and china s pboc wuhan virus aside the week will not be without drama in other corners of the financial markets the federal reserve has its first fomc decision of the year on wednesday evening and the bank of england announces its latest rate decision ahead on thursday we expect the fomc to hold unchanged with us data and us company earnings all tracking in the fed s goldilocks zone a response to the wuhan virus if required will be a story for later meetings the bank of england was probably poised to ease this week but recent uk data has been unexpectedly strong the odds for a 25 basis point cut are probably now only 50 50 at best as the uk formally exits europe this week trade continues to be a concern that hasn t died it just took a vacation europe s proposed digital taxes and carbon taxes have put it on a collision course with president trump s america first white house threats have emanated from washington dc of reprisals along with veiled warnings to britain if huawei is allowed even a nibble of the uk s proposed 5g networks readers may recall that after president trump had finished with china the tariff guns would swivel towards europe which also enjoys a massive surplus with the us in a us election year none of this is likely to subside with america s negotiating approach very much shoot first and not bother asking questions later us earnings reach their peak this week with big tech reporting amongst others we expect earnings to remain strong although fears of a wuhan virus induced global slowdown will probably drown out the celebrations equities the nikkei 225 being the only major index open in asia today has borne the brunt of the wuhan virus rush to safety falling 1 80 this morning china stock futures traded on the sgx are also lower by 5 0 without the underlying indices open though the extremity of the move is driven by a lack of liquidity and panic the extension of the chinese new year holiday in china by the government until february 2nd will add to concerns about just how serious the government is taking the wuhan virus with 40 million people in lock down and the unprecedented extension to the holiday equity markets in europe and the united states are likely to continue lower following the sell off on wall street on friday major indices there falling nearly one per cent and s p mini futures lower by the same this morning in electronic trading it is said that when america sneezes the rest of the world catches a cold the ascendance of china in the world s economy means that now if either the us or china sneeze the rest of the world may well catch a cold that worry will likely drown out any other data points this week currencies unsurprisingly the usual suspects are the centre of attention in a holiday thinned asia this morning the off shore yuan has been clubbed on the head with usd cnh rising 0 50 to 6 9620 the haven japanese yen has strengthened against the us dollar usd jpy falling 0 30 to 108 95 china proxies the australian and new zealand dollars have also suffered aud usd falling o 25 to 0 6890 and nzd usd falling 0 40 to 0 6575 usd cnh aside forex moves have been reasonably orderly this morning despite the much reduced liquidity due to pan apac holidays we would expect asian regional currencies to also come under pressure today as china growth worries spread fortunately those same markets have seen a strong appreciation of their currencies over the past two months a one or two day sell off will not be too much of a concern to the region s central banks heading into europe this afternoon we would expect the us dollar and haven currencies to continue to out perform oil both brent crude and wti have gapped lower by over 2 0 this morning in asia continuing friday s strong sell off with ample supply around the world oil is more vulnerable than most markets to a shock economic growth slow down brent crude fell by 2 0 on friday to 60 50 a barrel and has opened below the key 60 00 a barrel level at 59 20 this morning wti also fell by 2 0 on friday to 54 50 a barrel and gapped lower to 53 00 a barrel this morning brent crude s crash through 60 00 gives opec a headache as the pricing benchmark internationally for crude the only mitigating factor for the falls this morning is that almost all of asia is on holiday and liquidity is exceedingly thin that does leave room for bargain hunters and profit takers to emerge in europe to steady prices that though is a big if and the concerns about the wuhan virus likely mean that any rallies will be met by a wall of sellers oil is unlikely to find many friends until signs of concrete progress have been made on the control of the spread of the coronavirus gold gold rallied on friday as haven assets saw heavy demand in new york rallying 0 55 to 1571 50 an ounce the escalation of growth fears from the wuhan virus saw gold gap higher this morning on thin liquidity jumping 0 60 to 1584 25 an ounce gold s rally has undeniably been driven by classical safe haven flows the technical picture though shows that gold has tested 1550 00 an ounce every day over the last seven trading days and held solidly the 1550 00 region has therefore become the critical daily pivot region for gold and its technical picture is constructive if that holds the continuation of the gold rally will rely on developments for good or for ill of the wuhan virus situation from a resistance point of view the next level to watch is 1600 00 an ounce followed by the january 8th highs at 1611 50 an ounce

25 years ago us emergency loan to mexico in peso crisis on january 31 1995 us president bill clinton invoked executive power to extend a 50 billion loan to mexico amid the ongoing peso crisis the bailout was motivated by the need to appease wall street investors and avert total international financial collapse it was also an effort to deter a potential surge in immigration due to increased austerity measures and the instability of the mexican economy the 50 billion rescue package cobbled together by clinton required administration by the international monetary fund imf with support from the g7 countries and the bank for international settlements imf managing director michael camdessus described the events as the first major crisis of our new world of globalized finance and indicated that there were at least ten further countries which could potentially be thrown into similar emergencies throughout the rest of 1995 the bailout was proposed with the understanding that failure to assist would trigger a chain reaction panic in world markets federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan noted that the prospect of a mexican default on bond payments had begun to affect financial markets in other developing countries those not even remotely related to mexico for example in asia and in central europe as well as in a few industrial countries the new york times reported that clinton administration officials were privately concerned about the spread of anti government uprisings if the bailout failed demonstrations erupted in mexico city against the handing over of the nationalized oil company pemex and other state assets to us control mexican president ernesto zedillo ponce de leon ordered thousands of troops into chiapas mexico s poorest state to crush a 13 month old rebellion and arrest its leaders aimed at reassuring wall street and intimidating mexican workers the bailout drew significant right wing criticisms along nationalist lines from both democrats and republicans including democratic minority whip david bonior among others former republican presidential hopeful patrick buchanan called the bailout a daylight robbery of the nation s wealth the american taxpayers will never see again the crisis was triggered by washington s pursuit of its own interests driving up bank rates despite the destabilizing impact in mexico since 1982 successive mexican governments pursued policies dictated by the imf to create an export economy selling state enterprises and reducing social spending and living standards to meet debt payments to western banks that process culminated in nafta with the us and canada in which remaining barriers on imports and investment were toppled 50 years ago us president nixon demands austerity budget on february 2 1970 us president richard nixon submitted his proposal to congress for the 1971 fiscal year the 200 8 billion sum while technically an increase from the previous year was an effective spending cut after accounting for inflation it was the first full year budget nixon would propose to congress and was the first republican budget since the dwight d eisenhower administration 1953 1961 nixon claimed that the cuts in spending were intended to stem the effects of inflation in his message to congress he wrote this anti inflationary budget begins the necessary process of re ordering our national priorities for the first time in two full decades the federal government will spend more on human resource programs than on national defense the proposed military spending 71 8 billion was in fact the beginning of a decline in the defense budget withdrawals of us troops from vietnam had already begun and would continue over the next several years as part of nixon s strategy to gradually reduce the presence of us troops in the war nasa was also hit with cuts of 500 million causing the postponement of some space missions and the shutdown of research facilities other federally funded scientific research also took a 3 percent cut factoring in inflation a particular target for cuts was education one week before nixon proposed his budget to congress he signed his first veto killing legislation that would have provided 19 7 billion to education with some money in the bill also going to healthcare and welfare programs in an unusually arrogant move nixon televised the signing of the veto to a national audience during the broadcast he also attempted to blame inflation saying this action is in the vital interests of the american people in stopping the rise in the costs of living no new funds for education were provided for in nixon s budget and in his statement to congress he suggested that he would search for more areas to cut school spending the new budget did propose some increases in funding there was a meager increase in welfare programs such as food stamps and some health services however the increase was mainly to keep funding rates the same when accounting for inflation along with one new family assistance program most new funding went to infrastructure with about 4 billion allocated to the construction and repair of highways and another 4 billion provided for the creation of a national clean water program also receiving an increase in funding was law enforcement with an additional 1 3 billion 600 million more than the increase in the 1970 fiscal year budget nixon claimed that the increase was to crack down on organized crime in reality the funds would be used in police operations against the poorest working class areas 75 years ago american prisoners of war freed in the philippines on january 30 1945 almost 500 american prisoners of war were freed from a japanese camp near cabanatuan city in the philippines after a daring raid conducted by us army scouts rangers and local guerilla units the prisoners and those who had liberated them beat a hasty retreat behind american lines those who were freed included 464 american soldiers 22 british troops 3 dutch soldiers and 33 civilians the rescue of the prisoners was a daring operation planned after japanese forces began mass executions of prisoners of war at other camps in the philippines in the aftermath of the us invasion the raid was preceded by reconnaissance operations behind enemy lines led by filipino guerilla fighters in the early evening of january 30 a party of local fighters along with us army rangers and scouts surrounded the camp before launching a surprise attack that overwhelmed japanese guards the speed of the assault meant that only one japanese soldier was able to fire mortar rounds before being overwhelmed the operation took place amid rapid gains in the campaign of american imperialism to regain the philippines its former colonial possession and to establish primacy over japan throughout the asia pacific region us prisoners had been at the detention center since early 1942 when an initial american counterattack on japanese positions in the philippines had been roundly defeated a force of some 72 000 us and allied filipino military personnel had been forced to surrender after launching a bungled offensive characterized by insufficient supplies and munitions poor planning and widespread disease and illness among the ranks the prisoners were marched to camp o donnell a former us military installation on the island of luzon some 52 000 survived the journey comprised of around 9 000 american troops and more than 40 000 filipino fighters as many as 20 000 died on the 60 mile trek many from disease when camp o donnell was later closed the internment center near cabanatuan city became the largest site of allied prisoners in the country holding over 10 000 at its height able bodied prisoners were transported throughout japanese controlled asia to perform forced labor those who were unable to travel were held in the rudimentary camp in conditions that us authorities denounced as a violation of their rights the us launched an invasion of the philippines in october 1944 the following month it dispatched a naval armada to the archipelago which engaged with its japanese adversary in the largest sea borne battles of world war ii amid a crisis of the fascist regimes internationally and widespread local hostility to the japanese occupation the us troops made rapid advances 100 years ago british arrest irish nationalist leaders in dublin on january 31 1920 units of the british army and the royal irish constabulary ric arrested seven recently elected members of the dublin city council all supporters of the irish nationalist movement sinn fein which advocated the independence of ireland from the united kingdom on the previous day irish nationalist flags had been flown from the city council building the british arrested another 18 sinn fein leaders throughout ireland the nationalist irish republican army had been fighting an insurgent war against the british since 1919 known as the irish war of independence this included attacks on outposts of the ric primarily in the provinces the war of independence was also marked by strikes against key british controlled infrastructure such as the railways the response of the british was to form a special terrorist unit of the ric comprised primarily of unemployed soldiers recruited from england and scotland activated in january 1920 the units came to be known as the black and tans from the color of their uniforms the black and tans conducted reprisals for ira attacks with the tacit approval of british authorities these included the burning of houses farms and businesses of suspected nationalist sympathizers as well as rape and extrajudicial killings the black and tans killed hundreds and became notorious for acts of willful barbarism such as burning down the cottages of small farmers sometimes with the residents inside and the destruction of factories which put thousands out of work the ferocious repression only produced a deep and abiding hatred of british imperialism in the irish population commemorated by the famous song come out ye black and tans
diversity is the key to success for every investor says greg forst director of marketing at factom protocol the importance of diverse investing is literally proverbial how old were you when you first heard don t put all your eggs in one basket correct diversification is relatively simple when it s a question of eggs and baskets but in the global financial world diversification is exponentially more complex what types of currencies bonds stocks commodities and other instruments should a savvy investor hold in a time of political economic and environmental uncertainty and how can a single investor or entity hold an appropriately diverse portfolio without vanishing under a sea of paperwork or disappearing beneath a pile of tax documents creating a personal hedge has long been the domain of the well connected few it s now an option for anyone a european investor seeking to invest in american dollars or the british pound might find that portfolio diversity enacts a high price in time and effort holding and trading involves connecting with another party or with an exchange smaller trades may incur overlarge commission fees that make the investment a losing proposition etc the net result larger traders can operate at scale while smaller traders look on in envy and frustration the internet has made the world smaller and the value of diversified investments more immediately apparent now it has also made diversification simple in cryptocurrency there has been a rush to create stablecoins that reflect the moment by moment values of traditional assets without themselves being those assets the most famous stablecoin is facebook s libra which has been under the spotlight since it was first announced in june 2019 other major stablecoins that have established footholds in the market include dai dai tether usdt and paxos pax however the concept of a proof of work mined stablecoin network represents a true paradigm shift for the stablecoin space one such program is pegnet a decentralized non custodial and fully auditable network of tokens tied to different markets which lets investors hold tokens pegged to 32 different assets disclaimer factom protocol launched pegnet a suite of traditional pegged currency stablecoins are available such as the u s dollar the euro the swiss franc the japanese yen the indian rupee the singapore dollar the philippine peso and the brazilian real additionally the flexibility of the peg model means that any number of commodities or financial instruments can be replicated currently commodities such as gold and silver are also pegged to their real world price over a dozen cryptocurrencies including bitcoin ethereum cardano and dash have established pegs more could be added if there was sufficient demand if all pegged currencies cryptocurrencies instruments and commodities run on a single distributed ledger network many of the frustrations attendant in the traditional financial world vanish for example an investor s holdings are held in a single wallet so there is no need for a diversified investor to manage multiple brokerage accounts traders may look to leave a blockchain s ecosystem some chains may stand alone while others interact with larger and exceedingly liquid chains like ethereum holding investments is one thing acquiring or exchanging them is often another one major benefit of the stablecoin model is that transaction costs are so low as to be negligible each transaction no matter how large or small it may be costs roughly a tenth of a cent which means that microtransactions and frequent trading are real possibilities the middlemen and fees that blight so much of traditional finance are put to an end wise diversification of assets remains a challenge traders must analyze data consider prospects and probabilities and understand phenomenally complicated aspects of international economics these difficulties remain but networks such as pegnet are lowering the barriers of access high fees multiple brokerage accounts and lack of access to specific investment instruments are a thing of the past the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc
published monday 27 january 2020 print disqus hedonic fantasies meaningless averages desperate ideas inflation may not be the most important statistic philadelphia dallas and new york the human brain excels at taking shortcuts processing all the information our senses collect takes a lot of energy so repetitive data gets lower priority things we see often fade into the background so we can notice new stuff this is where we get phenomena like nose blindness we stop perceiving familiar smells like our pets perfume cigarettes and even our own body odors but others do smell them which can get awkward i think something like that may explain why the federal reserve doesn t see the inflation others notice their data says inflation isn t a problem so they ignore indications otherwise we see this in their policy decisions and it s not just the fed other central banks wall street analysts economists and politicians have the same affliction the kindest thing we could do is tell these people about their ahem unattractive condition they might not react well but at least we will have tried so that is what i will do today i ll show how the fed s lack of concern notwithstanding inflation is a serious problem for many americans in addition to federal reserve officials most economists look at yet another set of inflation data and argue that inflation is too low from their perspective they are right but that doesn t mean that you and i aren t experiencing inflation in what we buy furthermore the way we measure inflation has been changed many times over the years it may be time to do yet another adjustment to our inflation measures to better reflect the economic reality of the average american hedonic fantasies today i m talking about price inflation i e changing prices of the goods and services we all must buy price is as we learned in econ 101 the intersection of supply and demand prices change when one of both those curves move which they do for many reasons monetary policy is a big one but not the only one consumers and producers both have many constraints such as wages and wage growth disposable income on the one hand and cost of goods and actual demand for their products on the other hand somewhere in the middle they find balance and that is where prices settle that s the economic theory in practice it is a lot messier since we have such a dazzling array of goods services people and places not every market is equally efficient therein lies the problem how to distill this complexity into one meaningful number wonks tell us with all sincerity things like the us cost of living rose 2 1 last year really to an actual numerical decimal place on something as vague and as complex as inflation now to give them credit they are looking at the total national inflation rate and it is extraordinarily complex they do the best they can but the inflation you and i experience they don t know that they can t know it at least not with any precision because the cost of living is so individualized everyone spends their money differently and the things they spend it on vary in price for many reasons that doesn t stop the wonks from trying of course and it s not entirely their fault they work for policymakers who demand information whether it s accurate information is less important than simply having something on which to hang their hats one of the most important economists of the last century was kenneth arrow during world war ii he was tasked with predicting the weather on d day when the allies would attempt a beach landing in france the weather would be critical arrow told his commanding general there was an extraordinary amount of uncertainty for his prediction the general answered we know that but we need a number to work with and you have to give us the number talk about a no pressure environment government statisticians while maybe not feeling the same pressure are also responsible for millions of lives since so much personal income is tied to that inflation number note also policymakers have preferences on what the number should be many government programs have inflation adjustments higher inflation forces politicians to make tough decisions about taxes spending and borrowing these same politicians hire and pay the people who compile the inflation numbers that s what we would call in the investment world a disclosable conflict of interest having said all that i believe the analysts try to be fair and scientific they have to work within boundaries that don t always make sense so we get crazy things like hedonic adjustment that s where they modify the price change because the product you buy today is of higher quality than the one they measured in the past this is most evident in technology the kind of computer i used back in the 1980s cost about 4 000 the one i have now on which i do similar work writing was about 1 600 so my computer costs dropped 40 but no today s computer isn t remotely comparable to my first one it is easily a thousand times more powerful so the price for that much computing power has dropped much more than 60 it s probably 99 9 louis gave surfaced another example according to consumer price index data a television set that cost 1 000 in 1996 is now 22 you can t buy any such product today but the fact you can spend the same amount of money and get a better tv depresses the inflation rate source gavekal they do the same thing for cars as peter boockvar noted earlier this month last week edmonds com said the average price of a new vehicle sold in 2019 was 37 183 a new record high and up 30 from where it was 10 years ago within today s cpi the price of a new car reflected a 2 increase in total since 2009 this is magically done via hedonic adjustments which discount the value of new add ons with each subsequent iteration of cars unfortunately the actual buyer of a car has to pay what the price is and that is why delinquency rates are rising according to the ny fed loans 90 days late totaled 4 7 in q3 the highest since 2011 and the average length of a loan is at a record high experian said in november that 7 year auto loans amount to 31 5 of new vehicle sales vs 10 in 2010 the average price of a car is about 60 of median income in the us and incentives in december were a record amount of 4 600 per vehicle on average according to jd power the fed relies on hedonically adjusted data points and not the price that people are actually paying out of pocket exactly hedonically adjusted prices exist only in theory they don t reflect what people actually have a choice of spending health insurance is another good example cpi says it rose 20 4 in 2019 that s a national average that could be much more depending on your age and location but worse is the policy you can buy now identical to the one available a year ago certainly not it could have a higher deductible narrower network smaller drug formulary and a wide variety of internal differences in coverage for various conditions which you will never know unless you seek treatment the real price change is impossible to know that 20 4 is a national average of local guesswork bearing no connection to anyone s reality it gets even more complicated i quoted cpi above the federal reserve actually prefers something called pce personal consumption expenditures the two indexes have different estimates of the appropriate basket the cpi is based on a survey of what households are buying the pce is based on surveys of what businesses are selling social security uses the cpi for adjustments the fed uses pce when targeting inflation pce is generally lower as we can see from the chart below source advisor perspectives meaningless averages i mention cars and health insurance because they are two of the larger budget items for most households and both are broader in reality the car takes you nowhere unless you also buy fuel insurance and maintenance health insurance helps only after you pay your deductible and co pays which can be substantial but housing is the biggest single living cost for most people here again the individual variation is so huge as to render national averages meaningless even if they were accurate and they re not for instance if you bought your home years ago with a fixed rate mortgage your personal housing inflation rate has been zero your monthly payment is the same as it was then if you have a variable rate mortgage you might even be paying less for the same house depending on when you bought it because your rate dropped but housing costs aren t just mortgage payments because a house can be more than housing if you re lucky it is also an investment that will give you a profit someday meanwhile you get to use it as your home and avoid paying rent cpi recognizes this its housing component is a combination of average rental rates and something called owner s equivalent rent oer that s the amount you would expect someone else to pay if you rented your home to them you are in effect paying it to yourself according to the december 2019 cpi report rent of primary residence rose 3 7 last year and owner s equivalent rent rose 3 3 those two combined are about 33 of cpi do they reflect reality in any significant way maybe it depends on the kind of housing you need and where you need it according to apartment list the national average increase in apartment rent was 1 4 last year but it was considerably more in some places mesa arizona phoenix area tops their ranking at 5 1 source apartment list those are apartments house rental rates are something else completely as are home and condominium purchase prices as noted above your home s resale price has no impact on inflation unless you actually sell it and even then it doesn t show up in the inflation measure but home values can give us a rough approximation corelogic data shows something interesting source corelogic price changes in the last year were highest at the low priced end up 5 6 compared to 3 4 in the highest tier but according to bls national average owner s equivalent rent for homes of all prices rose only 3 3 so that doesn t fit and again the national variation is dramatic corelogic s home price index rose 10 2 in idaho and actually fell slightly in connecticut now you might say the difference between 3 3 and 5 6 isn t so dramatic remember we are talking about a full third of the budget for most families so if cpi has been understating housing costs by as much as it hedonically understates vehicle prices it s enough to make a difference a dramatic difference if compounded over time and especially if you are on social security or other inflation adjusted income desperate ideas the agencies don t simply adjust their inflation measures on a whim they have reasons most of which make sense but they add up to a number that doesn t reflect actual experience this causes policy errors and greater problems we have other non government inflation figures one is the venerable shadowstats which adjusts the published cpi numbers using the methodologies the government itself used in 1990 that adjustment has its own limitations but might be closer to the reality you experience source shadowstats recently the cpi under the old methodology has been running about four percentage points annually above the official numbers another alternative measure is the chapwood index twice a year chapwood checks the price for 500 common consumer items see list in the 50 largest cities as of mid 2019 the five year average annual cost of living change in those cities ranged from 6 6 to 13 1 in oakland ca if you re wondering that s more dramatic and possibly overstated even if you chop chapwood s numbers in half and remember they measure retail prices if you measured wholesale items that businesses purchase you might even see deflation now the people who sit on the federal open market committee aren t foolish they are aware of data limitations so why do they persist in thinking inflation is under control or shudder look for ways to generate more of it to answer i ll summarize a very complex argument among economists forgive me if i oversimplify it essentially if you used shadowstats or any other statistic showing higher inflation you have to assert that gdp has been shrinking for 30 years that is clearly not the case the us economy has grown albeit slower in the last 10 years but we are certainly not in a constant negative 2 per year recession looking at actual nominal gdp yet another imprecise measure we are clearly growing again this can be very misleading to any individual your personal gdp may be either growing or shrinking a lot depends on how your business is doing if you are a business owner your salary or wages etc national gdp is the theoretical and let me emphasize the word theoretical total production of 330 million people source fred so when economists say inflation measures are too high they are making a macroeconomic argument from top down data others who argue inflation is significantly understated rely on bottoms up data both sides are arguing a particular point of view using data to buttress their viewpoint a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest i understand both arguments and they both make extraordinarily valid points but for those of us living in the real world are hard to swallow nominal average weekly earnings for all employees rose 28 in the last 10 years if we can believe that data the average worker has roughly kept up with average inflation if average inflation accurately reflects the cost of living for many people it clearly hasn t so the average worker has probably fallen behind how much it depends on what you buy seriously source gavekal we started out talking about nose blindness most people don t keep careful track of their spending and income they don t know their wages rose x and spending rose y in the last decade they just know making ends meet is tough and getting tougher so if both the public and the fed are nose blind to inflation where does it take us nowhere good but we re going there fast inflation may not be the most important statistic i believe the pressure on the average american can t be expressed in wages or inflation for most people disposable income is where they live and breathe fixed costs whatever yours are eat into disposable income that s what we feel the yellow vest protests in france arose from a rather small increase in the subsidized diesel fuel price similar fuel price protests recently swept iran chile has had major riots in protest over public transportation costs rising a few pennies similar situations have occurred elsewhere relatively small price increases for an item or two can be the straw that breaks the camel s back when disposable income is so tight that even a few pennies mean the difference between food for your children or not anger can explode into riots the actual prices at stake may not be significant except they act as the straw i have serious concerns about how we measure gdp we double count some items not the least of which is government expenditures making the economy seem bigger than it actually is what we call inflation is an imprecise measure of an artificially created government statistic when we measure real gdp we are using that imprecise measure on yet another imprecise measure of artificial government statistics called nominal gdp the irony is that we think we can measure gdp or inflation out to two decimal points i have always contended anything to the right of the decimal point is simply economists trying to demonstrate they have a sense of humor like a weather forecast for d day we need a number but we should recognize the limitations furthermore remember that these measures are for 330 million people in an extraordinarily chaotic and complex society we count some items and ignore others or we apply adjustments which aren t real world as they say your mileage may vary this is yet another reason the fed shouldn t be allowed to control short term rates except in the most extreme circumstances and then only to provide liquidity the use of artificial measures to set the price of the most important commodity in the world the interest rate of the us dollar of necessity leads to imbalance and occasional crises a low interest rate environment misallocates capital into financial transactions which are not necessarily productive while it may make money for some people it doesn t add to the general well being and that is not going to change those of us responsible for allocation of capital for clients and ourselves have to recognize reality and invest accordingly all the while knowing that imbalances are increasing and we will eventually face a reckoning sigh philadelphia dallas and new york i find myself in philadelphia for a last minute but worthwhile trip i fly back friday evening to puerto rico i will now have to be in dallas in two weeks and shane wants to come with me and i still have to get to new york at some point and write my book and help plan a conference and

management believes that sales excluding foreign currency provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations management believes that organic net sales provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and divestitures management believes that free cash flow provides investors and stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing the company s ability to fund its activities and obligations the company provides free cash flow related metrics such as free cash flow as a percentage of net sales as long term management goals not an element of its annual financial guidance and as such does not provide a

certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the company s control any such reconciliation would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of

in 2020 protests that began in the arab world in 2010 continue lebanon the latest country rocked by unrest has seen its elite face the common accusations of corruption and economic mismanagement what is happening is a complete economic breakdown explains professor rania masri one option being considered amid unrest is shaking hands with the imf an international monetary fund programme is an option for lebanon one senior official was quoted as admitting depending on terms that should be bearable for the crisis hit country and not trigger social unrest the latter comment is a reminder of how the imf is perceived by some as contributing to arab unrest rather than alleviating it some analysts go so far as to suggest that the imf itself has implemented policies that directly provoked protests at its most basic level the imf is an international banking organization that lends developing countries money on the condition that such countries adopt policies that the imf feels stimulate economic growth and sustainability says journalist ty joplin consistently the imf has called on governments to eliminate bread subsidies in the name of austerity and tighter monetary policies many times this has led to protests which become violent and are crushed in the middle east imf and imf inspired policies resulted in nearly identical backlashes in truth there already is an alternative to the imf the arab monetary fund established in 1976 its members cover north africa the levant and the gulf and include states such as jordan sudan egypt and tunisia states that have enacted imf policies and witnessed unrest if a global organization is regarded by some as pushing economic measures that price out lower and middle class families and trap arab states in a cycle of conditional loans why has the middle east not responded with regional unity and an attempt to created united but independent fiscal policy in truth there already is an alternative to the imf the arab monetary fund established in 1976 its members cover north africa the levant and the gulf and include states such as jordan sudan egypt and tunisia states that have enacted imf policies and witnessed unrest what is the arab monetary fund the amf boasts 22 member states headquartered in abu dhabi it promotes itself as a regional body aimed at strengthening arab trade financial markets and economic robustness long term goals also include the creation of a unified arab currency while the imf focuses on internal socio economics the amf advises members with regards to policies related to the investment of the financial resources of member states in foreign markets all these aims are intended to promote regional unity and economic prosperity for all members in practice the amf appears to be a carbon copy of imf policies at a january 2020 meeting amf ministers discussed how aligning education and labour needs across the region will strengthen economic growth the uae model of economic diversification was praised as one to be replicated across the middle east these meetings represent a vital platform to showcase the uae model to the broader region boasted uae under secretary of the minister of finance younis haji al khoori furthermore the model contributes to building a sustainable knowledge economy for future generations in practice the amf appears to be a carbon copy of imf policies the amf and the arab spring the international monetary fund headquarters in washington d c afp file just as the imf provides conditional loans 2010 12 saw the amf respond to the arab spring in kind jordan received a 76 million usd loan months after protest began against royalist victories in parliamentary elections the loan was earmarked solely for key financial reforms and came atop 16 further amf loans to jordan totalling 350 million usd for domestic support and another 411 million usd for regional trade that same year ali abdullah saleh s yemen received a 200 million usd loan pledge by the amf for economic restructuring bringing the total amf loans to yemen up to 800 million usd only morocco in 2012 received an amf loan to specifically help with one of the central complaints behind protests rising food prices 127 million usd was issued by the amf which recognized the kingdom s urgent economic conditions including the increased value of imported agricultural products the credit line brought morocco s amf debt to 1 46 billion usd whenever the government raises taxes cuts back salaries reduces the public sector the answer that comes back from citizens is that the government is corrupt says tunis based political analyst youssef cherif it provides an obstacle to any reform copying imf lines on economic reform is not enough as protestors will highlight a central demand of the arab spring was not simply economic restructuring but an end to corruption austerity measures cannot be enacted without tackling what many arab citizens perceive to be the root of their financial crises which means cracking down on the elite whenever the government raises taxes cuts back salaries reduces the public sector the answer that comes back from citizens is that the government is corrupt says tunis based political analyst youssef cherif it provides an obstacle to any reform a 2019 amf report praises austerity as key to arab economic growth igher growth rates are recorded in some arab countries in 2018 thanks to the positive effects of the implementation of economic reform and to the adoption of more prudent fiscal policies the spread of multidimensional poverty in arab countries resulted from a of social services such as health education and housing like the imf the amf insists on tax hikes and the slashing of subsidies yet the same report admits the spread of poverty caused by the same imf recommendations enacted by arab regimes the elimination of subsidies and welfare benefits the spread of multidimensional poverty in arab countries resulted from a of social services such as health education and housing like the imf the amf insists on tax hikes and the slashing of subsidies such a replication of imf policies will only fuel the arab spring governments in the middle east and north africa have consistently cut subsidies for key goods like gas and bread despite the predictable backlash explains joplin each time it has happened the cost of living has gone up and discontent resurfaces the most dramatic example is the arab spring partially driven by the rise of bread prices and the general cost of living in addition to the parallel policies between the amf and imf there are other political factors that hinder regional independence from global western institutions the assistance of western forces in the 1991 gulf war did not come cheap and the amf found itself billed for kuwait s liberation to the tune of almost 100 billion usd although the 2003 invasion of iraq saw some arab states compensated for their assistance iraq s gdp fell by 28 iraq has been described by outside observers as a nation captured by debt such a loan cycle returns to the legacy of imf and amf policies the imf has said it is changing its policies to encourage more stability and peaceful economic transitions says joplin however if the recent instability in tunisia jordan and sudan are any indicator then it appears the imf s attempts at internal reform have already failed imf austerity measures should be a warning to the amf that the arab spring is far from over yet as of january 2020 the amf recommendations of tax hikes are not being reversed imf austerity measures should be a warning to the amf that the arab spring is far from over yet as of january 2020 the amf recommendations of tax hikes are not being reversed ironically tunisia the starting point of the arab spring claims the highest tax burden in the arab world at 20 of gdp yet 8 10 tunisians believe corruption remains in a country with public debt at over 70 of gdp taxes loans and economic reforms are clearly not working to stabilise the arab region how long can the amf remain an imf mouthpiece before their relevance is questioned by arab citizens the views expressed in this article do not necessarily reflect those of al bawaba news
state media desperate justification of luke malaba s destructive judgement spread the love chief justice luke malaba state media since 2008 zimbabwe has been enjoying a multi currency regime introduced to restore sanity to the economy after years of hyperinflation it seemed like the only solution the zimbabwe dollar had all but been rejected zimbabwe dollar notes released in the morning would be worthless by evening the multi currency regime brought with it certainty and the ability to plan into the future something which had become impossible in the zimbabwe dollar era this was a good aspect for both industry and consumers on the flip side though the united states dollar soon emerged as the currency of choice though under the multi currency regime all regional currencies were to be accepted as a means of payment the us dollar soon gained monopoly with currencies such as the south african rand and the botswana pula initially being sidelined and later on being totally rejected in favour of the us dollar thus the economy was dollarised there is no legislation which specifically introduced the us dollar as the sole currency for transacting in zimbabwe but the economy simply opted for the greenback the us dollar while bringing about stability also brought with it many challenges use of the multi currency regime meant the country could not make use of monetary instruments to influence economic activity as such the economy was being run using only the fiscal function the multi currency regime made locally produced products more expensive as compared to imported products and thus made local products more expensive this had a negative impact on the country s capacity to export and earn foreign currency the transitional stabilisation programme tsp introduced a raft of measures to restore macro economic stability and stimulate productivity in the economy the monetary sector and currency reforms implemented under tsp included the separation of fca accounts and rtgs accounts liberalisation of the exchange rate the establishment of an inter bank foreign currency market and conversion of local us dollar accounts into rtgs dollar accounts this process was gradual in order not to induce unnecessary shocks on the economy the entire process culminated in the reintroduction of the zimbabwe dollar zwl through si33 2019 which has since been applied and interpreted by the supreme court in its recent judgment there has been an outcry against the judgment with some stating that it will deter investors from coming to zimbabwe because it undermines property rights nothing can be further from the truth as the supreme court did nothing but to interpret and apply the position of the law since the promulgation of si 33 2019 in essence nothing has changed the supreme court judgment changes nothing but merely enforces the law in accordance with the intentions of the legislature bearing in mind at all times the mischief that the legislature intended to cure it must be remembered that the state consists of the three arms the executive legislature and judiciary the judiciary s role is not to create or strike down laws but merely to interpret them and apply them in promulgating si33 2019 the intention of the legislature was to strip the us dollar as a medium of exchange to preserve it as a reserve currency the supreme court had the occasion to interpret and apply the provisions of si 33 2019 and bring the intention of the legislature into practicality as stated above it is the duty of the courts to interpret statutes and in so doing the court uses where the language used in a statute is clear and unambiguous the words ought to be given the ordinary grammatical meaning per malaba cj the case for determination was whether the provisions of si 33 2019 applied to judgment debts obtained in united states dollars prior to the promulgation of the statutory instrument the court held that all debts accrued prior to the promulgation of si 33 2019 including judgment debts obtained in united sated dollars are now payable in zwl at the rate of 1 1 the court has not done anything save to interpret and apply the law as was promulgated by the legislature the outcry against the supreme court is thus misplaced there is nothing new that the supreme court judgment does it merely applies the position of the law after the promulgation of the statutory instrument it is important to put the statutory instrument and the subsequent court judgment into the context of tsp the intention of the blueprint was to bring monetary and fiscal reforms which will consolidate the economy and increase productivity the minister of finance from the onset indicated that the continued use of the us dollar was no longer sustainable there were no longer adequate us dollars circulating in the system to sustain meaningful economic activity and that is when the gap arose which led to the creation of the black market there being no adequate supply of the us dollar to finance the economy it meant that the currency that was being held in our bank accounts was now a mythical us dollar the actual united states dollar being absent from the system by the time the statutory instrument was passed no one actually had real us dollars in their account anyway the deed had already been done and it was imperative that the law recognises this and puts it into application this judgment should come as a relief to everyone if the court had held otherwise there would be pandemonium in the economy insurance companies would have to pay claims in us dollars simply because the premiums were paid in us dollars there would be a run in on banks as people demanded us dollars ordinary people who had borrowed would be required to pay back in us dollars yet the truth is no one has us dollars anymore this would cause unnecessary hardship on everyone the economy is de dollarising by the end of tsp market distortions resulting in price disparities depending on whether one is using united states dollar cash ecocash or transfer should be a thing of the past at that stage the economy will have successfully de dollarised share this post like this like loading
even as a bitter and partisan impeachment trial plays out in washington the signals emanating from the economy continue to be amazingly positive the unemployment rate is at record lows the stock market is near record highs corporate profits remain strong and growth at around 2 percent is the highest among advanced economies at some level this disconnect between economics and politics reflects the underlying strength of the u s economy the innovation the efficient use of labor and capital the quality of management that existed long before donald trump became president business and economic fundamentals don t change overnight but americans should understand that there will be a significant long term economic cost to our polarized politics and dysfunctional government which has now reached the point of near total breakdown of comity and cooperation between the parties between the houses of congress and among the various branches of government in the modern era there are few if any examples of a country with a healthy thriving economy and a broken political system what distinguishes a successful economy from a failing one what distinguishes denmark from italy and south korea from north is not how much capital it has or technology it produces but the quality of its institutions the laws rules norms and policies that create the framework in which any economy operates and there should be no doubt that as a result of broken politics the quality of the united states institutions is already on the decline we can see such deterioration in our inability to adapt to changing conditions the rise of china as an economic superpower the influx of economic and political refugees and the threat from global warming people will inevitably disagree about how to deal with these serious economic challenges but a country with a working political system would rather after a modest debate embrace the obvious compromises building on what works and fixing what doesn t in the united states by contrast our approach has been to deny the problem demonize those with whom we disagree and ostracize anyone who dares to compromise as a result we now have millions of blue collar workers who are idle or underemployed millions of immigrants without the skills we need who entered the country illegally but too few of the skilled immigrants that we do and an unending series of devastating floods wildfires droughts and other extreme weather events the cost in terms of lost output and economic damage runs to tens of billions of dollars every year we see our institutional decline in the persistence of a health care system that continues to cost twice as much as in other countries while delivering some of the worst health outcomes in the industrialized world the reasons are not seriously in dispute 1 too much care that is unnecessary and too little of the kind that keeps people healthy and 2 corporate profits and medical salaries that are higher than necessary to attract talent and incentivize investment and innovation for decades opposition from special interest groups prevented anything from being done when it finally was obamacare most of those same interests used everything within their power to make sure even this modest reform would not succeed economists anne case and angus deaton recently calculated the direct cost of all this overspending at about 1 trillion a year or 8 000 for every household in the country the indirect costs in terms of lost output due to preventable death and illness and lost sales on global markets because of excessive labor costs surely add hundreds of billions more we also see the effects of political dysfunction in the inability of congress to come anywhere near balancing the federal budget even when the economy is seemingly operating at capacity in reality our current economic boom is a keynesian mirage the only reason our economy is growing at all is that because of extravagant tax cuts and undisciplined spending the federal government last year spent 1 trillion more than it brought in in revenue even as the federal reserve injects an additional 60 billion a month into the financial system as the international monetary fund warned in its annual economic outlook last fall such a level of fiscal and monetary stimulus is not sustainable creating risks of inflation a spike in interest rates or a sharp decline in the value of the dollar any of which in turn could lead to a recession or financial crisis in the longer run this addiction to living beyond our means will also have the effect of making us ever more beholden to the foreign lenders and investors who make it possible it would be one thing if we were productively investing all this borrowed or freshly printed money rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure providing effective job training to displaced workers or improving educational outcomes of our children these are the kinds of high payoff public investments that a functioning political system would be making instead we are essentially throwing the money down the drain by using it to finance runaway defense spending and farm subsidies and extravagant tax cuts for businesses that have mostly been passed on to shareholders but perhaps the greatest threat to the u s economy is the deterioration in the rule of law that has become a hallmark of the trump presidency and now lies at the heart of the unfolding impeachment process global companies do not invest in countries with autocratic leaders who arbitrarily impose economic sanctions or punitive tariffs on longtime allies who fail to perform political favors or take a different approach to unrelated foreign policy issues and the experience of other countries tells us that households and businesses do not pay their full share of taxes where leaders boast about paying no taxes at all and do not adhere to immigration rules when leaders are seen to flagrantly violate them this is other countries right we know that competition does not thrive in countries where leaders threaten criminal prosecution of political opponents and fire diplomats and civil servants who expose their corruption nor do markets flourish in countries where tariff waivers are handed out to political allies government contracts are withheld from political critics government regulations are not enforced against campaign contributors and companies are subject to antitrust investigations for lobbying against government policies rule of law is eroded when judges who rule against the government are dismissed as political hacks when journalists who report the truth are deemed enemies of the people and any investigation of corruption is labeled a witch hunt it will be further undermined when a president who has done all of these things is acquitted and vindicated by a deeply partisan and feckless senate majority deterioration in the rule of law reckless fiscal policy and lack of public investment failure to fix a costly and underperforming health care system or address the challenges of globalization and climate change like the impeachment process now playing out at the capitol each is both a consequence of and contributor to our broken politics and like the impeachment process each will have negative long term impact on the quality of our institutions and the

by riverfront investment group q4 2019 taking away the worst case scenario discount equity markets hate uncertainty and will assign what we call a worst case scenario discount to stocks when an outcome is unclear as clarity increases the worst case scenario regarding an event or issue can be proven to be unlikely and thus the discount is unnecessary in our view over the fourth quarter global markets received some of the clarity they had been searching for in the forms of an election in the uk a phase 1 trade deal between the us and china and the conclusion of the impeachment hearings in the house while none of these events erased the uncertainty each made the worst case scenario hard brexit escalating trade war and senate ratification of impeachment far less likely as a result risk assets such as emerging market equities generally performed well while defensive assets like bonds posted lower returns 2019 market returns we remain constructive on stocks in 2020 lack of

on call the cavalry or policymakers have shown a willingness to act when faced with evidence of economic weakness the cavalry or policymakers have shown a willingness to act when faced with evidence of economic weakness election year incumbent presidents are generally expected to do all they can to boost the economy to help them get re elected however we believe that 2020 may be the year that rewards the nimble who are willing to rotate between sectors and asset classes this is because as uncertainty fades business and consumer confidence improves we believe this will ultimately lead to additional spending and investment while a strengthening economy is generally good for all equities we believe that the kinds of companies and asset classes that perform the best will be different than those that outperform when economic growth is less robust a few of the places where that leadership change could occur include the following international could perform well with brexit becoming more clear and european economies showing signs of bottoming we could see a global synchronized recovery similar to 2017 in our opinion with brexit becoming more clear and european economies showing signs of bottoming we could see a global synchronized recovery similar to 2017 in our opinion cyclicals and small mid cap smid could perform well questions on the economy should also lessen and could lead to increased business confidence and corporate spending in our view this is good for cyclicals and smids because they are more economically sensitive we also expect a strengthening global economy to lift interest rates helping financials questions on the economy should also lessen and could lead to increased business confidence and corporate spending in our view this is good for cyclicals and smids because they are more economically sensitive we also expect a strengthening global economy to lift interest rates helping financials fixed income low volatility could lag with uncertainty defensive asset classes have been afforded premium valuations as uncertainty fades we expect that premium to fade what about iran and impeachment in our view a tug of war is currently playing out in the market with regard to recent news events on one side of the rope are the worries namely impeachment and iran namely impeachment and iran on the other side of the rope are the opportunities a signed phase 1 trade deal with china and a ratified usmca sometimes referred to as the new nafta both trade deals are expected over the coming weeks thus far the opportunities in our view are winning the fact that equity markets continue to shrug off the worries reminds us of james carville s famous quote it s the economy stupid in other words when investors are faced with competing news the news that contains clear economic consequences tends to be where investors pay the greatest attention in addition to the gains already accruing to equity holders we have observed two additional positives coming from the tug of war the market s resilience is a signal that significant underlying demand exists to buy equities and that sidelined investors are starting to chase the market in our view continuing worries such as impeachment and iran add additional bricks to the wall of worry that has historically been a pre requisite for continued equity advancement we believe that a formidable wall of worry keeps investors from becoming overly optimistic which can create dangerous bubbles in conclusion rising markets should be a tailwind for our global allocation portfolios in our opinion in

bloomberg opinion as part of his promise to deliver the benefits of brexit boris johnson has set a goal of doubling the rate of economic growth after the u k leaves the european union that aspiration could be treated as a rhetorical flourish like donald trump s belief that the united states can get to 4 or even 5 annual growth by following trumponomics but i will take it seriously at first glance the hope is ambitious but not outrageous the international monetary fund baseline forecast is just under 1 5 growth per year for the expected five years of this johnson government the trend growth rate pre financial crisis through the chancellorships of kenneth clarke and gordon brown between 1993 and 2007 was around 2 75 so the johnson proposition is that britain can return to its pre crisis economic performance or a bit better one obvious negative is the impact on growth of the government s policy to tighten immigration controls as the u k takes back control of its borders net immigration around 225 000 a year currently accounts for two thirds of population growth a rough calculation based on gdp per head suggests that contributes to about 0 6 of gdp growth annually so if population growth is halved say there is a potential hit of 0 2 per year of annual growth another negative is potentially weak demand at home and abroad unlike the pre crisis period there is no longer a booming world economy and the imf is warning of global growth downgrades weak business investment at home caused by last year s brexit uncertainty may get a temporary boost this year from the clear election result but there will be a long period of negotiation over terms of u k access to the eu and those countries where there is an eu association agreement the decoupling of trade and investment arrangements is bound to impose costs and inhibit investment even if you believe it will be skillfully managed by the johnson government meanwhile households are again approaching pre crisis debt levels making any consumer boom underpinned by credit improbable and risky in equal measure household debt rose to 146 of disposable income in the crisis year of 2008 from 85 in 1997 it is now back to 140 of disposable income and forecast to reach 150 by 2024 after a decade of quantitative easing there is little scope for further monetary stimulus to offset weak consumer demand much hinges on the promised fiscal boost to public investment and the more relaxed approach to the public sector deficit and debt some relaxation is necessary and welcome especially to fund productive infrastructure but any suspicion in the bond markets that the u k has abandoned fiscal discipline will test what bank of england governor mark carney referred to as the kindness of the strangers who lend to us drive down sterling and prompt higher interest rates this is in marked contrast to japan whose government can comfortably borrow for public spending since japanese savers are willing to lend even at derisory interest rates essentially what lies behind the prime minister s growth optimism is the hope that there will be a near miraculous productivity spurt but it is difficult to see where it will come from whatever the outcome of u k eu trade talks there will be new frictions that are bound to place a drag on growth the u k has already had a decade of supply side reforms based on deregulation cuts in corporate tax and labor markets that are among the most flexible in the developed world leaving the eu gives no additional flexibility in the big remaining regulatory challenges like the rules governing building permissions where politics and economics collide the conservative party s traditional supporters largely middle class and wealthier home owners rely on planning restrictions to support their inflated housing prices there is no sign that this government has any appetite for a new burst of thatcherism more positively there does seem to be a recognition of the importance of science and innovation of improving transport and internet connectivity in depressed areas of the country and of the value of industrial strategy to support high productivity sectors the unlikely electoral coalition which gifted boris johnson his majority the well heeled privileged english home counties alongside frustrated left behind parts of britain will be hard to hold together in 2024 so ministers will want to see projects like northern powerhouse rail a large scale project to improve and further develop rail links in the country s more deprived northern regions breaking ground and making a visible difference but these welcome projects will not in themselves solve the drag on the economy from low levels of mathematical and scientific literacy deficient provision of skills training and apprenticeships indeed inadequately supported life long learning will also take decades to turn around it is entirely understandable that the government should try to develop a positive narrative about post brexit britain but talking up the growth rate of the economy has to be based on more than wishful thinking forecasting is more an art than a science but i have rather more confidence in the realist art of the imf than the impressionism of the prime minister chancellor of the exchequer sajid javid s suggestion in davos that the government might now downgrade growth as an objective suggests that perhaps the treasury is coming around to the realist school too to contact the author of this story vince cable at emailvincecable gmail com to contact the editor responsible

readers of a certain age ok boomer will recall the long running demise of spanish dictator francisco franco and its satirization by saturday night live after a 40 year rule general franco fell into a three week coma before passing away in november 1975 seemingly breathless news reports in the u s of his obviously hopeless struggle for life were so repetitive that they became a skit in the first year of snl with continuing lines for years afterwards that generalissimo francisco franco is still dead one of the federal reserve s principal goals its 2 percent inflation target is in a similar condition 2019 has seen inflation measured with the fed s preferred gauge of core personal consumption expenditure pce prices excluding food and energy around its level through november of 1 6 percent since the fed announced the 2 percent target in 2012 its record has been perfect it has never achieved the goal for a calendar year zero for eight in fact going back to 1996 there have been only four years when inflation exceeded this target 2004 to 2007 think about what happened during those pre financial crisis years missing the inflation goal appears to have little actual consequence for the u s economy which obviously is healthy with record low unemployment and growth around its potential one could say a few tenths of a percent is good enough for government work and the fed is part of the government indeed according to san francisco fed research the fed s leaders used to have a 1 5 percent target before the crisis it was typical to describe an inflation objective between 1 and 2 percent in which case the current inflation level would be absolutely fine current fed leaders are more rigid new york fed president john williams says that the fed must stick to its 2 percent goal federal reserve board vice chairman richard clarida says we take as given that a 2 percent rate of inflation is the operational goal most consistent with our price stability mandate it s often the givens the unexamined assumptions that trip us up and the fed has never explained why 2 percent is superior to 1 5 percent or a range around it the origin of the 2 percent figure comes either from new zealand where the central bank originated inflation targeting in 1989 or from noted stanford economist john taylor whose taylor rule in 1993 mentioned a hypothetical 2 percent inflation target nothing says current u s economic conditions are comparable to those in new zealand in 1989 which at the time was fighting high inflation or even to the u s itself in 1993 with population and economic growth nearly twice current levels the fed must justify why 2 percent is appropriate for the u s now if the fed can describe for the first time why 2 percent is the optimal u s target it can then address how after a generation of failure it actually plans to get there not only has the fed been unable to hit its target on a sustained basis but so have other major central banks the european central bank and the bank of japan all three have poured massive resources into inflating their economies from 20 percent of gdp in the u s to 100 percent in japan yet none have reached their targets why would the fed now suddenly succeed to this end the fed has embarked upon a review of monetary policy strategy tools and communications to reorient policy to finally hit its target the fed and most monetary economists believe in an expectations theory that inflation is determined by what participants in an economy expect inflation will be as part of its review the fed may change the basis of its inflation target to a long term average inflation rate or to a price level that reflects a long term average rate this begs the essential catch 22 question of inflation expectations theory on the one hand as new york fed president williams stated the history of inflation plays a big role in inflation expectations we need higher inflation to boost expectations on the other hand we need higher expectations to boost inflation how will the fed s new strategy resolve this dilemma it s not even clear the economy pays attention to the fed s inflation goal while the fed has elegant mathematical models incorporating this theory right now in the bond market a combination of inflation adjusted and regular u s treasury bonds produces a breakeven rate for expected future inflation for 30 years around 1 80 percent for consumer price index inflation which translates to about 1 55 percent for the fed s core pce measure the financial markets which pay very close attention to the fed seem to utterly disregard its 2 percent target for the next 30 years all this might be of merely passing interest with the economy performing well but the fed is insisting not only on reaching 2 percent inflation but on surpassing it fed chairman jerome powell has repeatedly called for a symmetric target with inflation sometimes above 2 percent the one precedent for this is the mid 2000 s that entailed an increase in private debt of 50 percent of gdp and a one third decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar here s another catch 22 for the fed the economy s good when it doesn t hit its target but we have a financial crisis when it does what reason is there to believe next time will be different that to boost inflation over 2 percent we won t need a massive debt increase and depreciation of the dollar maintaining flexibility to respond to economic downturns is the principal reason the fed seeks higher inflation it wants latitude to cut interest rates former fed chairman ben bernanke s analysis is that the fed has stimulative tools to adjust to interest rates as low as 2 percent most recessions are preceded by rising inflation so in today s low inflation world they may be less frequent as has been true for the last two recoveries ironically a recession and financial crisis may be more likely if the fed actually attains its 2 percent target than if it doesn t so for its strategic review the fed must explain to congress the financial markets and the public why its inflation target matters beyond its sophisticated models why it should be 2 percent how it can accomplish this and how it can avoid past problems with higher inflation otherwise there may be many more refrains of the federal reserve failed to hit its target and generalissimo franco is still dead douglas carr is a financial markets and macroeconomics researcher he has been a think tank fellow professor executive and investment banker

vaneck funds europe looking at markets at present what do you feel are the risks we are facing and where do you see upside jan van eck vaneck i would say the things that concern me actually are the ecb bond markets and negative interest rate policy and the struggle that the ecb has with trying to stimulate its economy and where that all ends i would combine with that which is something that s not discussed at all the us fiscal deficit which is really tremendous people talk about late stage recovery but what s crazy about where we re at is how much money the us government is spending given where we are in the economic cycle greg ehret pinebridge investments the obvious thing that s out there from a risk perspective is the wide range of global geopolitical issues that have been at the forefront recently we believe these issues and also the us china trade issues have caused a temporary stall but longer term we think there s going to be a tremendous amount of western capital moving towards asia in the past 18 months or so we ve been talking to a lot of us investors about allocating capital to china i would say that is probably the greatest opportunity at present on the upside there will be tremendous selective opportunities for investors as capital flows towards asia in particular china both on the debt side as well as on the equity side richard garland investec asset management the biggest risk is the trade war between the us and china and it is not clear how and when it gets resolved the other risk linked to that is what mr trump does whether he wants to resolve the trade war before the election or whether he wants to do it afterwards assuming he wins notwithstanding this uncertainty we have had significant inflows into our china equity strategies particularly from pension funds in south america as well as from adviser clients in the americas asia and europe marc brookman schroders opportunities clearly exist in asia but there remains a lot of fear surrounding europe and especially the uk obviously international equities and emerging markets have both underperformed for a long time now and i think that fear has created some significant upside potential for the first time in a long time institutional investors are starting to think about reallocations here again dave lafferty natixis the main risks are us china trade relations and the potential for a messy brexit i think the market has an ability to get its arms around that the one that concerns me long term is the ecb and how it will all end one of my biggest worries is that it doesn t end that zero and negative interest rate policy and unlimited quantitative easing qe eventually has a gravitational pull that just continues to bring inflation expectations and bond yields lower and lower in the near term and we ve already seen it that s great for stocks but in the long run i don t think that s great for stocks i think the market eventually begins to discount if interest rates are that low and central banks are that worried then maybe the stock market shouldn t be rallying so that s my big worry i guess my hope is the inverse of that that at some point central banks begin to wean markets off of accommodative policy i don t think they can do it yet but maybe if they hold a little bit more firm fiscal policy and structural reform can begin to rise up and create productivity gains i don t think we re anywhere near that happening yet but that s kind of the long run upside to get us out of this stagnation environment we ve been living in funds europe in the last year what investment areas and types of product have seen the most momentum garland investors are generally nervous and we have seen so much money flowing into short term duration bonds these funds are being used as a safe haven as almost cash plus funds the challenge for owners of these funds is that with interest rates coming down the yield on these funds is down to 1 2 this is a potential bubble waiting to burst van eck i think again from my more us perspective it was really the risk off mentality was dominating it came after a tough fourth quarter in 2018 so it is a little bit understandable at the beginning of the year then in the summer the absolute collapse in yields i think frightened informed investors whatever it is you could be justifiably conservative but it s the same issue that i ve seen in portfolio construction since the financial crisis so much money was left on the table because people were saying lets go into short term municipal bonds or short term instruments because it makes you comfortable and at my quarterly reviews i m not going to have to apologise for anything and i think it really led to a lot of money being left on the table ehret a lot of institutions clearly sat out the first quarter of 2019 and volumes were low what was really interesting is that we had a great fourth quarter the previous year from a flow perspective because institutions had already decided they were going to allocate and they kept on allocating even when retail fled retail investors came back in in the first quarter but institutional investors took a pause during that retail rally but then we had the best summer we d ever had and we usually don t see this level of allocations in the summer we had fundings from clients in the middle east from the united states from asia the search for yield and returns in a highly uncertain market environment meant investors gravitated to strategies that are flexible and provide differentiated sources of alpha we saw momentum in loans emerging markets high yield as well as asian equities strategies like china a shares and asian small cap brookman we ve raised most of our assets from the offshore market which has typically favoured short duration but we ve attracted onshore flows too which has gravitated towards emerging market debt and other things looking ahead i do think that there are some good new corporate cash opportunities in the us there are record amounts of cash sitting in lots of companies especially tech companies the question is are they willing to do a little bit more to get a slightly higher yield to take on a little bit more risk that s going to be the key question and we re going to find out the answer in the fourth quarter lafferty our international team has more short duration than we have in the us and it hasn t been a huge boon for us in the us market that trade looks like it s fading so the growth you still see positive flows in the short and ultra short product but the rate has slowed dramatically not surprising as central banks begin to retrench we do as much if not more on the retail side than the institutional side the retail investors are really focused on taxes they ve had a ten year bull market in stocks and bonds and they re sitting on massive capital gains so we have no problem getting meetings talking to people about how to mitigate tax liability whether it s loss harvesting on the equity side or whether it s municipal bonds in spite of low yields funds europe fund distribution is changing across the board how do you anticipate this will change and what role do you think technology will play in this garland in the us we are witnessing the slow death of the mutual fund the future of the us retail industry will be etfs and smas because mutual funds are not tax efficient and are too expensive compared to etfs and smas furthermore globally we will see more distributors setting up their own mutual funds and hiring sub advisers we have seen this trend accelerate in the uk and europe as a result of rdr and mifid ii ehret when i was at ssga i spent a lot of time thinking about the future of indexing and etfs and i think technology is going to disintermediate etfs i think we re headed towards more of a mass customisation of index products that will have tilts similar to the tax loss harvesting smas that you see today we ll see very tax efficient portfolios that will reflect clients biases and will also reflect clients concentrations in where they work and live and other important details that technology is right around the corner and as soon as it s available at a very cost efficient rate investors will benefit from that instead of etfs i think that there s an opportunity for technology to really have a big impact on that business technology is changing the way we all do business even beyond distribution for active managers like us we use ai in our equity research algorithmic and quantitative analysis to enhance fixed income trading and technology platforms to interface with our clients efficiently as a few examples lafferty yes if you like etfs for the tax benefit the idea is it doesn t throw off a lot of taxes when you begin loss harvesting if you can give somebody the same index broad market return and kick off 3 or 4 in tax losses some of our portfolios the tax alpha fades over time but you can get six seven eight years of 2 3 tax alpha it pretty much dominates a straight etf portfolio or straight index mutual fund it s tough to make it scalable until the technology kicks in but every year that goes by it becomes more and more efficient to run more and more of these portfolios brookman yes during my 12 years at morgan stanley on the wealth management side we drove a lot of the move to separate accounts the mutual fund is an antiquated vehicle it s convenient for broker dealers because of the revenue sharing that you can get out of it but slowly but surely everyone s moving to institutional shares we talked about this at our conference the other day the actively managed etf is not what everyone thinks it is it s not a regular passive index and if you re going to manage it you re not going to get the transparency you re not going to get a lot of things that people want the irony is separate accounts are exactly what everyone is looking for they want transparency they want to be able to take distributions in kind easily and they want tax efficiency there are these unified managed account platforms that exist out there that do tax overlay they can be done at the broker dealer side van eck international shares are a problem in separately managed accounts so you ve got to use american depositary receipts adrs and separate accounts unless you get creative and create no fee mutual funds on the subject of the death of etfs you just have to put some caveats in there for some asset classes etfs offer greater liquidity than the underlying securities so we have this in a local emerging markets local currency etf if you re an institution and you re trading 30 million it s stupid for you to go to a broker and buy the underlying bonds when you can just trade the etf at a penny wide spread then if you have a taxable investor and an active high turnover strategy etfs are awesome for that if you have a high turnover strategy you can t tax loss optimise your way out of that one if you have a separately managed account so there are use cases for etfs i don t think they re going to go away but i m not fighting that trend in the conversation and if you re a non taxable client then it doesn t matter funds europe looking solely at the north american market do you anticipate any changes in the dynamics of the market and investor needs lafferty at some point the pain comes back and people have to have a recognition of risk management i don t see how you can do 17 trillion in global qe take interest rates to zero take them negative across the yield curve around europe and i cannot believe that that hasn t forced investors into portfolios that are above and beyond their risk tolerance at some point in the future there s going to be a shift there is going to be a bear market we don t know when we re not quite in the recession camp yet but there inevitably will be a recession i have to wonder how many clients have been forced into portfolios that are not appropriate for their risk tolerance because the option was to buy a negative yielding bond or they were forced to take their private equity allocation from 5 to 15 because the option was to own a 2 ten year treasury when the discount rate on their liabilities is 7 ehret also where i m starting to see a shift is in investors reliance on the whole concept of benchmarking from institutional north american clients downstream to all investors they don t think of for example an em allocation as an em allocation any more they think about where specifically they re going to invest their em dollars they are questioning the whole concept of what is a global benchmark and does it make sense maybe it s been useful for measuring my strategic asset allocation but they have to somehow figure out how to translate that into a workable investment in maybe brazil india and china or some other combination of the various countries i do think that if you look back in the 90s and early 2000s all the global consultants were talking about global benchmarks and saying get away from the style box go global we re going to see that coming back because the connectivity of all those markets seems to be different brookman a goals based approach is gaining momentum especially in the retail and intermediary channel again the big firms are pushing aggressively to get away from benchmarking focusing on what the goals are and target them that s is what you should be looking at the other interesting one is a similar point around risk i ran a consulting firm for some years and the hardest thing a client could ask was why am i allocated this way why am i buying these expensive hedge funds when i could be 65 in the s p index and 35 in lehman ag and outperform you for 2 basis points the answer is well some day that will change when and if that change comes is a difficult question and the more you plough fees into it or use hedge funds or anything else makes it tougher still but when it does it is the best way you could invest i do think there will be a day where it will be the right strategy to buy gold and some of these other asset classes again garland we need to accept that clients portfolios will end up with 30 50 in passive investments and that the portion being invested in active funds will shrink this is a structural shift and as an active manager we need to focus on offering concentrated high conviction portfolios with a high active share van eck maybe for big active shops but in my next life i want to be an active manager just give me five or ten stocks i can own there are so many companies that are under researched right now the sell side is just getting weaker by the year i don t know when that changes the overall dynamic but i think that would be really fun funds europe do people trust the funds industry and what needs to be done to improve this garland no we need to be more transparent and create clear outcome based solutions for clients van eck i have to give my idiosyncratic answer to this my biggest concern about the fund industry is the concentration of ownership of corporate america the top four asset managers state street vanguard fidelity blackrock own 20 plus of the stock of a lot of public companies and it s going to be a big issue at some point period it s because their ownership is increasing as their market share increases and it s going to be a political issue it s on the fringes but i can tell you that there s a cottage industry of lawyers law professors and some economists talking about it no one i think wants those companies running corporate america brookman but their obligation from a stewardship perspective is in conflict to that right so it s a huge issue i see that van eck where the rubber meets the road is that for antitrust purposes if one owns over 5 of a company s stock one has to be passive but i don t always know what that means the concept of passive has gotten very confused these days because boards are meeting with big shareholders whether active or passive talking about esg and all kinds of different topics and it s not transparent what s going on there and it s potentially conflicted so i just think that politicians will come in one day that s one of my concerns i don t have a proposal but i do think the industry has got to figure out what appropriate behaviour is brookman there is trust in the industry but i don t think the general public trust wall street this was a big thing for me personally in 2008 and 2009 during the financial crisis as asset management firms or wealth management firms we did the right thing for our clients i get really passionate about how we help our clients whether they re retail or institutional how we help meet their goals dreams aspirations provide for generations all that corny stuff but we really do that when people tout how bad and evil wall street is and our industry is tainted with that brush i think it s unfair what we aim to do i think means people trust our industry because there have been so few blow ups yes there are a handful of them and a couple of the hedge funds and ponzi schemes and things like that but i think overall our industry is pretty well thought of lafferty we have some data on this we survey investors and advisers and asked them do you trust your financial adviser and it s a lot like congress they don t trust the industry as a whole but they love their congressman so when our data showed that when you asked them about their adviser over 90 of them registered some reasonably high level of trust when you asked them about advisers in general that number falls to 65 or 70 so it s reasonably high they don t have a huge problem with the advisory practice they like their adviser more than they like the industry as a whole ehret to address trust there is also a one client at a time type of work you have to do in the last four years we have probably gained 25 clients who are strategic partners relying on us for advice on how they run their business as well as investment strategies and i think that trend is increasing the desire of our institutional client base as well as financial advisers getting real advice from their asset managers has grown and that can put a strain on a firm s resources at times but there s an opportunity to heal the wounds of the global financial crisis through those partnerships the demonstration of how you work and partner with your clients will always overshadow anything that s as self serving as us saying you should trust us funds europe if there s one thing you d like to change about our industry what is it garland we need to work on explaining the value of active management and not allow passive to be seen as the only investment option brookman my one wish is to improve perception of our industry this is a great industry that helps people every single day and it should be ahead of dentistry in terms of public perception lafferty if you read the media the casual reading is passive is cheap and good and active is expensive and bad and we need to try to balance those scales i wish the financial media would write as much about where active is outperforming but i get it we ve all had media training if it bleeds it leads and frankly saying that you re overpaying and not getting value is a far more interesting story than you paid and got value for it that was what was supposed to happen so we would like to see a more balanced narrative and there s nothing about this argument that is any way designed to downplay or mitigate the good parts of passive we are huge believers in passive we just think the narrative has become completely unbalanced my back up choice would be technology the industry has just been slow other industries are really ramping up technology we are doing it in fits and starts because it s kind of been a high margin business and we don t really want to bring a lot of technology too quickly to what we do that would be my back up choice van eck scepticism i feel like we fall into paradigms of the ways of thinking about the market right now i ll give you an example growth versus value so there was a study 20 years ago that said that value always outperforms and those huge asset managers that are biased towards value yet growth has beaten value for many years i don t think anyone knows why i don t know why and i really don t believe anyone has sufficiently explained it just because one study came out or it worked for 30 years doesn t mean it s going to work for the next 20 the financial markets reflect a changing world let s just be a little bit more broadly sceptical about the future ehret i would say the whole argument that equates scale with success the whole concept that big is always better in asset management is usually touted by the very large firms themselves and can be a backwards argument especially in active management managing more money in an active portfolio doesn t necessarily mean you re going to have better performance scale has to reflect who and what you are and what you re offering it doesn t necessarily have to mean you have to be big this actually does have a negative impact on investors as well for example if you can only be a certain percentage of a fund and let s say you pick a middle market private equity fund how big should a middle market private equities fund be maybe that fund shouldn t be a big fund by nature of its investments but maybe it s still a good investment for you maybe it shouldn t be any bigger than 800 million or so but now you are constrained by the size scale has been forced to be the mantra of our industry and it s sometimes counterproductive for our clients success 2019

europe faces common threats both geopolitical and environmental for which it will need common action but common action which usually involves sacrificing short term national advantage is politically very demanding while the impetus may be common threats sustaining it will only be feasible if the union has strong legitimacy with europe s citizens as brexit and the rise of european populism has revealed such practical legitimacy is under attack in this article i diagnose the origins of populism and propose ways the commission can best restore support among those most disaffected the origins of european populism are two socio economic divergences that began around 1980 and have been at their most extreme in britain one is spatial the other educational i discuss these processes more fully in the future of capitalism facing the new anxieties here after a brief summary i focus on how core european policies have affected them and how new approaches by the commission could potentially restore social convergence the subsequent section focuses on the past effects of the union s four flagship economic policies the internal market free movement the euro and the identity of being european the article then focuses on healing spatial divergence suggesting policies that might enable each region of europe to have at least one major city that is globally competitive and anchors the region s most able young people finally the article focuses on healing educational divergence suggesting policies that might enable the half of europe s population that is less cognitively gifted to acquire and retain skills that make them highly productive the political economy of social divergence spatial divergence takes three forms in some countries notably britain france portugal and poland national metropoles have outpaced provincial cities and towns some of which have crashed as their core industry has relocated to asia the primary driver of this process which reverses the trend of the previous two centuries is probably the increasing globalisation of markets supporting fewer but bigger winning clusters of agglomeration within europe london is the most striking example of this process with the city becoming the most successful of the world s three leading financial clusters the second form of spatial divergence is between regions it is notable that the main secessionist movements in europe catalonia scotland italian s northern regions and flanders have all been the wealthy regions of their countries wishing to escape from the claims of poorer regions again it is most marked in britain where indices of regional inequality have risen very substantially the final spatial divergence is between countries this has been reflected in incomes unemployment and migration most notably germany has benefited from rising incomes low unemployment and inflows of skilled labour whereas italy and greece have suffered a large decline in income high unemployment and the emigration of skilled workers the educational divergence is between those with good tertiary education on which sophisticated skills are built that have become steadily more valuable and those with weaker education who had invested in manual skills the primary driver of this process is probably technological i e the increased complexity of production complexity has increased the need for sophisticated skills which require university built cognitive capabilities while simultaneously reducing the value of manual skills the spatial and educational divergences have become intertwined due to the tendency of the best educated young people growing up in declining cities regions and countries to migrate to the metropoles we can conceptualise this process as a rise in the productivity of skilled workers in the metropole an increase in the rents of agglomeration which accrue partly to those who own land and property and partly to those with high value skills these rents attract migrants from the provinces but potential job seekers are differentiated both by skill and by housing needs willingness to accept the bedsit lifestyle the winners who gain by relocating will be those with relatively high skill but relatively low housing demand this is why it is predominantly those young people who are well educated and still single for whom relocation to the metropole is attractive once people are married with children and therefore have a greater need for housing the gains from higher metropolitan productivity are more than offset by the higher costs of housing the exit of the brightest and best youth while their parents are left behind both physically and perhaps psychologically aggravates the sense of despair in left behind places at its extreme in provincial america it manifests as deaths of despair hence the divergence of the provinces cannot simply be addressed by compensating transfers of consumption what is needed are credible prospects of recovered pride that retain each region s youth these post 1980 spatial and educational divergences interacted with reconfigurations of identity by 1980 the governments of western europe had built welfare states that were without historical precedent the political underpinnings of this extraordinary achievement were that the terrible experiences of the second world war in which civilians had suffered alongside soldiers had forged a sense of common national solidarity in consequence the successful accepted burdensome new responsibilities towards the less successful for example in britain the high income groups accepted rates of marginal income tax above 80 in order to fund the national health service similarly in france during the trente glorieuses huge state expenditures funded by taxation and debt put in place the transport infrastructure that enabled prosperity to be spatially widely spread the new economic divergences gradually undermined this new sense of shared identity diverging incomes generated diverging collective identities which gradually unwound the capacity for a sense of common purpose as income differences widened successful people in successful metropolises found that their self interest was to reduce their attachment to their national identity substituting it for a professional or metropolitan identity collier presents a simple rational choice model in which in response to greater income inequality there is a successful peel off from shared national identity in which there is a withdrawal from their obligations to less successful fellow citizens an example of this psychological process is the description by a london based journalist of how he and his fellow metropolitans perceive provincial britain it feels like being shackled to a corpse since well educated metropolitans have wielded disproportionate political influence they reshaped policy priorities in favour of their own concerns which did not include remedying the divergences from which they had benefited unsurprisingly this neglect induced a corresponding shift in the identity of those left behind towards grievance and opposition how the flagship policies of the european project affect these divergences the european project is primarily political and legal rather than economic but since the move to the european union four flagship policies have each been economically consequential namely the internal market free movement the euro and the promotion of european identity the internal market the gradual lifting of national barriers protecting markets for goods and services is qualitatively analogous to globalisation markets become more competitive this can produce substantial gains squeezing profits and thereby benefiting consumers and intensifying the quest for efficiency as philippon has shown the internal market has achieved this generating substantial benefits at a more mundane level the basic theorems of international trade tell us that liberalisation will produce powerful redistributions within each country specifically the less skill intensive activities will shift to the low income countries within europe reducing low skill wages in the countries where they were high while raising them where they were low the internal market has therefore helped regional convergence between countries but accentuated educational divergence within the higher income countries normally the gains of those who benefit will be larger than the losses of those who become worse off within each country so that a sufficiently well designed system of compensation could leave everyone better off while the commission had competencies to enforce mutual trade liberalisation among member countries it did not have the corresponding competencies to ensure that within each country those who gained would compensate those who lost this was left to national governments resulting in considerable variation in policies arguably this matter could have received more attention and its neglect may have contributed to anti european sentiment among aggrieved populations of workers in some of the high income member countries free movement the introduction of free movement affected both spatial and educational divergence while the basic theorems of economics suggest that the internal market bestowed mutual benefits among member countries there is no equivalent theorem concerning movements of labour between countries once firms and capital become mobile as they are in europe efficiency can be achieved by moving them to labour rather than labour to firms and capital indeed the central point of the factor price equalization theorem was to show that as long as activities are free to relocate the internal market should gradually make movements of both labour and capital unnecessary the key effect of free movement has been to encourage spatial mobility of labour in the interest of a more efficient allocation of resources for given locations of firms and capital thereby inadvertently tending to amplify initial spatial inequalities in practice those most likely to gain from migration are the skilled and so it has enabled relocation of the well educated from the poorer regions of low income member countries to the richer regions of high income members the governments of the poorer countries of europe that have suffered from rapid brain drain such as greece estonia and romania are now unsurprisingly wary of free movement in contrast the german government which has sought to offset an unsustainably low birth rate through immigration rather than the more costly strategy of greater family support remains enthusiastic free movement has had effects both on the regions of exit and the regions of entry as an example of the effects of exit i take the emigration of around 30 of romania s doctors to better paid jobs in northern europe those doctors who have emigrated have principally come from poor provincial areas of romania rather than bucharest resulting in a severe deterioration in the medical coverage of small towns the only way for provincial populations to have protected the healthcare of their young and old would have been to raise the incomes of their doctors already a high income group in their communities towards parity with the northern metropoles this new outflow of the highly skilled to more attractive opportunities fully meets the efficiency criteria by which resource allocation is commonly assessed in treating high income patients in paris rather than low income patients in small town romania the productivity of romanian doctors as measured by their earnings has unambiguously risen if efficiency is the sole criterion then the integration of the internal market has achieved its purpose it can also be judged to be a success on the libertarian criterion romanian doctors have benefited from the increase in their individual liberty achieved by european cooperation however on social well being criteria it can be seen as inadvertently damaging tempting vital members of communities into abandoning their obligations as an example of the effects of entry i take london the european city that has attracted the most immigrants well over half its population is now first or second generation immigrant as discussed the people who will find relocation to london most attractive will be those with high skills and low housing demand prior to free movement the eligible pool of potential workers from whom these best suited people were drawn was the 50 million people living in provincial britain free movement radically expanded this pool of eligible people from 50 million to 500 million one consequence of this more intense competition for jobs in london was that the average skill level of entrants to the london job market rose this was a gain in allocative efficiency but as with romanian doctors it produced powerful redistributions the increase in levels of individual skill increased the rents of agglomeration the gain in productivity from clustering many skilled people together these rents were shared between those who owned land and property in london and the highly skilled but since many british provincial workers who would otherwise have received these jobs had been outcompeted by european workers with higher skills or lower housing demand there was a corresponding transfer of these rents of agglomeration as with romanian doctors this can be seen in different ways it is an increase in allocative efficiency and in freedom for some successful people but it is also a transfer from provincial britons the beneficiaries are london land and property owners those highly skilled britons remaining in london and skilled europeans who moved to london notably in these examples the effects both of exit and of entry disadvantaged the less successful groups of europe s citizens the euro the decision to replace national currencies with a common currency left open the rules by which that common currency would be managed prior to the common currency national practices had been very different and so a common currency required some common standard had the common currency adopted the practices of the lira the consequences for spatial divergence would most likely have been quite different from the adoption of the practices of the deutschmark which was what actually happened this gave germany with its expectations of low inflation a competitive advantage afforded by an undervalued real exchange rate which cumulated to become considerable hence its rapid growth very considerable balance of payments surplus and very low unemployment this advantage was amplified through the hartz reforms and the black zero which lowered wage costs that would otherwise have been offset by a market driven appreciation in the nominal exchange rate conversely italy and other previously high inflation countries received an initial windfall from reduced interest rates on government debt generating a temporary boom which delayed downward revisions in wage demands subsequently governments could only maintain payments equilibrium by deflating their economies hence inflicting high unemployment on their citizens in response to this divergence in unemployment rates skilled labour migrated giving german firms a further windfall from the influx of ready trained labour this influx of labour rescued german firms from the consequences of social policies which had induced the birth rate to fall well below replacement rates but in doing so it arguably delayed the necessary reforms in social policy the divergence due to the euro is now fairly well understood by economists but not yet sufficiently understood by either citizens or politicians notably in their resistance to a transfer union germans appear genuinely to be unaware that given the policies adopted for the euro europe already is a powerful transfer union of which they have been the major beneficiaries the modest scale of offsetting fiscal transfers which is the focus of attention is trivial in comparison to the effects of real exchange rate misalignment and the relocation of skilled labour this misunderstanding is important because in a democracy good policy is dependent upon the existence of a critical mass of informed citizens and politicians european identity the final policy which indeed was considered so important that it probably motivated the others was the promotion of european identity potentially such an identity could work either as a substitute or a complement for national identities the impetus for the founding of the european community was understandably the fear of further intra european warfare just as the purpose of regional economic integration was to create sufficient interdependence in production that such warfare would be materially impossible the purpose of european identity was initially to substitute for national identity thereby making intra european warfare psychologically impossible however the potential for european identity to substitute for national identity has profound consequences for the poorer citizens of europe s nations for them the post war sense of shared national identity had become a hugely valuable asset post 1980 just as the new economic forces of social divergence were necessitating national solidarity this sense of shared identity was being unwound the most successful citizens namely the well educated metropolitans who have enjoyed rising relative incomes have gradually peeled off from shared national identity the option of being european has perhaps been a convenient justification for them to withdraw from obligations to their provincial fellow citizens evidence for this interpretation comes from the structure of support for the european union generally strongest support for europe is found among the successful metropolitans whereas hostility to europe is most common among the provincial less educated the people who have been marginalised by divergence the clearest evidence of this comes from the voting pattern in the brexit referendum the only region of england and wales to support remaining in the union was london every other region voted for brexit further among the highly educated population those living in london were more likely to vote for remain than those outside london while among the less educated population those living in london were even less likely to support remain that those living elsewhere the brexit referendum is particularly revealing because it was a rare instance of a vote entirely focused on attitudes toward the union however similar patterns are evident from support for the gilets jaunes in france the afd in germany the league in italy and vox in spain in essence to the extent that it has been taken up by citizens to date the option of european identity has arguably been interpreted primarily not as the acquisition of new obligations towards the less successful regions of europe which would evidently help regional convergence but as the exit from former obligations towards the less successful regions of one s own nation the commission might try to address this directly by clarifying that european identity cannot legitimately be used to exit obligations to others within the nation but incurs further obligations to those in other member countries promoting spatial convergence a fundamental rationale for the european project has been to promote spatial convergence this goal is both valuable and feasible it is valuable because common european action is increasingly necessary but the willingness to accept that it should prevail over national preference will dissipate if poorer regions and countries fall behind some market fundamentalists seem to believe that the internal market will automatically achieve regional balance across europe and the shift of labour intensive activities to low income member countries is indeed a force for convergence unfortunately the spatial allocation of economic activity is more complex than envisaged by the classical theory of international trade more recent theories emphasise the importance of agglomeration cities not countries are the key spatial unit of analysis the market responses when the key export base of a city loses competitiveness have recently been analysed by venables initially markets drive down the price of property and local wages the response to these market signals is that the city attracts individual footloose firms whose business models depend upon cheap accommodation and low wages and whose markets are regional or national rather than global as property gets reoccupied the scope for a new cluster of knowledge intensive firms that are globally competitive closes the city s labour market falls off the escalator of skill accumulation and innovation found only in the clusters of high productivity firms such as that which was lost successful cities which are the key spatial phenomena are the result of coordination interdependent firms determine investment strategies based on their expectations of how the other firms with whom they need to co locate will invest there are an infinite number of these possible spatial equilibria and so firms face radical uncertainty there are three possible responses to such uncertainty one is to remain in the current cluster successful clusters are fairly persistent the second is indecision firms preserve the option value of waiting the third is the emergence of some narrative that circulates within the peer group the interdependent firms as the narrative circulates it gains credence simply because other members of the peer group come to hold the same ideas it can become a conviction narrative on which firms are willing to rely in taking a decision conviction narratives abound as schiller has recently shown they are often false and eventually implode but precisely because there are so many possible spatial equilibria spatial narratives have the unusual property that over a wide range they can be self fulfilling if singapore is the city of the future it is considered a safe place in which to invest and so it becomes the city of the future if rotherham is doomed firms will not go there and its skilled young will leave one role of public policy in achieving spatial balance of opportunities is to anchor expectations through an irreversible commitment such as the provision of economic infrastructure and thereby a shift in such narratives lessons from britain and germany britain s spatial distribution of economic activity is an extreme example of the consequence of market forces allied to a conviction narrative that has favoured london with no attempt to use offsetting public policies the gini coefficient of spatial activity in britain is far higher than any other large country in europe some market fundamentalists believe that such extreme agglomeration is allocatively efficient people in london are highly productive especially the skilled and so concentrating more skilled people in london would be even more efficient the fallacy in this is that extreme concentrations of people in megacities result in a loss of liveability although london is efficient at transforming inputs into income it is highly inefficient at transforming income into well being although london is the region with the highest average income in britain it is also the region with the lowest average score on well being the reasons for this are not yet adequately analysed but both the material conditions of congestion reflected in crowded commuting and lack of floor space and the social isolation reflected in a loss of proximity to family and belonging to community are plausible contenders further the same spatial narrative that supported the success of london namely that it was the place to go for bright young people deepens the demoralisation of the people remaining in regions that are being left behind that public policy sustained over decades can achieve a wide spatial distribution of successful cities is demonstrated by western germany after two decades of active policy and massive fiscal transfers eastern germany has achieved considerable convergence of incomes but that has been insufficient to prevent the emergence of grievance over second class citizenship in britain the only city apart from london that has productivity above the national average is edinburgh the comparison of edinburgh with the successful dispersion of knowledge clusters in west and limited successes in east germany may help to guide spatial policies in the larger context of europe while we still do not fully understand how to catalyse successful cities a combination of seven characteristics looks to be helpful the first characteristic is local political autonomy edinburgh like german cities has considerable developed political power in germany this is an implication of the federal constitution in britain it is a consequence of the rise of scottish nationalism itself a consequence of the location of britain s oilfields the second characteristic is a locally based finance industry only if finance is locally based can it use the tacit knowledge in lending decisions that comes from frequent personal contact with the management of local firms further only locally based finance has an overarching alignment of long term purpose regarding local prosperity the finance industry always starts as local because of the value of local knowledge for lending decisions but the dangers posed by spatially correlated default risks create a centripetal force by the end of the 19th century the bank of england had forced the pooling of spatial risks by requiring the merger of the many regional banks into just five national banks all of which were london based outside london britain has very few financial centres edinburgh is an exception because scottish law is distinct from english law and the remit of the bank of england did not extend there the german central bank solved the risk problem by insurance rather than concentration so that german banking remained local the third characteristic is a locally organised business community this is probably consequential on the first two characteristics for obvious reasons business communities tend to organise themselves so as to be near to political and financial decision taking in edinburgh and most german cities that is local while in england it is national and clustered in london in germany public policy has considerably encouraged the local basis for business organisation by legislation which gives such organisations important functions the fourth characteristic is locally based institutions of tertiary education their potential importance to the local economy is partly for training in locally pertinent skills and partly to generate research that helps to keep knowledge intensive firms sufficiently close to the frontier that they can sustain their position again legislation can help or impede links between education and local business for example in the 1980s britain converted its locally oriented technical colleges polytechnics into universities and this changed their sources of finance reducing their links to local government and local business in contrast the scottish government has strengthened the local connections of its universities uniquely in britain it has made its universities free to students but only if they are scottish german tertiary education has far stronger links with local business through its prestigious vocational training programs the fifth characteristic is a civic society that generates a strong sense of local culture civic society in edinburgh pioneered the city s annual festival which has created a brand attracting 500 000 people from around the world german cities have particularly strong civic society partly because public policy encourages participation in verein which have considerably expanded the sixth characteristic is an infusion of public finance that empowers local political leadership to upgrade the infrastructure that can anchor a new narrative and which can be used to encourage the other local actors to collaborate edinburgh was fortunate to benefit financially from the political consequences both of scotland s oil and of a scottish dominated government for the period 1997 2010 which between them sustained a large fiscal transfer to the edinburgh based scottish government public spending in scotland has been approximately 15 higher than that in england the seventh and final characteristic is good local leadership that forges purposive collaboration between local government local business local colleges and local civic society the purpose must be feasible forward looking and seen as beneficial to all so that it can be held in common in the absence of such leadership the more likely outcome in a broken city is that the narrative of local prospects becomes discordant and backward looking as each entity blames the others for failure an example being enmity between the local government and local business in edinburgh in 2009 leaders brought the various local entities together to agree on attracting a sector that had the potential to generate knowledge intensive jobs they chose information technology at the time the city had only two such firms but with each entity playing its role edinburgh was able to attract many more as of 2019 edinburgh had 480 it firms the largest cluster in the whole of europe again public policy can help or hinder the emergence of good local leadership germany has long had powerful mayors being a clear route to the top of national politics these positions attract highly able people for example germany s current minister of finance and deputy chancellor was previously the mayor of hamburg in contrast other than in london england is only now piloting the idea of mayors not only can these characteristics account for the success of edinburgh and the cities of west germany their absence may help to explain both why britain has greater spatial inequality than germany and why although east germany has caught up in terms of incomes its population has become highly disaffected east germany did not start in 1990 with local business communities its state enterprises were nationally organised the massive financial transfers were primarily to raise per capita consumption and to attract subsidiary operations of west german businesses rather than to build prosperous local businesses hence east germany has been slow to develop locally rooted business communities further the gdr system of top down mass scrutiny had undermined local social cohesion and cooperation people had become distrustful of each other and had little experience with local collective initiative the national policies implemented in post 1990 east germany have consequently not enabled its cities to build the interdependent clusters of knowledge intensive firms which would have retained bright young people instead its cities have filled up with the low cost low skill enterprises predicted by venables consumption levels have risen but have stalled at significantly below west german levels implications for european policy the internal market will not automatically induce spatial convergence while it is not feasible to bring productive jobs to wherever people want to live a reasonable goal is to ensure that every region of europe has at least one city that has a knowledge intensive cluster of businesses that are competitive either globally or at least within the european market good regional transport infrastructure would then enable people who belong to the region s other towns and cities to remain in them some commuting and the rest working in activities openerating in more localised markets west germany suggests that such a spatial distribution could be self sustaining edinburgh suggests that it is feasible to catalyse successful cities and east germany suggests that it will take more than fiscal transfers most of the remaining six desiderata were missing the appropriate role for the commission is to orchestrate region by region the provision of the seven characteristics that appear to be effective in catalysing a successful city evidently this cannot mean that the commission itself directly provides them but that it works with national and regional governments to ensure that there is a coherent plan within which public actions are clearly assigned the commission already has a structural fund were this fund linked to the purpose of catalysing a successful city in each region money for a city could be made conditional upon the other levels of government national regional and municipal each playing its appropriate role in contributing to specific parts of the seven characteristic package evidently the larger the fund the more leverage it would provide reversing skill divergence skill accumulation must necessarily occur through two distinct paths universities deepen the abilities of those young adults well suited to cognitively focused education and this provides a cognitive platform on which specialist professional skills can be built this process is generally working well in europe with britain being the most successful the half of young adults whose abilities are less suited to cognitively focused education need to make a more demanding transition to the acquisition of a range of non cognitive vocational skills this process varies considerably around europe in many countries this group is falling further behind those with cognitive abilities with britain being among the least successful fortunately the diverse range of policies important for non cognitive skill accumulation around europe provides a natural arena for rapid social learning the process which results in a young adult who is fully equipped with the necessary non cognitive skills to be productive and then maintains them consists of a long chain of distinct phases each dependent upon specific supportive public policies although no country has a complete chain of such policies that are best practice for each phase some european country can reasonably be judged successful the role of the commission is not to force standardisation of these policies but to encourage more rapid learning from this variation through comparison evaluation and persistent emphasis rapid and substantial improvements in addressing skill divergence could be achieved non cognitive capacities are forged right from conception a recent finnish study that tracked the consequences of stress in pregnancy for forty years found that the damage to personality was substantial and highly persistent it is likely to be more effective to focus policy on reducing stress in pregnancy than in coping with its consequences more generally during the period from conception to the age of around three years the priority seems to be to support young mothers and strengthen their families an example of such practical support in the home is the dutch policy of providing home help to mothers facing demanding situations in contrast the british social work system is designed around scrutiny of parents under threat of child removal 70 000 children are currently being reared in foster care which being temporary and paid struggles to provide the secure loving environment that young children need from the age of two to five non cognitive capacities can be enhanced by socialisation a good model is the french pre school system of ecoles maternelles one strength of this system is that it is free and standardised so that attendance has become the social norm hence there is no stigma attached to it so that the children who are most in need of it are very likely to be sent by their parents because provision is by means of formal entities with a headmistress and professionally qualified staff children get a structured learning experience where their progress can be monitored additionally being a full fledged organisation it can readily catalyse a community among parents reducing the stress of isolation by the age of six the cognitive performance of the child when aged 12 can be accurately predicted while the years of schooling receive enormous policy attention putnam argues convincingly that schools are predominantly sites at which children interact with each other thereby reinforcing whatever characteristics children have acquired in their homes assortative mating followed by assortative location leaves schools little scope for redressing weaknesses again an implication is that resources should be focused on the first six years there are however substantial variations around europe in school practices with finland recognised as having among the most successful outcomes post school there are wide variations in the provision of vocational training one lesson from failures in vocational training is that local firms need to be fully involved in the design and execution of training another is that to achieve a high level of skill and the ability to acquire related skills courses need to be long typically three to four years and properly accredited a particularly successful model is switzerland where 60 of school leavers choose to take the vocational route firms have a strong incentive to be involved because they finance half of the costs finally given rapid changes in the demand for skills many people will need to change their vocations training courses will need to cater to older workers and the public finance of skill acquisition needs to be structured for lifetime learning for example the french government has introduced a lifetime training entitlement of 5 000 euro a related proposal by jean tirole is that a firm that makes workers redundant should bear the costs to society of retraining so that it would have a stronger incentive to keep its workforce sufficiently skilled to remain productive conclusion europe like other advanced economies has faced social pressures arising from the globalisation of markets and the increasing complexity of production however the european commission has been given competences and implemented policies which while they have increased overall productivity have sometimes compounded these social pressures the commission has lacked the competences that would have equipped it to address the understandable anxieties of those at the wrong end of these pressures perhaps in consequence support for europe is strongest among the winners from globalisation and the rise in complexity and lowest among those who feel threated as an extreme but perhaps justifiable simplification the commission draws its support base from well educated metropolitans whereas its opponents are provincial manual workers to the extent that this is the case it is a substantial weakness centralised european authority must rest at least in part upon a sense of common identity in which the successful accept that they have obligations to the less successful and thereby commit to a europe of convergence convergence cannot just be about consumption people want the empowerment the agency that comes from being sufficiently productive to be able to contribute to society rather than being a burden on it hence convergence is about productivity poor regions must become more productive relative to richer regions and less skilled people must become more productive relative to the most skilled this convergence of productivity across europe s regions and classes analogous to what happened within most european countries during the period 1945 70 is the challenge for the commission in the 2020s it is a feasible goal but clearly not one that the commission can achieve purely through its own competences rather the commission needs to equip itself to orchestrate policies that will largely be the responsibility of national regional and municipal governments

with brent d griffiths the ticker president trump is notching his highest ever marks for his handling of the economy helping lift his overall approval rating to match his record peak of 44 percent according to a new washington post abc news poll the survey finds 56 percent of americans give trump a thumbs up on his economic stewardship 10 points higher than the last reading on that question in september and 5 points above the president s previous record set in july the result is buoying the president even as the nation remains split over trump s ongoing senate impeachment trial though 39 percent approve of how trump has responded to his impeachment americans are split on his removal from office 49 percent opposed to 47 percent in favor the poll finds the president is also benefiting from rising support from men the poll also finds a 57 percent majority of men approve of trump up 12 percentage points from october to the highest level of his presidency post polling director scott clement writes by contrast 33 percent of women approve of trump s performance little changed from 31 percent in the fall the 24 percentage point gender gap in trump s approval rating is the largest in post abc polls since he took office the gap carried through to assessments of trump s handling of the economy the overwhelming majority of men approved of his performance on that count 70 to 25 percent by contrast only 44 percent of women gave trump positive reviews for the economy while 50 percent disapproved it s not clear what accounts for the apparently dramatic improvement in the reviews for trump s handling of the economy since the fall economists estimate fourth quarter growth will underwhelm with projections at 2 percent or worse far below the 3 5 percent growth or better trump has promised annual growth should clock in around 2 2 percent and is projected to slow further next year advertisement on the brighter side unemployment remains at a five decade low a development that looks to be translating into wage gains especially for those at the bottom of the income scale the gains at about 3 percent a year are modest but goldman sachs economists project they will continue to gain steam rising to about 3 5 percent by the end of the year what the economy s performance means for trump s reelection chances is a matter of debate as the wall street journal s jerry seib notes the effects of the good economic news don t cut evenly or neatly across the land and political effects simply aren t what analysts traditionally would have expected some of those benefiting most from the trump economy reside in urban areas on the coasts yet their hatred of the president burns hot despite the economic benefits they feel he writes conversely some of those who are still struggling in the trump economy actually reside in the trump strongholds of rural america and the working class neighborhoods of the rust belt yet their support of the president seems as

president donald trump addressed an audience of the global business elite in davos on tuesday to make the case that ordinary americans have been the chief beneficiaries of his administration s america first maxim at the world economic forum in the swiss alps trump argued that a regime of tax cuts regulatory rollbacks and protectionist trade policies have benefited the working class every decision we make on taxes trade regulation energy immigration education and more is focused on improving the lives of everyday americans trump said adding that the well being of the american worker was paramount on cnbc national economic council director larry kudlow echoed the president s assertions inequality is diminishing right now he said i think we re in a better place many mainstream economists hold a different opinion while low unemployment and steadily if slowly rising wages have improved the fortunes of lower income americans these gains pale in comparison to the investment gains realized by the wealthy few the economic backdrop is such that people s finances are improving and the stage is set for further improvement it s debatable what all of that s attributable to said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com in spite of higher incomes significant wealth building among the middle class has not manifested mcbride pointed out more people are working more people are making money the extent to which people have used that backdrop as way to step further towards financial security such as boosting emergency savings retirement savings or paying down debt is still unclear he said the republicans corporate tax cuts also magnified economic inequality said ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics the tax policy center says that two thirds of the gains from the tax cuts in 2018 went to the top 20 percent of the household income distribution with the top one percent getting 21 percent of the immediate gains he said i don t particularly feel that it s been evenly distributed across the entire socioeconomic landscape said scott cole founder and president of cole financial planning and wealth management economists point out that trump s policies also have led to a ballooning of the federal deficit a growth sapping trade war and a recession in manufacturing even as the stock market has notched record highs there s no way that what s happening right now under a republican administration is fiscal conservatism cole said in his davos speech trump revisited another favorite topic negative interest rates they get paid to borrow money something i could get used to very quickly love that he said in reality negative rates would serve to further erode the financial stability of ordinary americans said karen shaw petrou managing partner of consulting firm federal financial analytics we know that they also destroy household savings and long term retirement security she said it s a move that supports stock markets not personal savings and to the extent that financial security is defined by wealth accrual a large number of households have still been left behind mcbride said we ve seen scant evidence that americans en masse have moved the needle regarding some fundamental aspects of financial security he said regardless of what the headline is i would think it s troublesome if you keep hearing about how great this economy is and you re not participating in it cole said

likely despite the improving outlook for advanced economies easing trade tensions and accommodative monetary policy the international monetary fund estimates that growth in developing countries fell to 3 7 per cent last year the slowest pace since 2009 and well below the imf s july 2019 forecast of 4 1 per cent an expected rebound to 4 4 per cent this year assumes highly uncertain recoveries in

fomenting domestic unrest and tensions with predominantly muslim pakistan and bangladesh meanwhile the spread of a new virus that originated in china threatens to depress retail sales and tourism in asia helping to bring a global stock rally to a halt last week these stresses exacerbate long term structural problems the early 2000s and the period immediately following the global financial crisis saw a synchronized acceleration of growth across the world but advanced economies have slowed and their long term potential rate of expansion has fallen the latest imf estimates released last week have growth in advanced economies stabilizing at 1 6 per cent in 2020 21 compared with 2 3 per cent in 2018 and 0 1 percentage point lower than in its october forecast underlying this stagnation is the flagging potency of debt fueled growth flat productivity limited policy options and unfavorable demographics emerging economies cannot rely on historic demand for exports to drive future expansion

restrictions that affect improvements in productivity meanwhile automation decreases the advantages of low skilled cheap labor and offshoring bringing manufacturing home to advanced economies

vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection a vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future covid 19 infection but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely the good news is that sars cov 2 virus has been fairly stable which increases the viability of a vaccine how many types of vaccines are there there are broadly four types of vaccine one a vaccine based on the whole virus this could be either inactivated or an attenuated virus vaccine two a non replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of sars cov three nucleic acid vaccines that have genetic material like dna and rna of antigens like spike protein given to a person helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine and four protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of sars cov 2 along with an adjuvant booster is given as a vaccine what does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind vaccine development is a long complex process unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children pregnant women and the elderly so rigorous tests are compulsory history says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time view more show there are concerns that tourism and consumer spending could

in the year 1939 my grandfather is said to have brought a heavy box to the house that is called radio when plugged into power the box starts to speak and sing to everyone s amazement and children and elders of the house gathered around it watching the box with great astonishment at the same time the radio speaks that britain has declared a war and this war which was the world war ii engulfed the entire world and ended with the dropping of atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki in japan it was a war for economic gains and expansionism and economic interests as in those days it was said the sun never sets over the british empire the british were quite wealthy with the wealth extracted from the colonies that they ruled history may assert that although the arch enemy was germany and hitler the bombs were dropped over japan as all germans perhaps being caucasians and the japanese being yellow skins this was about the same time when the congress in its meeting in bombay declined to accept a separate legislation for the muslims of india that led to the announcement by the quaid e azam for a separate state for the muslims denying the legislation was a step by the majority hindus to gain total hegemony over the muslims in terms of economics wealth and natural resources with the recent killing of general soleimani in iraq a fresh skirmish has started in the region and it is to be seen why this drastic action is taken now and why not before what could be its impact in the region and the reason for this action by the united states for every action individual or collective by a country or countries there is always a motive behind it and this motive is basically economics and to gain power for economic gains this writer affirms that there is nothing in this world that can match the value of a single human life what to say of many as against material a region with natural resources is a curse for its inhabitants and its indigenous population eg afghanistan democratic republic of the congo etc world leaders are architects of the world and an architect s first responsibility is towards the people any people anywhere in the world going back into history it could be seen that the us was reluctant to confront in a direct war with the soviet union as both were nuclear powers the us drained the economy of the soviet union and the country collapsed the us even went to the extent of deploying a double agent who sold blueprints at exorbitant sums of the regan s space wars and of the experiments that were tried and had already failed the soviets spent billions to learn the lesson the hard way by experimenting with these blueprints this is one example whereas many other ways must have taken place in this context that led to the fall of the soviet union the basis of all wars is economics and economic interests considering the recent development where many quarters feel that it will trigger world war iii but iran will not be so foolish to start an all out war considering its own internal problems and economic situation but reactions and fallout from this will be felt and can happen the first being a bearish trend seen in the international markets and pakistan s stock market was no exception that immediately lost around 400 points after the soleimani incident as seen after every earthquake there are aftershocks such aftershocks of the incident can engulf the region as can be seen oil prices have remained depressed being close to 60 per barrel as per a world bank and imf report if oil prices remain depressed below 50 saudi arabia will go into bankruptcy within three to four years furthermore the saudis have signed a deal for the supply of arms worth 360 billion if the saudi economy goes bankrupt from where will they pay this liability also if at any point in time tensions ease between iran and the us although which looks unlikely at this stage iranian crude will be dumped in the international markets and oil prices may fall below 40 per barrel therefore an early settlement with iran is a very far cry the increase in oil prices can drastically affect pakistan with the rupee standing devalued higher oil prices mean increase in transport costs and power tariffs that have an impact on all the consumable goods the cost of living and the industrial base the major power consumer is the industrial base and while industrial units are seen closing down there will be more power available than consumed leading to an increase in the circular debt luckily pakistan is advocating neutrality in the fight between the two countries at this stage but this may not be possible in the long run pakistan may again be told as earlier either you are with us or against us the writer is former deputy managing director of saindak copper and gold projectpublished in the express tribune january 27 2020 like business on facebook follow tribunebiz on twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation

in the decades that i have been listening to politicians clumsily trying to explain the economy there has never been a period with the possible exception of the early reagan years in which major party leaders were able to present a solid grasp of economic principles but i have never seen a time in which the levels of ignorance coming from those in leadership positions is so extreme the state of affairs can be illustrated by two interviews last week by donald trump and alexandria ocasio cortez for the democrats the two undisputed leaders of our major political parties both put forth visions this week that are illogical incoherent and that completely ignore both data and experience but these leaders are putting out beacons under which the vast majority of americans are congregating it s worse than the blind leading the blind and it bodes very poorly for our ability to deal with the next economic crisis which i believe is certainly slouching towards washington waiting to be born before i get into particulars let s dispense with the notion that aoc does not speak for the democrats she is the leader of the progressives and the progressives are in control the recent dust up between elizabeth warren and bernie sanders shows how far the moderate wing of the party has fallen while it may be true that warren is just as far left as sanders the democrat establishment is more comfortable with her as they know she would be willing to fake moderation and to tack toward the center if she wins the nomination on the other hand sanders has been an unrepentant communist his entire life and is unlikely to alter that message one iota if he faces trump in the fall in a 1981 today show interview sanders stated clearly that he does not support the capitalist idea of competition and that people work better under a cooperative system in other words he believes in the absurd marxist proposition that people are just as likely to work for the benefit of strangers than they would for themselves establishment democrats fear that trump will win that contest going away so they are in full panic last week they took the gloves off it began with warren s calculated allegations that sanders in a private conversation between the two had claimed that a woman could not be elected president the allegation was pressed by establishment allies at cnn through supportive commentaries and stilted questioning at the cnn sponsored debate leading pundits fell in line behind warren with an awkward twist on the believe all women mantra of the me too movement they painted sanders as out of touch at best and sexist at worst the next anti bernie attack came a few days later when hillary clinton let loose calling him unlikable and ineffective she even failed to commit to endorsing him if he were to win the nomination j easley a parnes the hill 1 22 20 this simply made hillary look like a more corrupt and opportunistic figure than many democratic activists previously thought but these attacks failed spectacularly and simply deepened mistrust about the clinton wing of the party and reaffirmed warren s reputation as an opportunist despite the full court press the warren campaign is now in free fall and the sanders campaign is surging the establishment is left hoping that doddery joe biden can somehow revivify over the next 10 months and escape any contamination from the ukraine affair but no one who is not receiving a paycheck from the dnc really believes this it s no accident that a major poll this week showed biden trailing sanders for the first time nationally and while bernie has now emerged as the soul of democrats everyone knows that he is not the party s future that honor is increasingly falling on his young and telegenic protégé from the bronx who would be running for president right now if she had enough candles on her cake to constitutionally qualify she will be eligible in 2024 for all his leftist authenticity sanders is also an old white man a trio of sins that modern woke progressives have a hard time forgiving on the other hand alexandria ocasio cortez is the fulfillment of their wish list she s ethnic young female and sees the united states as a notably racist sexist and tyrannical country that continues to be a slave state for its own citizens and an oppressor to the rest of the world and despite the fact that her resume is thin enough to be written on half a napkin she is bold enough to challenge the most senior members of her own party without paying the slightest price politically those in the establishment dare not cross her and her statements no matter how absurd they are treated as wisdom from the burning bush in that sense she looms over the democrats much the way that trump looms over the gop as absurd as it may sound there are remarkable similarities between the appeal of trump and aoc both are political outsiders who use social media fueled demagoguery to appeal directly to the people and are largely contemptuous of party establishments both shoot from the hip and spin stories that are completely unrelated to history or economic reality so with that preamble let s see what these two economic luminaries are now saying on january 22 in a sit down at the world economic forum in davos with cnbc s reliably pro trump anchor joe kernan the president delivered a self congratulatory turn that was brazen by even trump s legendary standards with a series of wildly inaccurate statements and i m not just talking about his idea that thomas edison invented the wheel trump claimed that the u s economy is now experiencing unprecedented economic growth that the world has never seen before this statement is absurd on its face in his first three years in office the u s economy has expanded at about 2 6 annually based on gdp statistics from frb st louis while this is just slightly higher than the growth seen in obama s second term which president trump described in his inaugural address as american carnage it is strikingly lower than the average growth rate we have had over the last 90 years based on gdp data from the u s bureau of economic analysis bea there are also many three or four year periods in our history in which gdp growth was multiples higher than the current growth rate and that doesn t even address the growth rates that have been seen in recent history in asian countries for much of the past 20 years chinese growth has been north of 8 annually does he not know that trump claimed that during his term in office the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 i don t know where he got this statistic i have looked but i can t find it but it does not pass the smell test median wage in the u s is about 63 000 u s census bureau 2018 the bottom half of earners must earn less than that by definition people making that kind of money often have little to no assets or savings what savings they may have are usually more than compensated by household debt what factors would have resulted in a near 50 expansion of their net worth trump simply may be assuming that the 50 growth in the stock market since his election has created similar growth patterns in the broader economy but that is not the case at all as proof of economic success trump noted that for the first time there are more women in the workforce than men according to data from the u s labor department but what does that prove perhaps it points to the contraction of those sectors that have typically employed more men such as manufacturing and construction while the service sector jobs in education and health care which typically employ more women have been expanding this reality is in stark contrast to trump s typical boast that his policies have led to a boom in domestic manufacturing manufacturing jobs have declined consistently during his presidency trump also spent a lot of time with kernan talking about his opposition to interest rate increases or attempts to shrink the fed s balance sheet and his desire for negative interest rates showing no understanding of why debt is a drag on growth or why high rates would be good for the economy trump believes that negative rates would boost the stock market further and help the country pay off the debt in reality negative rates would only make it easier for the government to borrow more he then repeated the rhetorical question he asked at the signing ceremony for the phase 1 china deal regarding just who is dumb enough to buy negative yielding bonds the obvious answer that somehow eludes the president is central banks so trump wants the fed to be dumb so that he can look smart and keep pretending the economy is booming this then led to a discussion about trump s plan to tackle the growing deficits which in the first three years of his presidency are significantly higher than in obama s second term kernan asked if trump would favor relying more on tax increases or spending cuts to achieve that objective trump replied that he would do neither and that additional tax cuts in his second term would solve the problem it mattered little to trump that the tax cuts in his first term led to much larger deficits trump then went on to claim that he favors a strong dollar but immediately followed up on how great it would be for the economy if the dollar gets weaker instead ironically i think trump s wish will be granted but i suspect a weaker dollar will not deliver the benefits trump is hoping for it will push up interest rates and consumer prices and prick the bubble that trump so proudly claims constitutes the greatest economic boom in history for her part alexandria ocasio cortez sat down in nyc for a martin luther king day event with an equally sympathetic questioner ta nehisi coates the black author and activist in their extraordinary exchange aoc gave her clearest view to date of her absolute opposition to capitalism business ownership and economic freedom and her clear support for state seizure of wealth and the control of the means of production in other words she went full throated bolshevik the sad part is that unlike her mentor benie sanders aoc probably never studied anything about the russian revolution and its subsequent evils and failures while it s true that she only lived for 11 years in the 20th century i would have hoped that it would have come up once or twice in her history or economics classes at boston university but she behaves as if she is completely unaware of anything that happened before the 2016 election in her interview with coates aoc offered further development of the controversial you didn t build that claim made by barack obama in which the former president claimed that american business only succeed because of investments the government makes in education and infrastructure and while that statement is widely off the mark it s nothing compared to aoc s comment that in america no one ever makes a billion dollars you take a billion dollars her theory is rooted in marxist theories of labor which assumes that workers produce all the value of a company s products and services while owners simply sit on the couch and count the profits she sees profits coming solely from worker exploitation and that private ownership of capital is a modern version of slavery when asked how a billionaire entrepreneur like jeff bezos could regain his status as a moral person aoc says that the answer is simple turn your company into a worker cooperative of course aoc never delineated a threshold by which an owner of a company becomes an evil bloodsucker we know that she would apply that label to a billionaire with 1 000 employees but how about a less successful entrepreneur with only 100 employees and 10m net worth how about a store owner with 10 employees and 1m in the bank is it only the scale that makes the billionaire immoral who decides when that line is crossed clearly aoc s experience taking classes at boston university and mixing drinks in new york provide her with that expertise aoc claims that she wants to democratically transform the u s economy so that we finally give power to the people but what she really wants to do is to take the power the people already have and give it to the government instead aoc does not realize that capitalism empowers workers to decide where they want to work where they want to live and how they spend their money the entire system is based on the process of getting consumers more of what they want for less money jeff bezos became a billionaire because he made shopping easier for hundreds of millions of people collectively the world has benefitted more than bezos from his innovations aoc wants to replace the free market with a command economy where decisions are made by coercion rather than choice she further described capitalism as a fleeting and outmoded economic model she argues that a worker collective in which the workers themselves own the companies they work for is a better model she does not seem to realize that such structures are perfectly legal in the u s and that business partnerships happen all the time however she does not grasp how those structures become unworkable at large scale as executive authority is critical to making the decisions that keep a company alive she also does not understand that the vast majority of workers do not want to be business owners that requires sacrifices and risks that they are unwilling to assume business owners don t just lie back on a couch as she imagines they often put in far more hours than their paid employees workers want the security of a steady paycheck something business owners forego they also don t want to risk their savings on a business venture that may fail workers at any business are free to quit and join together to form their own cooperatives but few are willing to take the chance aoc s solution is to let someone else take the chance make the sacrifices and do all the work and then if they succeed employees can use their votes and the power of the state to steal the business apart from the immorality of legalized theft history shows that once confiscated successful businesses are quickly run into the ground if aoc knew anything about history she would be familiar with the mass experiments in socialization that have come to ruin and misery in the recent past she is similarly blind to the enormous strides in living standards that the developing world has made in recent years by embracing capitalism and rejecting socialism and of course she fails to understand the history of her own country which owes its prosperity to the system she despises so that s what this has come to clash of the titans two people whose collective ignorance of economics is staggering to behold vie for the soul of the country lord help us unfortunately i think a worst case scenario may be the most likely one and it goes something like this disarray in the democrat party allows for the nomination of bernie sanders who loses to trump in the general election but then the danger arises trump and the republicans could not have taken credit more forcefully for the current economy when the current bubble pops during trump s second term there will be no way for them to avoid the blame the more we cling to the ridiculous idea that the current economy is booming because of trump the more we create the conditions for bernie sanders and aoc to make us the next venezuela unfortunately i think a worst case scenario may be the most likely one and it goes something like this disarray in the democrat party allows for the nomination of bernie sanders who loses to trump in the general election but then the danger arises trump and the republicans could not have taken credit more forcefully for the current economy when the current bubble pops during trump s second term there will be

this one thing will tell us when the bubble economy is burstingâ mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome back michael pento president and founder of pento portfolio strategies michael s a well known money manager market commentator and author of the book the coming bond market collapse how to survive the demise of the u s debt market he s been a regular guest with us over the years and we always love getting his fantastic insights michael thanks for the time again today and welcome back michael pento it s always a pleasure to be on with you thank you for inviting me back on the program mike gleason well we re having a hard time seeing a big move higher in metals prices until one of two things happen we ll start here the first would be a pickup and safe haven demand in our view there is too much investor complacency given the circumstances as has been the case for a while now equity market valuations are sky high now we ve got an election coming up and there is at least some chance our next president will be an avowed socialist this does not seem like the time for investors to be all in on risk trades but we suppose the only thing that really matters is the fed they are going to do whatever it takes to keep the party in the stock markets going but what are your thoughts are we likely to see the markets get a wakeup call anytime soon or is the fed likely to maintain complete control for the foreseeable future let s start there what a great question geez you hit me over the head with a a big anvil that s the 20 trillion question i mean can the market continue to defy gravity and it is defying gravity make no mistake about it if you look at the total market cap to gdp i look at the wilshire 5000 that doesn t have 5 000 stocks anymore i think it s like 3 500 but it s the widest measurement of stocks their market cap to the underlying economy that ratio is now 155 outside of march of 2000 when it was 145 or 148 around there it s never been near this the average ratio is 0 8 80 or 0 8 in the ratio so 155 1 55 above where the underlying supporting economy is i mean it s never been anywhere near this outside of that epic bubble in the nasdaq debacle where the nasdaq lost 80 of its value so that is where we are we have s p 500 year over year earnings are going to be negative margins are shrinking four quarters in a row of negative earnings per share growth and profit margins are shrinking you have the most overvalued market on the planet that the planet has ever seen and yet you wonder how much longer can it go well think about it the fed said they were going to raise rates in december of 2018 do you remember jerome powell said hey we raise rates and we re going to 3 5 on the fed funds rate and we re going to continue to drain our balance sheet we re going to continue quantitative tightening how long did that last mike they did a panic about face took rates down to 1 5 on the overnight borrowing costs for banks and they went back into qe they re doing 60 billion worth of money printing every month and they have a repo facility on top of that hundreds of billions of dollars trying to keep the money markets liquid so the fed s balance sheet was going to be drained back to normal it went from 400 trillion from 800 billion it was supposed to go back down to 800 billion or around there but guess what it s now increased by a half a trillion dollars since mid september so why is the market in a bubble why is the bubble getting bigger is because the federal reserve and the ecb and the bank of japan and the bank of india and the people s bank of china they re all in a frantic to keep this artificial bubble alive the only question i have is you asked me when is it going to end i ll tell you when it s going to end i can t tell you the date but i have a model that lets me know when to short the market and believe me when i tell you this crash is going to be something like we ve never seen before it could even dwarf the nasdaq debacle of 2000 from 2000 to 2002 i m looking for a bust in junk bond yields when junk bond yields implode because that s the nucleus of the crisis that is when you ll see me go net short the market in my portfolio in the inflation deflation and economic cycle model and when will the junk bond market implode whenever the u s enters a recession and or because it could be both and or inflation begins to run intractable that is when the market will implode that is when we ll have our reality check that is when hopefully we make a lot of money for our investors while the chaos runs rampant around the world sticking with the stock market theme here you just published a note talking about zombie companies what we re seeing in the stock markets is truly amazing you talk about defying gravity that s a great way of explaining it you observed in this piece that stocks are at an all time record highs but at the same time we have 40 nearly half of listed companies losing money and 97 of cfos in a survey published by deloitte say a slowdown is either already started or will start this year talk a bit about the total and complete disconnect between stock prices and reality well as you mentioned there s a record number of ipos that don t make any money so if you look at the trailing 12 month earnings 40 of listed u s shares don t make any money and if you go back it s not just 12 months if you go back three years 30 of all listed companies haven t made a nickel in the last three years and nobody seems to care this is the truth central banks on a global basis have the global economy and global markets in the icu unit and they are on the life support system of money printing i ll give you an example so let s look at the global debt scenario global debt is now 255 trillion mike that s up 50 since 2008 government debt is up 80 nearly 80 since 2008 the great credit crisis but you ask yourself what is the portuguese for example the portuguese 10 year note yields in this tsunami of new debt that s been issued you know back in 2000 as well the pigs remember the pig countries their debt greek debt the yield was 40 portugal and they were up at double digits italy greece ireland spain the portuguese 10 year note yield is 0 4 now on what planet does that make any sense at all i mean let s just do a thought experiment for a second mike let s just say that you knew that tomorrow the ecb the bank of japan and the fed were going to make announcement the announcement is that we will be ending qe and we will not buy when the assets mature we will not roll over any more of that debt corporate debt sovereign debt all that will be rolled off what do you think would happen to the stock market i think that it would be lock limit down circuit breakers would be hit for many consecutive days shutting down the exchange eventually that s what will happen that s the truth so central banks have no choice they re trapped they have no choice because the world was ending in 2008 instead of taking our medicine then and allowing for a deflationary depression to wipe out all the imbalances we levered up on everything we increased debt on the government side by 80 as i mentioned 255 trillion 330 of global gdp total debt we ve created a massive corporate bond bubble which i d love to touch on in a second unprecedented in the history of the planet and interest rates instead of being at five and a quarter percent like they were in the start of the crisis in 2008 they ve gone to zero around the world and in some cases negative and have stayed there for a decade or more and of course the consequences of that are massive intractable asset bubbles so they re trapped there s nothing they can do they re going to keep on printing money because they have no choice until the market decides that fiat currencies no longer deserve our trust that inflation will run intractable and then the junk bond market will implode and when that happens what are you going to say to the central bank you ve reached your asinine 2 inflation target even though we re already there that s not good enough for them the way they measure it they want it at three or four then they ll be happy of course by that time inflation will be running their double digits and then they re going to say okay we have intractable inflation and bond yields they re starting to go crazy they re spiking uncontrollably and the central banks are going to do what about that exactly are they going to print more money to combat an inflation problem are they going to then purchase every single fixed income asset in the globe corporate debt municipal bonds all sovereign debt it doesn t make any sense that s where we re headed so the problem here is you have to be on the vanguard very vigilant for a recession in the united states or for inflation to run intractable that is when this thing will end and it will end it will go supernova it s not going to end in a quiet whimper obviously the bigger the bubbles get the worse the bursting of that bubble if and when that does come and it s probably more a matter of when not if at this point how about metals michael gold had nearly a 20 gain last year lagged a bit but still was up about 15 do you envision 2020 being better or worse or what compared to 2019 in the metals well you had a big rise in the dollar about two years ago starting and then we see it had a nice run in 2019 but it is starting to top out and rollover when i look at gold i look at three factors i want to see rising debt as a percentage of gdp check i want to see a dollar that is rolling over or at least topping out check you re getting that and then of course the most important thing is falling real interest rates and usually these things are all part and parcel with a u s economy that is faltering right now i have 10 of the portfolio indoing very well i m happy with that but you want to add miners to that when you see all those three things i just mentioned taking place so the missing piece for me to get really heavy into miners and even increase my position into physical gold is i want to see the u s economy really take a dive to the south so i m going to need to see not only the manufacturing ism which is already plunging i want to see the service sector ism catch up with that i d like to see that the initial unemployment claims spike above the 200 000 level where they ve been for a long time and that is when i ll know and i have eight more components to my economic cycle model but those type of things will let me know when it s time to not only get net short the stock market in the portfolio but also to increase my exposure to gold and the miners well as we begin to wrap up here michael any final comments some other things that you re looking for that you think investors ought to be thinking about and watching for let s hear some of that before we close well i mean i just want to mention the middle class continues to be eviscerated i don t think the central banks of the world quite are on their side they re on the side of jpmorgan chairman and ceo jamie dimon et al so if you look at the combined assets and liabilities of the bottom 50 of americans for example it s now become negative 80 of americans now live paycheck to paycheck because they spend so much of their income on food clothing shelter energy but the richest among us get to enjoy multiple homes and big stock portfolios so that s a trench in gap is getting wider and wider and i just want to say a couple of things about corporate debt i mean business debt surged by 60 since 2008 triple b the tranche of investment grade debt that s on the lowest rung comprises 50 of all investment grade that yield is just above 3 it s never been this low in history the construction of corporate debt the record net debt as a percentage of ebitda so it s the worst composition of corporate debt the amount has surged the levels of debt has surged and the yields have never been lower so that s the nucleus of next crisis please keep in mind if you re not with me as an investor also you know you can become a podcast subscriber so i ll let you know about a lot of this stuff on a higher level but please keep a close eye on the investment grade and junk bond corporate debt market not only here in the united states but around the world that is what you should be myopically focused upon that ll be your warning sign that ll be the canary in the coal mine to let you know when it s time to sprint for the very narrow emergency exit well we ll leave it there for today thanks so much again michael we certainly appreciate the time and look forward to following these markets with you as we go through the year here in 2020 now before we

negatively impacted by temporary excess liquidity our ongoing low credit costs and well managed expenses enabled us to deliver increased profitability for the quarter on january 10 2020 the company

margin net interest income before provision for loan losses was 23 1 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 23 5 million for the third quarter of 2019 the 389 000 decrease was primarily attributable to a 10 2 million increase in average interest bearing liabilities partially offset by a 40 6 million increase in average earning assets and a 21 0 million increase in average noninterest bearing deposits net interest income was also impacted by a 12 basis point decrease in the net interest margin accretion of purchase discounts from prior acquisitions contributed 633 000 to net interest income in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 624 000 in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 net interest income before provision for loan losses decreased 2 5

liabilities a 22 4 million increase in average earning assets and a 22 8 million increase in average noninterest bearing deposits fhlb advances were paid off during the quarter the increases in

of 2019 a decrease from 3 59 in the third quarter of 2019 the decrease was primarily attributable to a 20 basis point decrease in the yield on average earning assets resulting from higher balances and lower yields on cash equivalents and short term securities and lower average loan yields partially offset by a 9 basis point decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities loan discount accretion contributed 10 basis points to the net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2019 consistent with the third quarter of 2019 noninterest income noninterest income was 5 8 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 an increase of 3 0 million from 2 8 million in the third quarter of 2019 the increase was driven by an increase in gain on loan sales of 2 9 million the company sold 61 3

combinations noninterest expense noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 13 5 million compared to 13 8 million for the third quarter of 2019 the 321 000 decrease was primarily

by lee kah whyesingapore jan 27 ani the wuhan virus now officially called 2019 ncov has been scaring a lot of people especially in east asia singapore which has close ties with china receives many visitors from the middle kingdom it is therefore not surprising that it was one of the first countries outside of china to report cases of the virus this has unnerved many residents in the city state who still vividly remember sars severe acute respiratory syndrome the last major coronavirus pandemic to sweep the country which resulted in 32 deaths between november 2002 and july 2003 according to the world health organisation who 8 098 people in 32 countries were affected by sars with 775 fatalities the wuhan virus is suspected to have first spread from snakes to humans in a seafood and wildlife market in wuhan the capital city of hubei province in late december last year as at the time of writing this article canada became the 16th country or territory to have reported cases countries affected so far include australia france japan nepal singapore south korea taiwan thailand united states vietnam china and hong kong so far over 2 000 people have been infected of which 56 have died the situation is expected to get worse with numbers rising before it gets better how fast normality can be restored will very much depend on how the world reacts the effectiveness of the control measures and how contagious the virus turns out to be already china has locked down more than 10 cities affected by the virus stopping all forms of public transportation in and out of cities with a high occurrence of the outbreak public places and tourist attractions like shanghai disneyland the great wall and the forbidden city have also been closed just over the weekend china banned domestic group tours and followed that up a day later by stopping international tourist groups from departing from monday january 27 this has come at the worst possible time of the year for chinese as it coincides with chinese new year where hundreds of millions of people make trips to be reunited with their families it is disappointing for those who have been forced to cancel trips but equally worrisome for others as some who have contracted the virus may already be in another city or country anything of this nature happening in the world s second largest economy will have a knock on effect on the global economy for numerous reasons here are some firstly while travel curbs remain in place travel demand from china will be affected the tourism sector in singapore thailand and hong kong are expected to be the most vulnerable china is india s 8th largest source of foreign visitors with 281 768 chinese nationals coming to india in 2018 according to the indian ministry of tourism international tourist on average spends usd 2 698 per trip and on that assumption chinese tourists contribute about usd 760 million to the indian economy consumer confidence could also be affected a dbs group research report issued on friday reported that the 2002 sars outbreak caused a sharp decline in travel tourism and commerce in china hong kong singapore and taiwan the loss of gdp for singapore was estimated to be 0 5 percent and that for hong kong 2 5 percent indian exports to china have been growing in recent years based on the indian department of commerce statistics china is among the top three countries india exports to indian exports to china grew 25 6 percent to usd 16 75 billion in fy2018 19 from a year ago it was projected to grow around 4 percent for fy2019 20 if the virus spread forces people to stay at home for a prolonged period in affected cities in china retail consumption and demand for raw material for manufacturing are expected to decline ani oil prices have been on the decline of late and with the coronavirus outbreak it is expected to continue this trend futures in new york are down 5 1 percent last week as travel restrictions continue to expand along with the expected fall in chinese consumption oil demand will follow this is tampered by a surprise decrease in us crude stockpiles brent crude posted the third weekly drop falling 2 2 percent to close at usd60 62 a barrel last friday january 24 it is down 7 6 percent for the week and almost 23 percent down from its 12 month high attained in april last year india which is a major importer of oil importing some 80 percent of its needs mostly stands to benefit from this lower oil prices mean lower inflation and a lower current account deficit it will also ease pressure on the rupee as less rupees will be required to buy the oil which is priced in us dollars in the international market analysts say that a usd10 fall in oil prices lowers the current account deficit by usd 9 2 billion on the other hand india is the world s sixth largest exporter of refined petroleum products and earns approximately usd 60 billion from this annually fall in demand and prices of oil will negatively impact this value as well as the value of petroleum by products the economic uncertainty resulting from the wuhan virus outbreak has been mirrored in the markets last friday msci s world index of stocks across the globe shed 0 45 percent weighed down by wall street as the benchmark sp 500 logged its biggest one day percentage drop since october 8 the sp 500 lost 30 07 points or 0 9 percent to close at 3 295 47 points the dow jones industrial average djia eased 356 09 points for the week or 1 2 percent to 28 989 73 while the nasdaq composite index dropped 72 12 points or 0 77 percent to close the week at 9 315 33 china shares are the worst hit with the shanghai composite index falling 3 3 percent to 2976 53 in a shortened trading week due to the chinese new year holidays whereas hong kong s hang seng index was down 4 2 percent at 27 949 64 india was less affected with the senex closing on friday at 41 613 19 down 0 6 percent from monday having tumbled 1 9 percent for the week to a low of 41 084 91 on wednesday safe haven assets like the japanese yen and gold saw increases while 10 year us treasury yields touched their lowest point in three months ani
mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome back michael pento president and founder of pento portfolio strategies michael s a well known money manager market commentator and author of the book the coming bond market collapse how to survive the demise of the u s debt market he s been a regular guest with us over the years and we always love getting his fantastic insights michael thanks for the time again today and welcome back michael pento it s always a pleasure to be on with you thank you for inviting me back on the program mike gleason well we re having a hard time seeing a big move higher in metals prices until one of two things happen we ll start here the first would be a pickup and safe haven demand in our view there is too much investor complacency given the circumstances as has been the case for a while now equity market valuations are sky high now we ve got an election coming up and there is at least some chance our next president will be an avowed socialist this does not seem like the time for investors to be all in on risk trades but we suppose the only thing that really matters is the fed they are going to do whatever it takes to keep the party in the stock markets going but what are your thoughts are we likely to see the markets get a wakeup call anytime soon or is the fed likely to maintain complete control for the foreseeable future let s start there michael pento what a great question geez you hit me over the head with a a big anvil that s the 20 trillion question i mean can the market continue to defy gravity and it is defying gravity make no mistake about it if you look at the total market cap to gdp i look at the wilshire 5000 that doesn t have 5 000 stocks anymore i think it s like 3 500 but it s the widest measurement of stocks their market cap to the underlying economy that ratio is now 155 outside of march of 2000 when it was 145 or 148 around there it s never been near this the average ratio is 0 8 80 or 0 8 in the ratio so 155 1 55 above where the underlying supporting economy is i mean it s never been anywhere near this outside of that epic bubble in the nasdaq debacle where the nasdaq lost 80 of its value so that is where we are we have s p 500 year over year earnings are going to be negative margins are shrinking four quarters in a row of negative earnings per share growth and profit margins are shrinking you have the most overvalued market on the planet that the planet has ever seen and yet you wonder how much longer can it go well think about it the fed said they were going to raise rates in december of 2018 do you remember jerome powell said hey we raise rates and we re going to 3 5 on the fed funds rate and we re going to continue to drain our balance sheet we re going to continue quantitative tightening how long did that last mike they did a panic about face took rates down to 1 5 on the overnight borrowing costs for banks and they went back into qe they re doing 60 billion worth of money printing every month and they have a repo facility on top of that hundreds of billions of dollars trying to keep the money markets liquid so the fed s balance sheet was going to be drained back to normal it went from 400 trillion from 800 billion it was supposed to go back down to 800 billion or around there but guess what it s now increased by a half a trillion dollars since mid september so why is the market in a bubble why is the bubble getting bigger is because the federal reserve and the ecb and the bank of japan and the bank of india and the people s bank of china they re all in a frantic to keep this artificial bubble alive the only question i have is you asked me when is it going to end i ll tell you when it s going to end i can t tell you the date but i have a model that lets me know when to short the market and believe me when i tell you this crash is going to be something like we ve never seen before it could even dwarf the nasdaq debacle of 2000 from 2000 to 2002 i m looking for a bust in junk bond yields when junk bond yields implode because that s the nucleus of the crisis that is when you ll see me go net short the market in my portfolio in the inflation deflation and economic cycle model and when will the junk bond market implode whenever the u s enters a recession and or because it could be both and or inflation begins to run intractable that is when the market will implode that is when we ll have our reality check that is when hopefully we make a lot of money for our investors while the chaos runs rampant around the world mike gleason sticking with the stock market theme here you just published a note talking about zombie companies what we re seeing in the stock markets is truly amazing you talk about defying gravity that s a great way of explaining it you observed in this piece that stocks are at an all time record highs but at the same time we have 40 nearly half of listed companies losing money and 97 of cfos in a survey published by deloitte say a slowdown is either already started or will start this year talk a bit about the total and complete disconnect between stock prices and reality michael pento well as you mentioned there s a record number of ipos that don t make any money so if you look at the trailing 12 month earnings 40 of listed u s shares don t make any money and if you go back it s not just 12 months if you go back three years 30 of all listed companies haven t made a nickel in the last three years and nobody seems to care this is the truth central banks on a global basis have the global economy and global markets in the icu unit and they are on the life support system of money printing i ll give you an example so let s look at the global debt scenario global debt is now 255 trillion mike that s up 50 since 2008 government debt is up 80 nearly 80 since 2008 the great credit crisis but you ask yourself what is the portuguese for example the portuguese 10 year note yields in this tsunami of new debt that s been issued you know back in 2000 as well the pigs remember the pig countries their debt greek debt the yield was 40 portugal and they were up at double digits italy greece ireland spain the portuguese 10 year note yield is 0 4 now on what planet does that make any sense at all i mean let s just do a thought experiment for a second mike let s just say that you knew that tomorrow the ecb the bank of japan and the fed were going to make announcement the announcement is that we will be ending qe and we will not buy when the assets mature we will not roll over any more of that debt corporate debt sovereign debt all that will be rolled off what do you think would happen to the stock market i think that it would be lock limit down circuit breakers would be hit for many consecutive days shutting down the exchange eventually that s what will happen that s the truth so central banks have no choice they re trapped they have no choice because the world was ending in 2008 instead of taking our medicine then and allowing for a deflationary depression to wipe out all the imbalances we levered up on everything we increased debt on the government side by 80 as i mentioned 255 trillion 330 of global gdp total debt we ve created a massive corporate bond bubble which i d love to touch on in a second unprecedented in the history of the planet and interest rates instead of being at five and a quarter percent like they were in the start of the crisis in 2008 they ve gone to zero around the world and in some cases negative and have stayed there for a decade or more and of course the consequences of that are massive intractable asset bubbles so they re trapped there s nothing they can do they re going to keep on printing money because they have no choice until the market decides that fiat currencies no longer deserve our trust that inflation will run intractable and then the junk bond market will implode and when that happens what are you going to say to the central bank you ve reached your asinine 2 inflation target even though we re already there that s not good enough for them the way they measure it they want it at three or four then they ll be happy of course by that time inflation will be running their double digits and then they re going to say okay we have intractable inflation and bond yields they re starting to go crazy they re spiking uncontrollably and the central banks are going to do what about that exactly are they going to print more money to combat an inflation problem are they going to then purchase every single fixed income asset in the globe corporate debt municipal bonds all sovereign debt it doesn t make any sense that s where we re headed so the problem here is you have to be on the vanguard very vigilant for a recession in the united states or for inflation to run intractable that is when this thing will end and it will end it will go supernova it s not going to end in a quiet whimper mike gleason obviously the bigger the bubbles get the worse the bursting of that bubble if and when that does come and it s probably more a matter of when not if at this point how about metals michael gold had nearly a 20 gain last year silver lagged a bit but still was up about 15 do you envision 2020 being better or worse or what compared to 2019 in the metals michael pento well you had a big rise in the dollar about two years ago starting and then we see it had a nice run in 2019 but it is starting to top out and rollover when i look at gold i look at three factors i want to see rising debt as a percentage of gdp check i want to see a dollar that is rolling over or at least topping out check you re getting that and then of course the most important thing is falling real interest rates and usually these things are all part and parcel with a u s economy that is faltering right now i have 10 of the portfolio in physical gold doing very well i m happy with that but you want to add miners to that when you see all those three things i just mentioned taking place so the missing piece for me to get really heavy into miners and even increase my position into physical gold is i want to see the u s economy really take a dive to the south so i m going to need to see not only the manufacturing ism which is already plunging i want to see the service sector ism catch up with that i d like to see that the initial unemployment claims spike above the 200 000 level where they ve been for a long time and that is when i ll know and i have eight more components to my economic cycle model but those type of things will let me know when it s time to not only get net short the stock market in the portfolio but also to increase my exposure to gold and the miners mike gleason well as we begin to wrap up here michael any final comments some other things that you re looking for that you think investors ought to be thinking about and watching for let s hear some of that before we close michael pento well i mean i just want to mention the middle class continues to be eviscerated i don t think the central banks of the world quite are on their side they re on the side of jpmorgan chairman and ceo jamie dimon et al so if you look at the combined assets and liabilities of the bottom 50 of americans for example it s now become negative 80 of americans now live paycheck to paycheck because they spend so much of their income on food clothing shelter energy but the richest among us get to enjoy multiple homes and big stock portfolios so that s a trench in gap is getting wider and wider and i just want to say a couple of things about corporate debt i mean business debt surged by 60 since 2008 triple b the tranche of investment grade debt that s on the lowest rung comprises 50 of all investment grade that yield is just above 3 it s never been this low in history the construction of corporate debt the record net debt as a percentage of ebitda so it s the worst composition of corporate debt the amount has surged the levels of debt has surged and the yields have never been lower so that s the nucleus of next crisis please keep in mind if you re not with me as an investor also you know you can become a podcast subscriber so i ll let you know about a lot of this stuff on a higher level but please keep a close eye on the investment grade and junk bond corporate debt market not only here in the united states but around the world that is what you should be myopically focused upon that ll be your warning sign that ll be the canary in the coal mine to let you know when it s time to sprint for the very narrow emergency exit mike gleason well we ll leave it there for today thanks so much again michael we certainly appreciate the time and look forward to following these markets with you as we go through the year here in 2020 now before we let you go please tell people a little bit more about pento portfolio strategies where they can get the podcast for instance and follow you more closely michael pento sure the podcast and my website is michael pento on that website you ll be able to avail yourself of a free trial five week trial of my podcast called the mid week reality check i give you a whole bunch of data that wall street isn t very proud of so they don t tell you about it but it s all real it s all there i give you some high level functionality on that analysis so you can understand when you should be long stocks and when you should be out of the market and of course if you have a 100 000 or around that you can join me in my firm and i ll take care of your money personally and my goal here is to participate in the bubble while it lasts but most importantly to protect and profit i will personally make sure and do the best i can to make sure you re not only protected when this crisis comes but you actually make money when the reality check comes and believe me for this great nation the sooner this occurs the better off it will be for all involved mike gleason yeah very well put michael s obviously got a fantastic handle on these markets and he s not one of these cheerleaders for the mainstream financial media that s i guess the reason why they ve blackballed him on places like cnbc but we re very happy to have him on our podcast here on a regular basis michael pento mike you probably have more viewers and listeners so i m happy to be with you

lausanne university and is a part time affiliate professor at the european university institute florence italy in which he participated in the wartime and post conflict in syria project wpcs and co coordinates now the syrian trajectories challenges and opportunities for peacebuilding project he is the author of hezbollah political economy of the party of god pluto press 2016 and syria after the uprisings the political economy of state resilience pluto press 2019 he created the blog syria freedom forever on december 20 2019 us president donald trump signed into law the caesar syria civilian protection act so named after the syrian military photographer codenamed caesar who defected in 2013 leaking tens of thousands of graphic images of detainees tortured to death in syrian government prisons the bill is the result of nearly four years of advocacy by the coalition for a democratic syria a us based organisation comprising americans for a free syria the syrian american council syrian christians for peace and the syrian emergency task force the syrian national coalition the syrian opposition s main representative body based in turkey has welcomed the bill and thanked the work of these syrian american organizations after the final vote many of these groups argued that the bill is a step in the direction for accountability us secretary of state mike pompeo meanwhile called the act an important step to promote accountability for the which has committed large scale atrocities in syria the text of the caesar bill itself states that it is the policy of the united states that diplomatic and coercive economic means should be utilized to compel the government of bashar al assad to halt its murderous attacks on the syrian people and to support a transition to a government in syria that respects the rule of law human rights and peaceful co existence with its neighbors one way in which the us proposes to do that is through secondary sanctions sanctioning foreign individuals and institutions doing business with syrian entities that are themselves already under us sanctions the caesar bill has since become the subject of debate among progressive and democratic syrian actors the key contentions of the bill are the nature and reach of the secondary sanctions the measures targeting syria s reconstruction efforts various sections of the economy and syria s allies russia and iran and the bill s potential impacts on the broader syrian population as such it s important to analyze the set of measures that make up the caesar bill deepening sanctions since 1979 syria has been under us sanctions since 1979 after it was placed on a us list of state sponsors of terrorism because of its continuing policies in supporting terrorism its former occupation of lebanon pursuing weapons of mass destruction and missile programs and undermining u s and international efforts to stabilize iraq according to the us department of state however the us would increasingly target individuals and entities syrian government officials and business sectors in the wake of the uprising that broke out in syria in march 2011 secondary sanctions on syria enabling the us president to sanction foreign individuals and institutions doing business with syrian entities already under us sanctions existed prior to the caesar bill but were rarely implemented even then the caesar bill is the most significant set of measures taken by washington against the syrian regime and its allies in syria the text of the bill allows for the punishment of any government or private entity seen to aid the regime as well as groups and entities linked to it or to contribute to the reconstruction of syria in addition to any assistance provided to the governments of russia and iran in syria the president can sanction any international company or individual that invests in syria s energy aviation construction or engineering sectors as well as anyone who lends funds to the regime section 102 the bill may also target the central bank of syria based on a decision following a report written by secretary of the treasury determining whether reasonable grounds exist for concluding that the central bank of syria is a financial institution of primary money laundering concern section 101 if syria s central bank is considered to play a significant role in money laundering then sanctions can then be imposed the caesar bill also allows the us president 90 days after the enactment of the bill to analyse the potential effectiveness risks and operational requirements of military and non military means to enhance the protection of civilians inside syria section 303 the bill ends by citing provisions allowing for the suspension of sanctions by the president section 401 if syria and russia airplanes stop bombing civilians if iranian syrian and russian forces as well as entities connected to them no longer restrict humanitarian access to besieged areas and the possibilities for civilians to leave freely if all political prisoners are released and the appropriate international human rights organisations are given full access to syria s prisons and detention facilities if the bombing of medical facilities schools residential areas and community gathering places including markets by syrian russian iranian forces as well as entities connected to them ceases if the possibility for the safe voluntary and dignified return of syrians displaced by the conflict is achieved and finally if there is accountability for perpetrators of war crimes in syria and justice for victims of war crimes committed by the assad regime including by participation in a credible and independent truth and reconciliation process measures targeting war profiteers the prospect for sanctions to be suspended provided basic human rights are respected in syria and a process of accountability started would of course resemble a great achievement for all sections of the syrian population especially for those who have suffered or continue to suffer at the hands of damascus and its allies hardly anyone can oppose such measures contrary to the claims repeated on an almost daily basis by syrian government officials sanctions and so called foreign conspirators are not the main reason for the socio economic problems facing the country similarly the sanctioning of any government or entity that significantly facilitates the maintenance or expansion of the government of syria s domestic production of natural gas petroleum or petroleum products and knowingly directly or indirectly provides significant construction or engineering services to the government of syria section 102 could potentially target russian and iranian private companies trying to benefit from the spoils of their military interventions by taking control of various syrian natural resources and national infrastructures through deepening neoliberal policies and public private partnerships ppps for example in december 2019 syria s parliament approved oil exploration contracts signed earlier in the year with two russian companies mercury llc and velada llc in three blocs including an oilfield in northeast syria and a gas field north of the capital damascus these russian companies should and could be among the entities sanctioned because they are contributing to expanding syria s oil production handing contracts to mercury llc and velada llc is in line with the syrian government s strategy toward friendly states that stood by syria according to syrian oil minister ali ghanem russia in particular is already trying to take advantage of this situation at the same time in the framework of syria s reconstruction process these sanctions could target significant foreign entities which could potentially invest and benefit in the syrian government s urban masterplans some emirati companies and officials have actually visited syria with this aim and showed an interest in investing in marota city a high end luxury masterplan in southwest damascus even so no foreign investments have gone to marota at the time of the writing contrary to the claims repeated on an almost daily basis by syrian government officials sanctions and so called foreign conspirators are not the main reason for the socio economic problems facing the country the regime is the main actor responsible for this situation firstly the syrian government s economic policies have massively impoverished large sectors of the syrian population especially since the early 2000s damascus used the war to deepen pre war neoliberal policies accompanied by austerity measures while reinforcing the authoritarian and patrimonial aspects of the regime albeit often with new networks and personalities the reconstruction process suggested by the regime in damascus will therefore reward the loyalty of its network of crony capitalists and foreign allies and to punish former rebel communities many of which were economically marginalized before the war began the current regime s policies for reconstruction are themselves based on policies that existed before the war whereby development is focused on luxurious real estate projects at the expense of impoverished populations and informal and popular neighborhoods in the current context these policies will only consolidate the regime s power and its domination over syrian society while also deepening pre existing political and socio economic grievances that ultimately fuelled the 2011 uprising moreover the vast damage and widespread destructions meted out against syria s cities and infrastructure is for the most part the result of damascus war machine with the assistance of its allies russia and iran as a reminder the uprising and ensuing international conflict has caused more than half a million deaths and led to the largest displacement crisis since the end of the second world war six million syrians are internally displaced while more than 5 6 million syrians are registered as refugees outside the country around 90 percent of the population live under the poverty line and more than 11 million people are in need of humanitarian aid inside the country the cost of reconstruction has been estimated in the range of 400 billion there are of course other foreign actors that contributed to the displacement of populations and destructions in the country particularly the military interventions of the us and turkey and to a lesser extent the armed opposition as well as hardline islamist and jihadist militias at the same time in the framework of syria s reconstruction process these sanctions could target significant foreign entities which could potentially invest and benefit in the syrian government s urban masterplans the effect of sanctions on ordinary syrians and the regime s power networks at the same time it s important to reiterate these realities about the syrian regime s role while also acknowledging the fact that the caesar bill could and probably will contribute to intensifying socio economic problems in syria its set of sanctions could participate in the deepening impoverishment of some sections of the population and represent a further obstacle to their future economic recovery for example syria lacks enough oil and gas for local consumption syria produces only 500 tons per day which represents only 40 percent of syria s domestic gas needs in periods of normal consumption while in winter peak consumption is closer to 1 300 tons daily it also faces difficulties in importing gas as a result of the sanctions according to the director of gas operations at the state hydrocarbons company ahmed hassoun the country needs around 136 000 and 140 000 barrels a day while according to statements in pro government daily al watan the ministry of oil can only secure 24 percent of the actual needs the country suffered a severe oil shortage between november 2018 and april 2019 notably as a result of the us decision in november 2018 to increase its pressure on syria by announcing that it would seek to impose sanctions against any party including shipping companies insurers vessel owners managers and operators involved in shipping oil to syria similarly an acute gas crisis has taken place in various areas of the country this situation also occurs amid continuing illegal black market monopolies and problems of distribution among governmental institutions in this perspective the possibility of sanctioning any entity supporting the expansion of national production of oil and gas and putting obstacles to import will most probably deepen these problems by creating even greater shortages of these resources and increasing its costs on the market this will in turn have dire consequences for ordinary syrians as well as sectors of the productive economy such as manufacturing and agriculture which are both very dependent on these resources by notably increasing production costs the deepening of broad general sanctions against syria through the caesar bill will therefore significantly affect the recovery of manufacturing and agricultural activities which are already affected by the current sanctions imposed by the us and eu similarly reconstruction efforts even though limited will most probably be hindered as the bill targets the construction sector and engineering services there are humanitarian exemptions that exist within the current sanctions but because of the lack of clarity risk adverse banks insurance and shipping companies and sellers of humanitarian goods have more often than not preferred not to engage with anyone or anything related to syria moreover overlapping sanction regimes have created so much doubt and uncertainty about how to comply with all the measures that banks exporters transport companies and insurance companies have nearly completely refused to conduct business in syria including with ngos providing assistance to syrian civilians the syrian regime s socioeconomic and political policies are likely to exacerbate social economic and regional inequalities throughout the country only deepening problems that were at the heart of the uprising that first started in march 2011 similarly products characterised as dual use also pose a problem for example nitrous oxide can be used for anaesthetics in hospitals but also to make bombs other dual use items include agricultural fertiliser and pesticides certain drilling tools pipes chlorine products used for water purification and sanitation but also chemical weapons construction equipment computers and it equipment and power generators the caesar bill will most probably reinforce these dynamics although exemptions section 302 also exist regarding ngos services in syria and the ability of humanitarian organizations to access financial services to help facilitate the safe and timely delivery of assistance to communities in need in syria however there is no clear process to put an end to this lack of clarity around the issue section 303 of the bill is also potentially problematic in that it allows washington to determine the potential means including military means to enhance the protection of civilians the potential interpretation of these methods is very broad threats of significant military intervention in syria by the us should however be tempered given that washington has never sought to actually overthrow the regime quite the opposite in fact and is already in the process of withdrawing its military forces from syria one more consideration to take into account is the fact that these sanctions supported by foreign entities as well as syrian organisations and activists working in exile will only increase the political gap with syrians inside syria who will ultimately be the ones suffering from the consequences of this new tranche of sanctions as mentioned previously the syrian regime s socioeconomic and political policies are likely to exacerbate social economic and regional inequalities throughout the country only deepening problems that were at the heart of the uprising that first started in march 2011 sadly most of the opposition failed even before 2011 to put forward a viable socioeconomic alternative to the regime s neoliberal policies and in fact the syrian national council and the syrian coalition proposed policies not dissimilar to those of the regime for the most part the exiled opposition too has failed to tackle the socioeconomic issues at the heart of the 2011 uprising while not proposing an inclusive political programs the support for the caesar bill from these pro opposition entities could strengthen their lack of legitimacy by worsening the socio economic status of large segments of the population back home conclusion the struggle for accountability the struggle for accountability against the assad regime should be an absolute priority for all progressives and democrats the recent prosecution in germany of two former syrian secret service officers who were charged with crimes against humanity is an important step forward towards justice for the atrocities committed by the regime efforts must continue throughout the world to ensure that the main perpetrators of state torture under assad and all war criminals in syria are brought to justice in this same matter the possibility of foreign funding for the reconstruction under the umbrella of the syrian state would threaten to reinforce the process of demographic engineering in former opposition held territories something that is mainly based on political and socio economic motives rather than sectarian ones as is often claimed this process which has already begun driven by campaigns of forced displacement and the evictions of original residents is being cemented by numerous laws enacted by the syrian government and president assad they considerably discourage and obstruct refugees from returning to syria in this perspective the caesar bill aims to create obstacles in the way of these dynamics which is positive similarly it aims at preventing russia and iran from benefiting from the spoils of war by taking control of national resources and infrastructure that said there are questions that need to be raised about effectiveness of the caesar bill in reaching these objectives as well as the willingness of the us to actually achieve accountability and respect for human rights in syria at the same time that it represents the main guardian of neoliberal militarist and authoritarian order including through its support for dictatorial regimes in the region indeed the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2020 to which the caesar bill was added before passing represents an attempted continuation of us military dominance additionally while the caesar bill allows the us president to take action and sanction specific institutions and individuals he is not compelled to do so in fact there are no obligations whatsoever more generally this bill places too much power in the hands of the us executive branch in other words the president moreover measures have to be taken in the framework of the caesar bill and sanctions more generally to truly alleviate the risk of sanctions harming ordinary syrians productive sectors of the economy as well as any possible reconstruction efforts not based on achieving the regime s objectives at the same time the vote on the caesar bill at the end of december last year has not halted ongoing pro government offensives by syria and russia against idlib province nor has it pushed damascus towards any kind of compromise with its political opponents on a more historical note sanctions have rarely had the expected results or achieved any change in a state s behaviour certain voices have pointed to the successful example of south africa in 1986 a series of punitive economic measures and an oil embargo were imposed by the un in an attempt to end the racist apartheid regime then in 1991 this regime was abolished but this official narrative is rather far from the truth firstly the sanctions were largely circumvented by the apartheid regime of south africa by its close connections with western states which resisted for a long time before imposing sanctions the main reason for the end of this regime was above all significant resistance and popular mobilization from people on the group led by the domestic insurgency of the african national congress and its allies within the country and the vast campaigns of solidarity throughout the word to boycott the apartheid regime for these reasons the most important challenge is for syrian democrats and progressives to regain autonomy from foreign actors by building their own networks and offering an inclusive democratic project with clear socio economic alternatives that will benefit ordinary syrians that could appeal to large sectors of society within the country refugees and the diaspora the absence of a structured and independent democratic and inclusive syrian political opposition which appealed to ordinary syrians and social actors such as independent trade unions made it difficult for various sectors of the population to unite and challenge the regime on a national scale the latest demonstrations in sweida to protest against the economic situation and difficult living conditions an often repeated criticism in many other areas of the country and the continued protests and clashes in daraa against the regime s forces demonstrate this situation regional protests without much coordination between them the author would like to thank gilbert achcar jihad yazigi and rohan advani for their comments and help in writing this article being on a us list of state sponsors of terrorism does not necessarily mean that the country stops trading with other states russia s tempbank company was for instance blacklisted in 2014 for providing millions of dollars to the central bank of syria and to sytrol both of which are under us sanctions for more information see there are no un sanctions on syria itself russian and chinese vetoes have prevented that sanctions have however been imposed unilaterally by many states opposed to the syrian regime including the united states and the 28 member states of the european union as well as japan canada australia switzerland norway and turkey the 22 countries of the league of arab states have also sanctioned syria poor suburban neighborhoods expanded considerably in the 2000s while urban real estate speculation unleashed by the influx of gulf capital together with an end to rent controls drove the cost of housing beyond the means of large sectors of the middle class this pushed many syrians into marginal areas of cities where they were often forced to live in informal housing this situation led to a housing crisis a shortfall of around 1 5 million formal homes in 2007 with sections of the population either becoming homeless or living in informal areas the regime s solution to the crisis was to outsource the problem to the private sector as it did increasingly with the economy as a whole but the private sector invested in luxury housing catering for rich syrians within the country and the diaspora foreigners and tourists investments in luxury tourist and residential developments attracted around 20 billion in investments from the beginning of the 2000s to mid 2007 while it was estimated that it would have cost some 24 billion to adequately upgrade all the country s informal housing see for example in daraa and aleppo

by lee kah whyesingapore jan 27 ani the wuhan virus now officially called 2019 ncov has been scaring a lot of people especially in east asia singapore which has close ties with china receives many visitors from the middle kingdom it is therefore not surprising that it was one of the first countries outside of china to report cases of the virus this has unnerved many residents in the city state who still vividly remember sars severe acute respiratory syndrome the last major coronavirus pandemic to sweep the country which resulted in 32 deaths between november 2002 and july 2003 according to the world health organisation who 8 098 people in 32 countries were affected by sars with 775 fatalities the wuhan virus is suspected to have first spread from snakes to humans in a seafood and wildlife market in wuhan the capital city of hubei province in late december last year as at the time of writing this article canada became the 16th country or territory to have reported cases countries affected so far include australia france japan nepal singapore south korea taiwan thailand united states vietnam china and hong kong so far over 2 000 people have been infected of which 56 have died the situation is expected to get worse with numbers rising before it gets better how fast normality can be restored will very much depend on how the world reacts the effectiveness of the control measures and how contagious the virus turns out to be already china has locked down more than 10 cities affected by the virus stopping all forms of public transportation in and out of cities with a high occurrence of the outbreak public places and tourist attractions like shanghai disneyland the great wall and the forbidden city have also been closed just over the weekend china banned domestic group tours and followed that up a day later by stopping international tourist groups from departing from monday january 27 this has come at the worst possible time of the year for chinese as it coincides with chinese new year where hundreds of millions of people make trips to be reunited with their families it is disappointing for those who have been forced to cancel trips but equally worrisome for others as some who have contracted the virus may already be in another city or country anything of this nature happening in the world s second largest economy will have a knock on effect on the global economy for numerous reasons here are some firstly while travel curbs remain in place travel demand from china will be affected the tourism sector in singapore thailand and hong kong are expected to be the most vulnerable china is india s 8th largest source of foreign visitors with 281 768 chinese nationals coming to india in 2018 according to the indian ministry of tourism international tourist on average spends usd 2 698 per trip and on that assumption chinese tourists contribute about usd 760 million to the indian economy consumer confidence could also be affected a dbs group research report issued on friday reported that the 2002 sars outbreak caused a sharp decline in travel tourism and commerce in china hong kong singapore and taiwan the loss of gdp for singapore was estimated to be 0 5 percent and that for hong kong 2 5 percent indian exports to china have been growing in recent years based on the indian department of commerce statistics china is among the top three countries india exports to indian exports to china grew 25 6 percent to usd 16 75 billion in fy2018 19 from a year ago it was projected to grow around 4 percent for fy2019 20 if the virus spread forces people to stay at home for a prolonged period in affected cities in china retail consumption and demand for raw material for manufacturing are expected to decline ani oil prices have been on the decline of late and with the coronavirus outbreak it is expected to continue this trend futures in new york are down 5 1 percent last week as travel restrictions continue to expand along with the expected fall in chinese consumption oil demand will follow this is tampered by a surprise decrease in us crude stockpiles brent crude posted the third weekly drop falling 2 2 percent to close at usd60 62 a barrel last friday january 24 it is down 7 6 percent for the week and almost 23 percent down from its 12 month high attained in april last year india which is a major importer of oil importing some 80 percent of its needs mostly stands to benefit from this lower oil prices mean lower inflation and a lower current account deficit it will also ease pressure on the rupee as less rupees will be required to buy the oil which is priced in us dollars in the international market analysts say that a usd10 fall in oil prices lowers the current account deficit by usd 9 2 billion on the other hand india is the world s sixth largest exporter of refined petroleum products and earns approximately usd 60 billion from this annually fall in demand and prices of oil will negatively impact this value as well as the value of petroleum by products the economic uncertainty resulting from the wuhan virus outbreak has been mirrored in the markets last friday msci s world

by davide barbuscia dubai jan 27 reuters the international monetary fund estimates that kuwait s financing needs will amount to some 180 billion over the next six years given the gulf state s modest fiscal measures and expectations of lower oil prices kuwait said earlier this month it expects a budget deficit of 9 2 billion dinars 30 31 billion in the fiscal year starting on april 1 a deficit increase of 19 compared to the previous year subdued oil prices and output are weighing on near term growth prospects and external and fiscal balances the washington based international crisis lender said in a statement describing its preliminary findings at the end of an official visit to the country the recent run up in spending has worsened the fiscal position and eroded liquid buffers without a course correction the fiscal and financing challenges would intensify and the window of opportunity to proceed at a measured pace would narrow a major oil exporter kuwait was among the most resilient economies in the region when oil prices sank in 2014 2015 thanks to low debt and large financial assets but it has not tapped global debt markets since its debut 8 billion debt sale in 2017 because parliament has yet to pass a law that would allow it to raise its debt ceiling and to issue debt with longer maturities that has raised concerns among analysts that its wealth fund general reserve fund grf managed by the kuwait investment authority kia might be depleted over the next few years to cover kuwait s deficits the imf expects kuwait s consolidated fiscal balance to turn from a 5 5 of gross domestic product surplus in 2019 to a deficit of a similar magnitude in 2025 which would lead to financing needs of some 180 billion over the next six years it estimated kia s assets surpassed 410 of gdp by the end of last year as one of its funds continued to receive mandatory transfers from the government and created strong returns on its assets however the continued drawdown from the grf for fiscal financing reduced its estimated total and liquid balances to 56 and 24 percent of gdp by june 2019 the imf said adding it expected grf s readily available assets to be exhausted in less than two years without recourse to other funding sources borrowing would help reduce drawdowns from the grf allowing it to last longer it said assuming no legal restriction on borrowing to finance the remaining gap government debt would have to rise to over 70 percent of gdp in 2025 from 15 percent in 2019 borrowing activities that the fund said would be unprecedented growth in kuwait s non oil sector had strengthened in 2019 but lower oil prices and output cuts weighed on its oil sector resulting in overall economic growth of about 0 7 in 2019 down from a 1 2 growth in 2018 said the fund it expects kuwait s growth to stabilise to an annual rate of 2 7 from 2021 to 2025 after growth of 1 5 this year basing its estimates on the assumption that oil prices would decline from 62 per barrel in 2019 to about 56 per barrel in 2023 kuwait s 2020 2021 budget assumes an oil price of 55 a barrel 1 0 3035 kuwaiti dinars reporting by davide barbuscia editing by kim coghill and catherine evans davide barbuscia thomsonreuters com 971522604297 reuters messaging davide barbuscia reuters com reuters net the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc
