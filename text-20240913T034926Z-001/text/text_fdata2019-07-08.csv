news national by staff reporter government says multi currency system created fiscal and monetary challenges stunting economic growth and making most industries in zimbabwe uncompetitive treasury permanent secretary george guvamatanga said there is no way zimbabwe s economy could have grown substantially using strong currencies such as the united states us dollar finance and economic development minister prof mthuli ncube said the use of the multi currency system since 2009 stifled growth as the country could not utilise monetary instruments to stimulate economic activity the country has been using the multi currency monetary system for the past 10 years dominated by the us and the south african rand among the british pound euro chinese yuan and botswana pula while acknowledging that in its early stages the multicurrency system brought some stability in terms of taming inflation and restoring value for money the model has not worked well for the country the multi currency system stifled growth as the country could not utilise monetary instruments to influence economic activity and gradually lost competitiveness compared to major trading partners said prof ncube in a latest update explaining the recent re introduction of the zimbabwean dollar the situation was worsened by recurrent unfavourable weather conditions low commodity prices and high appetite for importing this resulted in declining foreign currency inflows liquidity and cash shortages as well as confidence challenges prof ncube said the introduction of bond notes in 2016 as an export incentive was a pro active measure to boost exports and substitute imports he noted that the initiative was however marred by fiscal indiscipline this resulted in widening fiscal deficit which were financed by treasury and recourse to the central bank s overdraft window combined with widening trade deficit these exerted pressure on the foreign exchange market and resulted in the resurgence of the parallel market whose exchange rates became the anchor of pricing of goods and services in the economy and the attending spiral inflation the situation was untenable said prof ncube hence in october 2018 president mnangagwa s government introduced the transitional stabilisation programme tsp which sought to address major policy reform areas required for stabilisation rebuilding and transforming the economy to an upper middle income status by 2030 one of the key pillars of the tsp being currency reform said the minister he said the tough policy propositions and their shock impact since october last year were meant to set the tone for implementing currency reforms necessary for supporting fiscal consolidation and growth promotion in october 2018 government started by separating fca and rtgs accounts to encourage exports diaspora remittances banking of foreign currency and eliminate dilution effect of rtgs balances on nostro fcas this was followed by differential pricing of fuel in january 2019 and finally liberalisation of the country s foreign currency market through discarding the fixed 1 1 exchange rate peg between the us and the bond note in february 2019 concurrently a new currency called the rtgs dollar made up of electronic balances in banks and mobile platforms bond notes and coins was introduced through si 33 of 2019 the intention was to strip the us dollar as a medium of exchange and serve more as a reserve currency simultaneously the rtgs dollar was expected to assume all other functions of a domestic currency said prof ncube who acknowledged widespread criticism over the policy shift and the attendant devaluation of the local unit of currency to as low as us 1 rtgs 13 on the parallel market the devaluation has been accompanied by rampant inflation in rtgs terms with many goods and services now being effectively pegged to parallel market rates as at may month on month inflation stood at 12 54 percent and year on year inflation at 97 85 percent at the same time prices in us dollar terms remained flat or even decreased prof ncube said this situation led to shortages of forex and constrained production amid rampant speculative tendencies and capital flight these developments suggested that the monetary arrangements were not sustainable and self dollarisation was gaining momentum however a scenario of formal re dollarisation was undesirable he said minister ncube said in response to fiscal constraints pressure to increase salaries loss of competitiveness liquidity crisis loss of monetary instruments and vulnerability to sanctions government had to make bold decisions there was therefore an urgent need for zimbabwe to introduce its own fully fledged currency and to formally end the multi currency regime through the introduction of si 142 of 2019 which was further operationalised by the exchange control directive said prof ncube the directive was issued in terms of section 35 1 of the exchange control regulations statutory instrument 109 of 1996 under the new framework all domestic transactions are now settled in zimbabwe dollars the sole legal tender in zimbabwe that is represented by bond notes and coins and electronic currency that is rtgs dollars this effectively means the use of foreign currency to settle domestic transactions has been removed and the basket of multi currencies that is usd gbp zar eur bwp jpy cny au and indian rupee shall only be used to settle international payments or those services exempt from this requirement as per section 3 of statutory instrument 142 of 2019 the operation of nostro fcas however remains in place for purposes of receiving offshore funds and to facilitate foreign payments the funds in nostro fcas will retain their foreign currency status and shall continue to be utilised for the settlement of international transactions said the minister individuals shall continue to hold us dollars in their nostro fca as well as withdraw cash up to a daily limit of us 1 000 as was previously the case said minister ncube meanwhile government through the rbz has assumed all legacy debts arising from the changeover from the 1 1 exchange rate between rtgs and us dollar as announced through exchange control directive ru28 of february 2019 all rtgs dollars representing the legacy debt shall be moved from commercial banks to the rbz which will reduce the amount of zimbabwe dollars in circulation by about 1 2 billion thus strengthening the value of the zimbabwean dollar this is further going to be supported by the review of the overnight accommodation window which has been pegged at 50 percent per annum said prof ncube

with brent d griffiths the ticker the sunday headline in the washington post aided by a strong economy trump approval rises but a majority also see him as unpresidential appeared to confirm what a pair of top republican pollsters told me last week gop pollsters david winston and whit ayres said voter satisfaction with the economy s strength provided trump an opportunity to lift his overall approval rating which has remained historically low the new post abc news survey suggest that s already happening in their write up of the results the post s dan balz and emily guskin note that trump s 44 percent approval rating in the survey is the highest of his presidency and they credit that to voter perceptions that the president has effectively led on the economy yet economists continue to find ample evidence that the longest u s economic expansion on record still isn t reaching significant portions of the population including demographics that trump relied on to stitch together his winning coalition in 2016 the uneven recovery that phenomenon has produced should worry trump s reelection campaign even if his top line polling numbers continue improving advertisement the economy is the lone issue in the survey where trump enjoys positive numbers with 51 percent saying they approve of the way he has dealt with issues balz and guskin write a smaller 42 percent disapprove of his handling of it down slightly from 46 percent last october asked how much credit trump deserves for the state of the economy 47 percent say a great deal or a good amount while 48 percent say he deserves only some or hardly any that represents a significant improvement for trump since january 2018 when 38 percent of respondents gave him credit for the economy while 56 percent said he deserved little or none and voters of both parties agree the economy will be key to their decisions in the presidential election next year with 82 percent rating it either the most important issue or very important to their votes but that number is in line with historical averages and it s not clear it will benefit the president with all voters as my colleague heather long wrote last week the recovery has improved the personal financial situations of about 60 percent of americans while 40 percent have seen no benefit according to matthew mish head of credit strategy at the investment bank ubs advertisement wish described a two tier recovery in which the lower tier has seen paltry or volatile wage growth rising expenses for housing health care and education and increased levels of personal debt heather writes they tend not to own homes or many stocks many are a slight setback away from serious trouble the average american family has yet to recover fully from the 2008 financial crisis the federal reserve found leaving half the nation with a diminished cushion to handle surprise expenses or the next downturn heather writes the bottom half has less wealth today after adjusting for inflation than it did in 1989 according to fed data through march of this year the brookings institution found an even starker wealth divide per the left leaning think tank the top one percent holds more wealth than the middle class over 25 trillion as of 2016 versus 18 trillion held by the middle class that s a new state of affairs before 2010 the middle class owned more wealth the top one percent the organization noted last month since 1995 the share of wealth held by the middle class has steadily declined while the top one percent s share has steadily increased advertisement the june jobs report released friday showed job growth bounced back after a lackluster may employers beat expectations by adding 224 000 jobs last month but wage growth continues to lag wages climbed 3 1 percent from a year earlier a pace that hasn t improved in months and per heather the ubs survey found four in 10 americans say they still struggle to pay their bills trump s marginally improved numbers notwithstanding that represents a significant portion of the population he will need to convince to stick with him next year market movers trump bashing powell again may be grooming his successor bloomberg s josh wingrove and saleha mohsin trump wrapped up the weekend as he started it jawboning the federal reserve to lower interest rates at a time when he may be sizing up his two

to return to washington after a weekend at his nearby golf club fed policy is putting the u s at a disadvantage versus europe and suppressing gains in the stock market trump said advertisement sunday s comments came after trump said on friday that the central bank doesn t have a clue and was our most difficult problem the fresh criticism is consistent with ideas that the president is laying the groundwork to replace powell when the chairman s term is up in 2022 assuming trump is re elected or will attempt to do so earlier if the fed doesn t bend quickly enough to his will powell heads to the hill this week the fed chair is set to testify before the house financial services committee on wednesday and the senate banking committee on thursday on top of questions about the state of his relationship with trump capalpha s ian katz writes in a sunday note that powell could get questions about how and when the volcker rule will be fixed we expect that revisions to last year s so called

democratic lawmakers for tougher labor and environmental provisions a senior mexican official said reuters s frank jack daniel reports advertisement seade said as the deal now stands the united states could start a formal trade dispute if mexico was exporting a product made under labor conditions it considered unfair and contrary to the rules in the pact however he said a loophole meant mexico could theoretically block a dispute panel from being created trump tariffs are hurting older steel mills bloomberg s matthew townsend and joe deaux exuberance over the levies dramatically boosted u s output just as the global economy was cooling undercutting demand that dropped prices creating a stark divide between companies like nucor corp that use cheaper to run electric arc furnaces to recycle

the heyday of central bank independence now lies behind us pacific investment management co s joachim fels declared saturday he is not alone among economists in delivering the last rites after turkish president recep tayyip erdogan fired his country s top monetary policy maker and president donald trump continued to attack federal reserve chairman jerome powell for raising interest rates too high even the european central bank which is generally viewed as the institution most protected from politics felt a bit of heat over the weekend as the head of germany s ruling christian democratic party said incoming ecb chief christine lagarde should shift monetary policy to make it comply with the bank s inflation targeting mandate like it or not get used to the new normal of dependent central banks perpetually low interest rates and quantitative easing fels pimco s global economic adviser said in a report here are links to our quicktake on why monetary institutions are becoming political punching bags and a recent analysis by bloomberg economics what follows is a country by country guide u s powell has endured increasingly harsh criticism from donald trump the first american president in almost three decades to lash out publicly at the fed in remarks that seem aimed at setting the fed up to take the blame if the economy falters as he seeks re election trump has called on the central bank to slash interest rates and resume bond purchases on sunday trump said if the fed knew what it was doing it would cut its benchmark rate last week he nominated economists judy shelton and christopher waller to seats on the fed s board of governors both are thought likely to back lower interest rates and a person familiar with the matter said either may be in line for the fed s top job at some point breaking a long standing norm of international economic diplomacy trump also urged the fed to join his trade war with china calling on it to match steps he said beijing will take to offset the hardship caused by tariffs he s also said china and europe are pushing their currencies lower and the fed should do more u s central bankers say they ignore political considerations and focus on their mandate for stable prices and maximum employment turkey turkish markets have been rattled repeatedly by president erdogan s forceful opinions on monetary policy which culminated in the firing saturday of murat cetinkaya whose four year term was due to end in 2020 cetinkaya had overseen a pause in interest rates that lasted for more than nine months despite high inflation but erdogan who has called himself an enemy of interest rates told lawmakers from his ruling party that politicians and bureaucrats all need to get behind his conviction that higher rates cause inflation deputy governor murat uysal was named as a replacement but the lira dropped u k boe governor mark carney has long faced accusations of bias from pro brexit politicians who say he is overly negative about britain s future outside the european union lawmaker jacob rees mogg dubbed him the high priest of project fear carney denies the charge but was assailed again last year after the boe published scenarios showing that a no deal brexit could unleash a savage recession and a collapse in the pound euro area at the ecb outgoing president mario draghi recently opened up about his concerns on attacks on independence his own institution is relatively well safeguarded by an eu treaty that is hard to change but he s been lambasted in countries such as germany and the netherlands over the impact of his ultra loose monetary policy on savers he s also been criticized in his home country italy deputy premier luigi di maio said he s poisoning the climate by weighing into the debate about the nation s budget the appointment of christine lagarde as draghi s successor has also prompted some criticism given she was a former finance minister and not a trained economist although her helming of the international monetary fund is viewed as a plus but annegret kramp karrenbauer who took over as cdu party chief from angela merkel last december said last week that inflation is well below the ecb s target a spokesman later clarified her remarks to say she expects lagarde to cautiously adjust policy as the ecb strives to achieve price stability so that it can move away from ultra low interest rates italy bank of italy governor ignazio visco who overcame a bruising public debate in 2017 to win a second term saw his number two salvatore rossi leave his job after the ruling populist coalition demanded change at the top of the institution slovenia bostjan jazbec resigned as slovenian central bank governor last year after coming under pressure for his role in a 2013 bank bailout

vasle has slammed a draft law that could leave the central bank liable for investor losses from the bailout saying it would break the rules on monetary financing latvia latvian governor ilmars rimsevics is the target of a corruption investigation that saw him briefly detained he s back at work after the european court of justice overruled his suspension in a case that pitted the ecb against latvian law enforcement rimsevics says the accusations against him are orchestrated by well connected banks angered by his anti money laundering efforts lithuania the lithuanian central bank governor vitas vasiliauskas recently survived a parliamentary resolution that called on him to quit or be dismissed for allegedly failing to cooperate adequately with a parliamentary probe into the 2008 crisis the resolution failed despite being backed by the prime minister greece yannis stournaras the governor of the bank of greece has been targeted several times for alleged wrongdoing including a case involving swiss drugmaker novartis ag which he says was concocted to force him out and accounts of inaccuracies in his property declarations the latest scandal concerns a leaked phone conversation between the governor and alternate health minister pavlos polakis who demanded the governor probe loans to opposition politicians parties and media sweden the riksbank the world s oldest central bank has been criticized as its benchmark rate remains stuck far below zero and the krona has weakened parliament is reviewing the inflation targeting regime and some politicians including the finance minister argue that policy makers should abandon their strict focus on price stability and look at the broader economy any changes in the mandate will probably be muted given there s a large consensus that the almost three decade old regime overall has served sweden well the review was also told not to come back with recommendations for a so called dual mandate but there s wiggle room within the current framework to put more emphasis on growth and the labor market switzerland the swiss national bank is frequently in the cross hairs partly because its balance sheet has ballooned to 120 of economic output lawmakers regularly suggest its reserves be turned into a sovereign wealth fund and national plebiscites have unsuccessfully targeted its gold holdings and even questioned the fundamentals of banking south africa since an attempt by south africa s anti graft ombudsman two years ago to have the reserve bank s mandate altered governor lesetja kganyago rarely lets a speech or interview go by without making the case for central bank independence he successfully fought off attempts to change the inflation targeting remit but the institution faces at least two more possible threats to its independence this year first the ruling african national congress may move forward on a plan to nationalize the reserve bank one of only a handful of central banks in the world still owned by private shareholders while the shareholders have no say in policy kganyago has warned that the move could mask another attack on independence president cyril ramaphosa also has to decide who he wants to head the reserve bank kganyago s first term runs out in november and deputy governor daniel mminele s second five year term ends next month both can be reappointed and kganyago has said he would be willing to stay with economic growth below 2 since 2013 there may be pressure on ramaphosa to consider central bank leaders who will take a less harsh stance on inflation and help to boost output india india s new central bank governor shaktikanta das is seen as someone more amenable to the government s requests on relaxing tough regulations imposed on struggling banks and easing monetary policy to boost growth he succeeded urjit patel who resigned after a public row with prime minister narendra modi s government and has already overseen rate cuts of 50 basis points this year das has also taken a more conciliatory approach toward the banking sector and businesses many of which are struggling to repay loans patel wanted to clean up the banking system and repeatedly clashed with the government about relaxing lending rules for some weak state run banks das has eased those curbs in recent months the central bank then took another hit when deputy governor viral acharya one of its most outspoken officials unexpectedly announced in june that he was standing down mexico while president andres manuel lopez obrador has stayed away from criticizing banxico despite interest rates at a 10 year high one of his appointees gerardo esquivel took issue with a recent central bank statement calling it too hawkish by the end of next year lopez obrador s appointees will hold a majority of banxico s board and the bank may lean toward helping the president reach his growth goals argentina argentina s bid to create an independent central bank something the imf wants as part of its loan agreement with the country is mired in political uncertainty as the nation faces a presidential election in october president mauricio macri sent a bill to congress in march but its prospects aren t clear amid the tight electoral race and argentina s recession he proposed last month that all election candidates sign a 10 point plan that includes a commitment to an independent central bank so far none of macri s potential opponents has signed on or signaled they would brazil one monetary institution may actually get a break from politics brazil s central bank has enjoyed de facto autonomy on interest rates but no legal guarantees protecting its board against political meddling that may change if congress approves president jair bolsonaro s bill granting formal autonomy to the institution according to the proposal expected to be voted on this year the central bank chief could no longer be fired by the president and board members would have four year terms approved by the senate pakistan the central bank has been at the forefront of dealing with the nation s budget deficit blowout by the most aggressive rate hikes and currency devaluation in asia its independence has

december 12 movement sanctions imposed on zimbabwe adversely affected the vulnerable groups and the economy in general photo youtube december 12 movement decries devastating effects of sanctions on zimbabwe imposed after former president robert mugabe s 2000 land reforms zimbabwe s land reform programme of 2000 led the united states of america to impose illegal sanctions under the so called zimbabwe democracy and economic recovery act 2001 zidera which is subject to annual extensions the latest being in january 2019 supplementing the usa legislative sanctions of zidera are executive sanctions executive order 13288 of march 2003 also renewable on a similar yearly basis the european union also introduced its own sanctions in february 2002 while the eu lifted much of its sanctions in 2014 political sanctions against former president r g mugabe mrs grace mugabe and zimbabwe defence industries are still in place the eu s de escalation posture unlike the usa s position is positive in that it acknowledges the second republic s re engagement policy effects of sanctions on the zimabwean economy the sanctions have had a devastating effect on the economy zimbabwe s balance of payments position has deteriorated significantly since the introduction of sanctions zimbabwe s access to international credit markets was blocked effectively after the enactment of zidera the country has been forced to virtually operate on hand to mouth and there has been a significant buildup of external debt arrears this unfavorable development has worsened the country s creditworthiness as the country s international financial risk profile escalated this subsequently led to the drying up of traditional sources of external finance from the international financial institutions ifis the effect of the arrears situation has resulted in zimbabwean companies finding it extremely difficult to access offshore lending thus crippling their operations where the private sectors manage to secure offshore financing it is usually at punitive and exorbitant interest rates consequently zimbabwean importers are asked to pay cash upfront resulting in a significant squeeze on private sector cash flows this has led to bigger challenges including under capacity utilization due to declining external budgetary support zimbabwe s budget deficit has largely been financed from domestic borrowing which has triggered high inflation sustained decline in long term capital the sustained decline in long term capital inflows has had ripple effects on the country s employment levels and its ability to provide basic goods and services to its people ultimately leading to a decline in the standards of living this is has led zimbabwe to be a net importer of virtually everything especially from the neighboring including from south africa a dependence syndrome detrimental to the country s industrialization this has resulted in large scale emigration especially of skilled labour thus further straining the economy s capacity to hasten the pace of economic turnaround and development impact on the financial sector due to the decline in balance of payments bop support zimbabwe s bop position has been deteriorating significantly since the imposition of sanctions this unfavorable development was exacerbated by combined effects of poor export performance high import demand and reduced capital inflows on the back of adverse publicity the withdrawal of the multilateral financial institutions from providing bop to zimbabwe had a ripple effect as some other bilateral creditors and donors also followed suit by either scaling down or suspending disbursements on existing loans for both government and parastatal loans regional cooperation sanctions are affecting the smooth running of regional groupings such as sadc south african development community and comesa common market for eastern and southern africa the european union through the european development fund edf compensates comesa member states for revenue losses suffered under the tariff phase down exercise under specific conditions which take into account macroeconomic policies and governance issues zimbabwe has not benefited from the fund and this could affect in the long term its tariff reduction process in line with other countries in comesa thereby undermining regional integration initiatives sanctions have also resulted in zimbabwe failing to be effectively represented at regional meetings such as acp eu meetings as some targeted individuals especially high ranking government officials are denied visas this means that the country is not represented at international fora where crucial decisions and commitments are made a recent case is where trade mark southern africa tmsa a dfid department for international development financed project aimed at promoting regional integration and trade in southern africa working with sadc and comesa was shut down after providing direct support to the government of zimbabwe for fruit fly eradication project tmsa financed most sadc and comesa programmes including the establishment of a one stop border post at chirundu impact on investment and growth foreign direct investment fdi stimulates economic growth and employment creation in any economy fdi also positively impacts on the country s balance of payments position the negative perception that has come with sanctions has negatively impacted on fdi inflows as investors tend to shy away from economies that are perceived as risky impact on tourism sector bad publicity has dealt zimbabwe s tourism sector a painful blow zimbabwe has been falsely perceived as an unsafe and risky country to visit thus drastically reducing the number of tourist arrivals similarly ordinary zimbabwean travelers are finding it difficult to obtain visas to travel abroad due to negative perceptions and xenophobia arising indirectly from the sanctions impact on health sector health services support programmes which were suspended include the following i supporting the provincial health service capacity building and policy issues to ministry of health child welfare mohcw ii development of a gender strategy support to hiv aids activities iii integration of zimbabwe essential drugs action program zedap to national laboratories iv establishment of the health information system and v support to the health services fund transport management impact on international financial transactions zimbabwean companies have found it extremely difficult to effect payments through the international payment platforms as these transactions are intercepted and blocked in the hostile countries especially the us the industrial development corporation has reportedly lost over 20 million to the united states treasury department s office of foreign assets control ofac the zimbabwe fertiliser company a subsidiary of the idc industrial development corporation still has its 5 million frozen to date the minerals marketing corporation also lost over 30 million in revenue to ofac zimbabwe has lost a total of 42 billion in revenue over the past 13 years because of the sanctions another idc subsidiary olivine lost the 2 million it had secured from the pt a bank to recapitalise and the firm is currently struggling to produce some of its popular household products other socio economic effects zimbabwe has seen widespread reversal and cessation of donor funding in the areas of social development such as health education and infrastructure development ordinary citizens were thus adversely affected by the sanctions sanctions have also had adverse and downstream social and economic effects on the zimbabwean economy s key sectors zimbabwe took years negotiating to gain access to the global fund to fight malaria tb and hiv aids a significant number of non governmental organizations have moved their operations out of zimbabwe since the enactment of the zidera for instance danida danish international development agency and the canadian international development agency cida pulled out of zimbabwe in 2001 and 2003 respectively terminating all projects in progress and retrenching their employees it is believed that zimbabwe lost donor support amounting to approximately us million annually since 2001 us million in loans from the international monetary fund the world bank and african development bank commercial loans of us million and gdp reduction of us billion wayfoward sanctions are a blunt coercive instrument with far reaching implications for the ordinary people hence there is need for unity of purpose from all zimbabweans sadc and au african union in lobbying for the removal of these sanctions there is also need to liberalise the business operating environment in a manner that enhances confidence in order to unlock value in the country for vast investment opportunities strewn across all sectors including agriculture tourism manufacturing and mining conclusion it is evident from the foregoing that sanctions imposed on zimbabwe adversely affected the vulnerable groups and the economy in general beyond the country s borders neighbouring countries continue to feel the strain of the implosion of the zimbabwean economy which continues to reel under illegal western sanctions significant progress that the country had made in the development of infrastructure health and social service delivery systems was severely affected by the imposition of sanctions the sanctions must therefore be removed to allow the country to move forward

george osborne the former uk chancellor of the exchequer is touting himself as the next head of the international monetary fund he is hoping to fill the forthcoming vacancy as the current managing director christine lagarde has been nominated to be the next president of the european central bank according to the financial times osborne told friends that the imf requires a skilled political communicator and operator not a technocrat but osborne s interest in running one of the world s most powerful international organisations has been met with widespread criticism from across the political spectrum and among professional economists over his record at the helm of the uk economy for example danny blanchflower a former member of the bank of england s monetary policy committee described osborne as the worst uk chancellor in 300 years well qualified time for a new direction on a superficial level osborne is well qualified to lead the imf first as a european he passes the nationality test the world bank and the imf stitch up their top jobs so that the president of the bank is decided by the united states and the managing director of the imf is a european it s one of the traditions of international economic governance second osborne s economic philosophy as shown in his role as the architect of austerity in the uk is closely aligned with the imf s the fund s traditional core belief is that there should be minimal state intervention in the economy and that countries that receive financial help are required to implement privatisation deregulation and other pro market policies digging deeper into osborne s job application however shows that he does not tick all the boxes according to the imf s selection criteria the successful candidate for the position of managing director will have a distinguished record in economic policymaking at senior levels the main distinguishing feature of osborne s policy record was presiding over the worst economic recovery in british history since the industrial revolution osborne was a passionate advocate of austerity policies which led to a retrenchment of the state at exactly the time when the uk economy needed a fiscal boost masked by the need for prudence osborne s uncompromising approach to cutting public spending in an ideological bid to reduce the deficit and national debt led to depressed output and stagnant real wages it was the bank of england that tried to pick up the slack an aggressively loose monetary policy including quantitative easing has helped the economy stagger along but extremely low interest rates and readily available cash for investors has had the knock on effect of inflating assets such as house prices ironically despite his austerity policies and focus on balancing the budget osborne consistently overshot his public borrowing targets this is because slow growth leads to lower than expected tax revenues plus osborne s austerity damaged the long term growth potential of the economy due to a lack of investment in infrastructure skills and innovation it is not just economic competence that lets osborne down his economic philosophy is becoming out of kilter with the direction of travel of the imf slowly but surely the imf is moving away from its strict adherence to orthodox pro market policies as it recognises the damage they have caused to many economies economists at the imf have criticised neoliberal policies that they recognise have increased inequality in turn jeopardising durable expansion even outgoing chief christine lagarde has called for greater public spending by governments to boost growth the last things that the imf needs now is a skilled political communicator and operator it needs someone to accelerate the use of more pluralist policies which distributes power among more groups instead of dictating policies from the top it must completely jettison its historic one policy fits all approach that has so often failed countries that the fund exists to help from greece to argentina it is also about time that the european monopoly on leadership of the imf comes to an end the balance of world economic power is shifting from west to east with china already the largest economy if measured in purchasing power parity the major international institutions must embrace this new global reality instead of taking a step backwards and hiring a candidate like george osborne this article is republished from the conversation under a creative commons license read the original article
published monday 8 july 2019 print disqus the problem with keynesianism without savings nothing happens maine and montana the belief that wealth subsists not in ideas attitudes moral codes and mental disciplines but in identifiable and static things that can be seized and redistributed is the materialist superstition it stultified the works of marx and other prophets of violence and envy it frustrates every socialist revolutionary who imagines that by seizing the so called means of production he can capture the crucial capital of an economy it is the undoing of nearly every conglomerateur who believes he can safely enter new industries by buying rather than by learning them it confounds every bureaucrat who imagines he can buy the fruits of research and development the cost of capturing technology is mastery of the knowledge embodied in the underlying science the means of entrepreneurs production are not land labor or capital but minds and hearts whatever the inequality of incomes it is dwarfed by the inequality of contributions to human advancement as the science fiction writer robert heinlein wrote throughout history poverty is the normal condition of man advances that permit this norm to be exceeded here and there now and then are the work of an extremely small minority frequently despised often condemned and almost always opposed by all right thinking people whenever this tiny minority is kept from creating or as sometimes happens is driven out of society the people slip back into abject poverty this is known as bad luck president obama unconsciously confirmed heinlein s sardonic view of human nature in a campaign speech in iowa we had reversed the recession avoided depression got the economy moving again but over the last six months we ve had a run of bad luck all progress comes from the creative minority even government financed research and development outside the results oriented military is mostly wasted only the contributions of mind will and morality are enduring the most important question for the future of america is how we treat our entrepreneurs if our government continues to smear harass overtax and oppressively regulate them we will be dismayed by how swiftly the engines of american prosperity deteriorate we will be amazed at how quickly american wealth flees to other countries those most acutely threatened by the abuse of american entrepreneurs are the poor if the rich are stultified by socialism and crony capitalism the lower economic classes will suffer the most as the horizons of opportunity close high tax rates and oppressive regulations do not keep anyone from being rich they prevent poor people from becoming rich high tax rates do not redistribute incomes or wealth they redistribute taxpayers out of productive investment into overseas tax havens and out of offices and factories into beach resorts and municipal bonds but if the 1 percent and the 0 1 percent are respected and allowed to risk their wealth and new rebels are allowed to rise up and challenge them america will continue to be the land where the last regularly become the first by serving others george gilder knowledge and power the information theory of capitalism the ideas of economists and political philosophers both when they are right and when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood indeed the world is ruled by little else practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences are usually the slaves of some defunct economist john maynard keynes the general theory of employment interest and money nothing is more dangerous than a dogmatic worldview nothing more constraining more blinding to innovation more destructive of openness to novelty stephen jay gould dinosaur in a haystack reflections in natural history i think lord keynes himself would appreciate the irony that he has become the defunct economist under whose influence the academic and bureaucratic classes now toil slaves to what has become as much a religious belief system as an economic theory men and women who display appropriate skepticism on other topics indiscriminately funnel facts and data through a keynesian filter without ever questioning the basic assumptions some go on to prescribe government policies that have profound effects upon the citizens of their nations and when those policies create the conditions that engender the income inequality they so righteously oppose they often prescribe more of the same bad medicine like 18th century physicians applying leeches to their patients they take comfort that all right minded people will concur with their recommended treatments this is part of an ongoing series of a discussion between ray dalio and myself today s installment adapted from a letter i wrote several years ago addresses the philosophical problem he is trying to address income and wealth inequality last week i dealt with the equally significant problem of growing debt in the united states and the rest of the world the keynesian tools much of the economic establishment wants to use are exacerbating the problems ray would like to solve it with a blend of monetary and fiscal policy what he calls monetary policy 3 the problem with keynesianism let s start with a classic definition of keynesianism from wikipedia so that we can all be comfortable that i m not coloring the definition with my own bias and yes i admit i have a bias emphasis mine keynesian economics or keynesianism is the view that in the short run especially during recessions economic output is strongly influenced by aggregate demand total spending in the economy in the keynesian view aggregate demand does not necessarily equal the productive capacity of the economy instead it is influenced by a host of factors and sometimes behaves erratically affecting production employment and inflation the theories forming the basis of keynesian economics were first presented by the british economist john maynard keynes in his book the general theory of employment interest and money published in 1936 during the great depression keynes contrasted his approach to the aggregate supply focused classical economics that preceded his book the interpretations of keynes that followed are contentious and several schools of economic thought claim his legacy keynesian economists often argue that private sector decisions sometimes lead to inefficient macroeconomic outcomes which require active policy responses by the public sector in particular monetary policy actions by the central bank and fiscal policy actions by the government in order to stabilize output over the business cycle keynesian economics advocates a mixed economy predominantly private sector but with a role for government intervention during recessions before i launch into a critique of keynesianism let me point out that i find much to admire in the thinking of john maynard keynes he was a great economist and taught us a great deal further and this is important my critique is simplistic a proper examination of the problems with keynesianism would require a lengthy paper or a book we are just skimming along the surface and don t have time for a deep dive central banks around the world and much of academia have been totally captured by keynesian thinking in the current avant garde world of neo keynesianism consumer demand consumption is everything federal reserve policy is clearly driven by the desire to stimulate demand through lower interest rates and easy money and keynesian economists of all stripes want fiscal policy essentially government budgets to increase consumer demand if the consumer can t do it the reasoning goes then the government should step into the breach this of course requires deficit spending and borrowed money including from your local central bank essentially when a central bank lowers interest rates it is encouraging banks to lend money to businesses and telling consumers to borrow money to spend economists like to see fiscal stimulus at the same time as well they point to the numerous recessions that have ended after fiscal stimulus and lower rates were applied they see the ending of recessions as proof that keynesian doctrine works this thinking has several problems first using leverage borrowed money to stimulate spending today must by definition reduce consumption in the future debt is future consumption denied or future consumption brought forward keynesian economists argue that bringing just enough future consumption into the present to stimulate positive growth outweighs the future drag on consumption as long as there is still positive growth leverage just equalizes the ups and downs this has a certain logic of course which is why it is such a widespread belief keynes argued however that money borrowed to alleviate recession should be repaid when growth resumes my reading of keynes does not suggest he believed in the unending fiscal stimulus his disciples encourage today secondly as has been well documented by ken rogoff and carmen reinhart there comes a point at which too much leverage becomes destructive there is no exact way to know that point it arrives when lenders typically in the private sector decide that borrowers whether private or government might have some difficulty repaying and begin asking for more interest to compensate for their risks an overleveraged economy can t afford the higher rates and economic contraction ensues sometimes the contraction is severe sometimes it can be absorbed when accompanied by the popping of an economic bubble it is particularly disastrous and can take a decade or longer to work itself out as the developed world is finding out now every major economic miracle since the end of world war ii has been a result of leverage often this leverage has been accompanied by stimulative fiscal and monetary policies every single miracle has ended in tears with the exception of the current recent runaway expansion in china which is still in its early stages and this is why so many eyes in the investment world are laser focused on china forget about a hard landing or a recession a simple slowdown in china has profound effects on the rest of the world i would argue along i think with the austrian economist hayek and other economic schools that recessions are not the result of insufficient consumption but rather insufficient income fiscal and monetary policy should aim to grow incomes over the entire range of the economy that is best accomplished by making it easier for entrepreneurs and businesspeople to provide goods and services when businesses increase production they hire more workers and incomes go up without income there are no tax revenues to redistribute without income and production nothing of any economic significance happens keynes was correct when he observed that recessions are periods of reduced consumption but that is a result and not a cause entrepreneurs must be willing to create a product or offer a service in the hope there will be sufficient demand for their work there are no guarantees and they risk economic peril with their ventures whether we re talking about the local bakery or hairdressing shop or elon musk trying to compete with the world s largest automakers if government or central bank policies hamper their efforts the economy stagnates many politicians and academics favor keynesianism because it offers a theory by which government actions can become decisive in the economy it lets governments and central banks meddle in the economy and feel justified it allows 12 people sitting in a board room in washington dc to feel they are in charge of setting the most important price in the world the price of money interest rates of the us dollar and that they know more than the entrepreneurs and businesspeople who are actually in the market risking their own capital every day this is essentially the platonic philosopher king conceit the hubristic notion that a small group of wise elites is capable of directing the economic actions of a country no matter how educated or successful the populace has been on its own and never mind that the world has multiple clear examples of how central controls eventually slow growth and make things worse over time it is only when free people are allowed to set their own prices of goods and services and yes even interest rates that valid market clearing prices can be determined trying to control them results in one group being favored over another in today s world savers and entrepreneurs are left to eat the crumbs that fall from the plates of the well connected crony capitalists and live off the income from repressed interest rates the irony of using cheap money to drive consumer demand is that retirees and savers get less money to spend and that clearly drives their consumption down why is the consumption produced by ballooning debt better than the consumption produced by hard work and savings this is trickle down monetary policy which ironically favors the very large banks and institutions if you ask keynesian central bankers if they want to be seen as helping the rich and connected they will stand back and forcefully tell you no but that is what happens when you start down the road of financial repression someone benefits so far it has not been main street as george gilder said those most acutely threatened by the abuse of american entrepreneurs are the poor if the rich are stultified by socialism and crony capitalism the lower economic classes will suffer the most as the horizons of opportunity close high tax rates and oppressive regulations do not keep anyone from being rich they prevent poor people from becoming rich high tax rates do not redistribute incomes or wealth they redistribute taxpayers out of productive investment into overseas tax havens and out of offices and factories into beach resorts and municipal bonds without savings nothing happens those who were forced to endure economics 101 may remember that savings investment in any real world economic system you must have savings in order to have investment in order for the economy to grow generally savings are actually leveraged to produce more investments and thus eventual production and consumption than if the profit recipients had simply spent the money themselves this will become critically important next week this idea that consumption is better than savings is the heart of the keynesian conceit yes i know i ve written many a time about keynes s paradox of thrift it is a good thing for individuals to save but if everybody saves then there is less consumption that seems true on the surface and makes a great sound bite but it has an inherent flaw it assumes that savings don t become investments that increase productivity which in turn leads to the production of more goods and services which ultimately creates income which then creates more demand without savings nothing happens nothing there has to be capital of some kind from somewhere in order for economic activity to happen productivity growth is ultimately a product of savings and it is productivity growth that will generate an increase in income for the country as a whole there are consequences to the fact that savings are close to an all time low and when those limited savings go to purchase government bonds it takes money away from more productive and income producing endeavors a static economy does not raise overall income or wealth only an economy that is growing as a result of a healthy level of savings and investment can produce the results keynesian economists want increased incomes for everyone your typical keynesian economist isn t willing to wait for savings to become investment they and the politicians they serve want results today and the only way to get results today is to get people to spend today while the process of saving and investing takes time neo keynesian economists are ultimately teenage children who want the pleasure of consuming today rather than thinking about the future and i won t even go into the burden we are placing on future generations by borrowing money to goose our current economy and expecting them to pay that money back we are building toward a future intergenerational war that is going to be very intense once our children learn how we misspent their future but that s yet another letter maine and montana early august sees me in new york for a few days before the annual economic fishing event camp kotok then maybe another day in new york before i meet shane in montana and spend a few days with my close friend darrell cain on flathead lake after a long day spent in airports i arrived at my home in puerto rico shane is in california in the early evening with the full intent of writing and finishing a much different letter than the one above then i realized i did not have the key to the house shane and i had talked about dealing with such a contingency but we never actually did it that will shortly change and while the key did materialize some six hours later the new time constraints forced me to go back to previous material to address what is a serious obstacle to resolving the problems ray and i see next week we will look at policies that not only increase savings and investment but will restart economic growth and put us back on track to more equitable distribution of the economic pie and with that i will hit the send button and wish you a great week your hoping to find a balance analyst john mauldin chairman mauldin economics p s want even more great analysis from my worldwide network with over my shoulder you ll

atlanta july 8 2019 prnewswire invesco a leading asset manager with over 30 years of expertise in factor investing today released findings from its seventh invesco global sovereign asset management study an annual in depth report on the complex investment behavior of sovereign wealth funds and central banks which this year shows disenchantment with europe among sovereign investors this year s study was conducted face to face amongst 139 individual sovereign investors and central bank reserve managers across the globe representing 20 3 trillion of assets of which 71 are central banks 62 in 2018 reflecting their growing status as sovereign investors our authoritative annual study of the global sovereign segment shows sovereigns and central banks preparing for an end to the current economic cycle seen within two years leading them to be more defensive and diversified in their portfolios sovereigns have reduced equity exposure in favor of fixed income but continue to blaze a trail with rising long term commitments to private markets which for larger sovereigns now include direct investments in china and the technology sector said alex millar head of emea institutional invesco as trade wars continue to impact markets our research shows sovereigns shifting toward china demonstrating their ability to look past short term geo political issues and capitalize on core dynamics in this case the continued maturing of the world s second largest economy continued john galateria head of north america institutional invesco another particularly notable finding is the rapid development of esg implementation by sovereigns with their focus moving from g governance initiatives to more closely looking at e environmental initiatives additional key findings include sovereigns optimistic on china china s attractiveness rating for sovereign investors has improved more than any other major region since 2017 some 82 of sovereigns cited trade tensions as having had an influence on asset allocation decisions yet china s attractiveness as an investment destination over the next three years scored an average rating of 6 1 out of 10 among sovereign investors a marked increase on 2017 s 5 2 rating study figure 1 despite the fact that the study was carried out during a period of ongoing rhetoric on a trade war those surveyed saw china s pledge to improve safeguarding of intellectual property as grounds for optimism that some resolution of tensions would be reached the unique competitive dynamics of china are appealing for sovereigns seeking more diversification the survey found with equities continuing to be the asset class most favored approximately 90 of sovereigns with china exposure held chinese equities showing that the government s measures to open the market to foreign investors are bearing fruit fixed income allocations are also likely to increase with chinas inclusion in major bond indices and initiatives such as bond connect giving foreign investors access to the local bond market transparency remains a significant obstacle to higher allocations in china for sovereigns while for those sovereigns with no existing allocation to china investment restrictions and currency risk are seen as the main impediments study figure 2 investors see less economic attractiveness in europe a combination of slowing economic growth and perceptions of rising political risk have led to a decline in the perceived attractiveness of major european economies brexit is now influencing asset allocation decisions for 64 of sovereigns study figure 3 while continental eurozone internal politics seen as increasingly uncertain with the ascendance of populist movements in major european economies such as germany and italy are impacting asset allocation decisions for 46 this has resulted in europe falling out of favor with nearly one third of sovereign investors decreasing allocations to europe in 2018 and a similar number planning further decreases in 2019 only 13 of sovereigns plan on increasing allocations to europe this year compared to a 40 allocation to asia and 36 to emerging markets study figure 4 environmental considerations move esg firmly into the spotlight esg is an increasingly important issue for sovereigns and central banks since 2017 the percentage of sovereigns with a specific esg policy rose from 46 to 60 20 of central banks now have an esg policy compared to 11 in 2017 approaches to esg are increasingly sophisticated having moved beyond screening to incorporate more advanced forms of integration there has also been a shift in focus of the nature of esg activity while asset owners have in the past focused on issues of governance due to clearer risk and return benefits these factors are now often assumed by esg adopters for sovereigns environmental concerns are increasingly becoming the lead focus with carbon emissions and climate change the single most important esg issue renminbi finds a bigger place in central banks reserve portfolios as a group central banks believe the end of the economic cycle will be characterized by a gradual slowdown rather than an economic crisis however the uncertain market environment combined with an increasingly hawkish federal reserve led many of them to find perceived safety in increased allocations to deposits and in some cases gold central banks bought 651 5 tons of gold in 2018 the second highest annual total on record and up 74 from the year earlier1 over a third 35 of central banks increased allocations over the last three years with 32 expecting further increases over the next three years but overall gold holdings remain steady at around 4 of overall reserve portfolios respondents to the study reported additional challenges associated with gold as a reserve asset including volatility storage costs and the political implications of selling 75 of central banks agreed or strongly agreed that selling gold holdings would attract negative domestic media coverage in their country central banks continue to diversify away from the negative yields of government bonds especially in europe into bank deposits and away from the us dollar the main beneficiary has been the renminbi and between 2017 18 allocations to china s currency overtook the australian and canadian dollar with 43 of central banks now holding it in their portfolios compared to 40 in 2018 over a quarter 27 of central banks expect to continue to increase renminbi reserves in 2019 making it the most favored currency for the year ahead with increased allocations expected to be taken from the usd eur and gbp though usd remains the dominant reserve currency allocations reached a 5 year low falling from 62 7 of global currency reserves to 61 7 fixed income displaces equities as largest asset class for sovereigns 2018 was a challenging year for sovereigns as weak and volatile equity markets led to a decline in overall investment returns on average sovereign investors achieved returns of 4 in 2018 compared to 9 in 2017 despite the decrease in returns sovereigns performed well given negative returns from global equities which fell 8 7 in us dollar terms during the year according to msci world index the majority of sovereigns 89 anticipate the end of the economic cycle within the next two years this combined with volatility concerns and the prospect of negative returns from equities has led to increased fixed income allocations and more diversification in allocations to infrastructure real estate and private equity markets fixed income allocations increased to 33 in 2019 from 30 becoming sovereigns largest asset class meanwhile allocations to equities fell from 33 to 30 marking the end of a five year trend between 2013 and 2018 during which fixed income fell from 35 to 30 as equities posted strong gains challenging equity markets in 2018 highlighted the limitations of market cap weighted passive strategies as well as some more basic factor strategies some of the most popular factor strategies e g value and momentum performed below sovereign expectations during 2018 and some of those adopting a simple set and forget approach to their factor allocations reported negative returns this is encouraging a move away from a single factor approach towards multi factor positions that can

overview the capital markets have begun the week in a mixed note asia pacific equities tumbled led by 2 losses in china and south korea but european shares are edging higher and a positive close would be the seventh in the past eight sessions the s p is little changed asia pacific bond yields moved higher as anticipated after the jump in us yields after the jobs data european bonds are slightly firmer except in italy and spain where the benchmarks are paring recent gains greek debt has rallied in response to the election results that saw syriza defeated by new democracy along the lines the polls had signaled us 10 year treasury yield is consolidating the pre weekend move that lifted it back above 2 the dollar is sporting a slightly heavier profile with the scandis and antipodeans leading way with 0 2 0 3 gains the turkish lira is off nearly 2 following erdogan dismissal of the central bank governor gold and oil are firmer asia pacific japan reported a smaller current account surplus and a drop in core machine orders the more modest external surplus reflects the deterioration in japan s trade balance the deficit on the balance of payments basis rose to about jpy650 bln from less than jpy100 bln in april japan has recorded an average trade deficit of jpy107 bln this year compared with jpy192 bln average in the first five months of last year separately japan s three month rising machinery orders came to a screeching halt in may with a nearly 8 drop twice the decline expected by economists last week japan reported stronger household consumption but that could be some front running ahead of the october 1 sales tax hike to 10 from 8 china s reserves rose by 18 bln to 3 119 trillion it is the highest since last april and likely reflects valuation adjustments and capital inflows rather than intervention to weaken the yuan the way the pboc set the reference rate last month suggests that it had been leaning against modest downside pressure on the yuan china also reported its first monthly increase in auto sales this year new discounts may have helped but also some cities granted more licenses too the dollar is consolidating in the upper end of the pre weekend range it met offers in tokyo near jpu108 60 but found support in europe ahead of jpy108 25 where a roughly 770 mln option is struck and will expire in the us today around 1 25 bln in options in the jpy108 00 jpy108 15 area may offer support for the greenback the australian dollar is also consolidating its pre weekend decline and has been confined to a quarter of a cent below 0 7000 nearby support is seen in the 0 6950 0 6965 area the us dollar initially edged up against the chinese yuan edging through last week s highs but slipped as the session progressed to finish the local session near cny6 88 europe after german factory orders tumbled 2 2 in may the market was prepared for a poor industrial production report it did not turn out as bad as feared industrial output edged up 0 3 after the april decline was revised to 2 0 from 1 9 germany also reported a stronger than expected rise in exports 1 1 after a substantial decline 3 4 in april revised from 3 7 imports unexpectedly fell 0 3 rather than increase by 0 5 as the median bloomberg survey forecast anticipated johnson appears to have solidified his lead to become the next tory leader securing javid s support this has spurred speculation that javid will replace hammond as the chancellor of the exchequer the results of the rank and file vote are still two weeks away although the agreement with the dup is to run the course of the parliament session it does not seem ironclad a new government committed to getting rid of the backstop which ostensibly risks the good friday agreement would seem to violate a key part of the agreement johnson refuses to rule of propagation which would end the parliament session the risk of a no deal exit continues to weigh on sterling sentiment the firing of turkey s central bank governor may bring forward the rate cut that erdogan is demanding but the market does not like the interference and sold the lira the dollar had trended lower against the lira in may and june and lost nearly 3 over those two months the greenback slipped to its lowest level since early april last week try5 5850 but in the illiquid asian timezone when investors got their first chance to respond the dollar was marked up to nearly try5 8250 the lira recovered but the dollar found support a little below try5 71 in europe the five year credit default swap also rose 395 bp from 375 bp before the weekend the euro fell a little below 1 1210 after the us employment data and has barely been able to recover it reached almost 1 1235 in europe but there is not much of an appetite the 2 1 bln euros in expiring options struck between 1 1250 and 1 12665 will likely be a sufficient cap today sterling was driven below 1 25 before the weekend and has resurfaced above there today to reach almost 1 2540 the intra day technicals show little enthusiasm for stronger gains initial resistance is seen near 1 2560 america fed chair powell s testimony before congress wednesday and thursday has taken on greater significance after the constructive employment report some fear that if the fed delivers a rate cut in july it would be seen as capitulating to the presidential bullying on the other hand if the fed does not deliver a rate cut it others fears that the disruption to the market would make a september cut inevitable we have argued the institutional strength differentiates the us from many developing countries such as turkey the unusual explicit pressure from trump has been resisted reduces the likelihood that a rate cut now would be seen as the loss of the central bank s independence the tension between japan and south korea is not america s doing but one could imagine a different kind of american president exerting leadership to quell the tension between two allies our sense is that both japan and south korea will be harmed by the dispute but like the us and china dispute it will spur south korea to strengthen its own semiconductor materials market japan s use of trade to punish south korea over a non trade issue seems to be a page from the us playbook indeed there are some reports today that suggest china may take another page from trump s playbook and challenge trade with some us companies on national security grounds it is a light calendar day for north america the canadian dollar is in stuck in a narrow range and a chunky option for 1 3 bln at cad1 31 is likely sufficient to deter a stronger us dollar recovery the bank of canada meets in the middle of the week and while there won t be a change in policy the confidence that the soft patch is in the rearview mirror may have been bolstered by the recent data for a third session the dollar is straddling the mxn19 00 level the consolidation even if there is some range extension looks poised to continue the peso and the yuan are competing today for the strongest emerging market currency disclaimer
welcome to this week s market wrap podcast i m mike gleason coming up michael pento of pento portfolio strategies joins me for a tremendous interview on what he sees as pending doom in the stock market and why he believes we re in for a bout of stagflation that will make the 1970s look like a walk in the park he also makes a compelling case for gold during an interest rate environment that he believes will soon be turning profoundly negative in real terms so don t miss a must hear interview with michael pento coming up after this week s market update following yesterday s independence day celebrations perhaps more americans will wake up to the need to declare their independence from the financial system one of the best ways to do that is by shifting dollar denominated wealth from bank and brokerage accounts into physical precious metals although the public isn t yet clamoring in huge numbers to buy bullion we have seen some encouraging price action of late in metals markets the main fireworks have been in gold rising to a multi year high and palladium this week palladium posted a new all time high palladium prices currently come in at 1 568 up 0 7 since last friday s close its sister metal platinum is down 3 5 on the week to trade at 809 turning to the monetary metals which are selling off a bit here today during thin trading in the futures markets on this holiday weekend surprise surprise gold shows a slight weekly decline of 1 0 now to bring spot prices to 1 396 per ounce silver meanwhile continues to play second fiddle to gold and has yet to generate any real upside momentum of its own this year for the week silver is off by 2 2 with essentially all of that decline coming here today and is at 15 03 as of this friday morning recording gold bugs took notice of president donald trump s newest attempt to re shape the federal reserve he had previously floated herman cain and stephen moore as nominations to the central bank s board of governors but they each withdrew after coming under attack by the media and getting preemptively rebuked in the senate by never trump republican mitt romney earlier this week president trump announced plans to nominate two new candidates to fill the remaining seats on the fed s board of governors one is a conventional pick christopher waller of the st louis fed along with st louis fed president james bullard waller is regarded as dovish and would likely be a voice for the interest rate cuts currently favored by the white house trump s other pick is less conventional and of more interest to sound money advocates he has tapped one of his economic advisors and a longtime gold standard proponent named judy shelton that last comment was from stephen moore who has off and on advocated for a gold or commodity backed dollar but moore and now judy shelton also advocate for the fed to cut rates citing low inflation and efforts by europe and china to gain trade advantages through depreciating their currencies if shelton makes it through the senate which may be an uphill battle it wouldn t be the first time the fed had a policymaker who advocated a gold standard in theory but not in practice former fed chairman alan greenspan was a pro gold free market economist before becoming an easy money bubble blowing central banker we will certainly be watching judy shelton s nomination process with interest it will be good to see some of her sound money ideas at least being brought up in the public discourse but there is simply too much political pressure in opposition to sound money for the fed to move toward a gold standard anytime soon a larger sound money movement needs to be built first one that makes the moral and practical case for declaring independence from fiat money and its abuses by bankers and politicians thomas jefferson himself once said of fiat money that it is liable to be abused has been is and forever will be abused in every country in which it is permitted the author of the declaration of independence believed that precious metals were a necessary foundation of a free and fair economy the founders specifically wrote gold and silver into the u s constitution as the legal tender of each of the states restoring constitutional money to the united states is going to be a long and difficult battle the federal reserve and the financial and political interests that control it won t give up their power to print voluntarily it will probably take a crisis event that causes the public to lose confidence in the dollar then perhaps the current monetary order will be called into question and have a chance of being replaced with a system of sound money in the meantime americans should prepare themselves financially for more currency manipulation and depreciation ahead you can gain a measure of independence from the inflationary fiat system by putting your own finances on a hard money standard with backing in gold and silver bullion well now without further delay let s get right to this week s exclusive money metals interview mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome back micheal pento president and founder of pento portfolio strategies michael s a well known money manager and a terrific market commentator and author of the book the coming bond market collapse how to survive the demise of the u s debt market he s a regular guest right here on the money metals podcast and we always love having him on michael thanks for the time again today and welcome back michael pento great to be back on your program mike gleason well michael when we spoke last in march you noted something very important that being the equity markets were celebrating the fed s shift to a more dovish posture at that time the fed hadn t actually done much they were telegraphing a pause in rate hikes but still selling assets the celebration continues today but in point of fact the fed still hasn t done a whole lot it s all about expectations and right now everyone is sure they will be cutting rates in july they re getting a lot of mileage out of a little more than some jawboning the s p 500 is up 20 from its december lows what do you make of these expectations is the fomc going to meet them with some aggressive rate cutting or do you think people are going to quickly find out that talk is cheap and the economy is headed for recession regardless of what the fed does michael pento well first of all the market s doing well this year but that s because the calendar changed and the market went up after going down 30 the russell was down almost 30 28 the s p was down 20 so you pretty much just reversed what happened in the fall of 2018 so this is not a runaway stock market by any means and people are going crazy how well the market s doing it s actually i think it s putting in a triple top that would be my best analysis of the situation and the reason why i say that well before i go into that let me answer your question first so you re asking me will the fed cut rates i believe the fed will cut rates later this year i think they ll probably go 25 basis points in july and the reason why i think they ll go 25 basis points in july is that they are trying to catch up to what the bond market has already done so if you look at the bond market the fed funds money market rates right now the effective fed funds rate is about 2 38 and the 10 year treasury is below 2 so you have a pretty significantly inverted yield curve which really hurts banks profits and diminishes their rationale when it comes to making a loan in other words they re not going to make a lot of loans when they don t have a lot of profit margins and they think the economy s slowing because of the reduction in nominal rates on the long end of the yield curve and they don t want to make loans to people who probably aren t going to pay the loan back because then their capital will go away so that s the reason why i think the fed is going to cut rates in july but the market is 100 convinced that they re going to cut rates probably as much as 50 basis points so two or three rate cuts this year and i will say that that is a possibility however if the fed is aggressively cutting rates it s because the global economic recession is well underway that would be the rationale behind cutting interest rates so aggressively don t forget that at the end of last year we had a fed that was absolutely avowed to raise rates to 3 and then another 50 basis points so 3 was what they deemed as being neutral and then they were going to go above 50 basis points right you remember this and you ll also recall that the balance sheet withdrawal process the burning of cash was supposed to be on autopilot in other words the fed s destruction of its balance sheet to the tune of maybe two trillion dollars was supposed to be on autopilot that all changed so they ve gone a pretty trenchant difference they ve gone more than a country mile as they say from being one central bank is going to raise rates to three and a half percent and drained the balance sheet down from four and a half trillion to around two trillion to one that is now supposed to be aggressively cutting rates i ll just say one more thing about this the fact that the federal reserve is going to be cutting rates they have two and a half percent less than two and a half percent before they go to zero so the question i have and i don t have the answer i have a model that tells them what the answer will be but i am willing to guess based upon the myriad and the plethora of evidence that i have that merely cutting rates by 25 basis points in july is not going to be nearly enough to stem the tide of a global recession which by the way i believe has already begun mike gleason you recently wrote a great piece on corporate debt stating that it s a bubble that will eventually pop you made a comparison between today s corporate debt and the housing bubble of 2007 and the dot com bubble of 2000 you pointed out that both ben bernanke and alan greenspan attempted to shirk responsibilities for the massive bubbles the fed creates the claim was that nobody can identify a bubble before it bursts we know that isn t exactly true you ve done it and anyone willing to take an objective look can see that debt is one of the next bubbles likely to burst the obligations are so large that they simply cannot be paid talk about the bubble in corporate debt if you would and what would you think are some signs that listeners should be watching for that maybe the reckoning is about to arrive michael pento i have to laugh when i hear people tell me this is time is much better than 2008 because in 2008 don t you know that there was all kinds of malfeasance in the banking system and people were making loans to people who couldn t pay back those loans mortgages that were going to default but there was only about one and a half trillion dollars worth of subprime mortgage debt but i went and did the numbers myself and added up triple b debt leveraged loans and junk bonds and triple b is just one notch above junk and basically the covenants behind these triple b loans make them essentially junk that number is 5 4 trillion dollars and what makes me laugh is when i look back and i hear people on cnbc and all the financial networks all the pundits come out the carnival barkers will tell you that in 2019 there are no massive dislocations there are no excesses in the economy well how do you explain the fact that there are now 13 trillion dollars worth of sovereign debt that has a minus sign in front of it is it normal for a japanese a swiss and a german 10 year note to have a negative yield think about that central banks have gone so insane concurrently that they have now forced bond yields so low that going out 10 years they get paid to borrow and that hasn t caused any dislocations or malformations in the stock market or the junk bond market or the leveraged loan market or the housing market or the stock market that is insane prima facie it s a prima facie case for insanity in my opinion mike gleason let s talk about china for a bit china has always been a tough one for us to evaluate there have been people speculating that chinese central bankers have blown a massive bubble of their own and the bursting of that bubble is imminent but if they were close to a crisis they ve done a pretty good job of keeping the wheels on thus far you ve been watching developments in the chinese banking sector and perhaps things are starting to get serious there the central bank of china recently took control of a chinese bank when it failed there are certainly other banks then buried in bad debts what are you expecting from china in the months ahead and what you think it will mean for investors here in the u s michael pento well you have to understand just to stay at 36 000 feet china quadrupled their debt since 2007 and when any nation not just china but any nation and by the way there has been no nation that has done that in the history of mankind but any nation that will quadruple the amount of existing debt outstanding in 12 years and have done so by an edict from the central government is sitting on a massive pile of unproductive loans that will go bankrupt baoshang bank is just one example this is replete throughout china and even in hong kong where their banking system is many many times the size of their gdp so you re going to have a situation where and this is by the way speaking parenthetically as i tend to do why i am bearish on the global economy not because of trade conflicts or conflagrations so much more to the fact that china can no longer be the engine of global growth responsible for one third of global growth since 2008 they can t do it anymore because they re sitting on 40 trillion dollars worth of debt dung that they cannot pay back and if china s not the global engine of the world then europe is going to suffer it might surprise you to know maybe not you but your audience and certainly those that watch mainstream financial media it might surprise everybody to know that japan europe the u k and china are all in a manufacturing recession now that is not something that michael pento came up to talk about on money metals that is public information released by governments they re publicly released purchasing managers indexes they all show that all of those countries i mentioned and much of the developed world is in a manufacturing recession now i want to pose this question to you how can china which was erstwhile in the habit of providing one third of global growth by building out massive unproductive fixed asset investments how can china possibly be growing at 6 if their manufacturing base is in a recession the answer is that they are not growing at 6 china is lucky if they re growing at all because china has a shrinking labor force and plunging productivity and if china isn t growing then europe s in deep trouble and asia s in trouble and the korean nation is in trouble and japan is in trouble and even in the united states our manufacturing the new order component just released for june the manufacturing new orders component of ism was 50 flat no growth so we are in the midst of a global manufacturing recession we are in the middle of according to fact set which is the definitive voice on earnings on the s p 500 we are in the middle of an earnings recession that s going to last for three quarters so it s not the second derivative of earnings growth is falling so we re not going to grow from 24 earnings to maybe 20 or 15 or 5 earnings growth is going to be negative according to fact set for three quarters in a row you add that to a manufacturing recession and then you add it to the fact that we have a stock market that is near all time record high valuations if you look at price for sales if you look at total market cap to gdp i m not trying to scare people i manage money for a living so i can t short the market and buy gold always and hope to be in business so i have a model that tells me when to get net short and when to overweight gold which we are at this point because by the way when you live in a world where interest rates are going towards zero and below the carrying cost of gold doesn t look so bad i could put a bar of gold in my safe at home that earns no interest and i can lament the fact that i m not sitting in a bank earning 10 with my cash but if i m sitting at my house looking at my bar of gold and saying gee i m forgoing almost nothing at the bank and because interest rates are negative in a real sense because inflation is the goal of every horrific central banker on the planet i m actually making money much more than i would in the bank because gold for 5 000 years has maintained its purchasing power so i m not trying to scare people i m just telling people that this is not normal it is not normal to have one dollar worth of sovereign debt that has a negative yield and it s certainly beyond the twilight zone to have 13 trillion dollars worth of sovereign debt with a negative sign in front of it it is certainly completely abnormal to have the stock market at a record high valuation when you re in the middle of an earnings and manufacturing recession globally so if you think i m trying to scare you you re wrong but if you think you want to go and call your local broker and put your money into a closet index fund and go to sleep at night don t be surprised if very soon you wake up and find out you re in the middle of an event much like we saw in december of 2018 or october of 2008 or march of 2000 where are you at the cusp especially in those last two i mentioned the recession of 2000 and the recession of 2008 where you are on the cusp of going off the cliff in the stock market and this time around we don t have the tools available to readily pull us out of deflationary depression because as i just mentioned bond yields are already in the toilet of history so there is not going to be any rapid relief from plummeting bond yields around the world and there certainly isn t going to be this fiscal response coming from countries which are already massive overly indebted we have a problem it s going to take a lot of fiscal and monetary wrangling to get out of that takes time but in the interim i wouldn t be surprised to see the stock market lose half of its value again for the third time since the year 2000 mike gleason obviously a lot of black swans circling about and certainly a number of very interesting situations that we could see unfold here and obviously confidence is a big reason that the central bankers have been able to sort of get us out these messes in the past and you ve got to wonder if anybody s going to have any confidence in them this time around well michael i wanted to kind of further the point on gold before we let you go these markets have been pretty range bound for a while talking about gold specifically sliver as well gold finally broke out to a five year high recently driven primarily by escalating tariffs and maybe perhaps the fed will be cutting rates do you see gold finally starting a new trend higher here or are we going to drop back into the range michael pento that s not a prediction any longer it s the fact you just said it it s a fact gold massively broke out of that 1 350 ceiling that it was staring at it went all the way well into the 1 400s it pulled back here recently but what a wonderful buying opportunity in my humble opinion the fact is that we live in a world where money is going to be mostly free for a very long time because central banks have gotten into the business of eviscerating markets so for instance in japan the bank of japan now owns 80 of all etfs and over 50 of the entire japanese government bond market so when do i have to worry about the bank of japan raising rates they can t even get out of the business of buying etfs manipulating their stock market or trying to manipulate their stock market higher likewise with the ecb when are we going to talk about raising rates they threatened they were going to raise rates but now they re talking about lowering rates and getting back into qe and the same can be said for the united states we were talking about draining the balance sheet and raising rates back to normal now not being five and a quarter percent like it was in 2007 but they re talking about trying to get to three and a half and they barely got to two and a half and now we re supposedly heading back to zero so the competition for a real currency a real money a real store of value is going to increase exponentially and why would people go anywhere else but what s proven for millennia to be the best place to store your wealth and your purchasing power so i predict that rates going to be well it s not a prediction because rates are already at zero i think the united states will soon be back to zero and then after that back into quantitative easing which means you re going to get a much higher rate and by the way you should understand that if rates are zero and you get even one basis point of inflation real interest rates are negative but i can t see them stopping until they get 2 inflation so your real interest rates will be 2 but that s the way the government measures inflation and they do a hell of a bad job doing that so if the government s measuring it at two it s probably closer to eight you re going to get profoundly negative real interest rates which is rocket fuel for gold and why anybody would have nay faith in any fiat currency not just hating the dollar but how could you have faith in the euro over the dollar or the yen or the yuan you have to have the belief that gold will rise and will continue to rise in all currencies and i think that dynamic is just getting started mike gleason all these central bankers are pretty much going from the same playbook this keynesian world that we live in and never ending money creation well we ll leave it there for today michael we appreciate the time as always and love getting your comments before we let you go though please tell people a little bit about pento portfolio strategies and then how they can contact you and then also follow you more closely michael pento well great so the website is pentoport com on the website you can see all of my media appearances and you can get my weekly commentary for 49 a year you can get access to a podcast that really gets into the minutia and the data points that you absolutely need to know about what s really going on in the world you can t get that from mainstream financial media that much anymore really then you can become a client because i actually have a portfolio that s designed to protect your principal while we wait for this occurrence to happen i believe a minimum of 35 downturn in the market and then i also believe most importantly after if you want to have a chance to actually protect your principal make a little money while you wait hopefully then capitalize on the destruction of this mirage of an economy and a market on the backend of that i think we re going to have we will engender a protracted period of stagflation like we ve never before seen so it s going to be the 70s on steroids but for a long time there s a model on how to invest for that so you have to know when to buy bonds and when to buy stocks what kind of stocks when to be short stocks all these things are imperative because 80 of the stock market now 80 is on autopilot just like the fed s balance was supposed to be 80 of the market is passive investing strategies in other words strategies are designed by machines to mimic the momentum of the stock market and when that breaks you re going to see nothing but offers and no humans to support the stock market no fundamental reason no fiscal no monetary reason will come in time to protect you that s where i come in and if you re interested in capitalizing on that and then after the central banks master the business of destroying your currency and they get to the 2 but it will really be more like double digit inflation you have to know what to own so if you re interested in that my email is mpento pentoport com the website is pentoport com and the office number here is 732 772 9500 mike gleason money can be made in any markets and obviously preserving wealth may be also the big key and somebody like michael of

ankara turkey ap turkey s currency fell sharply on monday reawakening concerns of another bout of financial jitters in the country after president recep tayyip erdogan fired the central bank governor reportedly over disagreements on interest rate cuts murat cetinkaya was replaced by murat uysal the central bank s deputy governor in a presidential decree published saturday no reason was given for the dismissal but media reports said cetinkaya had resisted pressure from erdogan to lower borrowing costs the move which raises concerns over the independence of the bank from the government is expected to lead to rate cuts in the coming weeks the central bank holds its next monetary policy on july 25 the dismissal of turkey s central bank governor over the weekend increases the chances of aggressive cuts in interest rates in the near term wrote jason tuvey senior emerging markets economist at capital economics but it has also raised the risk of larger currency falls and is likely to make the country s inflation problem worse pushing up long term bond yields lower interest rates tend to weaken a currency but boost economic growth and inflation inflation has been a problem for turkey in recent years and independent economists have said the country should have higher rates though erdogan has been pushing for cuts the turkish lira dropped by 3 in early trading on monday before recovering some of its losses it stood at 5 74 against the dollar down some 2 from friday turkey s currency nosedived last year over concerns about the country s high levels of foreign debt erdogan s economic policies and a diplomatic and trade dispute with the united states at the time the central bank raised interest rates sharply from 17 75 to the current 24 to support the currency and fight inflation erdogan has frequently criticized the central bank for keeping rates high the hurriyet newspaper said the governor had rejected calls by the president to lower the benchmark interest rate uysal the new governor said the central bank would continue to independently implement monetary policy instruments for price stability cetinkaya s four year term was due to end next year his dismissal was made possible under new executive powers under a new presidential system that went into effect last summer such appointments previously required a cabinet decision
turkey has avoided the meltdown that seemed possible last summer when the lira plunged precipitously but safety is remote the palpable threat of imminent collapse has given way to a sense of muddling through as the government unleashes credit to defer an inevitable reckoning meanwhile anyone with money stashes it away in the face of gnawing fears depriving the economy of vitality turkey s currency remains battered while its foreign debts remain vast inflation and joblessness are alarmingly high economic growth is minimal and anxiety considerable amid the sense that more trouble lies ahead this is playing out as turkey contends with political uncertainty after the shocking rebuke of mr erdogan s ruling party in the recent istanbul mayoral election a president with a reputation for ignoring unpalatable facts or thrashing those who wield them now appears at the mercy of forces he cannot command international markets ekrem imamoglu s victory in the istanbul mayoral election was a body blow to mr erdogan s party for mr erdogan all available choices entail peril most economists maintain that he must accept interest rates above the now stultifying level of 24 per cent to dissuade investors from abandoning turkey that should prevent the lira from falling further limiting inflation but it would also deprive businesses of capital yielding bankruptcy and joblessness while constraining economic growth advertisement mr erdogan has consistently opted for growth at any cost he has famously argued that high interest rates cause inflation which is like blaming abstinence for a hangover he fired the central bank chief precisely because he refused to lower rates according to reports in turkey all signs now point to mr erdogan forcing interest rates lower while pumping credit to turkish businesses and households that should spur spending and economic growth but at the cost of remaining faith in the currency yielding more inflation and bank losses that risk eventually exploding into a full blown crisis it s all coming apart says fadi hakura a turkey expert at chatham house a research institution in london the government is so wedded to this consumption model this will ultimately lead to an economic breakdown during his 16 years in power mr erdogan has proved a maestro of economic growth using influence over the financial apparatus to steer credit to his cronies in the construction industry they have erected monuments in his honor a new istanbul airport high rise office towers and an ever expanding trove of shopping malls and resorts but as international investors have taken note of the mounting debt produced by this development they have fled over the last two years the lira has surrendered 40 per cent of its value against the american dollar the drop has lifted the prices of imported goods from fuel to fertiliser yielding inflation running at 19 per cent advertisement from corporate offices in istanbul to open air markets across the nation frustration over rising prices has gained force reinforcing thrift and diminishing national fortunes if people were going to buy 2 kilograms of fruit now they buy one says fuat kar as he tended to his produce stand at a market in the blue collar istanbul neighborhood of silahtaraga the price for his cherries has soared from 6 lira 1 50 a kilogram to 15 lira as farmers charge him more the cost he bears for plastic pallets and paper bags has risen as his income falls he is spreading the pain by eating out less the biggest immediate threat to the economy remains loans in foreign currency after the 2008 financial crisis as the us central bank dropped interest rates to zero to spur revival turkish banks took advantage of free money by borrowing dollars they lent greenbacks to turkish businesses eager for an alternative to the lira s high borrowing costs advertisement such transactions were attractive because the lira was then appreciating and the turkish economy was rapidly expanding but in recent years as the lira has fallen companies with revenues in lira and debts in dollars have seen their burdens expand turkey s medium and long term foreign currency debts exceeded 328 billion 469 billion as of the end of 2018 according to official data with private companies responsible for about two thirds private companies confronted a further 138 billion in foreign exchange debt due in the next year given that turkey s overall economic production was about 766 billion 1 1 trillion last year these numbers were disturbing i don t think companies will be able to pay back their debts says selva demiralp an economist who previously worked at the federal reserve bank in washington and now teaches at koc university in istanbul it may spill over to the local banking system they are the ones who are going to be on the hook for the bad loans some say the government has room to help companies in trouble officially government debt last year amounted to a manageable 30 per cent of annual economic output but turkey s financial workings are opaque and vulnerable to political manipulation mr erdogan has tapped state owned banks to finance favored projects partnerships between the state and private companies have kept debts off government ledgers advertisement these major projects when they fail it s going to be the government that is going to have to bail them out says mr hakura the chatham house expert the public debt numbers are a mirage the savviest companies are exploiting weakness as an opportunity reha medin global a real estate company with offices in a dozen turkish cities has seen domestic sales plunge given weak spending and mortgage rates running above 20 per cent a year everybody is waiting says the company s owner tamer cicekci 41 but his business has grown by focusing on buyers from iraq iran and china they have taken advantage of the weak lira to snap up properties at discounted prices sales to foreigners have increased 40 over the past year mr cicekci said but the forces of decline are so potent that even successful companies are vulnerable since it opened its first retail furniture shop in 2012 hamm design has been embraced by turks who favor its retro chic sensibility it now has seven shops as recently as last year its sales were doubling advertisement this year sales are down by one third while the cost of raw materials has soared the company has iced plans to open three new stores people have lost their jobs and they don t have security says idil ozbek 50 a co owner of the company they don t know what will happen in two months three months they think it s better i keep what i have and not spend any money near the border with georgia the weakness of the economy has ravaged businesses built on attracting

source of concern centers on tea the dominant local industry in april mustafa yuksel head of the union that represents 400 workers at three lipton factories received word from the company that it would not resume production at the arhavi plant once the harvest began in may i asked why mr yuksel recalled they said because of the economic crisis when he was quoted saying so in a local newspaper lipton s corporate parent unilever demanded that he keep quiet he says telling him that mr erdogan s administration had been angered by mention of a crisis unilever declined to answer questions while a spokeswoman in london gemma shaw emailed a brief statement the size and scale of our tea business around the world means that we regularly flex production up and down depending on the needs of the

atlanta july 8 2019 prnewswire invesco a leading asset manager with over 30 years of expertise in factor investing today released findings from its seventh invesco global sovereign asset management study an annual in depth report on the complex investment behavior of sovereign wealth funds and central banks which this year shows disenchantment with europe among sovereign investors this year s study was conducted face to face amongst 139 individual sovereign investors and central bank reserve managers across the globe representing 20 3 trillion of assets of which 71 are central banks 62 in 2018 reflecting their growing status as sovereign investors our authoritative annual study of the global sovereign segment shows sovereigns and central banks preparing for an end to the current economic cycle seen within two years leading them to be more defensive and diversified in their portfolios sovereigns have reduced equity exposure in favor of fixed income but continue to blaze a trail with rising long term commitments to private markets which for larger sovereigns now include direct investments in china and the technology sector said alex millar head of emea institutional invesco as trade wars continue to impact markets our research shows sovereigns shifting toward china demonstrating their ability to look past short term geo political issues and capitalize on core dynamics in this case the continued maturing of the world s second largest economy continued john galateria head of north america institutional invesco another particularly notable finding is the rapid development of esg implementation by sovereigns with their focus moving from g governance initiatives to more closely looking at e environmental initiatives additional key findings include sovereigns optimistic on china china s attractiveness rating for sovereign investors has improved more than any other major region since 2017 some 82 of sovereigns cited trade tensions as having had an influence on asset allocation decisions yet china s attractiveness as an investment destination over the next three years scored an average rating of 6 1 out of 10 among sovereign investors a marked increase on 2017 s 5 2 rating study figure 1 despite the fact that the study was carried out during a period of ongoing rhetoric on a trade war those surveyed saw china s pledge to improve safeguarding of intellectual property as grounds for optimism that some resolution of tensions would be reached the unique competitive dynamics of china are appealing for sovereigns seeking more diversification the survey found with equities continuing to be the asset class most favored approximately 90 of sovereigns with china exposure held chinese equities showing that the government s measures to open the market to foreign investors are bearing fruit fixed income allocations are also likely to increase with chinas inclusion in major bond indices and initiatives such as bond connect giving foreign investors access to the local bond market transparency remains a significant obstacle to higher allocations in china for sovereigns while for those sovereigns with no existing allocation to china investment restrictions and currency risk are seen as the main impediments study figure 2 investors see less economic attractiveness in europe a combination of slowing economic growth and perceptions of rising political risk have led to a decline in the perceived attractiveness of major european economies brexit is now influencing asset allocation decisions for 64 of sovereigns study figure 3 while continental eurozone internal politics seen as increasingly uncertain with the ascendance of populist movements in major european economies such as germany and italy are impacting asset allocation decisions for 46 this has resulted in europe falling out of favor with nearly one third of sovereign investors decreasing allocations to europe in 2018 and a similar number planning further decreases in 2019 only 13 of sovereigns plan on increasing allocations to europe this year compared to a 40 allocation to asia and 36 to emerging markets study figure 4 environmental considerations move esg firmly into the spotlight esg is an increasingly important issue for sovereigns and central banks since 2017 the percentage of sovereigns with a specific esg policy rose from 46 to 60 20 of central banks now have an esg policy compared to 11 in 2017 approaches to esg are increasingly sophisticated having moved beyond screening to incorporate more advanced forms of integration there has also been a shift in focus of the nature of esg activity while asset owners have in the past focused on issues of governance due to clearer risk and return benefits these factors are now often assumed by esg adopters for sovereigns environmental concerns are increasingly becoming the lead focus with carbon emissions and climate change the single most important esg issue renminbi finds a bigger place in central banks reserve portfolios as a group central banks believe the end of the economic cycle will be characterized by a gradual slowdown rather than an economic crisis however the uncertain market environment combined with an increasingly hawkish federal reserve led many of them to find perceived safety in increased allocations to deposits and in some cases gold central banks bought 651 5 tons of gold in 2018 the second highest annual total on record and up 74 from the year earlier1 over a third 35 of central banks increased allocations over the last three years with 32 expecting further increases over the next three years but overall gold holdings remain steady at around 4 of overall reserve portfolios respondents to the study reported additional challenges associated with gold as a reserve asset including volatility storage costs and the political implications of selling 75 of central banks agreed or strongly agreed that selling gold holdings would attract negative domestic media coverage in their country central banks continue to diversify away from the negative yields of government bonds especially in europe into bank deposits and away from the us dollar the main beneficiary has been the renminbi and between 2017 18 allocations to china s currency overtook the australian and canadian dollar with 43 of central banks now holding it in their portfolios compared to 40 in 2018 over a quarter 27 of central banks expect to continue to increase renminbi reserves in 2019 making it the most favored currency for the year ahead with increased allocations expected to be taken from the usd eur and gbp though usd remains the dominant reserve currency allocations reached a 5 year low falling from 62 7 of global currency reserves to 61 7 fixed income displaces equities as largest asset class for sovereigns 2018 was a challenging year for sovereigns as weak and volatile equity markets led to a decline in overall investment returns on average sovereign investors achieved returns of 4 in 2018 compared to 9 in 2017 despite the decrease in returns sovereigns performed well given negative returns from global equities which fell 8 7 in us dollar terms during the year according to msci world index the majority of sovereigns 89 anticipate the end of the economic cycle within the next two years this combined with volatility concerns and the prospect of negative returns from equities has led to increased fixed income allocations and more diversification in allocations to infrastructure real estate and private equity markets fixed income allocations increased to 33 in 2019 from 30 becoming sovereigns largest asset class meanwhile allocations to equities fell from 33 to 30 marking the end of a five year trend between 2013 and 2018 during which fixed income fell from 35 to 30 as equities posted strong gains challenging equity markets in 2018 highlighted the limitations of market cap weighted passive strategies as well as some more basic factor strategies some of the most popular factor strategies e g value and momentum performed below sovereign expectations during 2018 and some of those adopting a simple set and forget approach to their factor allocations reported negative returns this is encouraging a move away from a single factor approach towards multi factor positions that can

first a decline in manufacturing and then a slump in service industries now a broad spectrum inversion of the yield curve hitting its most critical metric this week unemployment finally starting to rise again a one year relentless housing decline across most of the nation and the world carmageddon pressing car dealers to offer big incentives once again just to hold sales flat shipping everywhere sinking rapidly broadly deteriorating general business conditions plus tariff troubles for the us throughout the world all of these economic stresses have gotten remarkably worst in just the past month at the same time the stock market has soared back up to its three time ceiling now four time and managed to clear microscopically above that level apparently the last recession was such a great recession the stock market believes more of the same would be the best thing that could happen and why not the last recession made 10 of the us richer and 1 fabulously richer investors it would appear couldn t be more delighted to see so many forces pushing the entire global economy us now fully included back into recession for another go at the best of times for the one percent crowd with their best interests in mind let s take a closer look at all that is happening on that downhill run to recession all the things that give investors sugar plum dreams at night about the fed being forced to inject more monetary narcotics into the market let me lay out all the recent hopeful signs that the economy is crashing just in time to force the fed s first interest rate cut after a couple of years of rising rates that cut of coke that the market is now demanding 1 factory orders manufacturing are in repetitious months of decline in may factory orders fell 0 7 month on month which is the third decline in four months april s decline was revised lower to 1 2 within those figures sales of transportation equipment plunged 4 6 transportation being particularly indicative of where the overall economy is going a look at the actual trend line makes the meaning of these drops much more apparent after months of decline the ism shows no signs of a bottom forming here s another view we are now the closest we ve been to actual economic contraction since the great recession up to now all talk has been about slowing growth now we are on the cusp of actual contraction which means the same thing as recession if it lasts six months or more what is seen for manufacturing in the reports above is consistent with recent results from the dallas fed manufacturing survey which crashed below the worst analysts estimates in june both are back in their contraction zones 2 services sector finally joins the fall many who have been seeing this decline play out over months in the manufacturing sector have been hoping that the services sector will save the day services have been holding up much better than manufacturing so perhaps that sector of industry would carry the economy over this slump however as you can see in the graph below services are no long doing much better anything below the 50 line represents economic contraction though serviced did see a minor uptick in june it was barely visible and still leaves the service sector very near the 50 line this keeps them just about at a three year low hardly encouraging given the massive business tax cuts in the us over the last year and a half that were accompanied with massively increased government spending at the same time employment in the services industry dropped by its most in sixteen months so all that boost is creating now apparent lift at all an improvement in service sector growth provides little cause for cheer as the survey data still indicate a sharp slowing in the pace of economic growth in the second quarter a major change since the first quarter has been a broadening out of the slowdown beyond manufacturing with the service sector growth now also reporting much weaker business activity and orders trends than earlier in the year hiring was hit as firms scaled back their expansion plans in the face of weaker than expected order inflows and gloomier prospects for the year ahead jobs growth was the weakest for over two years and future expectations across both services and manufacturing has slipped to the lowest seen since comparable data were first available in 2012 ihs markit the services sector employs more than 80 of all american workers but hey that s good for fed addicts right with momentum clearly fading it won t be long before the fed begins cutting interest rates said senior u s economist michael pearce of capital economics marketwatch yay let s all join in hoping the economy crashes spectacularly so stocks can benefit all over again from years of more free fed funds than they ve ever seen before the one percenters are already stocking champagne for that day when great recession 2 0 is finally announced 3 the yield curve just inverted at its most critical level the bond market flashed yet another warning signal for investors on wednesday that a downturn for the economy may be coming despite the s p 500 hitting new all time highs the yield on 30 year u s treasury bonds briefly dipped below the overnight fed funds rate a signal that has preceded the past five u s recessions yahoo finance economists have known for quite some time that yield curve inversions tend to be reliable predictors of business contractions recessions st louis fed 4 unemployment has begun to rise at last the first upticks in unemployment typically are one of the last events to happen before a recession begins so renewed hope for the one percent is not far off while the number of job layoffs remains near a half century low initial jobless claims have started to rise the four week monthly average of claims considered the more stable report has also begun to rise albeit incrementally the pace of hiring has dropped but the pace of firing has not yet risen with the unemployment rate at a nearly 50 year low of 3 6 good help is hard to find and companies are reluctant to let go of workers the economy would have to stumble badly to get firms to start handing out pink slips en masse marketwatch whenever unemployment has settled this low an uptick in joblessness soon begins and recession always begins shortly thereafter historically a trough in the unemployment rate also tends to be a reliable predictor of a business recession st louis fed well good then the trough is already forming and it doesn t have to form for more than 2 3 months before recession is here that uptick in job losses is particularly notable now in the bellwether small business sector where falling jobs haven t looked this bad since the great recession adp s worst plunge in jobs in this sector since 2010 in fact the only time jobs have been this hard to get is inside of a recession see horizontal line near top of the following graph 5 ipo insanity in the stock market is equal to that seen right at the dot com bust unprofitability is no obstacle ipos with negative earnings per share surpassed 80 in 2018 joining 2000 as the only period in which that dubious threshold has been reached in the last 28 years grant s interest rate observer all investors love a good unprofitable company right now like only one time before the last time it paid this well to be unprofitable was at the change of the millennium moments before everyone s 401k got wiped out in a big stock market bust is it any wonder unprofitable companies are coming on like gangbusters when we still have a stock market that falls because of relatively good news about a temporary reprieve in the decline of the job market the market has no interest in a good economy because the junky bulls crave only their next hit of fed meds if the fed doesn t deliver the dope later this month watch out below on the other hand the dot com bust tells us the first part of these recessions isn t even good for stock investors but it is the extremely long recovery period after the fall the has them all salivating that and the fact that they think they can somehow slide right over the recession part and just go straight into recovery mode good luck with that 6 housing continues its relentless decline speaking of another whacky ipo bubble we also have another whacky housing bubble the best of both of the last excellent recessions at the same time this has to have the one percenters salivating with the hope of more repos since i announced the housing decline had begun last summer housing has fallen in unusual places like the major tech centers of the us just to tie in all the better with that whacky tech profitless ipo bubble that has re inflated one might assume that the ipo wave has spurred another leg higher in silicon valley housing as tech employees cash out their newfound riches but that s not the case an analysis today from kate seabaugh senior manager at john burns real estate consulting finds that a nationwide slowdown in residential housing markets has hit the northern california tech epicenter particularly hard san jose san francisco and seattle saw net resale deceleration meaning the change in year over year price growth this year compared to last in home prices of 26 15 and 13 respectively in may for instance san jose went from a 20 percent year over year price gain in may 2018 to a 6 drop this year that s the worst three showings out of the 33 metro areas tracked by the firm grant s interest rate observer anecdotal evidence says two words never witnessed in palo alto real estate ads in the past thirty years are now common price reduced existing home sales have tumbled month after month longer now than any time since the great recession for those like my lonely crow who still deny the reality of a housing decline across the us just take a look at construction spending on a nationwide basis since i announced a year ago the housing decline had begun as the first i know of to do so i see a slump there i don t know why some can t if the housing market were growing contractors would be spending money the last time we saw a drop this long in residential construction was during the housing collapse that gave us the great recession here s another view of the same thing that shows how the decline is not abating but is rapidly accelerating the housing collapse has spread throughout the global economy right now too the global housing market is showing cracks those fissures could spread throughout the world wide economy potentially sending world wide gross domestic product or gdp to its lowest annual pace of in 10 years according to research from oxford economics a combined slump in house prices and housing investment in the major economies could cut world growth to a 10 year low an oxford economics proprietary gauge of housing conditions in the globe shows that home prices have declined by 10 and investments in houses have shrunk by 8 downturns in world housing markets have been important contributing factors to global recessions over the last thirty years most dramatically in 2007 2009 as a result the current slowdown in global housing is a cause for concern marketwatch 7 carmageddon morphs as it expands carmageddon has now spread to the rv market may rv shipments fell by double digits year to date rv shipments are down 22 y y free falling shipments could portend another recession seeking alpha as it turns out rvs are a luxury item for the middle class when times are good middle class people buy rvs when middle class people are preparing for harsher times or are in harsher times rvs are one of the first things to get scratched off the list of must haves during 2018 shipments fell off 4 for the year the downtrend continues at a steeper rate this year the decline continues in other american vehicles as well of course just as i ve said for months will continue to be the case analysts at rbc capital markets forecast steep declines for general motors co and ford motor co sales this month and also predicted some trouble for sales of the companies perennially popular pickup trucks marketwatch auto sales for june were projected to be 7 8 lower than a year ago and that is in spite of significant incentives being offered through dealers auto job cuts haven t been this high since the wind up of the great recession more than a decade ago hopes are running high that potential interest rate cuts by the federal reserve will support the auto and housing sectors two parts of the economy that are sensitive to borrowing costs the risk though is rising that any relief won t come until after these critical leaders of the current economic cycle have already fallen into contraction the rapid rate at which auto layoffs are rising suggest a spillover into the broader economy it s one thing to have a continuation of losses in the beleaguered retail sector but the loss of high paying jobs in both autos and industrials threaten to further hobble the housing market seeking alpha you can see in the following chart the slope we ve started down and how quickly it can fall off a cliff once we get a little below the present point 8 freight is a runaway truck down a steep mountain road naturally if sales are pulling the economy down you d expect to see freight going down looks almost as steep as a cliff from as high as a mountain to me 9 business conditions tightening quickly the freight figures fit with morgan stanley s assessment of overall business conditions which haven t been this bad since well once again 2008 during the great recession 10 trade winds entering the doldrums all of the above slowdowns have been exasperated by trade conditions which have not been helped by the trump tariff wars u s trade deficit in goods jumps in may the surprisingly larger may trade deficit will be a modest drag on second quarter gdp a larger deficit is a negative for u s economic growth the oomph has gone out of trade and the us trade deficit has actually gotten worse maybe recession isn t just around the corner any longer all of this could actually make one wonder if we are already in a recession gary shilling an economist and financial analyst who is credited with predicting several recessions over the past 40 years thinks the u s is in a relatively mild slump i think we re probably already in a recession shilling points to declining industrial production feeble job growth the federal reserve bank of new york s recession probability chart the organization for economic co operation and development s leading economic indicators weak housing data usa today no wonder american sentiment is turning sour i don t put any stock in sentiment as being much of a predictor or driver of where the economy is going because i think it is more of a following trend as such however it is still useful for seeing how many people are now agreeing with my start of the year proposition of a summer recession especially since so few agreed back when i made it according to bankrate com 40 of americas now believe a recession will begin in less than a year with half of those believing it has already begun rising stock market notwithstanding the experts of course believe a recession is at least 1 2 years away of course few if any experts saw the last recession coming even when it had already begun so if you re going to await the phd experts you re not going to know we re in a recession until it s over you ll feel it but you won t know it all that remains to happen now to give the one percenters an instant replay of the glorious great recession is for the fed to make its first interest rate cut because each of the last two huge recessions with their attending stock market crashes began right after the fed made its first rate cut cut following a period of rate increases so permabulls keep hoping the fed makes its first move in july and you may get all the free drugs you are hoping for but if you think you are going to skip over the painful recession part where stocks lose big it hasn t ever work that way so good luck with that and don t be a baby about it when the pain comes because you asked for it no pain no gain in the world of free fed meds
this is likely to be a cautious week in the markets across the board including currencies bonds equities and commodities but especially in the rice grain and cotton markets u s weather patterns in 2019 have deviated significantly from the norm leaving market participants to speculate on actual harvested acreage and yield and final production for u s corn soybeans rice and cotton those who follow changes in global weather patterns closely and their potential causes like the solar minimum will point out an increased probability of a global rice grain and cotton production shortfall in 2019 and coming years due to changing weather patterns the great power competition off again and now on again trade negotiations between the u s and china now appear to be back on again the week of july 8 2019 the great power competition between the world s two super powers the united states and the people s republic of china is extremely real and will intensify in coming years i believe it is fair to say republican and democrat leadership both agree that maintaining u s global economic financial human rights political and military leadership is an absolute priority increasingly the great power competition a trump administration term will be referred to as the new cold war by analysts news media and others the new cold war presently is not an appropriate characterization of the building economic social political and military competition between the world s two largest economies and two largest trading partners but that could well change with time related plan ahead to take advantage of run in corn prices the cold war 1946 1991 was a period of extreme geopolitical tension between the soviet union and the united states and their respective allied countries in which the u s goal was to maximize national security and economic activity between u s allies and contain soviet territorial expansion and global influence and domination goals speaking broadly the 1946 to 1991 cold war ended with the fall of communist rule in central and eastern europe in the late 1980s and the collapse of the ussr in 1991 the trump administration has key concerns about chinese economic aggression toward the u s and is seeking to renegotiate its relationship the congressional research service crs in a recent us china in focus report says in 2018 china was the united states largest merchandise trading partner with two way trade at 660 billion third largest export market at 120 billion and largest source of imports at 540 billion china is also the largest foreign holder of u s

cyber theft of u s trade secrets market outlook for the week beginning july 8 2019 soybeans we continue watching the price action given a friendly usda u s acreage report and production uncertainties but burdensome global stocks and demand uncertainties remain soybean prices likely remain in a sideways trading range of 7 77 to 9 39 per bushel the july 5 2019 close was 8 95 per bushel down 28 50 cents on the week or 3 09 percent soybean prices need to close the week of july 8 2019 above 9 39 per bushel for me to have reason to start considering a more bullish bias charts b10 to b13 long grain rice prices remaining above september s 11 19 per cwt or 5 04 per bushel keeps prices trending to the upside june 28 2019 september close 11 50 per cwt or 5 18 per bushel usda s current bearish u s

strength until fundamentals are more supportive of higher prices corn closed the week of july 1 2019 at 4 42 per bushel up 10 75 cents per bushel for the week or 2 49 percent with key support at 4 39 per bushel if corn ends the week of july 8 2019 above 4 39 i need to consider adjusting my outlook charts b14 to b17 wheat near term wheat price direction remains a key function of corn prices wheat closed the week of july 1 2019 at 5 15 per bushel up 12 25 cents on the week or 2 32 percent and will likely fall below key support of 5 08 per bushel the week of july 8 2019 but ending the week above 5 08 per bushel would be price supportive while losing support at 5 08 and 4 76 per bushel will return wheat to a bearish footing charts b25 to b28 cotton price weakness remains problematic cotton prices need to hold above 64 cents per pound the week of july 8 2019 or serious price weakness could emerge july 5 2019 close 69 cents per pound up 0 74 cents on the week or 1 12 percent charts b21 to b24 wtic light crude oil july 5 2019 close 57 51 per barrel down 0 96 cents on the week or 1 64 percent with a trading range presently of 48 00 to 59 88 per barrel charts b6 to b9 geopolitical dynamics coupled with possible supply disruptions make this market challenging for the world s most talented analysts so be highly respectful of price action crb index july 5 2019 close 178 up 1 70 on the week or 0 95 percent this index needs to close above 183 the week of july 8 2019 for a bullish bias to be considered otherwise the index is likely to retest its previous low at 168 the index still has a bearish bias with global deflationary forces remaining problematic with many of the world s commodities still surplus burdened with the ongoing global realignment of the world s currency bond equity and commodity markets and with a number of key global policy disputes limitations remain to this index s near term upside unless oil prices regain their upward advance charts b1 to b5 interest

charts a1 to a4 global governments and central banks are very focused on minimizing any global economic weakness and will remain accommodative in the second half of 2019 which will likely limit any significant upside given time the potential to revisit the july 2016 low of 1 43 is likely the november 2018 high was 3 24 that said global economic and geopolitical dynamics coupled with global government and central bank intervention will define the 10 year u s treasury yield or interest rate u s dollar index the u s dollar index gained 1 28 percent the week of july 1 2019 up 1 22 which was likely due to correcting its downside move safe haven status for global investors and a positive july 5th jobs report continued strength at this point would move the dollar index back into an uptrend which would likely draw an aggressive response from president trump toward the u s federal reserve charts a5 to a8 the dollar is currently at 96 89 on july 5 2019 a lower dollar would be supportive of

mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome back micheal pento president and founder of pento portfolio strategies michael s a well known money manager and a terrific market commentator and author of the book the coming bond market collapse how to survive the demise of the u s debt market he s a regular guest right here on the money metals podcast and we always love having him on michael thanks for the time again today and welcome back michael pento great to be back on your program mike gleason well michael when we spoke last in march you noted something very important that being the equity markets were celebrating the fed s shift to a more dovish posture at that time the fed hadn t actually done much they were telegraphing a pause in rate hikes but still selling assets the celebration continues today but in point of fact the fed still hasn t done a whole lot it s all about expectations and right now everyone is sure they will be cutting rates in july they re getting a lot of mileage out of a little more than some jawboning the s p 500 is up 20 from its december lows what do you make of these expectations is the fomc going to meet them with some aggressive rate cutting or do you think people are going to quickly find out that talk is cheap and the economy is headed for recession regardless of what the fed does michael pento well first of all the market s doing well this year but that s because the calendar changed and the market went up after going down 30 the russell was down almost 30 28 the s p was down 20 so you pretty much just reversed what happened in the fall of 2018 so this is not a runaway stock market by any means and people are going crazy how well the market s doing it s actually i think it s putting in a triple top that would be my best analysis of the situation and the reason why i say that well before i go into that let me answer your question first so you re asking me will the fed cut rates i believe the fed will cut rates later this year i think they ll probably go 25 basis points in july and the reason why i think they ll go 25 basis points in july is that they are trying to catch up to what the bond market has already done so if you look at the bond market the fed funds money market rates right now the effective fed funds rate is about 2 38 and the 10 year treasury is below 2 so you have a pretty significantly inverted yield curve which really hurts banks profits and diminishes their rationale when it comes to making a loan in other words they re not going to make a lot of loans when they don t have a lot of profit margins and they think the economy s slowing because of the reduction in nominal rates on the long end of the yield curve and they don t want to make loans to people who probably aren t going to pay the loan back because then their capital will go away so that s the reason why i think the fed is going to cut rates in july but the market is 100 convinced that they re going to cut rates probably as much as 50 basis points so two or three rate cuts this year and i will say that that is a possibility however if the fed is aggressively cutting rates it s because the global economic recession is well underway that would be the rationale behind cutting interest rates so aggressively don t forget that at the end of last year we had a fed that was absolutely avowed to raise rates to 3 and then another 50 basis points so 3 was what they deemed as being neutral and then they were going to go above 50 basis points right you remember this and you ll also recall that the balance sheet withdrawal process the burning of cash was supposed to be on autopilot in other words the fed s destruction of its balance sheet to the tune of maybe two trillion dollars was supposed to be on autopilot that all changed so they ve gone a pretty trenchant difference they ve gone more than a country mile as they say from being one central bank is going to raise rates to three and a half percent and drained the balance sheet down from four and a half trillion to around two trillion to one that is now supposed to be aggressively cutting rates i ll just say one more thing about this the fact that the federal reserve is going to be cutting rates they have two and a half percent less than two and a half percent before they go to zero so the question i have and i don t have the answer i have a model that tells them what the answer will be but i am willing to guess based upon the myriad and the plethora of evidence that i have that merely cutting rates by 25 basis points in july is not going to be nearly enough to stem the tide of a global recession which by the way i believe has already begun mike gleason you recently wrote a great piece on corporate debt stating that it s a bubble that will eventually pop you made a comparison between today s corporate debt and the housing bubble of 2007 and the dot com bubble of 2000 you pointed out that both ben bernanke and alan greenspan attempted to shirk responsibilities for the massive bubbles the fed creates the claim was that nobody can identify a bubble before it bursts we know that isn t exactly true you ve done it and anyone willing to take an objective look can see that debt is one of the next bubbles likely to burst the obligations are so large that they simply cannot be paid talk about the bubble in corporate debt if you would and what would you think are some signs that listeners should be watching for that maybe the reckoning is about to arrive michael pento i have to laugh when i hear people tell me this is time is much better than 2008 because in 2008 don t you know that there was all kinds of malfeasance in the banking system and people were making loans to people who couldn t pay back those loans mortgages that were going to default but there was only about one and a half trillion dollars worth of subprime mortgage debt but i went and did the numbers myself and added up triple b debt leveraged loans and junk bonds and triple b is just one notch above junk and basically the covenants behind these triple b loans make them essentially junk that number is 5 4 trillion dollars and what makes me laugh is when i look back and i hear people on cnbc and all the financial networks all the pundits come out the carnival barkers will tell you that in 2019 there are no massive dislocations there are no excesses in the economy well how do you explain the fact that there are now 13 trillion dollars worth of sovereign debt that has a minus sign in front of it is it normal for a japanese a swiss and a german 10 year note to have a negative yield think about that central banks have gone so insane concurrently that they have now forced bond yields so low that going out 10 years they get paid to borrow and that hasn t caused any dislocations or malformations in the stock market or the junk bond market or the leveraged loan market or the housing market or the stock market that is insane prima facie it s a prima facie case for insanity in my opinion mike gleason let s talk about china for a bit china has always been a tough one for us to evaluate there have been people speculating that chinese central bankers have blown a massive bubble of their own and the bursting of that bubble is imminent but if they were close to a crisis they ve done a pretty good job of keeping the wheels on thus far you ve been watching developments in the chinese banking sector and perhaps things are starting to get serious there the central bank of china recently took control of a chinese bank when it failed there are certainly other banks then buried in bad debts what are you expecting from china in the months ahead and what you think it will mean for investors here in the u s michael pento well you have to understand just to stay at 36 000 feet china quadrupled their debt since 2007 and when any nation not just china but any nation and by the way there has been no nation that has done that in the history of mankind but any nation that will quadruple the amount of existing debt outstanding in 12 years and have done so by an edict from the central government is sitting on a massive pile of unproductive loans that will go bankrupt baoshang bank is just one example this is replete throughout china and even in hong kong where their banking system is many many times the size of their gdp so you re going to have a situation where and this is by the way speaking parenthetically as i tend to do why i am bearish on the global economy not because of trade conflicts or conflagrations so much more to the fact that china can no longer be the engine of global growth responsible for one third of global growth since 2008 they can t do it anymore because they re sitting on 40 trillion dollars worth of debt dung that they cannot pay back and if china s not the global engine of the world then europe is going to suffer it might surprise you to know maybe not you but your audience and certainly those that watch mainstream financial media it might surprise everybody to know that japan europe the u k and china are all in a manufacturing recession now that is not something that michael pento came up to talk about on money metals that is public information released by governments they re publicly released purchasing managers indexes they all show that all of those countries i mentioned and much of the developed world is in a manufacturing recession now i want to pose this question to you how can china which was erstwhile in the habit of providing one third of global growth by building out massive unproductive fixed asset investments how can china possibly be growing at 6 if their manufacturing base is in a recession the answer is that they are not growing at 6 china is lucky if they re growing at all because china has a shrinking labor force and plunging productivity and if china isn t growing then europe s in deep trouble and asia s in trouble and the korean nation is in trouble and japan is in trouble and even in the united states our manufacturing the new order component just released for june the manufacturing new orders component of ism was 50 flat no growth so we are in the midst of a global manufacturing recession we are in the middle of according to fact set which is the definitive voice on earnings on the s p 500 we are in the middle of an earnings recession that s going to last for three quarters so it s not the second derivative of earnings growth is falling so we re not going to grow from 24 earnings to maybe 20 or 15 or 5 earnings growth is going to be negative according to fact set for three quarters in a row you add that to a manufacturing recession and then you add it to the fact that we have a stock market that is near all time record high valuations if you look at price for sales if you look at total market cap to gdp i m not trying to scare people i manage money for a living so i can t short the market and buy gold always and hope to be in business so i have a model that tells me when to get net short and when to overweight gold which we are at this point because by the way when you live in a world where interest rates are going towards zero and below the carrying cost of gold doesn t look so bad i could put a bar of gold in my safe at home that earns no interest and i can lament the fact that i m not sitting in a bank earning 10 with my cash but if i m sitting at my house looking at my bar of gold and saying gee i m forgoing almost nothing at the bank and because interest rates are negative in a real sense because inflation is the goal of every horrific central banker on the planet i m actually making money much more than i would in the bank because gold for 5 000 years has maintained its purchasing power so i m not trying to scare people i m just telling people that this is not normal it is not normal to have one dollar worth of sovereign debt that has a negative yield and it s certainly beyond the twilight zone to have 13 trillion dollars worth of sovereign debt with a negative sign in front of it it is certainly completely abnormal to have the stock market at a record high valuation when you re in the middle of an earnings and manufacturing recession globally so if you think i m trying to scare you you re wrong but if you think you want to go and call your local broker and put your money into a closet index fund and go to sleep at night don t be surprised if very soon you wake up and find out you re in the middle of an event much like we saw in december of 2018 or october of 2008 or march of 2000 where are you at the cusp especially in those last two i mentioned the recession of 2000 and the recession of 2008 where you are on the cusp of going off the cliff in the stock market and this time around we don t have the tools available to readily pull us out of deflationary depression because as i just mentioned bond yields are already in the toilet of history so there is not going to be any rapid relief from plummeting bond yields around the world and there certainly isn t going to be this fiscal response coming from countries which are already massive overly indebted we have a problem it s going to take a lot of fiscal and monetary wrangling to get out of that takes time but in the interim i wouldn t be surprised to see the stock market lose half of its value again for the third time since the year 2000 mike gleason obviously a lot of black swans circling about and certainly a number of very interesting situations that we could see unfold here and obviously confidence is a big reason that the central bankers have been able to sort of get us out these messes in the past and you ve got to wonder if anybody s going to have any confidence in them this time around well michael i wanted to kind of further the point on gold before we let you go these markets have been pretty range bound for a while talking about gold specifically silver as well gold finally broke out to a five year high recently driven primarily by escalating tariffs and maybe perhaps the fed will be cutting rates do you see gold finally starting a new trend higher here or are we going to drop back into the range michael pento that s not a prediction any longer it s the fact you just said it it s a fact gold massively broke out of that 1 350 ceiling that it was staring at it went all the way well into the 1 400s it pulled back here recently but what a wonderful buying opportunity in my humble opinion the fact is that we live in a world where money is going to be mostly free for a very long time because central banks have gotten into the business of eviscerating markets so for instance in japan the bank of japan now owns 80 of all etfs and over 50 of the entire japanese government bond market so when do i have to worry about the bank of japan raising rates they can t even get out of the business of buying etfs manipulating their stock market or trying to manipulate their stock market higher likewise with the ecb when are we going to talk about raising rates they threatened they were going to raise rates but now they re talking about lowering rates and getting back into qe and the same can be said for the united states we were talking about draining the balance sheet and raising rates back to normal now not being five and a quarter percent like it was in 2007 but they re talking about trying to get to three and a half and they barely got to two and a half and now we re supposedly heading back to zero so the competition for a real currency a real money a real store of value is going to increase exponentially and why would people go anywhere else but what s proven for millennia to be the best place to store your wealth and your purchasing power so i predict that rates going to be well it s not a prediction because rates are already at zero i think the united states will soon be back to zero and then after that back into quantitative easing which means you re going to get a much higher rate and by the way you should understand that if rates are zero and you get even one basis point of inflation real interest rates are negative but i can t see them stopping until they get 2 inflation so your real interest rates will be 2 but that s the way the government measures inflation and they do a hell of a bad job doing that so if the government s measuring it at two it s probably closer to eight you re going to get profoundly negative real interest rates which is rocket fuel for gold and why anybody would have nay faith in any fiat currency not just hating the dollar but how could you have faith in the euro over the dollar or the yen or the yuan you have to have the belief that gold will rise and will continue to rise in all currencies and i think that dynamic is just getting started mike gleason all these central bankers are pretty much going from the same playbook this keynesian world that we live in and never ending money creation well we ll leave it there for today michael we appreciate the time as always and love getting your comments before we let you go though please tell people a little bit about pento portfolio strategies and then how they can contact you and then also follow you more closely michael pento well great so the website is pentoport com on the website you can see all of my media appearances and you can get my weekly commentary for 49 a year you can get access to a podcast that really gets into the minutia and the data points that you absolutely need to know about what s really going on in the world you can t get that from mainstream financial media that much anymore really then you can become a client because i actually have a portfolio that s designed to protect your principal while we wait for this occurrence to happen i believe a minimum of 35 downturn in the market and then i also believe most importantly after if you want to have a chance to actually protect your principal make a little money while you wait hopefully then capitalize on the destruction of this mirage of an economy and a market on the backend of that i think we re going to have we will engender a protracted period of stagflation like we ve never before seen so it s going to be the 70s on steroids but for a long time there s a model on how to invest for that so you have to know when to buy bonds and when to buy stocks what kind of stocks when to be short stocks all these things are imperative because 80 of the stock market now 80 is on autopilot just like the fed s balance was supposed to be 80 of the market is passive investing strategies in other words strategies are designed by machines to mimic the momentum of the stock market and when that breaks you re going to see nothing but offers and no humans to support the stock market no fundamental reason no fiscal no monetary reason will come in time to protect you that s where i come in and if you re interested in capitalizing on that and then after the central banks master the business of destroying your currency and they get to the 2 but it will really be more like double digit inflation you have to know what to own so if you re interested in that my email is the website is pentoport com and the office number here is 732 772 9500 mike gleason money can be made in any markets and obviously preserving wealth may be also the big key and somebody like michael of course has a great handle on all of that and definitely i think you should take his advice there well thanks michael i hope you have a great 4th of

spread this news aljazeera the move was bold and many did not see it coming in a bid to defend the new and fledgling zimbabwean dollar against black market speculation the country s finance minister on june 25 outlawed using united states dollars and other foreign currencies in local transactions when news of the policy broke harare based independent economist john robertson thought it was a bad practical joke i am not fully convinced it s genuine robertson told al jazeera this idea is so bad it s a cause for concern i fear it may be an attempt in government to cause someone embarrassment we hope it is revised zimbabwe s finance minister mthuli ncube had hinted on several occasions that a new zimbabwean dollar was in the works the country had already made a move toward it earlier this year when it introduced an interim currency the real time gross settlement rtgs dollar or zimdollar but a decade after devastating hyperinflation prompted the country to dollarise its economy by allowing the us greenback and other foreign currencies to be used as legal tender many zimbabweans are sceptical about the stability of the country s new currency and worried about what could happen if their livelihoods are tied to it not even six months old the fledgling zimdollar has suffered from speculative attacks that saw its value plummet by more than 150 before recovering for 67 year old david mkono the country s new currency has just added to his myriad problems mkono worked as a boilerman for zimbabwe s power utility company for 47 years paying into his pension in us dollars from 2009 until he retired last year at retirement i was going to get us 223 about r3 100 per month i am not sure how much i am going to get now with the new changes mkono told al jazeera i really don t know how to value this because i don t know what 223 is now in rtgs some economists see zimbabwe s swift outlawing of the us dollar as justified given most countries that dollarise their economies fail to successfully reintroduce a new local currency it s a chance to disprove the notion that once an economy dollarises it can t have its currency ever many countries have failed kipson gundani a harare based economist and executive director of the ceo africa roundtable told al jazeera while dollarisation can help stabilise an economy in the throes of hyperinflation there are drawbacks local currencies are a powerful symbol of sovereignty and national identity countries that dollarise also lose the power to directly influence their own economy through monetary policy but zimbabwe s economy is not exactly fertile ground for a new currency to take root the country is likely in recession and the international monetary fund predicts the economy could contract 5 2 his year industry is operating at less than half of its installed capacity reliance on imports which become more expensive as the local currency weakens is stubbornly high mkono who has two children aged 12 and 8 says soaring inflation is already making it difficult for him to provide food for his family the prices have gone up rapidly in the shops he said when i get my monthly allowance we realise that we can t buy basic things like mielie meal after paying for things like school fees mealie meal is zimbabwe s staple food and is made from maize or corn but some economists maintain that zimbabwe had to take bold steps to defend its sovereign currency even if conditions weren t perfect even if fundamentals were not yet right the use of multi currencies was not sustainable said gundani we are not producing optimally we are vulnerable on the import cover and our economy is in recession on a gdp level but we are coming from a background where the rtgs was already in circulation along with other currencies and was depreciating against the us dollar at an alarming rate and while confidence in the new currency may be in short supply gundani believes that if policymakers show discipline the zimdollar may yet have a shot last week the reserve bank of zimbabwe removed us 1 4bn about r19bn from circulation to shore up the zimdollar and announced it would inject us 48 7m about r689m into the economy a day after the announcement and the mop up exercise the zimdollar recovered some 40 of its value against the us dollar on the black market i believe this is an opportunity to create that confidence by doing the right things and desisting from doing the things that killed the first zimbabwe dollar such as printing money to finance budget deficits said gundani it s a big gamble that we cannot afford to lose

the united kingdom s financial conduct authority proposed to ban the marketing and sale in or from the uk to retail persons of derivatives and exchange traded notes based on cryptocurrencies and utility digital tokens including futures on bitcoin currently authorized for trading in the united states separately the us commodity futures trading commission and the chicago board of trade sanctioned a hong kong based hedge fund for a one day position limits violation among its penalties the fund agreed to pay back losses it mitigated by liquidating its positions in excess of federal limits as a result the following matters are covered in this week s edition of bridging the week uk financial regulator proposes to ban crypto derivative sales to retail clients us congressional committee recommends facebook libra moratorium cftc and cbot both fine hk based hedge fund for position limits violation ifus settles with spoofer and more video version article version briefly uk financial regulator proposes to ban crypto derivative sales to retail clients us congressional committee recommends facebook libra moratorium the united kingdom s financial conduct authority proposed to ban the sale marketing and distribution in or from the uk to retail persons of all derivatives and exchange traded notes referencing unregulated cryptoassets that can be widely exchanged on cryptoasset platforms or other forums generally the proposed ban would include derivatives and etns based on cryptocurrencies and so called utility tokens to the extent they are created on public blockchains and are readily transferable the ban would not include derivatives or etns referencing security tokens digital tokens that are unregulated but not widely transferrable e g tokens used on a private blockchain or tokens that constitute e money and are subject to the fca s electronic money regulations e g potentially stablecoins futures options and contracts for differences are types of derivatives that would be included in the proposed ban the proposed ban would also not extend to professional clients or eligible counterparties as defined under the fca s client categorization rules click here to access the fca s conduct of business sourcebook 3 5 1 regarding professional clients and 3 6 1 regarding eligible counterparties the fca s prohibition would apply to affected products sold distributed or marketed in or from the uk to retail clients and sales to uk clients from the european economic area even where the clients seek such products proactively however it appears that retail clients would be authorized to obtain affected products proactively from non eea sources the proposed ban would also prevent uk brokers from selling to uk retail clients affected products that might be traded abroad lawfully e g bitcoin futures currently authorized for trading in the united states on commodity futures trading commission designated contract markets the fca claimed that it was proposing its ban because of 1 the complexity of the affected cryptoassets and the lack of transparency around their valuation 2 the prevalence of market abuse and financial crime in the secondary market for cryptoassets e g cyber theft 3 retail customers apparent lack of knowledge and understanding regarding affected cryptoassets and 4 particular characteristics of the relevant derivatives and etns including leverage and volatility of the underlying assets the fca presented various statistical analyses it claimed supported its concerns according to the fca some of these observations demonstrate that affected cryptoasset markets are not driven by external factors such as usage or technological developments but instead are driven by speculation akin to gambling the fca acknowledged that if adopted its proposal might encourage retail clients to invest directly in unregulated tokens or for impacted authorized i e registered firms to encourage retail clients to opt up to professional client status or move their accounts to affiliated non uk entities fca expects that adoption of its proposal would potentially avoid consumer losses between gb 75 million and gb 234 3 million the fca claimed it considered but rejected recommending the use of mandatory risk disclosures as an alternative to a ban the fca said this is because consumers are unlikely to follow advice from authoritative sources moreover he continued offer of products by firms with fca authorisations may also perpetuate a false sense of safety the fca will accept comments on its proposal through october 3 2019 unrelatedly congresswoman maxine waters chairwoman of the united states house committee on financial services and various subcommittee chairpersons requested that facebook and its partners immediately consent to a moratorium on the development and introduction of libra its proposed cryptocurrency and associated initiatives last month facebook published a white paper describing libra whose stated goal is to create a secure scalable blockchain and global virtual currency to help individuals currently outside the financial system benefit from an efficient payment system and to help reduce payment transaction costs for others click here for details in the my view commentary to the article global aml standards setter says countries should require virtual asset service providers to obtain and transmit certain information regarding senders and recipients for all virtual asset transfers in the june 23 2019 edition of bridging the week a moratorium is warranted wrote ms waters because libra raises serious privacy trading national security and monetary policy concerns for not only facebook s over 2 billion users but also for investors consumers and the broader global economy ms waters indicated that during the moratorium the house committee on financial services would hold hearings on cryptocurrencies generally and explore legislative solutions regardless of facebook s response to the moratorium call a hearing regarding the libra proposal is scheduled by the house committee on financial services for july 17 in other legal and regulatory matters involving cryptoassets cftc approves new clearing house as first derivatives clearing organization for fully collateralized deliverable virtual currency futures the cftc approved eris clearing llc as the first derivatives clearing organization authorized to clear fully collateralized virtual currency futures contracts that may be settled by the making or taking of delivery of cryptocurrencies in 2011 the cftc approved eris exchange llc eris clearing s indirect parent company as a designated contract market marketed together as erisx eris clearing anticipates offering the clearing of digital asset futures contracts traded on eris exchange beginning later in 2019 erisx began offering spot virtual currency contracts earlier this year among conditions for its dco registration eris clearing must obtain and endeavor to maintain to the extent commercially reasonable insurance for the theft or loss of participant cryptocurrency collateral must disclose to any potential clearing member material risks associated with the clearing of fully collateralized virtual currency futures and within three years of its dco order must have an independent certified public accountant review its internal controls and provide the accountant s report to the cftc eris clearing must also have an independent cpa audit its virtual currency balances annually and must provide to the cftc any audit report of internal controls it may obtain from any third party service provider used in connection with the custody or storage of cryptocurrencies for clearing members eris clearing was required to demonstrate compliance with 17 core principles under applicable law to obtain its dco status including establishing standards and procedures to protect members and participants funds implementing and maintaining adequate and appropriate risk management capabilities and system safeguards click here for background on these core principles contemporaneously with its receipt of dco status eris clearing also received certain no action relief from the cftc s division of clearing and risk from various requirements ordinarily required by dcos that clear margined products staff concluded that eris clearing would not be obligated to perform these requirements because of its fully collateralized clearing model bitfinex repays us 100 million of us 700 million tether loan subject of ny ag lawsuit the cryptocurrency exchange bitfinex announced that it repaid us 100 million of its outstanding loan facility to tether the company managing the tether stablecoin previously the office of the attorney general for the state of new york obtained an ex parte order from a new york state court prohibiting companies associated with bitfinex and tether from accessing loaning or encumbering in any way us dollar reserves supporting tether digital coins the ny ag claimed that the same individuals ultimately own and operate both bitfinex and tether as well as their related companies among other things charged the ny ag executives of bitfinex and tether agreed for tether to provide bitfinex a line of credit of up to us 900 million sourced from the us dollar reserves supporting tether in order to help meet bitfinex s customers withdrawal demands however this arrangement asserted the ny ag was made without disclosure to tether holders at the time of its lawsuit claimed the ny ag bitfinex had borrowed us 700 million from tether utilizing tether supporting balances click here for background on the ny ag s lawsuit against bitfinex and tether in the article ny court upholds restriction on stablecoin transferring tethered funds to affiliated international exchange but limits time period of prohibition in the may 19 2019 edition of bridging the week my view on december 12 1980 a small start up company apple computer inc launched an initial public offering where it raised less than us 100 million through the sale of 4 6 million shares priced at us 22 investors throughout the united states were able to participate in this ipo however individual investors of one state massachusetts were famously barred from participating this was because the state s regulators said apple was too risky an enterprise for its citizens to invest in and banned the ipo under regulations designed to eradicate highfliers that don t have solid earnings foundations last friday apple closed at over us 204 share after multiple share splits throughout its history and the company s market capitalization hovered between us 900 billion and 1 trillion click here for a representative article describing apple s ipo and massachusetts s ban in retrospect massachusetts clearly got it wrong its fear of apple was grounded in a lack of understanding its prevention of massachusetts individual residents to participate in this ipo was a misguided application of the doctrine of in loco parentis in place of the parents and in retrospect it did not know better at all than ordinary citizens it appears equally condescending for the fca to propose banning derivatives based on cryptocurrencies for the entire class of retail persons solely because it believes that such persons generically cannot possibly understand the risks of the product this particularly appears to be the case when the fca concedes that its ban may not be entirely effective either in precluding retail persons from obtaining access to derivatives through non uk based sellers or preventing retail persons from purchasing spot cryptocurrencies directly i have no view on whether any individual cryptocurrency will be around in its current form in 5 10 or more years let alone whether the price of any particular virtual currency will rise or fall no one can dispute that the prices of cryptocurrencies have been highly volatile moreover it is more than likely that additional virtual currencies will be lost through external hacks and internal fraud at intermediaries if not through design flaws of some cryptocurrencies themselves notwithstanding if the fca is concerned about the integrity of cryptocurrencies and derivatives based on them it should draft clearer disclosures and develop and impose appropriate standards on the marketers and sellers of such products rather than banning access by retail persons outright this is the approach the cftc has taken in the us in recently approving dcms dcos and swap execution facilities to trade and clear virtual currency derivatives and of the national futures association in mandating disclosures to all customers by futures commission merchants and introducing brokers that engage in virtual currency transactions click here for details regarding the nfa advisory in the article national futures association proposes interpretive notice requiring fcm ib cta and cpo disclosures regarding virtual currency activity in the july 27 2018 edition of between bridges the effective date of the nfa notice was october 31 2018 the fca might even consider suitability standards that could require sellers to preclude certain individual retail purchasers who fail to satisfy certain minimum standards but make these prohibitions individual focused and not across an entire class banning derivatives for a generic group of purchasers and sellers all retail persons regardless of individual suitability is wrong this is especially the case where from the outset other alternatives exist to acquire cryptoasset exposure that retail persons desiring exposure can pursue it is far better for a regulator to establish standards for derivatives on cryptocurrencies that can assist all investors and recognizes differences in individual capabilities hopefully the fca gets it better for retail persons in 2019 than massachusetts got it for its

calculation methodology the clearing house division of the chicago mercantile exchange proposed to adopt a new framework to calculate initial margin requirements for cme cleared products a filtered historical value at risk methodology termed hvar hvar will calculate the maximum potential loss that could be incurred by a portfolio and thus determine initial margin requirements by 1 reviewing the actual losses that would have been incurred by the portfolio during a given period of time and 2 adjusting the historical data to adjust for the conditions existing during the given period e g high volatility and the market conditions currently in effect in a submission to the commodity futures trading commission cme group said that hvar will be a single unified framework capable of supporting all cme futures and options as well as swaps and cash products if desired and will be able to capture liquidity and concentration risks beyond the risks posed by changes in the market value of positions ultimately hvar will replace the standard portfolio analysis of rate framework span that has been used to calculated initial margin requirements since 1988 cme group proposes to apply its new framework to all cme cleared products other than interest rate swaps and over the counter foreign exchange swaps initially cme group will apply its new framework to 150 major energy futures and options products and extend its new framework to other products over time when rolling out hvar cme plans to run both span and hvar in a parallel production for at least six months finra sanctions member for not reviewing trading alerts that identified excessive trading by banned salesperson summit brokerage services inc a broker dealer registered with the securities and exchange commission and

salesperson who subsequently was banned by finra according to finra from january 2012 through march 2017 summit s procedures required it to review trade alerts from clearing brokers to evaluate its registered representatives trading activity however claimed finra during this time the firm s compliance principals did not review such alerts related to turnover and cost to equity ratios instead they solely conducted manual reviews of trade blotters to detect for potential excessive trading moreover during the relevant time the review process did not detect that one salesperson solely identified by finra as cj had excessively traded 14 accounts including one for a retired customer with a net worth of less than us 500 000 who paid more than us 61 000 in commissions and had a cost to equity ratio in excess of 27 cj recommended 267 trades for this customer over a three year period during the relevant time all told claimed finra accounts traded by cj generated more than 150 alerts

a regulation that would lower the margin requirement for unhedged security futures from 20 to 15 additionally the sec proposed conforming revisions to its margin offset table to enable exchanges to set margin less than 20 for customers holding security futures and one or more related securities and futures the sec argued that such lower level of margin is defensible because there are exchange traded options based on an equity security or narrow based index where the required margin is 15 or less in march 2001 the board of governors of the federal reserve board delegated its authority over security futures margin jointly to both the sec and the commodity futures trading commission in response in 2002 the sec and cftc adopted their current margin requirements for brokers to collect from customers trading security futures because of the sec s and cftc s joint oversight of security futures the sec s proposed amendment to its related margin requirements will not be published in the federal register until after an equivalent amendment is proposed by the cftc expected to happen on july 11 click here for information regarding a cftc open meeting scheduled for july 11 sec

loan from aequitas to help pay down personal debt of mr behn and had access to a us 2 million line of credit under terms that incentivized defendants to recommend investments in aequitas the sec said that the defendants also solicited one client to invest us 1 million in aequitas without disclosing that mr behn intended to use most of the proceeds for personal purposes prior to soliciting clients to invest in aequitas defendants provided them an email discussing a strategic affiliation between fieldstone and aequitas however claimed the sec this email did not discuss mr behn s personal benefit

lawrence h summers is a professor at and past president of harvard university he was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to president barack obama from 2009 through 2010 the announcement last week that christine lagarde would be leaving her post as managing director of the international monetary fund to become president of the european central bank marks what may be the most important change in the leadership of the international financial system in decades at a time when the united states is abdicating its systemic responsibilities and focusing only on narrow commercial interests the role lagarde is leaving and the one she is entering are of preeminent importance lagarde unlike any of the others considered for leadership of the ecb fits in more naturally with the group of european heads of state who meet regularly in brussels than with the group of central bank heads who meet in basel switzerland this is a reflection of her extraordinary presence political ability and experience with european affairs it is also a consequence of the fact that unlike most central bank governors she is not an economist or an experienced financial technocrat advertisement lagarde s strengths are well matched to this moment the greatest risk to european monetary union and europe s contribution to the global economy is the persistence of the belief that the ecb acting independently can stabilize the european economy at the imf lagarde showed a willingness to assert that the austerity doctrines that were appropriate in an inflationary high interest rate era are not appropriate in an era when markets believe central banks will not succeed in getting inflation up to their 2 percent target even over a decade a focus on going beyond monetary policy in stimulating demand will be essential for the european economy to perform adequately in the years ahead in addition to good macroeconomic policy choices the success of the ecb will require institutional reforms bringing more consolidation in banking regulation and emergency response across europe and allowing the issuance of debt backed by all of europe there are sharp disagreements on these matters within europe and so moving forward will require the political stature and agility of someone such as lagarde not just technical explanations current ecb president mario draghi saved the euro system with his famous promise to do whatever it takes in the future however such an assurance may not be enough unless the ecb can also persuade governments to do what is necessary there is the further consideration that money only strategies for supporting the european economy will probably mean a weak euro and exacerbation of global trade friction so it will be very fortunate that the ecb has strong politically credible leadership advertisement what about the imf that lagarde leaves behind the good news is that under her deft leadership the imf has moved a long way from seeming to people around the world to be a stern dispenser of austerity in the interest of financiers to earning trust by taking on a broad range of problems of concern to regular people in addition to supporting larger deficits and fiscal stimulus when appropriate the lagarde imf has successfully promoted necessary debt relief cooperation in collecting reasonable levels of tax from global corporations measures to reduce inequality and the curtailment of subsidies that promote greenhouse gas emissions share this article share lagarde s successor will need to build on all of this to lead in minimizing the risks of a catastrophic recession among other things this means strengthening financial monitoring as risky private sector lending rises after years of economic expansion focusing on national policies that adequately maintain demand assuring that the imf has adequate resources to deal with the emerging market crises that will surely come at some point and carrying the torch for collaboration in maintaining global trade and international economic cooperation at a time when there is no one else with the capacity and will to take a global view financial policy leadership has something in common with the administration of anesthesia it is least noticed when it is done best but when done badly the consequences can be catastrophic between rising populist pressures liquidity trap low interest rates u s abdication of leadership and an expansion that is aging this is a perilous moment that will require confident and competent financial leadership we must all hope that christine lagarde at the ecb and whoever is chosen as her successor at the imf will provide

it s an epidemic with life and death significance for a pivotal portion of trump s base but the president has paid no attention to the way it is afflicting u s civilians writes rajan menon by rajan melon tomdispatch com we hear a lot about suicide when celebrities such as anthony bourdain and kate spade die by their own hand otherwise it seldom makes the headlines that s odd given the magnitude of the problem in 2017 47 173 americans killed themselves in that single year in other words the suicide count was nearly seven times greater than the number of american soldiers killed in the afghanistan and iraq wars between 2001 and 2018 a suicide occurs in the united states roughly once every 12 minutes what s more after decades of decline the rate of self inflicted deaths per 100 000 people annually the suicide rate has been increasing sharply since the late 1990s suicides now claim two and a half times as many lives in this country as do homicides even though the murder rate gets so much more attention in other words we re talking about a national epidemic of self inflicted deaths worrisome numbers anyone who has lost a close relative or friend to suicide or has worked on a suicide hotline as i have knows that statistics transform the individual the personal and indeed the mysterious aspects of that violent act why this person why now why in this manner into depersonalized abstractions still to grasp how serious the suicide epidemic has become numbers are a necessity according to a 2018 centers for disease control study between 1999 and 2016 the suicide rate increased in every state in the union except nevada which already had a remarkably high rate in 30 states it jumped by 25 percent or more in 17 by at least a third nationally it increased 33percent in some states the upsurge was far higher north dakota 57 6 percent new hampshire 48 3 percent kansas 45 percent idaho 43 percent alas the news only gets grimmer since 2008 suicide has ranked 10th among the causes of death in this country for americans between the ages of 10 and 34 however it comes in second for those between 35 and 45 fourth the united states also has the ninth highest rate in the 38 country organization for economic cooperation and development globally it ranks 27th more importantly the trend in the united states doesn t align with what s happening elsewhere in the developed world the world health organization for instance reports that great britain canada and china all have notably lower suicide rates than the u s as do all but six countries in the european union japan s is only slightly lower world bank statistics show that worldwide the suicide rate fell from 12 8 per 100 000 in 2000 to 10 6 in 2016 it s been falling in china japan where it has declined steadily for nearly a decade and is at its lowest point in 37 years most of europe and even countries like south korea and russia that have a significantly higher suicide rate than the united states in russia for instance it has dropped by nearly 26 percent from a high point of 42 per 100 000 in 1994 to 31 in 2019 we know a fair amount about the patterns of suicide in the united states in 2017 the rate was highest for men between the ages of 45 and 64 30 per 100 000 and those 75 and older 39 7 per 100 000 the rates in rural counties are almost double those in the most urbanized ones which is why states like idaho kansas new hampshire and north dakota sit atop the suicide list furthermore a far higher percentage of people in rural states own guns than in cities and suburbs leading to a higher rate of suicide involving firearms the means used in half of all such acts in this country there are gender based differences as well from 1999 to 2017 the rate for men was substantially higher than for women almost four and a half times higher in the first of those years slightly more than three and a half times in the last education is also a factor the suicide rate is lowest among individuals with college degrees those who at best completed high school are by comparison twice as likely to kill themselves suicide rates also tend to be lower among people in higher income brackets the economics of stress this surge in the suicide rate has taken place in years during which the working class has experienced greater economic hardship and psychological stress increased competition from abroad and outsourcing the results of globalization have contributed to job loss particularly in economic sectors like manufacturing steel and mining that had long been mainstays of employment for such workers the jobs still available often paid less and provided fewer benefits technological change including computerization robotics and the coming of artificial intelligence has similarly begun to displace labor in significant ways leaving americans without college degrees especially those 50 and older in far more difficult straits when it comes to finding new jobs that pay well the lack of anything resembling an industrial policy of a sort that exists in europe has made these dislocations even more painful for american workers while a sharp decline in private sector union membership down from nearly 17 percent in 1983 to 6 4 percent today has reduced their ability to press for higher wages through collective bargaining furthermore the inflation adjusted median wage has barely budged over the last four decades even as ceo salaries have soared and a decline in worker productivity doesn t explain it between 1973 and 2017 productivity increased by 77 percent while a worker s average hourly wage only rose by 12 4 percent wage stagnation has made it harder for working class americans to get by let alone have a lifestyle comparable to that of their parents or grandparents the gap in earnings between those at the top and bottom of american society has also increased a lot since 1979 the wages of americans in the 10th percentile increased by a pitiful 1 2 percent those in the 50th percentile did a bit better making a gain of 6 percent by contrast those in the 90th percentile increased by 34 3 percent and those near the peak of the wage pyramid the top 1 percent and especially the rarefied 0 1 percent made far more substantial gains and mind you we re just talking about wages not other forms of income such as large stock dividends expensive homes or eyepopping inheritances the share of net national wealth held by the richest 0 1 percent increased from 10 percent in the 1980s to 20 percent in 2016 by contrast the share of the bottom 90 percent shrank in those same decades from about 35 percent to 20 percent as for the top 1 percent by 2016 its share had increased to almost 39percent the precise relationship between economic inequality and suicide rates remains unclear and suicide certainly can t simply be reduced to wealth disparities or financial stress still strikingly in contrast to the united states suicide rates are noticeably lower and have been declining in western european countries where income inequalities are far less pronounced publicly funded healthcare is regarded as a right not demonized as a pathway to serfdom social safety nets far more extensive and apprenticeships and worker retraining programs more widespread evidence from the united states brazil japan and sweden does indicate that as income inequality increases so does the suicide rate if so the good news is that progressive economic policies should democrats ever retake the white house and the senate could make a positive difference a study based on state by state variations in the u s found that simply boosting the minimum wage and earned income tax credit by 10 percent appreciably reduces the suicide rate among people without college degrees the race enigma one aspect of the suicide epidemic is puzzling though whites have fared far better economically and in many other ways than african americans their suicide rate is significantly higher it increased from 11 3 per 100 000 in 2000 to 15 85 per 100 000 in 2017 for african americans in those years the rates were 5 52 per 100 000 and 6 61 per 100 000 black men are 10 times more likely to be homicide victims than white men but the latter are two and half times more likely to kill themselves the higher suicide rate among whites as well as among people with only a high school diploma highlights suicide s disproportionate effect on working class whites this segment of the population also accounts for a disproportionate share of what economists anne case and angus deaton have labeled deaths of despair those caused by suicides plus opioid overdoses and liver diseases linked to alcohol abuse though it s hard to offer a complete explanation for this economic hardship and its ripple effects do appear to matter according to a study by the st louis federal reserve the white working class accounted for 45 percent of all income earned in the united states in 1990 but only 27 percent in 2016 in those same years its share of national wealth plummeted from 45 percent to 22 percent and as inflation adjusted wages have decreased for men without college degrees many white workers seem to have lost hope of success of any sort paradoxically the sense of failure and the accompanying stress may be greater for white workers precisely because they traditionally were much better off economically than their african american and hispanic counterparts in addition the fraying of communities knit together by employment in once robust factories and mines has increased social isolation among them and the evidence that it along with opioid addiction and alcohol abuse increases the risk of suicide is strong on top of that a significantly higher proportion of whites than blacks and hispanics own firearms and suicide rates are markedly higher in states where gun ownership is more widespread trump s faux populism the large increase in suicide within the white working class began a couple of decades before donald trump s election still it s reasonable to ask what he s tried to do about it particularly since votes from these americans helped propel him to the white house in 2016 he received 64 percent of the votes of whites without college degrees hillary clinton only 28 percent nationwide he beat clinton in counties where deaths of despair rose significantly between 2000 and 2015 white workers will remain crucial to trump s chances of winning in 2020 yet while he has spoken about and initiated steps aimed at reducing the high suicide rate among veterans his speeches and tweets have never highlighted the national suicide epidemic or its inordinate impact on white workers more importantly to the extent that economic despair contributes to their high suicide rate his policies will only make matters worse the real benefits from the december 2017 tax cuts and jobs act championed by the president and congressional republicans flowed to those on the top steps of the economic ladder by 2027 when the act s provisions will run out the wealthiest americans are expected to have captured 81 8 percent of the gains and that s not counting the windfall they received from recent changes in taxes on inheritances trump and the gop doubled the annual amount exempt from estate taxes wealth bequeathed to heirs through 2025 from 5 6 million per individual to 11 2 million or 22 4 million per couple and who benefits most from this act of generosity not workers that s for sure but every household with an estate worth 22 million or more will as for job retraining provided by the workforce innovation and opportunity act the president proposed cutting that program by 40percent in his 2019 budget later settling for keeping it at 2017 levels future cuts seem in the cards as long as trump is in the white house the congressional budget office projects that his tax cuts alone will produce even bigger budget deficits in the years to come the shortfall last year was 779 billion and it is expected to reach 1 trillion by 2020 inevitably the president and congressional republicans will then demand additional reductions in spending for social programs this is all the more likely because trump and those republicans also slashed corporate taxes from 35percent to 21 percent an estimated 1 4 trillion in savings for corporations over the next decade and unlike the income tax cut the corporate tax has no end date the president assured his base that the big bucks those companies had stashed abroad would start flowing home and produce a wave of job creation all without adding to the deficit as it happens however most of that repatriated cash has been used for corporate stock buy backs which totaled more than 800 billion last year that in turn boosted share prices but didn t exactly rain money down on workers no surprise of course since the wealthiest 10percent of americans own at least 84 percent of all stocks and the bottom 60percent have less than 2 percent of them and the president s corporate tax cut hasn t produced the tsunami of job generating investments he predicted either indeed in its aftermath more than 80 percent of american companies stated that their plans for investment and hiring hadn t changed as a result the monthly increase in jobs has proven unremarkable compared to president obama s second term when the economic recovery that trump largely inherited began yes the economy did grow 2 3 percent in 2017 and 2 9 percent in 2018 though not 3 1 percent as the president claimed there wasn t however any unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before as he insisted in this year s state of the union address anyway what matters for workers struggling to get by is growth in real wages and there s nothing to celebrate on that front between 2017 and mid 2018 they actually declined by 1 63 percent for white workers and 2 5 percent for african americans while they rose for hispanics by a measly 0 37 percent and though trump insists that his beloved tariff hikes are going to help workers they will actually raise the prices of goods hurting the working class and other low income americans the most then there are the obstacles those susceptible to suicide face in receiving insurance provided mental health care if

canada s trade commissioner service offered via twitter this week to help executives struggling with this question what is a free trade agreement in that spirit let s revisit the subject of how one should interpret statistics canada s monthly labour force survey the lesson is mostly for currency traders who made some weird bets after statcan on friday reported that employment declined by 2 200 positions in june and the jobless rate increased to 5 5 per cent related stories the canadian dollar dropped about half a cent after the data were released which probably had something to do with traders wanting assets to purchase u s dollars since the value of the greenback jumped on the news that the u s economy in june added 224 000 jobs more than most analysts expected wall street rethought the likelihood of interest rate cuts this summer causing stock markets to tumble the calculation monetary stimulus is better for equities than full employment because it s 2019 but if part of the calculation is that the latest canadian numbers will trouble the bank of canada then some traders are likely going to lose some money i think currency markets totally missed the partly offsetting narrative that this is a very strong report derek holt a bank of nova scotia economist told clients in a note the jobs report was good not bad few of us listen but statcan encourages readers of the labour survey to pay attention to the trend not the month to month change which always comes with a huge margin of error the decline from may was too small on its own to say anything more than employment had plateaued at a high level the jobless rate was the second lowest recorded in the data set that goes back to 1976 so that s hardly a sign of weakness statcan s measure of the trend in hiring based on a calculation of the current month and the previous six months increased by almost 22 000 positions in june earlier this year when headline employment increased by an incredible 106 500 positions the trend reading rose by only 34 800 the economy is rarely as strong or as weak as the headlines and tweets on jobs day suggest canada s economy is essentially at full employment a situation where most people who want a job can get one the jobless rate rose because statcan counted more new people in the labour force than newly employed workers many economists interpret a growing workforce as a sign of confidence in the overall economy with the average pace of job growth still very strong in 2019 we do not see the modest pull back in employment as a sign of labour market softness said victoria clark an economist at citigroup inc the hiring numbers are the last significant indicator that bank of canada leaders will receive before they reset policy on july 10 and they cement the central bank s position as an outlier australia s central bank has been cutting interest rates the european central bank has made it clear that it is thinking about doing so and almost everyone assumes the u s federal reserve will lower its benchmark rate later this month in australia the unemployment rate has been climbing higher while inflation in europe and the u s remains weak the data warn that something is wrong it might seem odd but the bank of canada has been presented with little reason to follow its peers non energy exports surged 4 5 per cent in may the biggest monthly increase since july 2016 scotiabank s model of real time economic growth predicts gross domestic product will expand at annual rate of 2 7 per cent in the second quarter much faster than the boc assumed in april we see reasons for the bank to leave open the option that the next move might be a hike david watt an economist at hsbc in toronto told clients on july 5 watt s analysis has the boc leaving the policy rate unchanged through next year when weakness in the global economy will eventually force canadian policymakers to join the path taken by the australians americans and europeans but that would require a significant shift in domestic conditions the best information in the labour force survey is below the headlines the boc watches more granular indicators such as wage growth long term unemployment and the youth participation rate for signs of inflation pressure statcan said average hourly wages increased 3 8 per cent from june 2018 the biggest year over year increase since may 2018 the number of canadians in the labour force who reported being unemployed for more than 26 weeks shrunk to 155 400 the least since december 2008 and the youth participation rate climbed to 69 4 per cent the highest since august 2018 and above the historical average other central banks are worried about the outlook so the bank of canada will also be worried but few of the gauges on boc governor stephen poloz s dashboard are flashing warning signs the traders betting on lower interest rates in canada this year have set themselves up for disappointment email twitter kevinlibin copyright postmedia network inc 2019

more than 8 700 newly created opportunity zones are now racing to attract a portion of the 6 trillion in capital that may flow under a provision of the new tax law enacted in 2017 the law uses a package of tax incentives to jumpstart economic development in distressed communities by financing local startups building small businesses or developing properties but there are also opportunities for education institutions and workforce development programs a lack of investment in distressed communities a growing body of research has revealed geographic prosperity gaps across the united states recent economic growth is concentrated in large metropolitan areas with populations of over 1 million which have experienced 72 percent of the nation s job growth since the financial crisis nearly half of the net increase in business establishments from 2007 to 2016 took place in just two cities washington d c and new york city millions of americans now live in distressed communities characterized by higher rates of poverty and lower levels of income educational attainment and workforce participation pockets of the country also struggle with higher rates of deaths of despair due to suicide drugs and alcohol symptomatic of a larger sense of lost opportunity distressed communities are home to millions of americans too many communities have become poverty traps it s no wonder that economist raj chetty has found that where children grow up matters for their economic prosperity as adults working with the u s census bureau chetty and his team at opportunity insights were able to produce an opportunity atlas that mapped the disparities neighborhood by neighborhood chetty and team found that a low income child growing up in a less poor community is more likely to climb the economic ladder than a child who spends her entire life in a low income area in 2015 the economic innovation group a bipartisan policy center launched by sean parker brought together a group of economists from across the political spectrum to discuss possible causes of these troubling trends and identify potential solutions these experts discovered that while struggling communities each faced a series of complex and interrelated challenges they shared one common barrier a lack of access to capital needed for community and economic development projects distressed communities have hopes and dreams but no one is investing in them the federal reserve found that banks now make fewer loans of less than 1 million than they did before the recession nearly 75 percent of all venture capital is invested in just three states california massachusetts and new york philanthropic support is also concentrated in a handful of areas an analysis of overall philanthropic giving revealed that alabama receives an average of 130 per capita in grantmaking below the national average of 451 and well below the new york city average of 1 966 when it comes to education the philanthropy roundtable estimates that 90 percent of k 12 giving is concentrated in urban areas the economists assembled by economic innovation group proposed designating these distressed communities opportunity zones and offering investors incentives to funnel capital into revitalization projects the concept drew the support of a bipartisan congressional coalition led by senators tim scott r sc and cory booker d nj and representatives pat tiberi r oh and ron kind d wi with a group of almost 100 cosponsors the legislation was eventually included in the broader overhaul of the tax code signed into law in 2017 how does the opportunity zone program work the program consists of two parts the first asked governors to identify up to 25 percent of their low income census tracts for certification by the u s treasury department as opportunity zones these designations last ten years and cannot be changed states territories and the district of columbia designated a total of 8 700 opportunity zones which are home to nearly 35 million americans where are the opportunity zones the second part creates a qualified opportunity fund a new investment vehicle to finance projects within opportunity zones after investors sell appreciated assets such as stocks bonds real estate or businesses they can reinvest the money gained from those sales into a qualified opportunity fund these qualified opportunity funds then invest in certain equity financed projects located in an opportunity zone including businesses property redevelopment or new construction the law offers investors three tax incentives that grow the longer the investment stays in an opportunity zone deferred payment of the federal capital gains taxes on the reinvested amount until 2026 a tax liability reduction of up to 15 percent if they hold the investment for up to seven years and no taxes on any generated gains from that investment if held for at least ten years benefits for communities and investors this approach has several strengths it offers low income communities a flexible tool to support their own local approaches to economic development some may need affordable housing while others need broadband or capital for growing businesses it also rewards patient capital investors must hold their investments in the community for at least ten years to secure all the benefits opportunity funds allow for enormous flexibility in terms of who can establish them what they invest in where they invest and whether the fund s goal is to maximize social impact or balance financial returns fund managers can be institutional banks community development finance institutions universities or impact investors funds can focus on a single city or support projects anywhere in the country unlike other economic development programs such as new markets tax credits there are no caps on the number of funds or the investment amounts that can be raised already there are at least 90 funds with nearly 30 billion pledged a number expected to grow as the treasury provides additional regulatory clarity economic innovation group estimated there are 6 trillion in unrealized capital gains that are eligible to reap the tax benefits the law provides potential drawbacks and problem areas while the opportunity zone program offers significant potential for positive impact there are several areas of risk previous placed based policies including empowerment zones enterprise communities renewal communities and promise neighborhoods have had mixed results as the california budget and policy center put it the inconclusiveness of the research exploring the connection between economic development tax incentives and community outcomes suggests that the costs of such incentives may outweigh the benefits these past efforts targeted the tax incentives on a project by project basis in an expensive cumbersome and time consuming process that discouraged many from applying the authors of the opportunity zone policy sought to remedy this by focusing the tax incentive on investors instead of projects once funds are pooled in an opportunity fund they can be invested in projects through the familiar processes and timelines used for most investments risk is also shared under this structure as investors and fund managers must identify good projects in order to make the investment pay off given the history of past policies and programs it is possible that investments may lead to gentrification displacement and inequitable development but this risk is likely localized to a handful of regions such as san francisco new york city and washington d c new research by the university of minnesota law school s institute on metropolitan opportunity found that the most common type of change over the last two decades has been not gentrification but rather poverty concentration in areas where there is a population displacement risk mayors and state policymakers can also use other financial incentives and permitting processes to help prevent displacement and encourage projects with greater social impact such as prioritizing affordable housing over a market rate condo a further critique of many placed based programs is that they result in tax giveaways for investment that would have occurred anyway investors could flock to the projects that have known deal pipelines such as real estate in the markets they know best such as major metropolitan areas instead of taking on challenging projects in struggling locales addressing this risk requires new services to help investors and project organizers find each other across the 8 700 zones one such service is the opportunity exchange which is working with several cities and states to serve as a searchable listing of projects the platform also assigns a social impact score based on the oz reporting framework developed by the u s impact investing alliance the beeck center for social impact and innovation at georgetown university and the federal reserve bank of new york expanding services like the opportunity exchange can help connect overlooked communities and high impact projects with investors even so the opportunity zones program lacks the organizational infrastructure taken for granted in the education sector there isn t something like chiefs for change for opportunity zone coordinators or the council for chief state school officers for state economic development directors thanks to the work of the economic innovation group accelerator for america and the local initiatives support corporation there are more ways for participants to share best practices but philanthropic support of capacity building organizations will be critical to the program s long term success how can opportunity zones impact education education and workforce institutions are the backbone of most communities if the goal of the opportunity zones program is to empower residents then investing in educational opportunities will deliver powerful results for future generations and future success early childhood and afterschool care high quality affordable childcare is essential to families economic stability parents ability to work and children s healthy development many distressed communities however are afterschool deserts where families have limited access to afterschool care tutoring and other enrichment programs qualified opportunity funds could be used to purchase or build new facilities or rehabilitate existing ones for providers the city of dayton ohio for example is pitching investors the chance to build a new public library and afterschool community center investments could even finance small businesses operating tutoring or early care programs elementary and secondary schools according to the 21st century school fund there are 13 536 elementary or secondary public schools located in opportunity zones on average 71 percent of students in these schools come from low income families many of these schools are also struggling likely reflecting the distressed communities they re serving greatschools provides a snapshot of school quality based on data indicators and found that the average rating for schools located in opportunity zones was 4 0 out of 10 0 compared to 5 2 for those located outside an opportunity zone school districts in these low wealth areas could tap into qualified opportunity funds to improve their buildings to deliver these modern schools developers and a school district could form a public private partnership using ground leases to transfer building ownership to private investors while leaving the local school district in control of ongoing operations the investment from a qualified opportunity fund could then finance the renovations with ownership returning to the district at the end of the term this approach can be used by district schools charter schools and private schools the 21st century school fund has also suggested that developers partner with school districts to modernize underutilized school facilities as mixed use community centers involving partners such as health facilities childcare centers libraries and even elder care service centers this approach is aligned with that of many emerging community schools which work with families students and community organizations to identify and address unmet needs developers can also incorporate new school construction into their projects for example the developers behind greenpoint landing in brooklyn new york are building 5 500 new apartments 1 400 which will be affordable along with nine acres of parks and a new public school serving preschoolers through 8th graders other cities with large development projects could embrace a similar approach there are ways to leverage these resources for adjacent needs as well rbh group is using opportunity zones to finance workforce housing for teachers in teacher villages a strategy that could be important for cities with a higher cost of living charter schools while at least 22 percent of charter schools are located in opportunity zones nearly 70 percent of opportunity zones are actually charter deserts or areas of three or more contiguous moderate to high poverty census tracts without charter elementary schools all things being equal a charter network may want to consider expansion into opportunity zones to tap into qualified opportunity funds an additional source of facilities funding that can complement other forms of financing developers can also include charters or private schools in mixed used properties built using opportunity funds starwood capital group for example announced a development in the south bronx that will be home to zeta charter school along with retail and apartment units even if charters don t receive any opportunity fund investment they can be part of a community s revitalization plan in florida charter schools can apply to be schools of hope which allows their networks to establish new charters near low performing schools governor ron desantis has proposed expanding the program to allow charters to serve students in other opportunity zones potentially bringing new education options to children in distressed areas colleges and universities nearly every governor designated opportunity zones near universities and research institutions creating the potential for commercializing research supporting technology transfer incubating student startups and expanding student housing universities can serve as important anchor institutions in facilitating community planning arizona state university and the university of delaware are already playing this role by leveraging their faculty research and convening abilities to assist communities with planning and development higher education institutions can also benefit from qualified opportunity fund investments almost half of historically black colleges and universities are located in opportunity zones some of these campuses will receive investment from a newly created 50 million opportunity fund led by renaissance equity partners the hbcu community development action coalition and calvert impact capital similar funds could be established to support projects near community colleges or other institutions for example some research has suggested that when students live on campus graduation rates tend to be higher opportunity funds could allow colleges to expand student housing to serve more students and thereby improve outcomes universities can also leverage their proximity to opportunity zones to create entrepreneurship incubators for students qualified opportunity fund investments could support building a dedicated facility and provide start up capital for the most promising ventures workforce training programs communities have to create workforce development programs to give residents the skills needed for new jobs and to attract business development from companies that require those skills governor larry hogan for example is targeting state job training funds in maryland opportunity zones workforce training providers can also benefit from qualified opportunity funds to build out services the technology apprenticeship provider kenzie academy is located in an opportunity zone in indianapolis which allows it to tap into qualified opportunity funds as part of its fundraising rounds kenzie also recently announced a partnership with hypothesis studios that will use kenzie graduates as candidates for roles at the startup organizations in hypothesis portfolio some opportunity zone businesses are even providing job training michigan based chart house energy uses investments from qualified opportunity funds to install solar panels and pass discounted energy costs to host facilities which may include schools but the company has also committed to hiring and training local residents creating a new employment pipeline and driving inclusive growth business incubators can provide workspace seed funding mentoring and training for entrepreneurs in fields like tech and advanced manufacturing in ohio the youngstown business incubator and bounce innovation hub offer places for entrepreneurs to learn more about advancing manufacturing and 3d printing in michigan projects like the detroit grocery incubator help address the problem of food deserts by supporting entrepreneurs who wish to set up local grocery stores entrepreneurs growing local businesses is an important part of addressing poverty and one of the primary objectives of the opportunity zone program according to the kauffman foundation for every 1 percent increase in the rate of new businesses started in a state there is a 2 percent decline in the poverty rate opportunity zones give investors the chance to add qualified opportunity funds to their portfolios and thereby support overlooked entrepreneurs in distressed communities hypothesis studios for example is searching for mission driven founders in opportunity zones who are trying to make an impact in sectors including healthcare technology education technology agricultural and the internet of things modeled after the famous edison labs hall labs in utah has 25 companies and employs more than 200 engineers scientists and specialists hall venture partners is launching an opportunity fund giving investors the chance to participate this same approach could be used by education investors to attract private capital to the launch and growth of education and workforce solutions it could also be used to help target underserved populations such as minority or female entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs launching their startups in an opportunity zone creates a new fundraising advantage for example the next generation assessment startup imbellus is located in the heart of a distressed opportunity zone in culver city california which means the company is eligible to receive opportunity fund investment as part of its next venture raise this additional capital would help imbellus accelerate its work developing new assessments through learning science psychometrics and artificial intelligence incubators and accelerators could also be established within a zone to help jumpstart new education businesses or nonprofits matt candler of 4 0 schools for example is exploring the use of qualified opportunity funds to develop small creativity boosting approachable spaces like microschools and maker spaces facilitating the success of opportunity zones investment is not guaranteed just because a community is designated an opportunity zone it is up to mayors community leaders and local business leaders to bring projects to investors define priorities and provide additional support only then will opportunity zones drive inclusive growth how policymakers can help mayors and governors are well positioned to identify community assets and needs by evaluating current conditions in their opportunity zones to this end the accelerator for america and new localism advisors is working with cities like cleveland ohio erie pennsylvania louisville kentucky stockton california and south bend indiana on investment prospectuses that describe local demographic and economic trends assets and anchor institutions and potential projects for investors the local initiatives support corporation has also released a playbook to help communities with their planning education and workforce institutions need to join these discussions to inform the work and potentially benefit from investment policymakers will need to leverage state support through grant preference points eligibility criteria or other state incentives to make projects in their opportunity zones more attractive for investors so far more than 150 bills addressing some or all of these policy levers have been introduced this year proposed legislation in alabama for example would provide 50 million in tax credits to impact oriented qualified opportunity funds which benefit projects in rural areas technology companies workforce training providers and affordable housing developments but state policymakers do not necessarily have to pledge new funds and in many cases can use existing state and federal dollars the u s department of education is giving competitive preference to career and technical education projects serving opportunity zones under the innovation and modernization grant program within the perkins act a federal law funding career and technical education states can follow the federal government s lead by making the opportunity zone designation an indicator of need in their own state grant programs or they can award bonus points for competitive grants allocated under the every student succeeds act these approaches allow states to encourage the types of development they want to see in opportunity zones and prioritize the projects most likely to benefit residents the role of philanthropic organizations philanthropies also have a critical role in the success of opportunity zones particularly in terms of capacity building foundations can support local planning or provide funding for a dedicated opportunity zone coordinator along these lines the rockefeller foundation announced that six cities will receive financial support for the hiring of a chief opportunity zone officer who will be embedded in a city government or a city economic development agency and two community engagement specialists the economic innovation group is also in the process of securing support for a forum where opportunity zone coordinators can exchange best practices and develop shared strategies qualified opportunity funds also give foundations another tool besides traditional grants and program related investments for education and education adjacent foundations these funds offer unique opportunities to improve student outcomes a whole child opportunity fund for example might complement school based philanthropic endeavors by investing in a new grocery store in a food desert building affordable housing for a low income community or creating dedicated space for tutoring and afterschool programs though these projects would normally be outside their grantmaking scope qualified opportunity funds let foundations address pressing needs by leveraging outside capital directed at mission aligned projects opportunities are what we make of them the opportunity zones program is the largest community development initiative in a generation but its success isn t guaranteed policymakers mayors community leaders investors developers and philanthropic organizations will have to work together to get the best results for opportunity zone residents if education leaders pursue these investment opportunities they too can benefit from the program and ensure better outcomes for those in distressed communities for generations to come john bailey is an advisor to the walton family foundation and a visiting fellow at the american enterprise institute he previously created the opportunity zone proposal announced by president bush in 2004
by erik knutzen lagging small caps indicate that beneath the record high s p 500 all may not be as placid as it seems we are currently gathering our thoughts for our latest quarterly asset allocation committee outlook you can see a preview of the ideas here the full publication will be coming soon and we look forward to welcoming you to the webinar on july 16 in the meantime it s worth noting that the theme that has caught our attention this quarter is the way that what we see on the surface can conceal both the complexity and opportunity that lies beneath for example we think the doldrums in inflation data which is scaring central banks into renewed dovishness and bond markets into negative yields conceals a more interesting story that is becoming evident in leading indicators they may be suggesting that consumer prices are reaching a trough just as the federal reserve gets ready to cut rates similarly in equity markets the story most people are focused on is the advance of the s p 500 index to a record high within touching distance of 3 000 points but we think there is a more interesting story going on underneath divergence a near 20 gain in the value of the u s stock market in the first half of the year might reasonably be taken as a sign of investors optimism and keen appetite for risk over that time however u s small cap stocks as measured by the russell 2000 index have risen by 16 5 in a risk on environment riskier smaller companies would normally rally more than large caps look back over 12 months and the picture becomes even starker the s p 500 is up around 12 but the russell 2000 is still down by almost 5 can valuations explain this not really the russell 2000 trades on a higher forward price to earnings multiple than the s p 500 but that is normal more importantly the s p 500 s multiple is two points higher than its long term average while the russell 2000 s is just half a point higher this divergence in performance appears to have more to do with investor sentiment we think that s interesting it shows how record high levels for the equity index can coincide with quite cautious even slightly bearish positioning within the market what s on the surface can conceal the complexity beneath we find similar patterns all over equity markets whether it s regions sectors style or high beta stocks versus low beta stocks everywhere we look we find the risk on assets lagging the risk off ones and then of course there s the big one the puzzle of how we can be breaking records on both the s p 500 and the value of negative yielding bonds at the same time a major part of the answer is revealed by this underlying caution inside equity markets a turn in investor sentiment are these potential value opportunities from a historical perspective when large caps have opened up a 16 to 17 percentage point lead over small caps in the past that gap has tended to revert back to the mean sometimes this is due to small caps outperforming sometimes to large caps underperforming often both looking forward we think this is why it s interesting to see an apparent stabilization and possibly a bottoming out in some of the more leading growth and inflation indicators more on that in the forthcoming asset allocation committee outlook should this coincide with the fed and other central banks loosening policy it could mark a turn in investor sentiment with the likely beneficiaries being those asset classes and sectors that have lagged over the past 12 months while we would always caution against tracking a problematic benchmark such as the russell 2000 we see u s small caps actively managed as one of the key parts of that lagging cohort our asset allocation committee has eased toward being more neutral on equities in its overall views as last week showed economic releases are likely to be continued in a seesaw pattern business surveys out of china and europe and especially german manufacturing data came in low even as the u s jobs report indicated still robust growth beneath the placid surface however we see opportunity to take advantage of market complexity in case you missed it japan purchasing managers index 0 2 to 49 3

heather long the washington post sommer johnson thought everything was finally coming together for her last year she was engaged working full time and doing well in online college classes when her fiance s mother died a week before their wedding day triggering a series of large and unexpected expenses that left her struggling to pay her bills and brought her to the verge of bankruptcy i keep hearing this is one of the best economies we ve ever had and unemployment is down especially among african americans which i am said johnson 39 who lives in douglasville georgia an atlanta suburb i m looking around going where is this boom from where i sit this doesn t look like the best economy ever the economic expansion last week became the longest in u s history surpassing the 1990s boom which lasted exactly a decade the stock market is at record levels with the dow jones industrial average closing at a new high wednesday ahead of the july 4 holiday and president donald trump has made the economy s strong performance a centerpiece of his reelection campaign but this expansion has been weaker and its benefits distributed far more unevenly than in previous growth cycles leaving many americans in a vulnerable position this is a two tier recovery said matthew mish head of credit strategy at the investment bank ubs about 60 of americans have benefited financially he said while 40 have not the 40 which mish calls the lower tier have seen paltry or volatile wage growth rising expenses for housing health care and education and increased levels of personal debt they tend not to own homes or many stocks in discussions with 30 americans unable to pay all of their bills a clear pattern emerged most were able to eke by until they faced an unexpected crisis such as a job loss cancer car trouble or storm damage the extra expense caused them to get behind on their bills and they never fully rebounded economists fear such precarious financial situations put many americans at risk if there is even a mild setback in the economy potentially setting up the next recession to be worse than anything in recent history except the great recession so many americans are living paycheck to paycheck said signe mary mckernan vice president of the center of labor human services and population at the urban institute we are headed toward a political crisis if not an economic one their vulnerability is due to a confluence of factors first the average american family has yet to recover fully from the crisis the federal reserve found leaving half the nation with a diminished cushion to handle surprise expenses or the next downturn the bottom half has less wealth today after adjusting for inflation than it did in 1989 according to fed data through march of this year while wage growth has accelerated in recent months especially for the lowest paid workers families who have struggled for years have a ways to go to return to solid footing half of u s jobs pay less than 18 58 an hour and more than a third pay less than 15 which makes it difficult to save or invest for a better future trump and his team argue that a strong economy is lifting more and more americans up financially including blue collar workers the formerly incarcerated and minorities in contrast democrats are calling for major expansions of government programs to address inequality how to help the economically vulnerable is likely to be a key debate in the 2020 race just because folks on wall street think things are fine doesn t mean most americans feel like things are fine said ray boshara director of the center for household financial stability at the federal reserve bank of st louis when every day is a rainy day for millions of families things are not fine to get by americans have borrowed heavily in recent years total u s household debt is now 13 7 trillion surpassing the 2008 peak in dollar terms according to the federal reserve bank of new york the surge in debt this time around is for cars and college not mortgages johnson knows these issues all too well her family of five including two teenagers and an infant daughter was making it on her 31 000 salary as an insurance underwriting assistant and her husband s part time job as a clerk but it took longer to sell her mother in law s house than the couple expected the modest life insurance policy the couple collected on her death soon ran out but the bills for the funeral carrying the extra house rent health insurance and the new baby kept coming johnson s husband carl dunlap has applied repeatedly for full time jobs but has not been able to get one he picked up as many extra hours as he could at work but it wasn t enough already in debt for college and a used volkswagen passat she bought in 2017 johnson turned to friends and family for help but she eventually had to choose between paying for day care and the 350 a month auto loan she picked day care and her family lost a vehicle she recalls the exact moment it happened 10 p m on a thursday night in early march she saw the red flashing lights of the repo men through her living room window and ran outside barefoot i just stood there and watched it go which was tough johnson said that was the first car i ever bought for myself and we needed it the couple carpool to work now trying to save money to pay the thousands of dollars they still owe on the vw that is no longer in their possession older and wealthier and usually white americans typically take on debt to buy homes or make investments that are likely to make them richer in the years to come most in this category have recovered the wealth they lost in the great recession as home prices and stocks have soared in contrast data from the fed and the credit score company equifax show that families of color younger americans born after 1970 and households earning less than 60 000 are the least likely to have recovered the wealth they lost in the crisis and they tend to carry heavy debt loads often taking out loans for college which they cannot get rid of in bankruptcy or loans to pay bills which can put them further behind the prevailing view among wall street investors and washington policymakers is that there is little to worry about because student loans are backed by the government and delinquency rates for other kinds of debt are fairly low meaning most people can make their monthly payments credit quality is about as good as i ve ever seen it said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics there is nothing that suggests inordinate stress on low income households certainly nothing compared to times past but boshara of the st louis fed pointed out that credit card and auto loan delinquencies have risen this year the opposite of what wall street expected in good economic times four in 10 americans say they still struggle to pay their bills despite the strong economy according to a quarterly survey by ubs that has shown no improvement since 2014 and looking at how households are doing by class race or age reveals a concerning picture for maddy dannemiller who lives outside columbus ohio the tipping point came when her then boyfriend hit a deer while driving her car the vehicle was badly damaged and the couple decided it was not safe enough for their children prompting her to buy another one her monthly payment jumped to over 450 a month because she didn t have a credit history dannemiller s late mother had co signed the loan on her first car then the couple broke up and dannemiller says she is supporting three children on her own as a nurse s aide she makes above ohio s 8 55 an hour minimum wage but not much over 10 her landlord is a relative who sometimes gives her a break on rent but she is routinely late on car and credit card payments i m 25 but i feel like i am in my late 30s dannemiller said shortly before heading to work right now i m two months behind on my car payment
violence in guatemala through the eyes of the río negro massacres one two three it would be easy to just speak of the one massacre or even to add the several related ones in the region of the chixoy dam an event or events that are divorced from historical context that took place in a vacuum like a snapshot or a waxwork diorama on view but that would be cheating the victims and the people of guatemala from those deaths one can see a much larger story one that should be told this isn t just about almost two hundred indigenous maya almost all women and children who were brutally massacred by soldiers and a civil patrol pac paramilitary groups organized to support the military and provide intelligence it s about a nation that has lost well over 200 000 people many of whom disappeared and were never seen again it s also about how it got to that day of 13 march 1982 what is usually referred to as the río negro massacre and 4 march 1980 and a day in july 1980 and 13 february 1982 and 14 may 1982 and 13 september 1982 200 000 people in 34 years this is a country that in 2000 had around 12 6 million people total a country a little less than half the size of the united kingdom or a little bit bigger than iceland how does a country go from being a fledgling democracy to the massacres at río negro among others usurping democracy in the first half of the twentieth century guatemala was ruled by oppressive dictators who allowed american corporations most importantly the united fruit company ufco to basically control the economy and build also own the infrastructure this was good for ufco and good for the united states which in turn was good for whichever dictator was in power it was however not good for the people of guatemala who had little land to sustain themselves and those that worked for el pulpo the octopus as ufco was known by the people of central america for its hold on land and economy were little more than slaves or at least serfs in a feudal society without the protections granted by the feudal lord if it matters the workers were generally treated worse by native guatemalan plantation owners in late 1944 the people rebelled against the current dictator and established democracy for the first time in their country a popularly elected democracy many reforms took place education public works allowing labor organization sincere attempts were made to better the lives of the guatemalan people this was good for the people this was not good for ufco and not for the us as it viewed things the biggest problem was land reform ufco had thousands of acres of the best land in the country under its control a good deal of the remaining land belonged to the wealthy elite of the country also out of reach for the vast majority of the population in fact a large amount of the land was left uncultivated and fallow 87 as part of governmental reforms the land was to be parceled out to the people who needed it obviously ufco was upset it was also outraged at the amount they were compensated for the land lands weren t simply appropriated compensation was first given and only fallow land was redistributed the compensation was based on the company s own assessment of the land s value for tax purposes in other words ufco deliberately undervalued the land in order to escape taxation penalties then balked when they received what they officially said the acreage was worth ufco s ire was the main reason that democracy in guatemala was short lived not the only one though like a real democracy guatemala allowed any political group to be able to represent the people in the government if elected this means there were a few communists in the government they had little power and influence but their mere presence upset the communist cold war paranoia the us had on the other hand this fear was also largely used as a pretext to depose the democratic government and install one sympathetic and willing to play ball with the us ufco and other us interests one example besides a number of invented stories concocted by the cia and the state department was the way the us blocked the sale of arms from western nations for the country s army this meant guatemala had no recourse but to look elsewhere to supply itself about the only source being communist countries this of course proves that the country was nothing but a soviet puppet contended the us in 1954 a coup invasion was attempted aided by weapons from the us and planes piloted by americans that ran bombing and propaganda pamphlet runs over the capital and other parts of the country with the help of the us which also supplied most of the financing and the cia which mostly planned it the rebels took the country and installed with the help of the us in order to make sure the right kind of leader was in place a new dictatorship which of course was once again good for ufco and the us civil war in typical us latin american fashion the repressive dictatorship was supported by its creator and it was supportive of us interests ufco was back to where it once was and oil and wood resources that had been denied to the us under the democracy were once again opened up economic aid that had been stopped was reinstated including money from the us dominated world bank many of the insurgents that took part in the us organized bay of pigs invasion trained in guatemala as commonly happens under repressive right wing regimes a leftist guerilla movement arose in response which began a 34 year civil war 1962 to 1996 during which 200 000 people died the majority unarmed noncombatants disproportionally made up of the indigenous indian population the us heavily supported the regime s and its counterinsurgency measures training arms and actual participation was given green berets leading expeditions and american pilots taking part in dropping napalm early on between 1970 and 1973 an estimated 15 000 people died due to political violence the counterinsurgency so called internal security operations continued and increased into the 1970s the 1970s and early 1980s saw the worst the fighting one dictator proclaiming his willingness to turn the country into a cemetery in order to pacify it www witnessforpeace org while us participation was probably discontinued by then economic and military aid continued other important aid coming from the world bank international bank for reconstruction and development and the inter american development bank world bank and the energy crisis one of the chief means of giving indirect aid to guatemala to prop up whichever current dictator was in power was is through the world bank this of course in addition to other economic and military aid because the us has the most voting stock it is able to guide policy of the bank having a permanent place among the executive directors who choose the president who has unsurprisingly been from the united states time and time again as well a location near washington d c making it easily accessible to lobbyists and us policymakers all help it being used as an instrument or adjunct for the implementation of us foreign policy the list of corrupt and or repressive often violently so regimes that have received significant aid is surprising general augusto pinochet chile mobutu sese seko zaire general sani abacha nigeria suharto indonesia ferdinand marcos philippines a list almost as impressive as the leaders combined body count aid was freely given to countries whose leaders almost regardless of behavior supported and facilitated us interests often those that didn t had aid withheld sometimes with strict conditions and demands guatemala under democracy and grenada for example much of the aid never trickled down to the people who were supposed to be helped and often ruined the economy in the long term of course this was good for the dictators especially when part of the money found its way into their pockets as was the case in guatemala it was bad for the people as early as the 1960s the world bank was assisting guatemala in its energy concerns it had concluded after extensive research and survey that it was imperative for guatemala to get a reliable source of electric power as a means to increase economic growth and the assumed increase in standard of life whether much of it would reach the people is debatable as a result loans totaling 22 million were given to build two small hydroelectric dams in the latter part of the decade because of various reasons technical and financial they were inadequate to meet the needs of the country beginning an energy crisis by the beginning of the 1970s because the majority of guatemala s electric needs came from geothermal plants underutilized and especially diesel fuel large amounts of imported oil were necessary to meet demand spending about 60 of its export earnings by the mid 1970s there were availability problems making the crisis even more serious so the chixoy project was developed in 1972 the crisis had not reached its worst at the time but it was clear the direction the country s energy problems were headed in 1976 a 111 hour blackout affected the entire country the rest of that year and into the next availability of power was often nonexistent in places 1977 saw extensive blackouts through the first quarter of the year the importance of the project could not be underestimated damming the chixoy the plan was to dam the río chixoy the first stage being to create a large reservoir 49 8 km long and 0 6 km wide 31 miles by 1 mile in the chixoy valley it was claimed the project would result in a significant increase in electricity an early study for the proposed four dam project estimated triple the current amount it was also felt that the high cost of the project initially 270 million would be quickly offset by the expected savings and production supposedly some 340 million by 1990 unfortunately it wasn t going to work that way mismanagement poor planning unforeseen geological difficulties perhaps ones that should have been foreseen and unexpected obstacles an earthquake in 1976 that delayed work and necessitated a significant strengthening of the dam to withstand any future quakes all extended the time required and caused the cost to skyrocket the current estimate for the project exceeds 1 billion dollars with some estimates more than twice that that funds were misappropriated by those involved almost goes without saying in fact it has been a massive failure in most ways the basin is filling with sediment making many believe the dam s usefulness will only last about twenty years the impact on the economy is significant as well in 1991 about 45 of the country s foreign debt came from the project and in 1995 over half of the electric company s revenue went to pay off foreign debt incurred by the dam structural maintenance costs 8 million a year and the country still has to purchase oil at 150 million a year the dam does not produce enough electricity only 30 of the population have electricity but the dam also had other reasons that had little to do with guatemala s national needs it was part of an economic development plan that would benefit one area where a number of the generals government officials including then president general fernando romeo lucas garcía and his brother general manuel benedicto lucas garcía owned property men who would personally benefit land that would be more desirable and worth more with few or none of the country s poor around in 1983 anthropologist shelton h davis testified before congress that it appears as if hydroelectric development in guatemala was related to the modernization of the guatemala army and its concern to turn the northern lowlands into a vast cattle ranching petroleum mining and timber frontier by carrying out this frontier development program with international assistance the guatemalan army hoped to consolidate its own political and economic power qtd www witnessforpeace org further the dean of the school of civil engineering at guatemala s san carlos university stated that the dam was the biggest gold mine the crooked generals ever had www damsreport org again good for them not for the people interestingly the world bank was aware that the early projections were overly optimistic and that the guatemala instituto nacional de electrificación inde was disorganized and mismanaged and that there were unfavorable geological conditions www witnessforpeace org this did not stop them from green lighting the project or from beginning the many loans this brings up the charges often leveled at the world bank accusing it of letting poor countries get into an almost perpetual dependence and debt the second part of the charge being that it also functions as a means of controlling foreign policy again other countries whether the assessment is accurate is outside of the scope here but it is intriguing damning the maya of course there was another obstacle to getting the dam built and that was the people who lived in the chixoy basin the basin was home to the maya achí and had been for hundreds of years leaving a traditional indian culture of farmers the fertile area around the río chixoy allowed them to survive by harvests of fruit corn maize beans and tomatoes among others some livestock were also raised and fishing was another source of food additional money or goods could be had through the manufacture of handmade fabrics and crafts which could be sold or traded along with other agricultural products at markets elsewhere work could also be had by working as seasonal laborers on cotton sugar or coffee plantations as one former resident of the area explained life was hard but it was good the people were content everyone lived nearby we all knew each other and we lived peacefully but when they began the construction many strangers came to our communities the army arrived the guerrillas arrived and then the violence started www witnessforpeace org the people were largely self sufficient as they had been for centuries this was partly necessitated because of the relative remoteness of the population the rabinal municipality there were no roads prior to dam construction and the nearest major market town rabinal was an eight hour walk through the mountains there were some 463 families about 1500 people who were officially recognised as ones who be affected by the dam in 1976 this was low estimate a more accurate number is over 3400 people and this could be a bit low the largest community was río negro which had 791 people according to an inde census in 1977 it was also the strongest traditional culture of the villages in the basin there was a strong bond with the land and the traditional homeland the graves of ancestors were there and religious sites this was a problem for the guatemalan government and bad for the maya despite being an obstacle there was little thought put into what to do with the indigenous population according to an early study attachment shown by the involved communities to their region and land was a resettlement problem www damsreport org a feasibility study was even more dismissive the population in the zone is mainly indigenous in the area of the study there is almost no population most of the population in this area live in the higher parts of nearby mountains www damsreport org this was either grossly incompetent unlikely or a deliberate falsehood as the majority of the people lived near the river it wasn t until a year after the decision to build the dam that the people were even notified that the land that generations of their people had lived worked and died on would cease to exist disappearing under the waters of the dam s reservoir and they would all have to relocate the people had had zero input into the decision of course they were justifiably outraged at the announcement but realized there was no way to fight back so they chose to try to negotiate broken promises and deceit the inde suggested two different villages for relocation each was rejected as being too hot and too far away www witnessforpeace org at least one of the areas had little fertile land and poor access to water the idea was to relocate all residents of the region to those places despite some differing ethnicity and conflict between the groups it again shows little real concern for the victims of displacement a third site was agreed upon pacux near rabinal with certain conditions cement block houses with duralite roofs potable water and free electricity five acres of fertile land for each family a community truck compensation for crops and orchards lost in the flooding a church schools a health center and access roads a boat social services www witnessforpeace org residents were led to believe they were getting a fair deal despite the heartbreak of leaving one s ancestral home construction at pacux began in 1978 and the first groups of those who agreed to resettle were transported there in 1980 it was far different from they had hoped and nothing like río negro it was poorly planned there was little land and the homes were small people who had lived a rural existence all their lives going back hundreds of years were being forced into an urban environment one community leader described the response you have to understand that the people were upset by the construction of the houses and layout of the community seeing pacux that day was difficult for a rural people who felt such a strong bond to their land in río negro they were getting swindled and they knew it www witnessforpeace org feeling cheated and betrayed it effectively ended the negotiations meanwhile there were other problems for the maya a french archaeological group contracted through the inde had been excavating ruins in the area around río negro and the basin looking for artifacts though some maya were employed as laborers for them the majority resented the digging up of land and history land on which they currently lived and communally owned taking items that held resonance for them of importance culturally and religiously and creating a sense of having their homeland violated by foreigners after two years río negro stopped them from digging near their village in turn indians were accused of stealing artifacts it may have been true though the maya felt that the archaeologists who had not been invited by them anyway had no right to take anything how can we steal what is already ours www witnessforpeace org also at that time inde was found to be taking tons of gravel rocks and sand from land shared by the people of the basin and trucking it to where the dam was being built there had been no permission asked or granted the inde simply took what it felt it was entitled to the residents of río negro were angered but negotiated to allow the sale of material from its section of the land for 12 000 the money was distributed among the people of the village but unevenly which brought more problems as at least one person who felt slighted went to the neighboring village of xococ and told them that río negro had sold the rights of all the land to the inde this outraged the residents of xococ who began denouncing rio negro as communists guerillas on just how significant such a charge was see the opening sections of part two the army was informed of their subversive tendencies and the inde began denouncing them as guerillas and calling for action not long after the inde got the people of río negro to turn over their land titles the people were assured that they would be returned after a few months the people demanded them to be returned as promised only to be informed by the inde that the titles had never been received and the location of them was unknown this basically robbed them of almost any claim they had to land in a legal sense it was 1980 and the massacres would soon begin part two rio negro massacres the killings part three rio negro massacres responsibility

trade tensions and uncertainty surrounding brexit are raising economic risks for the euro area prompting france to urge germany to loosen its purse strings to support growth it would be irresponsible not to examine the need for new investments in the euro zone french finance minister bruno le maire said on saturday at an annual economic conference in aix en provence in southern france increased spending is under discussion between france and germany and is one of the biggest points of divergence between the neighbors he added now is the time to invest in innovation and infrastructure not in social spending he said citing the negative impact of trade tensions between china and the united states on economic growth and accommodating monetary policy and negative interest rates that could ease the cost of spending a slump in german factory orders in may is the latest sign that global trade uncertainty is turning europe s temporary slowdown into a more serious downturn the region s biggest economy reported huge declines in export orders and investment goods after a survey showed factory activity shrank for a sixth month in june the continued gloom is increasing concern at the european central bank and a growing number of economists are predicting it will add more monetary stimulus as soon as this month risks are such that the ecb may have to take action even before newly nominated head christine lagarde takes over in october societe generale sa chairman lorenzo bini smaghi said in an interview any action would also depend on the course taken by the federal reserve later this month brexit uncertainty we have all the factors of uncertainty the economist and former ecb executive board member said at the aix en provence conference also citing uncertainty surrounding the u k s plan to leave the european union later this year at some point the slowdown may reach bottom and we want to have the monetary instruments in place to avoid that this becomes a recession despite a slowing economy that could arguably benefit from a fiscal boost germany is running a large budget surplus and reducing a relatively low debt burden which stands at close to 60 percent of gross domestic product france s was just under 100 percent in the first quarter germany is among countries that have room to increase their debt load along with the netherlands while others including france and italy need to be on a path to reduce it despite low interest rates said odile renaud basso the head of the french treasury a debt load approaching 100 percent of gross domestic product doesn t have an impact when markets are confident but it is politically symbolic and it s a fragility factor in the longer term le maire said he planned to broach the topic with german christian democratic union party chief annegret kramp karrenbauer who took over from chancellor angela merkel and was also in aix en provence the main task for germany is to see where we break ground through new technology innovation and new business models she said in an interview we need to speed up processes we have too much bureaucracy these changes have less to do with money germany s export oriented economy has less to do with a lack of financing than a reaction to the growing trade conflict said the frontrunner of the party to succeed merkel as chancellor germany s approach needs to change and go towards more debt and investment as well as respecting eu rules on debt henrik enderlein professor of political economy at the hertie school of governance in berlin said at the conference it s currently got margins of maneuver source bloomberg
this article is more than 4 years old the bund bull in shanghai blackrock thinks market is too optimistic on china trade war and beijing s ability to continue stimulating its economy qilai shen 2017 bloomberg finance lp the world s largest asset manager blackrock with 6 5 trillion under management is ready to play defense now blame trump s trade war and uncertainties over the global supply chain that is forcing them to cut their growth outlook defense doesn t mean they re hoarding gold coins and stuffing cash in pillow cases in fact blackrock says it expects the fed and european central bank to remain in easing mode meaning qe in europe and expected rate cuts here in the u s will extend the equity rally blackrock is actually bullish on u s equities because the central bank s free money machine is getting jump started again as a result their fund managers think emerging market bonds will get even more love this year as conservative fixed income investors get forced outside of the u s if they want yield on their bond investments on china blackrock says markets are overly optimistic about china s efforts to stimulate growth they are underweight china linked equities throughout asia the u s and china have announced another trade war cease fire following last week s g20 summit in osaka both sides have entered into a strategic rivalry that is unlikely to change even in the event of a democratic party victory in 2020 the changes in the global supply chain where china has for years been the manufacturing hub for the western world is a potential shock to globalization long existing trends including china s deflationary role in world economics and china s ability to be a massive cheap labor source are coming to an end barring a surprising u turn on trade this is a scenario that markets are not prepared for and could lead to negative returns in both equities and bonds blackrock analysts led by philipp hildebrand wrote in their 16 page midyear investment outlook today as a result of the disruptions caused by the china trade war blackrock is downgrading their global growth outlook they see a lull in china s growth due to the fallout of u s tariffs confidence in both the corporate and household sector is currently running low in china another reason why the current recovery appears anemic even after significant stimulus estimates of the net impact on economic growth vary from half a percentage point to a full percentage point barclays capital said last week that they expect the trade war to finally drag china s official gdp to 5 at investment firms the in house proprietary economic and financial models all find it difficult to quantify the fallout from the trade war that s mainly because no one knows what companies will move out of china which ones will lower their prices or if companies do move out of china what will become of the newly unemployed can they be absorbed by other sectors of the chinese economy this uncertainty suggests that risks could be skewed to the downside for china the shake up of long standing supply chains could also reduce corporate investments while a softer job market could pressure consumer spending a long favored

of an insurance policy against tariff escalation then wall street might get what it wants later this month but bullard is a lone voice and the decision to cut is not his blackrock s willing to play defense now because looser monetary policy may not be effective in dealing with the effects of protectionism and geopolitical tensions for giulia artolli a european fixed income fund manager for blackrock more qe in europe and lower rates in the u s might not offset a drop in growth as supply chains get remapped a recession is unlikely artolli says markets may be counting on too many fed rate cuts and could be disappointed the market was wrong on the fed before investors started the year off forecasting four rate hikes this year taking treasury yields to 4 or more now everyone is expecting rate cuts and that s kept the s p 500 humming that expectation will continue to do be supportive to american stock portfolios so long as the fed doesn t pull the rug out from everyone

it seems there are few things central bankers like more than a good weather metaphor for the state of the economy in that case this week bank of canada s stephen poloz may want to add gathering storm clouds to the headwinds he has used in the past expanding on the meteorological euphemism of crosscurrents recently employed by his opposite number at the u s fed on wednesday poloz and his chief deputy carolyn wilkins meet with the business media to present their latest take on whether your interest rates should go up go down or stay the same despite heavy weather that has been widely predicted for the coming year so far neither the canadian nor the u s economy seems in dire need of interest rate cuts in fact a whole flurry of economic indicators plus the resolution of trade conflicts with our biggest trade partner seem to be saying the short term forecast is mainly sunny clear sailing statistics canada s labour force survey showed a slight cooling on friday with the predicted small rise in the unemployment rate and the loss of about 2 000 jobs but beyond those headline numbers the latest jobs report was far from gloomy alberta and saskatchewan saw significant job increases in june the slight decline in jobs in the month comes after a year when the economy churned out more than 400 000 new positions also this past month permanent jobs replaced lost part time work a sign employers may be anxious to lock in their own stable of employees instead of depending on the gig economy people who have those full time jobs saw wage gains well above inflation most important the trend in the unemployment rate seems clear with friday s small rise possibly just a zig in a zigzag downward slope scott galley cbc but perhaps an even more significant economic indicator for poloz and wilkins on wednesday will be last friday s u s jobs data that put canada s in the shade there a slight uptick in recent record low unemployment rates was overwhelmed by a tornado of job creation exceeding forecasts that had already been considered optimistic with the economy generating more than 200 000 jobs in the month all of a sudden the idea that the fed s jerome powell would slash interest rates by as much as half a percentage point next time around seems to have evaporated if so expect a frosty reaction from u s president donald trump loonie reacts to u s economic strength as often happens markets soaring on the prospect of rate cuts to boost a sagging economy suddenly declined from their stratospheric heights when it looked as if the economy was doing well in friday trading the canadian dollar which some have been predicting could head to 80 cents us as the two economies diverged fell back that was not because bank of canada watchers thought poloz would alter his predicted no change interest rate policy but merely because those jobs numbers showed no sign that either the u s economy or the greenback was about to fall behind a confluence of economic good news is having positive effects on business according to francis fong chief economist at the chartered professional accountants of canada falling vancouver property prices are causing concern but despite the heat construction employment in toronto for example at this former newspaper building shows no sign of meltdown don pittis cbc fong says a recent survey of high ranking canadian corporate accountants shows renewed optimism it s actually the first increase in optimism we have seen in our survey since 2017 said fong that considered it seems unkind to rain on their parade but in wednesday s meet the press poloz may be asked to look past the latest clear patch to signs of worsening conditions ahead unstable conditions ahead fong points out his survey s optimism is tempered by continued fears about trade and while canada and mexico seem out of trump s tariff spotlight worries continue about the repercussions of his battle with beijing there are some concerns the democrats in congress will stall passing the new nafta with unknown effects canadian housing and consumer borrowing remain a concern compounding problems should a recession hit but a deep dive in the vancouver market seems mostly at the high end and renewed strength in toronto is a reminder housing demand has not gone away us yield curve is still inverted still worrying financialtimes but perhaps most ominous for 2020 is the continuing and lengthening of the yield curve inversion a technical but until now foolproof warning of a change in the prevailing economic conditions the exact mechanism of the yield curve signal is much disputed some saying it is a cause others a result of recessionary activity in the economy some take the view that the distorting effect of the recent long period of rate cutting by central banks means it s different this time even if the warning is accurate like the extended outlook from environment canada the exact timing of when the tempest will hit remains uncertain previous instances show there is a lag of many months and in past cases interest rates begin heading back toward normal that is long rates being higher than short rates before recession strikes the other great uncertainty is how severe the disturbance will be if it occurs experience cannot tell us if the longest north american economic boom in recorded history will end with an economy flattening depression or a brief period of turbulence before heading back to growth central bankers must consider plans for both contingencies even if for now the sun is shining and the birds are chirping follow don on twitter don_pittis

konstantinidis reuters greek prime minister alexis tsipras on sunday conceded defeat to his opponent kyriakos mitsotakis after exit polls showed the latter s centre right new democracy nd party on track to win the parliamentary elections in the nation with 75 per cent of votes counted the nd party was leading with 39 6 per cent of total votes heading towards a majority in the 300 member greek parliament while tsipras leftist syriza was behind with 31 6 per cent of total votes cnn reported in a live television broadcast tsipras conceded defeat saying the result has been determined but we will be back in his speech mitsotakis said i know the difficulties lying ahead i don t request a grace period because we don t have time for it transparency and meritocracy will return to greece and our country s voice will be heard in europe he said that his first priority after taking office would be to boost the stagnant economy by slashing taxes and regulations and attracting investment mitsotakis is set to take oath as the new prime minister of greece at 1 pm local time on monday he is the son of former premier konstantinos mitsotakis who ruled the country from 1990 to 1993 between 1986 and 1995 mitsotakis studied in the united states receiving degrees from harvard and stanford he was working in the banking sector before joining politics known to be a liberal reformist the 51 year old nd leader has served as minister of administrative reform from 2013 and 2015 mitsotakis has vowed to change greece s global image in the wake of an acute economic crisis in the last nine years which saw its economy down by 25 per cent the worst contraction for a developed country since the end of world war ii the syriza party had called for a snap election in may after it fared poorly in the european parliament polls sunday s preliminary results show the widespread discontent by the people with tsipras after four years of populist reforms he implemented in exchange for greece s international bailout to infuse life into the sluggish economy and to prevent the country from departing from the eu s monetary union popularly known as grexit apart from these measures the move to change neighbouring macedonia s name as north macedonia also led to tsipras losing popular support despite the fact that the decades long naming dispute was finally resolved mitsotakis pro business steamroller mitsotakis is a hard nosed reformer from a conservative political dynasty with controversial civil service job cuts on his resume three years after taking over the leadership of the conservative nd party he has promised to steamroll obstacles to business he has pledged to create better jobs through growth foreign investment and tax cuts his critics argue that his pro business platform and promised tax cuts can only credibly come at the expense of social benefits to crisis hit families in his sole ministerial stint in charge of administrative reform in 2014 he was tasked with eliminating 15 000 civil service posts under pressure from greece s creditors the downsizing was cut short by elections but mitsotakis s tag as a hatchet man has endured tsipras bailout pm who lost final gamble image outgoing greek prime minister and leader of leftist syriza party alexis tsipras greets supporters in athens photograph alkis konstantinidi reuters alexis tsipras s dream of leading greece into the post bailout era came crashing down on sunday in a defeat blamed by analysts on a middle class revolt against heavy taxation tsipras leaves the post as the longest running pm in the country s decade long crisis after winning a series of gambles including an austerity referendum resignation and re election in 2015 and a confidence vote as recently as may his luck finally ran out we took difficult decisions and today we paid the political cost a chastened tsipras said in a concession speech we will work hard to make this defeat a temporary one he said adding that his party would dynamically resist efforts to roll back labour rights tsipras tried everything to avert defeat he warned voters that a victory by the conservative opposition new democracy party would bring back the hated international monetary fund from which he had just liberated the country on the policy side tsipras touted his party s track record in reducing unemployment by around eight points and raising the minimum wage for the first time since 2012 his government also rolled out a batch of last minute tax cuts in may it was still not enough to turn the tide as mitsotakis promised a swifter turn around with lower taxes tsipras was greece s first avowed atheist pm and its youngest in over a century he had stormed to power in 2015 with promises to eliminate austerity instead greece s creditors forced him to accept a third bailout following a disastrous six month negotiation that nearly saw the country pushed out of the euro in the four years that followed syriza sharply increased taxes to build a fiscal surplus demanded by the creditors but also promoted income redistribution programmes to help the poor with rent electricity benefits and school meals the economy inched out of recession and unemployment fell from nearly 26 percent when syriza took power to around 18 percent this year under tsipras greece also took major steps on equal rights reforms at a time of hardening views towards migrants in europe tsipras s administration also tried to integrate asylum seekers but resistance from other eu countries left greek island camps full to bursting with desperate refugees often living in appalling conditions with inputs from agencies

the relationship between ghana and the international monetary fund imf is to many ghanaians a difficult one most ghanaians are of the view that the country should divorce itself from the international body a look at sentiments expressed in statements by former presidents and finance ministers under whose tenure the country exited one sponsored programme or another illustrate this well they ranged from advertisement the decision to be independent of imf budgetary support is a watershed in the history of the country s economic development to we won t go to imf again ghana will no longer be troubled by conditionalities of imf these quotes encapsulate how ghanaians feel about the relationship but is the relationship that bad an informed assessment requires some context how ghana relates to all bretton woods institutions a historical assessment of this will better contextualise the nature of ghana s relationship with the imf advertisement the early years ghana was the first sub saharan african country to gain independence in 1957 it was undoubtedly a beacon of hope for the region the country had significant natural resources as well as a highly educated population ghana s relationship with the imf is a cycle of meeting targets under its programs before falling back on bad habits the relationship between ghana and the imf and world bank dates back to the late 1960s following the overthrow of kwame nkrumah s government in 1966 the country suffered nearly two decades of political instability and economic decline a prolonged drought worsened the situation as did widespread bush fires this resulted in an unparalleled famine adding to the burden on government was the need to resettle one million citizens from nigeria the next decade saw the global oil crisis as well as a persistent downward trend in the terms of trade by the 1980s inflation was at a triple digit level undoubtedly by 1983 ghana s economy was in tatters it desperately needed support to reverse the downward spiral as a result ghana embarked on a major programme of economic reform it did this through an imf and world bank sponsored structural adjustment programme and economic recovery programme over the years these have become a major reference points in terms of the relationship between ghana and the bretton woods institutions advertisement the scale of reforms under these arrangements were enormous structural adjustment the structural adjustment facilities were used to steer ghana toward becoming a market friendly nation where incentives were created by the free market in the process the country embarked on a large scale overhaul of institutions encouraged competition by privatising state own enterprises built institutional capacity and attained macroeconomic stability undeniably ghana chalked up some initial successes under the programme it was in fact referred to as the programme s ideal student due to significant improvements in its macroeconomic indicators but after nearly two decades of adjustment in 2001 the country fell on hard times it was classified as a highly indebted poor country a world bank and imf initiative aimed at reducing the external debt burden of very poor countries advertisement at the time all ghana s earlier successes had been eroded the economy was suffering from rapid exchange rate depreciation high inflation and very low external reserves the severe crisis was partly due to high debt service requirements that affected the budget and affected the balance of payments in 2001 the newly elected government opted for debt relief under the highly indebted countries initiative this decision was met with a lot of public backlash people s view was that ghana had fallen from being the beacon of hope for africa to being heavily indebted and poor people started to ask lots of questions about the implications of the effects of 16 years of imf and world bank adjustment programmes and their ramifications on ghana s development to many the country had been tied to the apron strings of the bretton woods institutions and had to wean itself off as soon as possible again by mid 2013 the government s efforts to achieve fiscal consolidation were undermined by policy slippages external shocks and rising interest cost this continued until mid 2014 but then the country s net international reserves position had weakened further and the exchange rate had depreciated sharply fuelling inflationary pressures advertisement these macroeconomic mishaps occurred against the background of the issuance of eurobond and a short term loan contracted by the cocoa board in the same year yet public debt continued to rise at an unsustainable pace ghana then entered another imf backed stabilisation program its 16th since independence after missing targets in 2013 and 2014 on 3 april 2015 the imf approved a three year extended credit facility arrangement with ghana this was aimed at the restoration of debt sustainability and macroeconomic stability to foster a return to high growth and job creation while protecting social spending the programme was extended for an additional year ending on 2 april 2019 undoubtedly the programme resulted in significant macroeconomic gains with rising growth single digit inflation fiscal consolidation and banking sector clean up nevertheless challenges remain ghana performs again in its world economic outlook the imf is forecasting that ghana will be the fastest growing economy in the world this year with a projected growth rate of 8 8 as with previous imf world bank sponsored programmes ghana is once again out performing itself advertisement as usual the government is very optimistic about the prospects of the country following its exit from the programme the obvious question being asked is what is different this time the programme appears different in a number of ways first it was based on a combination domestic and foreign of sources of finance second conditionalities attached to it were informed by homegrown policies this was unlike previous programmes where conditionalities were based on the washington consensus lastly ghana has also made important changes it passed a new law the first of its kind in the country to govern government spending the act seeks to ensure fiscal responsibility macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability a key provision gives parliament the power to censure the finance minister if spending exceeds defined limits advertisement what next given the chronology of ghana s relationship with the imf and the cycle of achieving targets under its programmes before falling back on bad habits most believe it s just a matter of time before the country goes back to the imf asking for help the likelihood of this happening is increased by the fact that the country goes to the polls in 2020 this means there is bound to be a tendency for government to overspend whatever happens next it s important to note that the structure of the economy has not changed it is still highly susceptible to external shocks particularly commodity prices to the extent that these external shocks are unavoidable the imf and world bank will remain critical partners in the country s development process priscilla twumasi baffour fellow of the international institute for advanced studies university of ghana this article is

article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com since the 2007 2009 financial crisis the talk and lengthy discussions about systemic risks and its implication on the stability of the global financial system has not ceased governments and international organizations showed increasing concerns of its serious implications 1 under which the world s financial system can collapse like a row of diamonds steven l schwarcz in the united states for instance the congress held lengthy hearings discussing systemic risks and its impact on the financial markets 2 according to the international monetary fund imf and to the bank of international settlements bis systemic risk is defined as a risk of disruption to financial services that is caused by an impairment of all or parts of the financial system and has the potential to have serious negative consequences for the real economy 3 however it is hard to identify which type of risks are truly systemic to the economy4 from the type of risks which are idiosyncratic it is the negative externality and the contagion risk to the financial markets are the basis of systemic risk and therefore requiring an effective policy intervention and interaction 5 from the above definition of systemic risk we can recognize that it has two main dimensions cross sectional and time dimension 6 the cross sectional dimension deals with common exposure in the financial systems the level of interconnectedness and how a specific shock can be amplified and goes on to become a real threat to the global economy thus the main focus here is on the distribution of risk in the financial system 7 on the other hand the time dimension deals with the pro cyclicality accumulation of financial instability and how overall systemic risk progresses over time 8 consequentially the need to regulate such risk is essential given its complexity and its different forms however previous macro polices that were entered to tackle systemic risks were not sufficient they must be accompanied with other well established approaches such as micro prudential fiscal and monetary policies in this article we will only discuss the design for macro prudential approach framework its implementation and its potential impact on the financial stability and whether it will jeopardize the economic growth of the economy the design of macro prudential supervision framework previously prior the crisis the regulatory and supervisory approach was implicitly based on a philosophy which believed in three main principles 9 first markets are self correcting which means that market discipline is a more effective tool than setting up regulations and enacting laws second the main responsibility in managing risks falls on the senior management and boards of the individual institutions who are believed to be better positioned to evaluate risks that regulators lastly customer protection can only be protected by unfettered and transparent market 10 as a result of such philosophy a micro prudential supervisory approach micropru has been implemented on the basis to focus on the administration of individual institutions instead of on the entire financial system and the emphasis on ensuring the systems and processes were in place and correctly implemented rather than challenging business models and plans 11 the micropru therefore failed to p the risk of externalities on the financial system such as externalities related to strategic complementarities interconnectedness and fire sales 12 consequentially another complementary macro prudential approach macropru has to be in place along with micropru to ensure financial stability and to control systemic risks 13 macropru can be defined as a policy that uses mainly prudential tools to control and mitigate systemic or system wide financial risk thus limit the impact of disruption out if individual financial institutions that can have a severe negative results on the overall economy including the probability of asset bubble formation14 by first targeting the accumulation of financial imbalances and establish effective defenses to keep the economy immune from any major sharp downswing 15 second identifying the sources of contagion risks via identifying common exposures and the level of interconnectedness in the financial system 16 from this definition the underlying framework of macropru can be outlined as follows 17 we will discuss each in turn objectives of limiting systemic and system wide financial risk 18 scope of analysis of the overall financial system and its correlation with the economy 19 set of tools and their governance of prudential instruments which are particularly assigned to macro prudential authorities 20 by looking at the objectives we can notice that macropru focuses on two essential dimensions of systemic risk first the buildup of systemic risk over time called the time dimension and second the distribution of risk in the financial system at a particular time called cross sectional dimension 21 the main focus in the time dimension is to control or minimize pro cyclicality in the financial system by measuring how systemic risk interacts with the financial system and therefore assess its stability i e in booming economy financial system tends to add on more risk through plenty of credit and money supply this is shows the interlink between macropru and monetary policy rapid increase in asset valuation and prices and through a remarkable increase in leverage and maturity mismatch 22 mainly due to the fact when short term debt is cheaper form of financing than equity banks and other financial institutions will tend to take on more debt that they should be 23 in contrast in a downturn economy the lack of sufficient buffers can impose financial distress which can be amplified by pressing deleveraging and by suddenly cutting the credit tab 24 in the cross sectional on the other hand the prime focus is to reduce concentration risk which can arise from having similar exposure among banks and other financial institutions 25 and the high interconnectedness level among them resulted mainly from their interbank money market operation and payment settlement systems 26 before discussing the tools for macropru the effective assessment of systemic risk should be highlighted as it is one of the essential elements for a stronger macropru framework 27 this requires upgrading the current financial statistics and the analytical toolkit to cover all potential sources of systemic risk and its buildup 28 improved quality of information in this area will assist the regulators and supervisors to better understand interconnections in the financial system and consequentially developing the right analytical tools to limit the possibility and consequences of the general reaction to shocks that can jeopardize the stability of the whole financial system 29 however as long as financial markets will keep growing and creating innovative investment tools the likelihood of noticeable information gaps will definitely emerges 30 therefore one of the priorities of a successful macropru policy is ensuring the financial statistical framework are dynamic and responsive to keep the pace with the development in the financial markets 31 nonetheless such a development will increase the burden on adopting macropru as it will increase the underlying costs significantly since the last financial crisis and the regulators and international institutions are trying to identify the right tools for an effective macropru framework for example goodhart kashyap suggested five macropru policy tools in order to mitigate the defaults in the housing markets which may lead to serious impairment to the banking and financial system 32 these are a caps on loan to value ratio b higher capital requirements for banks c clear and strict loan loss provisioning for banks d increased the bank s liquidity requirements via higher liquidity coverage ratios e margin requirements on repurchase transactions by shadow banks 33 in spite of the challenges of identifying the right tools for implementing macropru a set of tools have been proposed to p the both pillars of macropru framework time dimension and cross sectional dimension 34 i basel iii the previous basel standards basel i and basel ii were entirely based on micropru measures which as explained above considers risk as exogenous caused as result of individual behavior 35 by focusing on the balance sheet insolvency of financial institutions and ignoring insolvencies related to cash flows i e liquidity measures basel iii was first introduced by the basel committee in 2010 as immediate response to the financial crisis 36 in 2017 basel iii got amended to cover the following comprehensive features 37 first increasing the level and upgrading the quality of capital by increasing the requirements of tier 1 capital from 4 to 6 with a minimum of three quarters must be the highest quality common shares and retained earnings second enhance methods of capturing risk by enhancing risk sensitivity and reducing the reliance on external credit ratings third higher leverage ratio requirements fourth improving liquidity by asking banks to hold sufficient liquid assets to keep them operational for at least 30 days finally limiting pro cyclicality by requesting banks to retain earnings to build up capital buffers during expansionary high growth periods 38 the above basel iii framework contains a number of provisions that should control pro cyclicality and limit financial imbalances 39 in addition it pes interconnectedness among financial institutions via managing the risks arising from the firm exposure i e derivatives transactions securitizations and off balance sheet exposure 40 on the lights of the above basel iii combines both macropru and micropru tools to tackle systemic risk ii countercyclical variations in margins or collateral haircuts 41 this tool aims to upgrade common margining practices to become more dynamic and stable during the economy life cycle thus capping financial markets pro cyclicality 42 it can be achieved by applying haircuts and mark to market practices on collaterals and that specifically includes collateral on over the counter otc derivatives 43 iii sectoral capital requirements this tool provides an important mechanism to p the cross sectional dimension of systemic risk and therefore managing concentration and interconnectedness exposure by temporarily increase individual firm s capital requirements on their exposure to specific sectors 44 a good example for such a tool would be the bank of england act 1998 macro prudential measures order 2013 644 in which the regulator has the authority to ask financial firms to maintain additional funds to three main sectors 45 a residential property which includes mortgages b commercial property and c financial sector which allows the regulator to target exposures to loans derivatives and bonds to all financial participants in addition the regulator can impose specific requirements on firms if they fail to keep the additional capital and applying stress tests on individual firms to consider certain financial property exposure as if gave rise to their overall risk 46 iii identifying systemically important financial institutions sifi it is a tool that labels major financial institutions as too big to fail as their default will carry a serious systemic risk to the economy 47 in turn regulators are required to impose on them extra layer of regulatory requirements 48 the us enactment of the 2010 dodd frank act is a good example of sifi by the authority of the dodd frank act the financial stability oversight council fsoc has been established with the power to label banks and other financial institutions as sifi such label will impose extra regulatory burdens and intensified scrutiny including strict oversight by the federal reserve higher capital requirements and stress tests 49 which in turn will add another layer of cost on both regulators and financial institutions challenges in implementing macrupro framework obviously the road of implementing the macrupro framework entails significant challenges 50 first the use of time varying macropru techniques requires a significant amount of judgement as it requires accurate targeting and timing in order to deploy such tools regulators must locate the relevant point of risk progression i e distinguishing between overheating asset boom from secular growth in demand and then pick the tool that suppresses the boom without imposing constraints on other economic growth 51 practical evidences suggested that such tools are more influential at tightening credit than easing and have a counter effect of growing consumer credit than bank credit 52 second by requiring targeted banks and financial firms to internalize systemic cost of stability the cross sectional macropru techniques will most likely raise the cost of their credit intermediation which in turn motivates them banks and financial firms to participate in credit intermediation through non target firms outside the umbrella of regulatory perimeter in addition this may have an extended impact of shifting significant amount of financial intermediaries outside the financial sector 53 as a result systemic risk will be amplified instead of being mitigated and controlled third politicians and industry practitioners will resist implementing such measures in fact they might fight it and lobby against it mainly because both groups have shorter time horizon than the period which systemic risk will be build up and eventually burst 54 for example holding dividends distribution to shareholders when the economy is growing will not be accepted from short term investors and traders the impact of macropru framework on economic growth before discussing the relationship between macropru and economic growth and whether it will enhance or mute growth i would like to briefly define a very important risk in the financial market regulatory risk it is the risk that a change in laws and regulations will negatively influence the growth of a certain sector or market 55 this will lead us to the topic of over regulation risk over regulation can halt economic growth by capping innovation muting banking productivity and by limiting credit growth 56 as explained earlier macropru framework aims to enhance financial system stability and resilience by mainly mitigating systemic risk nevertheless there is a strong argument that macropru may be efficient at the cost of curbing long term economic growth which signaling a trade off relationship 57 on the other hand it can be argued that a more regulated supervised economy could better stand economic growth 58 to elaborate more on this point we will test two scenarios first macropru framework may support long term economic growth and second macropru may halt long term economic growth implementing macropru framework can limit the severance of financial shocks which are generally followed by periods of low productivity and negative growth 59 this means by having macropru tools in place we will certainly have better economic growth and productivity during periods of financial shocks in addition as macroeconomic volatility reduces growth and that macropru framework aiming to reduce macroeconomics volatility by enhancing stability macropru framework therefore should positively support long term growth by diminishing economic volatility 60 on the other hand macropru can halt growth by limiting the ability of the market to allocate financial resources freely in addition by requiring financial institutions to keep countercyclical buffer to counter the cyclicality of the economy might reduce the flow of credit to the economy which in turn it may negatively impact economic growth 61 despite of several arguments against it one of the approaches to resolve such trade off and conflict is to include economic growth to the objectives of macropru policy this objective was in fact included in the financial policy committee fpc mandate pursuant to s 9c 1 of the financial services act 2012 9c objectives of the financial policy committee 1 the financial policy committee is to exercise its functions with a view to a contributing to the achievement by the bank of the financial stability objective and b subject to that supporting the economic policy of her majesty s government including its objectives for growth and employment thus it is clear that the fpc has a macropru mandate with a prioritization of objectives where ensuring financial stability as a primary objective and maintaining economic growth as a secondary conclusion in summary there is no doubt that macropru policy is an essential pillar of financial stability however it is not as effective and efficient should it be implemented in isolation there must be close coordination with other policies i e micropru fiscal and monetary policy at the international level in order to achieve the desired outcome similarly given it complexity and the significant cost involved i believe implementing it will never be a straightforward and easy process 62 especially that verifying its effectiveness requires another financial shock which may be not anytime soon bibliography journals baker a political economy and the paradoxes of

the united kingdom s financial conduct authority proposed to ban the sale marketing and distribution in or from the uk to retail persons of all derivatives and exchange traded notes referencing unregulated cryptoassets that can be widely exchanged on cryptoasset platforms or other forums generally the proposed ban would include derivatives and etns based on cryptocurrencies and so called utility tokens to the extent they are created on public blockchains and are readily transferable the ban would not include derivatives or etns referencing security tokens digital tokens that are unregulated but not widely transferrable e g tokens used on a private blockchain or tokens that constitute e money and are subject to the fca s electronic money regulations e g potentially stablecoins futures options and contracts for differences are types of derivatives that would be included in the proposed ban the proposed ban would also not extend to professional clients or eligible counterparties as defined under the fca s client categorization rules click here to access the fca s conduct of business sourcebook 3 5 1 regarding professional clients and 3 6 1 regarding eligible counterparties the fca s prohibition would apply to affected products sold distributed or marketed in or from the uk to retail clients and sales to uk clients from the european economic area even where the clients seek such products proactively however it appears that retail clients would be authorized to obtain affected products proactively from non eea sources the proposed ban would also prevent uk brokers from selling to uk retail clients affected products that might be traded abroad lawfully e g bitcoin futures currently authorized for trading in the united states on commodity futures trading commission designated contract markets the fca claimed that it was proposing its ban because of 1 the complexity of the affected cryptoassets and the lack of transparency around their valuation 2 the prevalence of market abuse and financial crime in the secondary market for cryptoassets e g cyber theft 3 retail customers apparent lack of knowledge and understanding regarding affected cryptoassets and 4 particular characteristics of the relevant derivatives and etns including leverage and volatility of the underlying assets the fca presented various statistical analyses it claimed supported its concerns according to the fca some of these observations demonstrate that affected cryptoasset markets are not driven by external factors such as usage or technological developments but instead are driven by speculation akin to gambling the fca acknowledged that if adopted its proposal might encourage retail clients to invest directly in unregulated tokens or for impacted authorized i e registered firms to encourage retail clients to opt up to professional client status or move their accounts to affiliated non uk entities fca expects that adoption of its proposal would potentially avoid consumer losses between gb 75 million and gb 234 3 million the fca claimed it considered but rejected recommending the use of mandatory risk disclosures as an alternative to a ban the fca said this is because consumers are unlikely to follow advice from authoritative sources moreover he continued offer of products by firms with fca authorisations may also perpetuate a false sense of safety the fca will accept comments on its proposal through october 3 2019 unrelatedly congresswoman maxine waters chairwoman of the united states house committee on financial services and various subcommittee chairpersons requested that facebook and its partners immediately consent to a moratorium on the development and introduction of libra its proposed cryptocurrency and associated initiatives last month facebook published a white paper describing libra whose stated goal is to create a secure scalable blockchain and global virtual currency to help individuals currently outside the financial system benefit from an efficient payment system and to help reduce payment transaction costs for others click here for details in the my view commentary to the article global aml standards setter says countries should require virtual asset service providers to obtain and transmit certain information regarding senders and recipients for all virtual asset transfers in the june 23 2019 edition of bridging the week a moratorium is warranted wrote ms waters because libra raises serious privacy trading national security and monetary policy concerns for not only facebook s over 2 billion users but also for investors consumers and the broader global economy ms waters indicated that during the moratorium the house committee on financial services would hold hearings on cryptocurrencies generally and explore legislative solutions regardless of facebook s response to the moratorium call a hearing regarding the libra proposal is scheduled by the house committee on financial services for july 17 in other legal and regulatory matters involving cryptoassets cftc approves new clearing house as first derivatives clearing organization for fully collateralized deliverable virtual currency futures the cftc approved eris clearing llc as the first derivatives clearing organization authorized to clear fully collateralized virtual currency futures contracts that may be settled by the making or taking of delivery of cryptocurrencies in 2011 the cftc approved eris exchange llc eris clearing s indirect parent company as a designated contract market marketed together as erisx eris clearing anticipates offering the clearing of digital asset futures contracts traded on eris exchange beginning later in 2019 erisx began offering spot virtual currency contracts earlier this year among conditions for its dco registration eris clearing must obtain and endeavor to maintain to the extent commercially reasonable insurance for the theft or loss of participant cryptocurrency collateral must disclose to any potential clearing member material risks associated with the clearing of fully collateralized virtual currency futures and within three years of its dco order must have an independent certified public accountant review its internal controls and provide the accountant s report to the cftc eris clearing must also have an independent cpa audit its virtual currency balances annually and must provide to the cftc any audit report of internal controls it may obtain from any third party service provider used in connection with the custody or storage of cryptocurrencies for clearing members eris clearing was required to demonstrate compliance with 17 core principles under applicable law to obtain its dco status including establishing standards and procedures to protect members and participants funds implementing and maintaining adequate and appropriate risk management capabilities and system safeguards click here for background on these core principles contemporaneously with its receipt of dco status eris clearing also received certain no action relief from the cftc s division of clearing and risk from various requirements ordinarily required by dcos that clear margined products staff concluded that eris clearing would not be obligated to perform these requirements because of its fully collateralized clearing model bitfinex repays us 100 million of us 700 million tether loan subject of ny ag lawsuit the cryptocurrency exchange bitfinex announced that it repaid us 100 million of its outstanding loan facility to tether the company managing the tether stablecoin previously the office of the attorney general for the state of new york obtained an ex parte order from a new york state court prohibiting companies associated with bitfinex and tether from accessing loaning or encumbering in any way us dollar reserves supporting tether digital coins the ny ag claimed that the same individuals ultimately own and operate both bitfinex and tether as well as their related companies among other things charged the ny ag executives of bitfinex and tether agreed for tether to provide bitfinex a line of credit of up to us 900 million sourced from the us dollar reserves supporting tether in order to help meet bitfinex s customers withdrawal demands however this arrangement asserted the ny ag was made without disclosure to tether holders at the time of its lawsuit claimed the ny ag bitfinex had borrowed us 700 million from tether utilizing tether supporting balances click here for background on the ny ag s lawsuit against bitfinex and tether in the article ny court upholds restriction on stablecoin transferring tethered funds to affiliated international exchange but limits time period of prohibition in the may 19 2019 edition of bridging the week my view on december 12 1980 a small start up company apple computer inc launched an initial public offering where it raised less than us 100 million through the sale of 4 6 million shares priced at us 22 investors throughout the united states were able to participate in this ipo however individual investors of one state massachusetts were famously barred from participating this was because the state s regulators said apple was too risky an enterprise for its citizens to invest in and banned the ipo under regulations designed to eradicate highfliers that don t have solid earnings foundations last friday apple closed at over us 204 share after multiple share splits throughout its history and the company s market capitalization hovered between us 900 billion and 1 trillion click here for a representative article describing apple s ipo and massachusetts s ban in retrospect massachusetts clearly got it wrong its fear of apple was grounded in a lack of understanding its prevention of massachusetts individual residents to participate in this ipo was a misguided application of the doctrine of in loco parentis in place of the parents and in retrospect it did not know better at all than ordinary citizens it appears equally condescending for the fca to propose banning derivatives based on cryptocurrencies for the entire class of retail persons solely because it believes that such persons generically cannot possibly understand the risks of the product this particularly appears to be the case when the fca concedes that its ban may not be entirely effective either in precluding retail persons from obtaining access to derivatives through non uk based sellers or preventing retail persons from purchasing spot cryptocurrencies directly i have no view on whether any individual cryptocurrency will be around in its current form in 5 10 or more years let alone whether the price of any particular virtual currency will rise or fall no one can dispute that the prices of cryptocurrencies have been highly volatile moreover it is more than likely that additional virtual currencies will be lost through external hacks and internal fraud at intermediaries if not through design flaws of some cryptocurrencies themselves notwithstanding if the fca is concerned about the integrity of cryptocurrencies and derivatives based on them it should draft clearer disclosures and develop and impose appropriate standards on the marketers and sellers of such products rather than banning access by retail persons outright this is the approach the cftc has taken in the us in recently approving dcms dcos and swap execution facilities to trade and clear virtual currency derivatives and of the national futures association in mandating disclosures to all customers by futures commission merchants and introducing brokers that engage in virtual currency transactions click here for details regarding the nfa advisory in the article national futures association proposes interpretive notice requiring fcm ib cta and cpo disclosures regarding virtual currency activity in the july 27 2018 edition of between bridges the effective date of the nfa notice was october 31 2018 the fca might even consider suitability standards that could require sellers to preclude certain individual retail purchasers who fail to satisfy certain minimum standards but make these prohibitions individual focused and not across an entire class banning derivatives for a generic group of purchasers and sellers all retail persons regardless of individual suitability is wrong this is especially the case where from the outset other alternatives exist to acquire cryptoasset exposure that retail persons desiring exposure can pursue it is far better for a regulator to establish standards for derivatives on cryptocurrencies that can assist all investors and recognizes differences in individual capabilities hopefully the fca gets it better for retail persons in 2019 than massachusetts got it for its individual citizens who wanted to participate in the apple ipo in 1980

last week saw japan s mitsui and japan oil gas and metals national corporation agree to buy a 10 stake in novatek s arctic lng liquefied natural gas 2 project for an officially undisclosed price although russia s president vladimir putin independently stated that the investment would be around us 3 billion the fact that putin himself commented on the deal underlines how important the exploration and development of the arctic region is for the russian state as a source of potentially vast new oil and gas resources and the accretion of further geopolitical influence akin to the game changing shale industry for the u s russia s current development of the arctic region is centred around the yamal peninsula and led principally novatek but further developments are in the offing from gazprom and gazprom neft even in the face of current and future u s sanctions novatek s main arctic project the yamal lng unofficially referred to as arctic 1 last week announced that it produced 9 0 million tons of lng and 0 6 million tons of stable gas condensate in the first half of this year with all three lng trains running above the 5 5 million tons per annum mtpa nameplate capacity over that period this resulted in 126 lng tanker shipments being dispatched in the six month period via trans shipment from the ice class lng carriers to conventional vessels in norway and delivered onto the global markets mostly to russia s key target markets in asia overall the yamal lng project consists of a 17 4 mtpa natural gas liquefaction plant comprised of three lng trains of 5 5 mtpa each and one lng train of 900 thousand tons per annum utilising the hydrocarbon resources of the south tambeyskoye field in the russian arctic novatek is the exception in terms of global lng companies in that it has always been very accurate in terms of delivering its projects on time and on budget as it is a very western style operation run by a very capable ceo leonid mikhleson andrey polischuk senior oil and gas analyst from raiffeisenbank in moscow told oilprice com last week additionally supportive of success for further developments is that the arctic is an absolute priority for the government aimed at bringing russia s lng standing in the world market into line with its status as a global gas superpower as its lng capability has always been way behind what its gas production power would warrant he said in this context u s sanctions imposed after russia took over crimea in 2014 only made putin more determined that the arctic lng program would not fail moscow not only initially bankrolled yamal lng from the beginning with money directly from the state budget but also later in 2014 supported it again by selling bonds in yamal lng the program began on 24 november 2015 with a rub75 billion 15 year issue it further provided rub150 billion of additional backstop funding from the national welfare fund after that and months of wrangling april 2016 saw two chinese state banks agree to provide us 12 billion to the yamal lng project in euros and roubles the project was helped by a tumble in the rouble in late 2014 that effectively cut the cost of russia sourced equipment and labour at a key moment in the construction related oil tankers avoid fujairah in wake of attacks having insulated itself from u s financial sanctions novatek is busy doing the same for its technology requirements novatek has already indigenised as much of the technology and machinery involved with the yamal lng project as it can and last year received a federal patent for its arctic cascade natural gas liquefaction technology this is based on a two stage liquefaction process that capitalises on the colder ambient temperature in the arctic climate to maximise energy efficiency during the liquefaction process and is the first patented liquefaction technology using equipment produced only by russian manufacturers the overall goal of novatek as the company itself has stated more than once is to localise the fabrication and construction of lng trains and modules to decrease the overall cost of liquefaction and develop a technological base within russia so that the arctic lng operations are not subject to the whims of other countries and future sanctions given this backdrop novatek s second yamal lng project officially arctic lng 2 aims for three lng trains of 6 6 mtpa each based around the oil and gas resources of the utrenneye field which has at least 1 138 billion cubic metres of natural gas and 57 million tons of liquids in reserves novatek plans to commission the first train in 2023 the second train in 2024 and the third train in 2025 before reaching full capacity in 2026 to this end it has already secured three other partners in the venture aside from the japanese two are from the key target market of china itself the china national petroleum corporation subsidiary china national oil and gas exploration and development and china national offshore oil corporation with a joint 10 stake and france s supermajor total also with 10 novatek has said that it plans to keep 60 for itself with the remaining 10 likely to go shortly to saudi aramco oilprice com understands form various russia analysts novatek will make the final investment decision on the project in the third quarter of this year in the same vein russian gas giant gazprom recently announced the full scale development of the giant kharasavey gas field in the bovanenkovo production zone on the northern yamal peninsula this is part of the company s continuing shift in its production base northward in line with russia s other major tangential strategy of building out the gas capacity of yamal to compensate for reserves depletion in west siberia kharasavey is estimated to hold 2 trillion cubic metres of gas and is set to produce first gas in 2023 with plateau output of 32 billion cubic metres per year given the outlook for gas demand in the key markets of europe and asia and the geopolitical ramifications of being the major gas supplier to these regions gazprom s oil producing subsidiary gazprom neft is also looking at producing its own lng from its arctic operations monetising its gas resources in the arctic would be a relatively straightforward task for gazprom neft allowing the company to recoup more of the rub400 billion us 6 4 billion that it plans to spend on developing its novoportovskoye field estimated to have recoverable reserves of more than 320 bcm of gas over the next five years earlier than would otherwise be the case part of this development cost is planned to go on the construction of a key gas pipeline to run from novy port across the gulf of ob to yamburg which will carry at least 10 billion cubic metres of gas per year from the novoportovskoye oil and gas field into gazprom s main gas delivery system related is this the last bottleneck for nord stream 2 this infrastructure is also likely to be utilised by the third of novatek s own arctic projects ob lng which commenced development in june based on the resources of the verkhnetiuteyskoye and zapadno seyakhinskoye fields located in the central part of the yamal peninsula the two fields hold a total of 157 billion cubic metres of natural gas and the projected new plant will produce up to 4 8 mtpa of lng the main plant built exclusively with russian made technology in sabetta will cost us 5 billion and is set to come into operation in 2023 that a key point in adding such production from this the arctic region is to dominate the asian markets particularly that of china was tacitly acknowledged by novatek s mikhelson recently when he stated that he expected at least 80 of novatek s future lng production to go to the asian market this was further highlighted by the fact that novatek is moving forward with the trans shipment lng facility on the russian far east coast in kamchatka anna belova senior russia and fsu oil and gas analyst for globaldata in new york told oilprice com even more tellingly perhaps mikhelson added that future sales to china denominated in renminbi is under consideration this is in line with his recent comment that u s sanctions accelerate the process of russia trying to switch away from u s dollar centric oil and gas trading and the damage from potential sanctions that go with it this has been discussed for a while with russia s largest trading partners such as india and china and even arab countries are starting to think about it if they do create difficulties for our russian banks the all we have to do is replace dollars he said the trade war between the u s and china will only accelerate the process he added such a strategy was tested in 2014 when gazprom neft tried trading cargoes of crude oil in chinese yuan and rubles with china and europe this idea of an alternate principal trading currency for oil and gas away from the u s dollar was also discussed for the bric countries and was work shopped again recently by iran iraq russia and china and china s launch of the yuan denominated shanghai international exchange can be seen as a move in this direction mehrdad emadi head of risk analysis and energy derivatives markets consultancy betamatrix in london told oilprice com the more the u s uses the us dollar sanction against major suppliers in the oil market like iran venezuela and russia and major buyers like china then the more momentum will build to replace the oil market with a new currency benchmark he concluded advertisement by simon watkins for oilprice com more top

facebook fb mark zuckerberg s recent announcement of ambitious plans to launch a new global cryptocurrency called libra has been met with understandable alarm particularly among regulators and consumer advocates much of the controversy has centered around antitrust issues consumer privacy and the ability of crooks to anonymously use the system for illicit purposes those are all legitimate concerns but to my mind the biggest risks are financial both to users of libra and the financial system as a whole those risks include the possibility of bank runs credit disruptions or consumer losses arising from foreign currency risks or financial mismanagement of the libra reserve the best way to understand these risks is to follow the money buying and redeeming libra let s start with the process of buying and redeeming libra most cryptocurrencies including the granddaddy of them all bitcoin have failed to gain widespread acceptance as a method of payment because of their volatility zuckerberg hopes to avoid this problem by backing libra with a reserve of stable world currencies including the dollar euro and swiss franc so you can buy libra with pretty much any fiat currency a u s dollar brazilian real mongolian tugrik indian rupee but the amount of libra you receive will depend on the exchange rate between your currency and the basket of currencies in the reserve at the time of purchase when you want to redeem your libra back into your fiat currency you may get more but you may also get a lot less particularly in developing countries with unstable currencies it will depend on the exchange rate at the time of redemption facebook ceo mark zuckerberg makes his keynote speech during facebook inc s annual f8 developers conference in san jose california u s april 30 2019 reuters stephen lam let s say you still want to buy this hip new digital coin regardless of the foreign exchange risk where do you get the money for citizens in the u s and other developed countries the money will probably come from your bank account it s not going to hurt the banking system if you withdraw a few hundred a month for libra transactions but what if everyone decides they want to replace their bank accounts with libra after all this would be a great way to avoid checking account fees retailers will love libra as a way to avoid paying network fees on debit and credit card transactions all of a sudden that giant sucking sound is money coming out of the banks and into libra s kitty you may think fine let s stick it to the banks look what they did to the economy in 2008 but most of that money you withdraw from the banks is money they will no longer have to lend to the economy so as libra captures your cash banks have less to make loans with a run on the banks we also get a credit contraction what happens after libra has your money now libra has your money not the banks and you have your digital coins what will libra do with your money libra s white paper says your digital coin is safe because it will be backed by a basket of the most stable world currencies but it s not as if libra will be purchasing paper money in each of these currencies and piling them in a bank vault what this really means is that libra will be taking your money and investing it in instruments denominated in those currencies advertisement advertisement the return on these investments is how facebook and other libra founders will make money thus they will have incentives to invest in instruments that will maximize those returns which may or may not maintain the stable value libra s founders are promising the white paper promises to invest in low volatility assets such as bank deposits and short term government securities using investment grade financial institutions as custodians reminder lehman bros had an a rating from standard and poor s before its collapse in 2008 but there is no regulatory body to ensure that it does so nor to require that libra s sponsors put up any of their own capital or reserves to backstop those investments if they go sour people stand next to windows above an exterior sign at the lehman brothers headquarters in new york in this september 16 2008 file photo reuters chip east files united states business employment anniversary in essence libra proposes the failed business model used by money market funds prior to the financial crisis it wants you to buy libra on the promise that the coin will maintain stable value but there will be no regulatory oversight of what libra actually does with your money and no capital and liquidity requirements that you would typically find with a bank that structure proved disastrous during the 2008 crisis when the reserve fund a money market fund that heavily invested in lehman bros debt broke the buck and prompted widespread runs on other money market funds a big re allocation of resources even if libra keeps its promise to put your money only in relatively safe bank deposits and government securities we still have a problem if the money comes out of banks where it supports private sector lending and goes into government securities we would see a massive re allocation of resources from the private to the public sectors if you believe as do i that the market is generally a better allocator of economic resources than the government this re allocation will serve as a drag on economic growth advertisement advertisement libra says it will also put your money into bank deposits bank accounts have the advantage of maintaining stable value your bank account balance doesn t fluctuate as would a securities investment and perhaps this helps with our bank run problem you take money out of your bank to buy libra libra puts yours and other users money into other banks which will presumably use it to make loans but banks do fail and depositors take losses on their uninsured deposits so while libra is saying it s offering a better alternative to banks because it won t be taking risk by lending out your money the way banks do it will be putting at least some of your money right back into banks of its choosing when you withdrew money from your bank to buy libra you probably had less than 250 000 in your account meaning it was fully protected by the fdic but libra s founders hope to have a global reserve of hundreds of billions of dollars even if they spread the funds among multiple banks at those levels the lion s share will likely be uninsured the need for regulation anyone who has followed my writings on blockchain knows that i m enthusiastic about the use of distributed ledger technology to remove frictions in the payments system so i don t mean to sound too negative the problem is so long as cryptocurrencies have to rely on fiat currencies to maintain stable value they will be exposed to the same kinds of risks embedded in the banking systems that support those currencies i believe most of these risks can be addressed with thoughtful regulation but before mark zuckenberg or anyone else tries to create his own global currency we need to settle on an adequate regulatory framework to govern them washington dc june 19

and hinted at a possible rate cut later in the year photo by mark wilson getty images it would make sense for congress to give the federal reserve board lead authority for overseeing libra given its responsibility to conduct monetary policy and oversee an effective and efficient payments system it is also an experienced financial supervisor well equipped to develop capital and liquidity

new zealand dollar highlights fresh hopes of us china trade war progress will new uk pm solve the brexit crisis sterling new zealand dollar gbpnzd fx technical analysis once again the main focus of gbp nzd has been on the uk and brexit and the associated political fall out the same is likely to be true over the next few months as the new prime minister either boris johnson or jeremy hunt seeks to find a solution or crashes out of europe by 31st october with no deal but there has been some interesting developments in new zealand too where its central bank cut interest rates in may the first reduction in two and a half years in addition there were some expectations that the reserve bank of new zealand could cut rates again as a result sterling fell from 1 99 in typical mid market rates against the kiwi on 6th may to 1 91 a month later this was due to stronger new zealand economic growth than anticipated and comments by the us federal reserve that its interest rates could be cut which made the reserve bank decision more understandable brexit and uk political issues have also played a major part in the weaker pound then around 23rd june the value of gbpnzd fell again from 1 93 to 1 89 with credit spending higher than expected and hopes that the us china trade wars might soon end that means in the last two months the pound has fallen around 2 5 against the new zealand dollar nz interest rates cut to record low as we highlighted in the last quarterly report the reserve bank of new zealand did take the plunge in may and cut its official cash rate ocr by 0 25 to 1 5 the question now is will the rate be reduced again and how quickly the reserve bank said the cut was needed to support the outlook for employment and inflation it was also worried about global growth and international trade governor adrian orr explains global economic growth has slowed since mid 2018 easing demand for new zealand s goods and services this lower global growth has prompted foreign central banks to ease their monetary policy stances supporting growth prospects however there is uncertainty about the global economic outlook he says trade concerns remain while some other indicators suggest trading partner growth is stabilising domestic growth slowed from the second half of 2018 reduced population growth through lower net immigration and continuing house price softness in some areas has tempered the growth in household spending ongoing low business sentiment tighter profit margins and competition for resources has restrained investment employment is near its maximum sustainable level however the outlook for employment growth is more subdued consequently inflation is projected to rise only slowly given this employment and inflation outlook a lower ocr now is most consistent with achieving our objectives and provides a more balanced outlook for interest rates a month later the bank chose to keep rates on hold but admitted given the weaker global economic outlook and the risk of ongoing subdued domestic growth a lower ocr may be needed over time to continue to meet our objectives it reiterated concerns over slowing domestic and global growth while construction activity strengthened in the march 2019 quarter growth in the services sector continued to slow softer house prices and subdued business sentiment continue to dampen domestic spending the global economic outlook has weakened and downside risks related to trade activity have intensified a number of central banks are easing their monetary policy settings to support demand the weaker global economy is affecting new zealand through a range of trade financial and confidence channels we expect low interest rates and increased government spending to support a lift in economic growth and employment inflation is expected to rise to the 2 mid point of our target range and employment to remain near its maximum sustainable level given the risks around the employment and inflation outlook if there is a further deterioration in the outlook for trading partner growth and subdued domestic growth a lower ocr may be needed the monetary policy committee states members discussed the recent falls in oil and dairy prices and that several central banks are now expected to ease monetary policy to support demand concerning global trade a drawn out period of tension could continue to suppress global business confidence and reduce growth resolution of these tensions could see uncertainty ease the committee noted in particular the dampening effect of uncertainty on business investment in new zealand some members suggested that lower commodity prices and upward pressure on the new zealand dollar could see imported inflation remain soft while global economic conditions had deteriorated the committee noted that domestic gdp growth had held up more than projected in the march 2019 quarter if recent softer house prices were sustained household spending could be dampened the recent falls in mortgage rates and the government s decision not to introduce a capital gains tax were also discussion the 2019 budget incorporated a stronger outlook for government spending than assumed in the may statement was discussed this included the impact on growth of any increase in government spending being delayed for example due to timing of the implementation of new initiatives and current capacity constraints in the construction sector the reserve bank concluded that a lower ocr may be needed over time some analysts put the chance of a rate reduction in august at 75 if rates were reduced again nzd would be likely to come under extra pressure against the pound some analysts suggest that in the longer term once brexit is finalised the pound could recover some ground against the kiwi fresh hopes of us china trade war progress we have been here before but there are fresh hopes that the united states and china could make progress in their ongoing trade war at the same time new zealand trade with china is forging ahead at the g20 meeting at the end of june in osaka japan a new truce was announced by the two sides this suspended the planned 300billion imposition of tariffs of up to 25 on remaining chinese imports while the us and china continue to talk president trump also agreed to ease restrictions on chinese tech firm huawei so it can resume some business in the united states while chinese president xi jinping said china would purchase more agricultural products from the us although details were not specified even so president trump says if the talks fail he is prepared to go ahead with additional duties since the trade war began almost a year ago 25 tariffs have been placed on us 250 billion worth of chinese goods for unfair trade practices in turn china has introduced tariffs on s 110 billion worth of us goods china is new zealand s number one trading partner for both imports and exports with two way trade valued at over nz 28 billion in 2018 the us is new zealand s third largest individual trading partner but the trade war fears do not appear to be damaging trade with china at the moment in fact new zealand s trade surplus was nzd 264 million in may 14 million better than expected thanks to a 29 rise in exports to china new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern says new zealand greatly values trade with china it is one of our most important and far reaching relationships we already enjoy a relationship with an impressive and innovative history and a very impressive future will new uk pm solve the brexit crisis in early june british prime minister theresa may resigned to make way for a new leader of the conservative party and fresh ideas about brexit in a series of votes conservative mps whittled down contenders to just two the overwhelming favourite boris johnson and jeremy hunt party members have the final say with the result of the vote announced on tuesday 23rd july when the new prime minister will take office has yet to be announced boris johnson announced early in the hustings that he would take the country out of the european union on 31st october come what may do or die but a day later he suggested that the chances of a no deal brexit are a million to one against despite that he said anyone serving in his cabinet must be committed to the uk leaving the eu by the halloween deadline jeremy hunt also wants britain to leave europe and is prepared to leave without a deal but not if there was a prospect of a better deal however he says the 31st october deadline is fake and warns that if parliament rejects a no deal brexit a general election could be called instead he has suggested that if no agreement is reached by 30th september he would pursue a no deal brexit mark carney the governor of the bank of england told the treasury committee that under a no deal brexit interest rates would need to be cut and a new stimulus package would have to be introduced if an organised divorce from the eu can be agreed the boe would expect interest rates to rise gradually concerns about a no deal brexit are higher now given the stance of both conservative party leadership candidates currency markets have also been reacting to the increased possibility of a no deal brexit with the pound losing ground against most major currencies including the kiwi what s next for gbpnzd with both tory party leadership candidates looking set to take a firm line over brexit and europe seemingly determined not to renegotiate a no deal brexit is looking more likely over the next three months the issue is set to continue to drag down the pound the markets will be keenly watching any fresh comments and decisions over interest rates by the new zealand bank and whether the us china trade war suspension is maintained and how that affects the new zealand economy guidance for nzd sellers gbpnzd is heading towards the bottom of the channel support comes in at 1 85 level hopefully that will hold and then we will see a correction back toward 1 90 from there it is all very frustrating after a break up through 1 96 in early may the nz dollar has been slowly grinding lower it has gained value on improved risk appetite and a decreased risk of a chinese us trade war obviously gbp remains under pressure with the ongoing mess that is brexit great levels to be selling nzd if you are wanting to repatriate any funds into gbp guidance for nzd buyers for new zealand dollar buyers i do think that gbpnzd will potentially trade down to that 1 85 level before bouncing if you have time to play with wait for the bounce the initial upside target for a bounce is 1 88 and then 1 9100 in terms of the catalyst for the bounce it s most likely to come from softening new zealand economic data and increased trade tensions rather than an improvement on the uk side as data has taken a turn for the worse in the uk and that s likely to continue until there s some progress on brexit
image pavel ignatov adobe stock gbp nzd s down move to extend pull back from july 3 lows unlikely to sustain pound to take cue from brexit politics new zealand dollar to take cue from global risk trends the pound to new zealand dollar exchange rate is trading at around 1 8828 at the start of the new week a marginal 0 3 lower compared to the week before studies of the charts suggest that the exchange rate is likely to continue declining over the next week the 4 hour chart shows the pair having pulled back in a three wave corrective abc pattern after basing at the july 3 lows these abc corrections are quite common and once complete they usually lead to a resumption of the downtrend this appears to be what is happening currently the exchange rate is once again starting to fall and a break below the july 3 lows at 1 8708 would probably provide confirmation of a continuation down to a target at jan feb lows at around 1 8605 the dominant downtrend remains intact but if the pair were to break above the 1 8967 highs this would suggest a possible reversal was underway with an upside target at 1 9100 the 4 hour chart is used to give us an indication of the short term outlook which includes the next five trading days the daily chart shows how the pair is falling quite steeply in an established downtrend which is likely to continue over the medium term the time frame covered by the daily chart which includes the next week to month ahead a break below the july 3 lows would provide the green light for more downside initially to the jan feb lows and then the december lows at 1 8385 possibly after some sideways range trading the weekly chart shows how the downtrend is likely to extend longer term the pair appears to be forming a bearish measured move or abcd pattern this suggests an extension of the downtrend down to a target based on the proportions of the pattern the length of a b can be used to forecast the length of c d in this case it suggests an end target for c

investors sentiment had been riding high on the news that the u s labour market is holding up better than expected following data on friday however the new week starts on a more sombre footing on news that japan has introduced export controls on certain materials destined for south korea and the manufacture of semiconductors japan has tightened restrictions on the export of the high tech materials to south korea in connection with a dispute over compensation for forced wartime labour the dispute first flared in october when south korea s supreme court ruled that japan s nippon steel must compensate south koreans for forced labor during world war two the dispute is probably more important to global trade trends would normally be the case owing to the hit to trade stemming from the ongoing u s china tariff dispute recently the famous economist nouriel roubini sent out a clear warning that further disruptions of the technological global supply chain web could tip the world into a recession any downturn in global investor sentiment could well weigh on the new zealand dollar which tends to appreciate when global markets are rising a possible further risk to global investor sentiment is geopolitical tensions around iran particularly after uk forces stopped an iranian tanker in the straits of gibraltar suspected of being destined for syria which would be in contradiction to international trade sanctions the news that iran has also now surpassed the 3 67 maximum uranium enrichment limit set by the atomic energy organisation could also trigger repercussions or further sanctions from the international community with consequences for peace in the middle east and oil price stability a further source of volatility could be chinese trade data on friday which is forecast to show a rise in the chinese trade surplus to 42 2bn from 41 7bn previously with exports falling 2 0 but imports falling a greater 3 0 analysts will be scrutinising the data for signs the trade war is hitting chinese trade and growth trade numbers out of china on friday will come under the spotlight amid signs the world s second largest economy may require further stimulus to stave off a deep slowdown says a note from wells fargo chinese exports unexpectedly rose by 1 1 year on year in may though this was mostly due to the frontloading of shipments from the latest round of tariffs imposed by the united states they are forecast to have declined by 2 y y in june a bigger drop would accentuate worries about the economy and add to calls for more policy easing such a drop would also weaken the kiwi domestically a speech by reserve bank of new zealand rbnz governor orr on tuesday could be a major domestic driver if he mentions the outlook for monetary policy currently the rbnz is expected to cut interest rates in the future to combat slowing growth both domestically and globally however if the governor is more upbeat about the outlook there is a chance the kiwi could find support recent trade figures for example actually showed a rise in the new zealand trade surplus in may and a healthy 29 increase in exports to china which runs contrary to the doom and gloom portrayed by forecasters in light of the u s sino trade war datawise one of the main hard data releases is electronic card retail sales in june month on month which is forecast to show a 0 7 rise when

lira sinks on central bank dismissal required reading high wire act the bank of canada has something of a high wire balancing act to perform this week the central bank isn t expected to move its benchmark overnight rate from the current level of 1 75 per cent but what it says and how it says it will be key for markets the bank of canada is expected to hold policy rates steady at the july 10 policy meeting but that s one of the few certainties said benjamin reitzes bank of montreal s canadian rates and macro strategist the global central banking community has turned significantly more dovish over the past couple of months and the boc has thus far been able to refrain from openly discussing potential easing he added while canada is clearly facing different circumstances than the u s there s a limit to how far the can cut before the boc is forced to follow suit for now this is not an issue as the canadian data have had a solid run and therein lies part of the balancing act for

second quarter that s already over while possibly taking a less optimistic view of the second half of the year and into 2020 it last pegged second quarter growth at an annual pace of just 1 3 per cent but economic readings particularly for trade have come in better than expected leading bmo for example to expect the central bank to revise that to 2 5 per cent or more however the bank was previously very upbeat on and that will likely be dampened notably given the deteriorating global backdrop mr reitzes said the question then becomes what is more important for policy makers a much stronger than expected q2 or a potentially sharply weaker h2 indeed the latter likely means we ll see a downgrade to the 2020 growth outlook as well from 2 1 per cent the boc s decision here might be the key factor on what tone is taken at the meeting and thus how markets react this comes as markets expect the fed to cut interest rates possibly as early as this month markets and some economists expect the bank of canada to cut too but not until later next year more of the high wire act here then must also be aware of recent signals of slowing global industrial activity and needs to be careful about sounding

strength in the data suggests there s no reason to sound any more dovish or muse about potential cuts he added however with the fed poised to act at month end there s a risk that a lack of dovishness could push the canadian dollar sharply stronger tightening financial conditions that in turn would likely force the bank to turn more dovish and potentially cut keep in mind too that the fed releases

london july 8 2019 prnewswire prweb how does the currency pair trading work in the forex market we will try to explain that with the eur usd currency pair and its performance in 2019 so far there are so many currency pairs in the forex market for example the eur usd usd jpy usd cad however the experts of capital way have observed the trend in the forex market and following their reports the eur usd is the most traded currency pair the us dollar is the preferred reference in most currency exchange transactions worldwide it is the dominant reserve currency of the world the second most traded currency is the euro therefore a combination of both currencies is highly regarded in the forex market however the fact that these currencies are tied to the united states of america and europe does not mean there is always an upward trend no it fluctuates and traders watch the movement of this eur usd to know how much of one euro is worth in dollars as with every currency whatever happens in the economy will affect its demand and supply below are some of the factors affecting the eur usd in 2019 1 economic indicators information concerning economic indicators of countries determines the true value of its currency such economic indicators can be seen in the figures of the gross domestic product consumer price index unemployment figures the prices of crude oil economic indicators show the overall health of the economy and the true value of its currency therefore if the report about such indicators is on the positive side it will encourage traders to trade more on the eur usd currency pair the reverse will be the case if it s on the low side 2 regulatory monetary policies another factor that affects the eur usd currency pair is the monetary policy these are policies made by regulatory bodies like the european central bank and the federal reserve to control the amount of money in circulation within the economy such decisions can either be positive or detrimental to the forex market depending on the goal of the regulators a shift in monetary policies can cause a considerable fluctuation in the currency pair just one policy can affect the value of both currencies in every way 3 political affairs imagine what will happen if the brexit becomes successful that means the united kingdom will pull out from the european union will it weaken the strength of the euro will they have their currency questions like this are what will fill the mind of an average investor and it will affect the eur usd currency pair how about trump s trade war investors and traders are carefully following the news on this topic other countries are threatening to retaliate and the prospect of further escalation risk will significantly hamper trade and investment and possibly the global economy as a result of the factors mentioned above especially as regards the trade tensions this year has recorded a downturn in the eur usd currency pair following the analysis of the capital way analysts this trend will continue and the currency pair will continue on a lower slide since most trading pattern shows that investors believe the euro will crash the us president donald trump claims that the us will be in a problematic situation if euro and other currencies weaken against the dollar the first half of 2019 is already gone and the euro is being traded below its value according to most indices however say capital way analysts it s too early to give up yet a lot can still happen in the next 180 days who knows there might be a turnaround let s keep our fingers crossed this capital way review does not constitute a recommendation for investment and does not replace professional advice source capital way
make america great again don t count on it donald trump was partly voted into office by americans who felt that the self proclaimed greatest power on earth was actually in decline and they weren t wrong trump is capable of tweeting many things but none of those tweets will stop that process of decline nor will a trade war with a rising china or fierce oil sanctions on iran you could feel this recently even in the case of the increasingly pressured iranians there with a single pinprick supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei effectively punctured president trump s maga balloon and reminded many that however powerful the u s still was people in other countries were beginning to look at america differently at the end of the second decade of the twenty first century following a meeting in tehran with visiting japanese prime minister shinzo abe who brought a message from trump urging the start of u s iranian negotiations khamenei tweeted we have no doubt in goodwill and seriousness but regarding what you mentioned from u s president i don t consider trump as a person deserving to exchange messages with and i have no answer for him nor will i respond to him in the future he then added we believe that our problems will not be solved by negotiating with the u s and no free nation would ever accept negotiations under pressure a flustered trump was reduced to briefly tweeting i personally feel that it is too soon to even think about making a deal they are not ready and neither are we and soon after the president halted at the last minute in a distinctly humiliating retreat u s air strikes on iranian missile sites that would undoubtedly have created yet more insoluble problems for washington across the greater middle east keep in mind that globally before the ayatollah s put down the trump administration had already had two abject foreign policy failures the collapse of the president s hanoi summit with north korean leader kim jong un followed by that regime s provocative firing of several missiles over the sea of japan and a bungled attempt to overthrow the regime of venezuelan president nicolás maduro america s global standing at a record low what s great or small can be defined in absolute or relative terms america s greatness or exceptional or indispensable nature much lauded in washington before the trump era should certainly be judged against the economic progress made by china in those same years and against russia s advances in the latest high tech weaponry another way of assessing the nature of that greatness and what to make of it would be through polls of how foreigners view the united states take for instance a survey released by the pew research group in february 2019 forty five percent of respondents in 26 nations with large populations felt that american power and influence posed a major threat to our country while 36 offered the same response on russia and 35 on china to put that in perspective in 2013 during the presidency of barack obama only 25 of global respondents held such a negative view of the u s while reactions to china remained essentially the same or just consider the most powerful country in europe germany between 2013 and 2018 germans who considered american power and influence a greater threat than that of china or russia leapt from 19 to 49 figures for france were similar as for president trump only 27 of global respondents had confidence in him to do the right thing in world affairs while 70 feared he would not in mexico you undoubtedly won t be surprised to learn confidence in his leadership was at a derisory 6 in 17 of the surveyed countries people who lacked confidence in him were also significantly more likely to consider the u s the world s top threat a phenomenon most pronounced among traditional washington allies like canada great britain and australia china s expanding global footprint while 39 of pew respondents in that poll still rated the u s as the globe s leading economic power 34 opted for china meanwhile china s belt and road initiative bri launched in 2013 to link the infrastructure and trade of much of southeast asia eurasia and the horn of africa to china at an estimated cost of four trillion dollars and to be funded by diverse sources is going from strength to strength one way to measure this the number of dignitaries attending the biennial bri forum in beijing the first of those gatherings in may 2017 attracted 28 heads of state and representatives from 100 countries the most recent in late april had 37 heads of state and representatives from nearly 150 countries and international organizations including international monetary fund imf chief christine lagarde and united nations secretary general antonio guterres leaders of nine out of 10 association of southeast asian nations attended as did four of the five central asian republics strikingly a third of the leaders participating came from europe according to peter frankopan author of the new silk roads more than 80 countries are now involved in some aspect of the bri project that translates into more than 63 of the world s population and 29 of its global economic output still chinese president xi jinping is intent on expanding the bri s global footprint further a signal of china s dream of future greatness during a february two day state visit to beijing by saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman xi suggested that when it came to riyadh s overly ambitious economic plan our two countries should speed up the signing of an implementation plan on connecting the belt and road initiative with the saudi vision 2030 flattered by this proposal the crown prince defended china s use of re education camps for uighur muslims in its western province of xinjiang claiming it was beijing s right to carry out antiterrorism work to safeguard national security under the guise of combating extremism the chinese authorities have placed an estimated one million uighur muslims in such camps to undergo re education designed to supplant their islamic legacy with a chinese version of socialism uighur groups had appealed to prince bin salman to take up their cause no such luck one more sign of the rise of china in the twenty first century china enters the high tech race with america in 2013 the german government launched an industry 4 0 plan meant to fuse cyber physical systems the internet of things cloud computing and cognitive computing with the aim of increasing manufacturing productivity by up to 50 while curtailing resources required by half two years later emulating this project beijing published its own 10 year made in china 2025 plan to update the country s manufacturing base by rapidly developing 10 high tech industries including electric cars and other new energy vehicles next generation information technology and telecommunications as well as advanced robotics and artificial intelligence aerospace engineering high end rail infrastructure and high tech maritime engineering as with bri the government and media then publicized and promoted made in china 2025 vigorously this alarmed washington and america s high tech corporations over the years american companies had complained about china s theft of u s intellectual property the counterfeiting of famous brands and the stealing of trade secrets not to speak of the pressuring of american firms in joint ventures with local companies to share technology as a price for gaining access to china s vast market their grievances became more vocal when donald trump entered the white house determined to cut washington s annual trade deficit of 380 billion with beijing as president trump ordered his new trade representative the sinophobe robert lighthizer to look into the matter the resulting seven month investigation pegged the loss u s companies experienced because of china s unfair trade practices at 50 billion a year that was why in march 2018 president trump instructed lighthizer to levy tariffs on at least 50 billion worth of chinese imports that signaled the start of a sino american trade war which has only gained steam since in this context chinese officials started downplaying the significance of made in china 2025 describing it as nothing more than an inspirational plan this march china s national people s congress even passed a foreign direct investment law meant to address some of the grievances of u s companies its implementation mechanism was however weak trump promptly claimed that china had backtracked on its commitments to incorporate into chinese law significant changes the two countries had negotiated and put into a draft agreement to end the trade war he then slapped further tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports the major bone of contention for the trump administration is a chinese law specifying that in a joint venture between a foreign corporation and a chinese company the former must pass on technological know how to its chinese partner that s seen as theft by washington according to senior fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace yukon huang author of cracking the china conundrum why conventional economic wisdom is wrong however it s fully in accord with globally accepted guidelines such diffusion of technological know how has played a significant role in driving growth globally as the imf s 2018 world economic outlook report made clear it s worth noting as well that china now accounts for almost one third of global annual economic growth the size of china s market is so vast and the rise in its per capita gross domestic product from 312 in 1980 to 9 769 in 2018 so steep that major u s corporations generally accepted its long established joint venture law and that should surprise no one last year for instance general motors sold3 645 044 vehicles in china and fewer than three million in the u s little wonder then that late last year following gm plant closures across north america part of a wide ranging restructuring plan the company s management paid no heed to a threat from president trump to strip gm of any government subsidies what angered the president as he tweeted caught the reality of the moment nothing was being closed in mexico and china what trump simply can t accept is this after nearly two decades of supply chain restructuring and global economic integration china has become the key industrial supplier for the united states and europe his attempt to make america great again by restoring the economic status quo ante before 2001 the year china was admitted to the world trade organization is doomed to fail in reality trade war or peace china is now beginning to overtake the u s in science and technology a study by qingnan xie of nanjing university of science and technology and richard freeman of harvard university noted that between 2000 and 2016 china s global share of publications in the physical sciences engineering and mathmatics quadrupled and in the process exceeded that of the u s for the first time in the field of high technology for example china is now well ahead of the united states in mobile payment transactions in the first 10 months of 2017 those totaled 12 8 trillion the result of vast numbers of consumers discarding credit cards in favor of cashless systems in stark contrast according to emarketer america s mobile payment transactions in 2017 amounted to 49 3 billion last year 583 million chinese used mobile payment systems with nearly 68 of china s internet users turning to a mobile wallet for their offline payments russia s advanced weaponry in a similar fashion in his untiring pitch for america s beautiful weaponry president trump has failed to grasp the impressive progress russia has made in that field while presenting videos and animated glimpses of new intercontinental ballistic missiles nuclear powered cruise missiles and underwater drones in a march 2018 television address russian president vladimir putin traced the development of his own country s new weapons to washington s decision to pull out of the 1972 anti ballistic missile abm treaty with the soviet union in december 2001 encouraged by john bolton then under secretary of state for arms control and international security president george w bush had indeed withdrawn from the 1972 abm treaty on the spurious grounds that the 9 11 attacks had changed the nature of defense for america his russian counterpart of the time the very same vladimir putin described the withdrawal from that cornerstone of world security as a grievous mistake the head of russia s armed forces general anatoly kvashnin warned then that the pullout would alter the nature of the international strategic balance freeing up countries to restart arms buildups both conventional and nuclear as it happened he couldn t have been more on the mark the u s is now engaged in a 30 year trillion dollar plus remake and update of its nuclear arsenal while the russians whose present inventory of 6 500 nuclear weapons slightly exceeds america s have gone down a similar route in that televised address of his on the eve of the 2018 russian presidential election putin s listof new nuclear weapons was headed by the sarmat a 30 ton intercontinental ballistic missile reputedly far harder for an enemy to intercept in its most vulnerable phase just after launching it also carries a larger number of nuclear warheads than its predecessor another new weapon on his list was a nuclear powered intercontinental underwater drone status 6 a submarine launched autonomous vehicle with a range of 6 800 miles capable of carrying a 100 megaton nuclear warhead and then there was his country s new nuclear powered cruise missile with a practically unlimited range in addition because of its stealth capabilities it will be hard to detect in flight and its high maneuverability will theoretically at least enable it to bypass an enemy s defenses successfully tested in 2018 it does not yet have a name unsurprisingly putin won the presidency with 77 of the vote a 13 rise from the previous poll on record voter turnout of 67 7 in conventional weaponry russia s s 400 missile system remains unrivalled according to the washington based arms control association the s 400 system is an advanced mobile surface to air defense system of radars and missiles of different ranges capable of destroying a variety of targets such as attack aircraft bombs and tactical ballistic missiles each battery normally consists of eight launchers 112 missiles and command and support vehicles the s 400 missile has a range of 400 kilometers 250 miles and its integrated system is believed to be capable of shooting down up to 80 targets simultaneously consider it a sign of the times but in defiance of pressure from the trump administration not to buyrussian weaponry president recep tayyip erdogan of turkey the only muslim member of nato ordered the purchase of batteries of those very s 400 missiles turkish soldiers are currently being trained on that weapons systems in russia the first battery is expected to arrive in turkey next month similarly in april 2015 russia signed a contract to supply s 400 missiles to china the first delivery of the system took place in january 2018 and china test fired it in august an expanding beijing moscow alliance consider that as another step in russian chinese military coordination meant to challenge washington s claim to be the planet s sole superpower similarly last september 3 500 chinese troops participated in russia s largest ever military exercises involving 300 000 soldiers 36 000 military vehicles 80 ships and 1 000 aircraft helicopters and drones codenamed vostok 2018 it took place across a vast region that included the bering sea the sea of okhotsk and the sea of japan little wonder that nato officials described vostok 2018 as a demonstration of a growing russian focus on future large scale conflict it fits into a pattern we have seen over some time a more assertive russia significantly increasing its defense budget and its military presence putin attended the exercises after hosting an economic forum in vladivostok where chinese president xi was his guest we have trustworthy ties in political security and defense spheres he declared while xi praised the two countries friendship which he claimed was getting stronger all the time thanks to climate change russia and china are now also working in tandem in the fast melting arctic last year russia which controls more than half the arctic coastline sent its first ship through the northern sea route without an icebreaker in winter putin hailed that moment as a big event in the opening up of the arctic beijing s arctic policy first laid out in january 2018 described china as a near arctic state and visualized the future shipping routes there as part of a potential new polar silk road that would both be useful for resource exploitation and for enhancing chinese security shipping goods to and from europe by such a passage would shorten the distance to china by 30 compared to present sea routes through the malacca straits and the suez canal saving hundreds of thousands of dollars per voyage according to the u s geological survey the arctic holds petroleum reserves equal to 412 billion barrels of oil or about 22 of the world s undiscovered hydrocarbons it also has deposits of rare earth metals china s second arctic vessel xuelong 2 snow dragon 2 is scheduled to make its maiden voyage later this year russia needs chinese investment to extract the natural resources under its permafrost in fact china is already the biggest foreign investor in russia s liquefied natural gas lng projects in the region and the first lng shipment was dispatched to china s eastern province last summer via the northern sea route its giant oil corporation is now beginning to drill for gas in russian waters alongside the russian company gazprom washington is rattled in april in its latest annual report to congress on china s military power the pentagon for the first time included a section on the arctic warning of the risks of a growing chinese presence in the region including that country s possible deployment of nuclear submarines there in the future in may secretary of state mike pompeo used a meeting of foreign ministers in rovaniemi finland to assail china for its aggressive behavior in the arctic in an earlier speech pompeo noted that from 2012 to 2017 china invested nearly 90 billion in the arctic region we re concerned about russia s claim over the international waters of the northern sea route including its newly announced plans to connect it with china s maritime silk road he said he then pointed out that along that route moscow already illegally demands other nations request permission to pass requires russian maritime pilots to be aboard foreign ships and threatens to use military force to sink any that fail to comply with their demands an american downturn continues altogether the tightening military and economic ties between russia and china have put america on the defensive contrary to donald trump s maga promise to american voters in the 2016 campaign it s true that despite fraying diplomatic and economic ties between washington and moscow trump s personal relations with putin remain cordial the two periodically exchange friendly phone calls but among russians more generally a favorable view of the u s fell from 41 in 2017 to 26 in 2018 according to a pew research survey there s nothing new about great powers even the one that proclaimed itself the greatest in history declining after having risen high in our acrimonious times that s a reality well worth noting while launching his bid for reelection recently trump proposed a bombastic new slogan keep america great or kag as if he had indeed raised america s stature while in office he would have been far more on target however had he suggested the slogan depress america more or dam to reflect the reality of an unpopular president who faces
