overview ecb president draghi underscoring the likely need for more stimulus broke the subdued tone as market participants took a wait and see stance ahead of tomorrow s fomc decision draghi s comments sent the euro through 1 12 for the first time in two weeks and drove european bonds yields to new lows asian equity markets were mostly higher with the exception of japan as order returned to hong kong it was the hang seng that led the region with a little more than a 0 9 gain european equities picked up after draghi s comments and the dow jones stoxx 600 was about 0 8 higher in late morning turnover led by the interest rate sensitive utilities sector and health care financials were struggling under the prospect of still lower rates despite concerns about the doom loop of european banks exposure to their sovereign bonds the rally in bonds has done little for bank shares consider that with today s 10 13 bp decline in italy s benchmark 10 year yield the bank shares are lower for the fourth session in the past five over the past month as italy s bond yield has fallen 50 bp the bank share index is off roughly 11 european benchmark yields outside of italy are off around five to seven basis points with most hitting new record lows us shares are trading higher and the 10 year yield has slipped a couple basis points to nearly 2 05 the dollar is firmer against most of the major currencies save the japanese yen the lower rates in the high income countries are reigniting the yield hunt into emerging market and helping to lift the liquid accessible and volatile currencies like the south african rand and turkish lira east and central european currencies are being dragged lower by the euro the chinese yuan is practically unchanged cny6 9265 asia pacific the minutes from the reserve bank of australia s meeting earlier this month underscored the dovish bias additional stimulus was deemed more likely than not the central bank appeared to call on the government fiscal policy to bolster efforts to support the labor market it noted that mortgage arrears were back near 2010 highs but not spurring systemic stress separately australian reported that its index of house prices fell 3 in q1 which was a bit more than expected and takes prices down 7 4 year over year it was the fourth consecutive quarter that the year over year rate contracted and it is doing so at an accelerated pace in q1 18 house prices had gained 6 8 year over year in china new house prices rose 0 71 in may for an 11 3 increase from a year ago new houses prices have risen by an average of 0 62 in the first five months of 2019 in the same period a year ago house prices averaged a monthly gain of 0 48 china manages both supply and demand and it appears that the rise in house prices may be more a function of supply constraints rather than robust demand the dollar has held above jpy108 since last monday there is only a 530 mln option struck there that is set to expire today and larger options there will expire in the coming days including 2 7 bln tomorrow and 1 3 bln on thursday the first target of a break is jpy107 75 but our reading of the charts suggests an objective near jpy107 the dovish rba minutes have sent the australian dollar to new lows 0 6830 since the january 3 flash crash that saw it drop to around 0 6740 which is next important target previous support near 0 6865 may become resistance europe draghi and a collapse in german investor confidence have stirred the foreign exchange and debt markets the ecb president was more dovish than he seemed to be at the ecb meeting a fortnight ago he warned that in the absence of improvement that inflation was headed toward its target additional stimulus was necessary draghi suggested that if needed rates can be cut with measures to mitigate some of the undesired consequences and that the limits around asset purchases could also be revisited the news follows the bundesbank s warning yesterday that europe s biggest economy may have contracted in q2 although draghi s term does not end until october there seems to be some hesitancy to lock in the next ecb president too much separately germany s zew survey disappointed the assessment of the current situation edged lower to 7 8 from 8 2 between the start of last year through june this year the current assessment has improved in only four months this year there has been one increase and that was in may more disturbing was the collapse in the expectations component it plunged from 2 1 to 21 1 it is the worst since last november and it is lower than a year ago 16 1 the optimists hope that the weak data will prompt germany to reconsider its fiscal stance and may win its support for more measures by the ecb that said recently bbk president weidmann has cautioned against deferring rate normalization the selection of the next tory leader in the uk moves into overdrive starting today in the second round candidates need to secure at least 33 mp votes or they do not make it to the third round which will be held tomorrow and the fourth round on thursday when two candidates remain the rank and file will decide meanwhile prime minister may s push for gbp27 bln for education over the next three years is controversial and chancellor of the exchequer hammond has threatened to resign the euro has been sold below 1 12 and has found some bids near 1 1180 an option for 562 mln euros at 1 1150 expires today and a 1 6 bln euro option at 1 12 will also be cut looking ahead on thursday there are another 1 6 bln euros in a 1 1150 strike that will expire in late april through may the euro as seemed to carve a base around 1 11 sterling extended its decline to near 1 25 it is its lowest level since the january 3 flash crash that may have seen 1 2440 a move now back above 1 2550 would help stabilize the tone the euro approached gbp0 8975 the high since mid january but has backed off support is seen in the gbp0 8900 gbp0 8920 area america we caution against reading too much into the latest us treasury data that shows china reduced its holding by 7 5 bln in april before trump declared the end to the tariff truce china sold about 10 1 bln in us bonds and notes and bought around 2 6 bln in bills april was the second consecutive month of net sales but it was preceded by a three month accumulation as a whole foreign central banks sold about 27 5 bln of us treasury bonds and notes not including bills in april china accounted for a little more than a third these are hardly even rounding errors given china s current holdings of a nearly 1 113 trillion more than any other country china s surged from about 845 bln in mid 2010 1 314 trillion in july 2011 it has been above there marginally and has not been below roughly 1 05 trillion since and now is near the middle of the range moreover a decline in treasury holdings is not necessarily an aggressive act consider that japan s treasury holdings the second largest in the world peaked in november 2014 near 1 241 trillion and now stand near 1 064 trillion three other holdings caught our eye belgium which hosts euroclear has sometimes been thought to hide chinese reserves so it treasury holdings rise and fall sharply in 2013 2015 they bottomed in 2017 a little below 100 bln but by january 2019 they had nearly doubled they have pulled back in recent months and are now a little below 180 bln saudi arabia s treasury holdings have risen sharply in recent years according to us data the saudis owned practically no treasuries as recently as 2003 2004 they rose to around 80 bln by mid 2009 where they hovered until 2014 when they began rising perhaps the weakness in oil prices in 2016 was behind the roughly 35 bln drop in treasury holdings but the accumulation quickly resumed and in april a new record of 176 6 bln was registered the uk s treasury holdings swung violently in the 2004 2011 period but since then they have been steadily climbing at the end of 2011 they stood near 107 bln and peaked in march a little more than 317 bln before pulling back in april to about 301 bln part of the recent increase may reflect the building up of reserves to prepare for brexit but something more is going on in the last six months uk reserves have risen by about 6 6 bln while treasury holdings have increased by around 37 bln maybe the negative yields associated with core european bonds spurred some reallocation poor infrastructure led to a blackout in brazilian 2009 and one in venezuela earlier this year the outage over the weekend that impacts tens of millions of people in argentina uruguay and paraguay may have been simply another episode an investigation is underway which may take the better part of the next two weeks while some argentine officials are playing down the likelihood that it was a cyber attack as the trigger for the cascading effect appears to have been a transmission point between two power stations still others refuse to rule it out they wonder if it is coincidental that the ny times had just revealed that the us had penetrated a russian utility trump accused denied the report and simultaneously accused it of virtual treason russia press reported yesterday that it had identified attempts by the us to use cyber attacks on its infrastructure the conspiracy theorists cannot link russia to argentina s blackout but it may have just been opportunistic some suggest trump appears to like argentina s president macri who faces voters in october after promising to address the electrical grid a weaker macri boosts the chances that kirchner returns as vice president under fernandez her former chief of cabinet ministries who is leading in macri in some polls as a senator kirchner enjoys immunity and it is disputed whether she does if she were vice president as macri is seen as a trump ally kirchner is seen to be an ally of putin the us reports may housing starts and permits figures small gains are expected but they are not the focus the day ahead of the fomc meeting yesterday s empire state manufacturing survey was shockingly poor with its biggest decline on record and a return to levels now seen since october 2016 the cme s model suggests that the market is pricing in nearly a one in four chance of a cut tomorrow it sees about a 66 chance 65 8 of a 25 bp cut in july the cme s model finds about a 20 chance of a 50 bp move in july the broad us dollar gains are weighing on the canadian dollar the greenback is pushing above cad1 3425 which has capped it over the past couple of sessions and is bumping against the 61 8 retracement objective of this month s down move above there the cad1 3485 cad1 3500 beckons the mexican peso is trading firmly within the ranges that have dominated since the us tariff threat was suspended separately the us has announced it is cutting aid to guatemala el salvador and honduras until measures are taken to reduce the migrant flow while on the one hand it boosts the incentive structure for governments to take action it also may add to the local misery that is part of the encouragement of people to leave disclaimer
international economic conditions members commenced their discussion by noting that the data on the global economy released since the previous meeting had been mixed gdp growth outcomes for the march quarter in some economies had been slightly stronger than the second half of 2018 while labour markets had remained tight however global trade and conditions in the global manufacturing sector had remained weak new export orders had been little changed at subdued levels and growth in industrial production had slowed in many economies including those economies in east asia that are closely integrated with global supply chains the us china trade dispute had escalated in may intensifying the downside risk posed to the global economic outlook from this source the united states had proceeded to increase tariffs from 10 per cent to 25 per cent on us 200 billion of imports from china and china had responded by announcing that tariffs would increase by 5 25 per cent on us 60 billion of us imports from 1 june 2019 in the days leading up to the meeting the us administration had also announced tariff measures affecting mexico and india in the major advanced economies gdp growth for the march quarter had been somewhat stronger than in the second half of 2018 however in both japan and the united states the contribution from domestic demand had declined and investment intentions in japan pointed to only moderate investment growth over the period to early 2020 nevertheless labour markets in the advanced economies had remained tight as a result wages growth had continued to increase reaching around the highest rates recorded during the current expansion in the three major advanced economies moreover firms employment intentions had remained positive at high levels and firms had continued to report widespread difficulties in filling jobs inflation had remained subdued globally despite tight labour markets and rising wages growth in many advanced economies core inflation had been below target in the three major advanced economies following the decline in core inflation in the united states in recent months members noted that temporary factors had been contributing to the decline in the us core inflation measure with the trimmed mean underlying inflation measure close to 2 per cent over recent months in china indicators of activity had moderated in april the moderation had partly reversed the unusually strong results in march which had included activity brought forward ahead of tax changes that came into effect on 1 april 2019 growth in fixed asset investment had slowed in april driven by a sharp fall in manufacturing investment while infrastructure investment had been supported by increased government spending industrial production had slowed across a wide range of products in april although production of construction related materials such as steel plate glass and cement had remained strong elsewhere in east asia growth had slowed further in the march quarter mainly because of weaker growth in exports and investment growth in india had been at the lower end of the range of recent experience with members noting that the recent tariff announcements by the us administration could adversely affect indian exports of goods commodity price movements had been mixed since the previous meeting iron ore and rural prices had increased the increase in iron ore prices had been underpinned by supply constraints strong demand from china and an increase in steel production on the other hand the prices of coal oil and base metals had declined members noted that the decline in oil prices had mainly reflected renewed concerns around the outlook for global oil demand domestic economic conditions members noted that national accounts data for gdp growth in the march quarter would be released the day after the meeting gdp growth was expected to have been a little firmer than in the preceding two quarters supported by growth in exports non mining business investment and public spending growth in consumption however was expected to continue to be sluggish and dwelling investment was expected to have declined further in the march quarter information received for the june quarter and indicators of future economic activity had been mixed business conditions and consumer sentiment had been broadly stable at or slightly above average levels information from the abs capital expenditure survey and the bank s business liaison contacts suggested that mining investment was close to its trough while the available information pointed to ongoing modest growth in non residential building investment members noted that the low and middle income tax offset including the increase announced in the australian government budget for 2019 20 would boost household disposable income and could support household consumption in the second half of 2019 members also discussed the distributional implications of low interest rates on household incomes lower interest rates lead to a decline in the interest that households pay on their debt but also lead to a decline in the interest income that households receive from interest bearing assets such as term deposits as such changes in interest rates have different effects on different groups of households in particular members recognised that many older australians rely on interest income which would decline with lower interest rates the overall net effect of lower interest rates was nevertheless expected to boost aggregate household disposable income and thus spending capacity conditions in established housing markets had remained weak housing prices had continued to decline in sydney and melbourne during may although the pace of decline had eased from earlier in the year housing prices had continued to decline markedly in perth members noted that the housing market was likely to be affected by the removal of uncertainty around possible changes to taxation arrangements relating to housing they also considered the effects of the australian prudential regulation authority s apra s proposal to amend its requirement for banks to determine the borrowing capacity of loan applicants using a specified minimum interest rate while it remained too early to determine the overall effects auction clearance rates had increased noticeably in sydney the weekend following these developments building approvals had declined further in april however to be more than 20 per cent lower over the preceding 12 months this suggested that even if there were a marked turnaround in housing sentiment given the lags involved it would take some time for this to translate into higher residential construction activity several key domestic data series relating to the labour market had been released over the previous month the wage price index had increased by 0 5 per cent in the march quarter to be 2 3 per cent higher over the year while wages growth had been higher than a year earlier in most industries and states the low rate of wages growth provided further evidence of spare capacity in the labour market wages growth in the private sector had been unchanged in the march quarter and had increased to 2 4 per cent over the year 2 7 per cent including bonuses the fair work commission had recently granted a 3 0 per cent increase in the national minimum and award classification wages which would take effect from 1 july 2019 members noted that this decision directly affected the wages of around one fifth of workers in australia public sector wages growth had been little changed in recent years because of caps on salary increases for public sector employees members also noted that an increasing proportion of business liaison contacts were expecting wages growth to be stable in the year ahead although the proportion of contacts expecting wages growth to decline had continued to fall the data on conditions in the labour market in april had been mixed the unemployment rate had increased to 5 2 per cent in april from an upwardly revised 5 1 per cent in march this followed a six month period during which the unemployment rate had remained at around 5 per cent the increase in the unemployment rate had been accompanied by an increase in the participation rate to its highest level on record the underemployment rate had also increased in april while the unemployment rate in both new south wales and victoria remained historically low in both states it had increased since the beginning of 2019 employment growth nationwide had moderated in 2019 but had remained above growth in the working age population employment growth had been robust in most states in preceding months the exceptions were western australia and tasmania where the level of employment had been roughly unchanged since mid 2018 forward looking indicators of labour demand pointed to a moderation in employment growth in the near term to around the rate of growth in the working age population measures of job advertisements had declined over recent months employment intentions reported by the bank s business liaison contacts had been lower than in mid 2018 but these intentions were still generally positive members had a detailed discussion of spare capacity in the labour market although difficult to measure directly the extent of spare capacity in the labour market is an important factor that affects wages growth and price inflation on a number of measures it was apparent that the labour market still had significant spare capacity the main approach to measuring spare capacity is to compare the current unemployment rate with an estimate of the unemployment rate associated with full employment which is the rate of unemployment consistent with stable inflation the bank s estimate of this unemployment rate had declined gradually over recent years to be around 4½ per cent currently members noted the significant uncertainty around modelled estimates of the unemployment rate consistent with full employment they also discussed other measures of spare capacity including underemployment of part time workers recognising that the supply side of the labour market had been quite flexible strong employment growth over recent years had encouraged more people to join the labour force allowing the economy to absorb increased activity without generating inflationary pressure notwithstanding the uncertainties involved members revised their assessment of labour market capacity acknowledging the accumulation of evidence that there was now more capacity for the labour market to absorb additional labour demand before inflation concerns would emerge financial markets members commenced their discussion of financial market developments by noting that escalating trade disputes had led to a rise in volatility in global financial markets over preceding weeks most notably in equity markets nevertheless with central banks expected to maintain expansionary policy settings and risk premiums generally low global financial conditions remained accommodative the escalation in the trade dispute between the united states and china had resulted in declines in global equity markets the fall in equity prices had been particularly sharp in china but substantial declines had also been seen in the united states as well as in a range of other advanced economies members observed that the declines in equity prices had been largest for sectors more directly exposed to the announced and prospective tariff changes and or deriving a larger share of revenue from international trade by contrast australian equity prices were little changed at close to their highest level in a decade members noted that a sharp increase in australian banks share prices following the federal election had partly offset a recent decline in resource stocks in the context of escalating trade tensions members noted that there had been only a modest tightening in financial conditions in emerging markets including in mexico where trade tensions with the united states had recently resurfaced equity prices had declined and sovereign credit spreads had widened somewhat and there had been modest outflows from bond and equity funds in emerging markets currencies of emerging market economies had also generally depreciated a little although there had mostly been little change in yields on government bonds denominated in local currencies in the advanced economies there had been some widening in yield spreads between corporate and sovereign debt particularly for corporations rated below investment grade members observed that financing costs for corporations remained low nonetheless with government bond yields having declined further over the preceding month in some cases to historic lows this had partly reflected a shift down in market participants expectations of future policy interest rates in several advanced economies including australia in an environment of ongoing trade tensions and subdued inflation in the cases of the united states canada and new zealand members noted that market pricing implied a lowering of policy rates in the period ahead although central banks in these economies had not indicated that a near term change in policy rates was in prospect volatility in foreign exchange markets had generally remained low although the japanese yen had appreciated over recent weeks as tends to be the case in periods of increased uncertainty there had been a moderate depreciation of the chinese renminbi over the preceding month members noted that the australian dollar had depreciated a little over preceding months remaining around the lower end of its narrow range of the preceding few years members also noted that while the strength in commodity prices had supported the exchange rate the decline in australian government bond yields relative to those in the major markets over 2019 had worked in the opposite direction long term government bond yields in australia remained noticeably below those in the united states although this gap had narrowed a little recently as market participants expectations for the future path of the us federal funds rate were revised sharply lower housing credit growth had stabilised in recent months having slowed substantially over the preceding year growth in housing lending to owner occupiers was running at around 4½ per cent in six month ended annualised terms while the rate of growth in housing lending to investors had been close to zero since early 2019 although standard variable reference rates for housing loans had increased since mid 2018 the average rate paid on outstanding loans had been little changed since then as banks had continued to compete for new borrowers by offering materially lower rates on new loans borrowers shifting from interest only to principal and interest loans had also put downward pressure on average outstanding mortgage rates members were briefed on the changes proposed by apra to its requirement that banks determine the borrowing capacity of loan applicants using a specified minimum interest rate members observed that the proposed changes would be likely to result in a modest increase in borrowing capacity for those with lower interest rate loans typically owner occupiers and borrowers with principal and interest loans however some borrowers facing higher than average interest rates would not see an increase in their borrowing capacity members observed that such a change to serviceability assessments would mean that any reduction in actual interest rates paid would increase households borrowing capacity a little this would be in addition to the positive effect on the cash flow of the household sector overall the pace of growth in business lending had slowed in recent months with lending to large businesses continuing to be the sole source of growth lending to small businesses had declined over the preceding year members noted that the stricter verification of income and expenses required for consumer lending was also being applied to many small businesses members noted that financing conditions for both financial and non financial corporations were highly favourable with australian bond yields at historic lows yields on residential mortgage backed securities were also at low levels having declined in line with the one month bank bill swap rate bbsw which is the reference rate for these securities members observed that the increase in bbsw and other short term money market rates in 2018 had been fully unwound as a result the major banks debt funding costs were now at a historic low the major banks retail deposit rates were also historically low with deposit rates having continued to edge lower the average interest rate paid on retail deposits by banks was slightly below the cash rate although only a small share of deposits by value received a rate below 0 5 per cent predominantly deposits on transaction accounts financial market pricing implied that the cash rate target was expected to be lowered by 25 basis points at the present meeting with a further 25 basis point reduction expected later in the year considerations for monetary policy in considering the stance of monetary policy members observed that the outlook for the global economy remained reasonable although the risks from the international trade disputes had increased members noted that the associated uncertainty had been affecting investment intentions in a number of economies and that international trade remained weak at the same time the chinese authorities had continued to provide targeted stimulus to support economic growth and global financial conditions remained very accommodative in most advanced economies labour markets had remained tight and wages growth had picked up while inflation had remained subdued members observed that the outlook for the australian economy also remained reasonable with the sustained low level of interest rates continuing to support economic activity a pick up in growth in household disposable income continued investment in infrastructure and a renewed expansion in the resources sector were expected to contribute to growth in output over coming years the unemployment rate was expected to decline a little towards the end of the forecast period and underlying inflation was expected to pick up gradually to be at the lower end of the target range in the next couple of years members noted that this outlook was based on the usual technical assumption that the cash rate followed the path implied by market pricing which suggested interest rates would be lower in the period ahead the most recent data on labour market conditions had shown that despite ongoing strong growth in employment the unemployment rate had not declined any further in the preceding six months and had edged up in the most recent two months reasonably strong demand for labour had been met partly by a rise in labour force participation members observed that this increased flexibility on the supply side of the labour market together with ongoing subdued growth in wages and inflation suggested that spare capacity was likely to remain in the labour market for some time while wages growth had picked up from a year earlier it had remained subdued and recent data suggested the pick up was only very gradual together these data suggested that the australian economy could sustain a lower rate of unemployment than previously estimated while achieving inflation consistent with the target members observed that underlying inflation had been below the 2 3 per cent target range for three years and that the lower than expected march quarter inflation data at 1½ per cent in underlying terms had pointed to ongoing subdued inflationary pressures in part this reflected continued slow growth in wages members also observed that competition in retailing very weak growth in rents in the context of the housing market adjustment and government initiatives to reduce cost of living pressures had been dampening inflation pressures these factors were likely to continue for some time members recognised that australia s flexible inflation targeting framework did not require inflation to be within the target range at all times which allows the board to set monetary policy so as best to achieve the bank s broad objectives however they also agreed that the inflation target plays an important role as a strong medium term anchor for inflation expectations to help deliver low and stable inflation which in turn supports sustainable growth in employment and incomes in these circumstances members agreed that further improvement in the labour market would be required for wages growth and inflation to rise to levels consistent with the medium term inflation target moreover while the bank s central forecast scenario for growth and inflation was unchanged the accumulation of data on inflation and labour market conditions over recent months had led members to revise their assessment of the extent of inflationary pressure in the economy and relatedly the extent of spare capacity in the australian labour market given these considerations members considered the case for a reduction in the cash rate at the current meeting a lower level of interest rates would support growth in the economy thereby reducing unemployment and contributing to inflation rising to a level consistent with the target members recognised that in the current environment the main channels through which lower interest rates would support the economy were a lower value of the exchange rate reduced borrowing rates for businesses and lower required interest payments on borrowing by households freeing up cash for other expenditure although households are net borrowers in aggregate members recognised that there are many individual households that are net savers and whose interest income would be reduced by lower interest rates carefully considering these different effects members judged that a lower level of interest rates was likely to support growth in employment and incomes and promote stronger overall economic conditions members also considered the risks associated with a lower level of interest rates in the period ahead given the high level of household debt the adjustment under way in housing markets and the tightening in lending practices members judged that a decline in interest rates was unlikely to encourage a material pick up in borrowing by households that would add to medium term risks in the economy members continued to recognise that there were risks to the forecasts for growth and inflation in both directions however given the extent of spare capacity in the economy and the subdued inflationary pressures they judged there was a low likelihood of a decline in interest rates resulting in an unexpectedly strong pick up in inflation members also observed that a lower level of interest rates would stimulate activity and thereby improve the resilience of the australian economy to any future adverse shocks taking into account all the available information the board decided that it was appropriate to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points at this meeting a lower level of the cash rate would assist in reducing spare capacity in the labour market providing more australians with jobs and greater confidence that inflation will return to be comfortably within the medium term target range in the period ahead given the amount of spare capacity in the labour market and the economy more broadly members agreed that it was more likely than not that a further easing in monetary policy would be appropriate in the period ahead they also recognised however that lower interest rates were not the only policy option available to assist in lowering the rate of unemployment consistent with the medium term inflation target members agreed that in assessing whether further monetary easing was appropriate developments in the labour market would be particularly important the decision the board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 1 25 per cent effective 5 june to read the minutes from the rba click here
in july 2024 the world bank and the imf will be 80 years old 80 years of financial neo colonialism and the imposition of austerity policies in the name of debt repayment 80 years is enough the bretton woods institutions must be abolished and replaced by democratic institutions serving an ecological feminist and anti racist bifurcation to mark these 80 years we are republishing a series of articles every wednesday until july looking in detail at the history and damage caused by these two institutions the world bank world bank wb the world bank was founded as part of the new international monetary system set up at bretton woods in 1944 its capital is provided by member states contributions and loans on the international money markets it financed public and private projects in third world and east european countries it consists of several closely associated institutions among which 1 the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd 189 members in 2017 which provides loans in productive sectors such as farming or energy 2 the international development association ida 159 members in 1997 which provides less advanced countries with long term loans 35 40 years at very low interest 1 3 the international finance corporation ifc which provides both loan and equity finance for business ventures in developing countries as third world debt gets worse the world bank along with the imf tends to adopt a macro economic perspective for instance it enforces adjustment policies that are intended to balance heavily indebted countries payments the world bank advises those countries that have to undergo the imf s therapy on such matters as how to reduce budget deficits round up savings enduce foreign investors to settle within their borders or free prices and exchange rates s and the imf imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country the most important one 6 57 of the votes is led by belgium the least important group of countries 1 55 of the votes is led by gabon and brings together african countries s policy on indonesia is a textbook case in many ways everything is there interference in a country s internal affairs support for a dictatorial regime guilty of crimes against humanity backing for a regime responsible for an aggression against a neighbouring country the annexation of east timor in 1975 and the development of mega projects which simultaneously imply massive transfers of population the plundering of natural resources for the profit profit the positive gain yielded from a company s activity net profit is profit after tax distributable profit is the part of the net profit which can be distributed to the shareholders of transnational corporations and aggressions against indigenous populations in 1997 indonesia was hit hard by the southeast asian crisis the prescribed remedies of the world bank and the imf worsened the economic situation and brought about social disasters the tsunami drama changed nothing for the bank and the imf the creditors maintained their pressure for repayment of indonesian debts and imposed an additional dose of neo liberal adjustment in 1947 the bank granted a 195 million dollar loan to the netherlands the second loan in the bank s history two weeks before the loan was approved the netherlands launched its offensive against the indonesian nationalists who were demanding independence in the next two years as many as 145 000 dutch occupying troops were sent into the country it was a large scale operation that could hardly go unnoticed within the united nations and in the us criticism was voiced concerning dutch policy in indonesia and the world bank s involvement the bank replied that the loan had been granted to the dutch government for spending within the netherlands the critics objected in their turn that since money is fungible by nature it was easy for the dutch government to use the bank loan to support its military effort in indonesia the us put pressure on the netherlands giving it 400 million dollars under the marshall plan marshall plan a programme of economic reconstruction proposed in 1947 by the us state secretary george c marshall with a budget of 12 5 billion dollars more than 80 billion dollars in current terms composed of donations and long term loans the marshall plan enabled 16 countries notably france the uk italy and the scandinavian countries to finance their reconstruction after the second world war so that it could grant independence to indonesia the us objective was to open a new field of trade and investment for its companies on 27 december 1949 the transfer of sovereignty was signed indonesia became a republic and the nationalist sukarno was elected president he set about maintaining a balance balance end of year statement of a company s assets what the company possesses and liabilities what it owes in other words the assets provide information about how the funds collected by the company have been used and the liabilities about the origins of those funds between the various factions in the country while amassing personal power in 1955 following the first elections sukarno decided to collaborate with the communist party pki in order to establish his legitimacy the pki won 16 of the votes and sukarno s party the pni 25 in external affairs sukarno made skilful use of the two opposing blocs in the cold war and there too he managed to maintain an equilibrium until 1963 when the us exasperated by the ussr s assistance to indonesia explicitly asked him to choose his camp the imf played the role of intermediary by proposing financial assistance strictly conditioned by terms of close co operation in march 1963 negotiations for loans got underway with the us the imf and the member states of the oecd oecd organisation for economic co operation and development oecd the organisation for economic co operation and development created in 1960 it includes the major industrialized countries and has 34 members as of january 2016 but everything went haywire in september 1963 when the british proclaimed the federation of malaysia without any outside consultation sukarno saw it as a destabilizing manœuvre and retaliated by nationalizing the british companies which led to the cancellation of the agreements with the imf despite everything the un endorsed the creation of malaysia and sukarno unable to prevail walked out of the un in 1965 at the height of the cold war sukarno nationalized all foreign private companies except the oil companies indonesia left the imf and the world bank in august 1965 and decided to manage its affairs without them on 30 september 1965 general mohamed suharto staged a military coup supported by washington as chief of the armed forces he launched a massive repression against the leftist parties making the pki his prime target between 500 000 and 1 million civilians were assassinated simply for being members or sympathizers of the pki in march 1966 suharto finally forced sukarno to make an official transfer of power six days later the us government announced that it was opening a line of credit for indonesia amounting to 8 2 million dollars so that it could buy american rice on 13 april 1966 indonesia joined the world bank in 1966 us president lyndon b johnson went to visit us troops in vietnam and insisted in one of his speeches on the indonesian model this model the new order of the suharto era regularly used terror and assassination and in effect aligned its policy on that of the united states the world bank and suharto s dictatorship when robert mcnamara became president of the world bank in april 1968 he observed that indonesia with mao s china was the only highly populated country with which the bank did not have an important relationship it was necessary to make up for lost time and his first trip abroad as world bank president was to indonesia in june 1968 he felt quite at home there the dictator suharto had already surrounded himself with economists trained in the us courtesy of the ford foundation relations between them were idyllic he mcnamara and president suharto admired each other while they were engaged in daily policy discussion the bank and the government acted like a couple of old cronies indonesia was the presidentially designated jewel in the bank s operational crown moreover the historians of the bank admit that president suharto he had assumed the office in 1967 was a general and his government in good part was a government of generals many of whom were corrupt indonesia officially rejoined the ranks of the imf in february 1967 and the rewards were not long in coming the western countries immediately granted aid of 174 million dollars in order to absorb the effects of the indonesian crisis thereafter in the early 1970s the good relations between indonesia the us and the financial institutions took the form of a substantial debt reduction indeed at the end of 1966 534 million dollars should have been repaid as debt servicing interest interest an amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set principal and arrears a sum which represented 69 of the estimated earnings from export without a re scheduling debt servicing would have destroyed the effect of financial assistance the western creditor countries accepted a long term moratorium until 1971 on repayment of the principal and interests on the debt contracted before 1966 however the effects of the moratorium were only temporary and in 1971 repayments were supposed to start again consequently the creditors signed the most favourable agreement ever granted at that time to a third world country the pre 1966 debt contracted under sukarno must be repaid in 30 annual instalments over a period extending between 1970 and 1999 the creditors agreed that indonesian repayments would not exceed 6 of the earnings from export this operation had the effect of cancelling 50 of the debt this reduction of debt was coupled with a reprehensible complacency regarding corruption as soon as the world bank returned to indonesia to support the military dictatorship its representatives became aware of the extent of the corruption but robert mcnamara and the enormous bank staff who settled in permanently in djakarta decided not to make it a cause for divorce thus they were clearly accomplices bernard bell who headed the bank resident staff in indonesia recalls the question of the enormous misappropriation of funds caused by high level government corruption on 11 february 1972 he described this corruption to robert mcnamara as unacceptable to small but potentially vigorous elements of the public and that was only the beginning indeed the global report on corruption 2004 by transparency international estimated embezzlement by suharto and his entourage at 15 to 35 billion dollars the world bank itself nurtured the corruption since one of its own reports mentioned that 20 to 30 of the budgets related to development funds were misappropriated the bank continued its loans while knowing perfectly well that they were likely to be diverted the pertamina affair during the 1970s oil incomes exploded and so did the diversion of funds by corrupt generals for their own benefit in 1975 a major crisis came to a head between the us and indonesia ironically the invasion and annexation of east timor by indonesia that year had nothing to do with this the indonesian generals had developed the public oil company pertamina so successfully that in february 1975 it had become the largest asian company japan not included the pertamina conglomerate not only extracted and refined hydrocarbons but it also possessed a chain of hotels and numerous oil tankers pertamina improved the country s harbour infrastructures and built roads and hospitals this public company was active in the field of insurance with offices in hong kong los angeles singapore and tokyo it played a key part in a strategy of industrialization by import substitution this was less and less to the liking of the us and naturally to the world bank to put it bluntly pertamina was an obstacle to the development of the large us oil companies consequently the us found it advisable to weaken and even dismantle pertamina under pressure suharto bowed to its demands during the summer of 1975 robert mcnamara wrote to him i applaud the comprehensive and systematic way in which you have moved to re establish appropriate priorities as a consolation prize robert mcnamara added that he would see to it that the world bank increased its loans it was only during his last visit to indonesia on 15 may 1979 that robert mcnamara privately spoke his mind it was also necessary to maintain the emphasis on reducing corruption outside indonesia this was much talked about and the world had the impression rightly or wrongly that it was greater than in any but perhaps one other country it was like a cancer eating away at society however at the end of 1980 the world bank was still supporting suharto s indonesia to such an extent that it granted a loan without respecting imposing the usual conditions a similar situation can be seen 9 years later when the bank anxious to maintain good relations with china failed to take its distance after the repression of the chinese spring of 1989 the bank s silence regarding the annexation of east timor thirty years after indonesia s invasion of timor certain us archives were made public undisputedly they establish what had long been suspected in december 1975 indonesia invaded east timor with the connivance of the american british and australian governments with the result that the country would undergo twenty four years of bloody occupation and systematic violations of human rights according to these documents as early as march 1975 the state department then headed by henry kissinger aware of indonesia s preparations for invasion estimated that the us has considerable interests in indonesia and none in timor when he learned about the special operations leading up to the invasion henry kissinger asked his colleagues can i trust you to keep quiet about this his fear was that congress would decree an embargo on arms deliveries to indonesia washington s ally in the cold war one can well understand that during this time the world bank neither made any allusion to nor criticized the invasion and the annexation of east timor submission to the interests of the us and its allies the uk and australia and complicity regarding the dictatorship were constant components of the bank s behaviour the world bank s support for the transmigration programme the world bank actively collaborated in the sinister transmigration project certain facets of which constitute crimes against humanity this project concerned the displacement in certain cases forced of millions of people from the islands of java and sumatra to other islands of the archipelago and dispossession of the indigenous people of these islands the world bank especially during the fifteen years of the programme s heyday 1974 1989 was its principal source of external financing the historians recognize this responsibility of the bank during the middle and later 1970 s the bank as well supported and assisted the government s controversial program of official and subsidized transmigration of families from java to the outer islands this contribution was not only restricted to financial and technical support the bank also supported the project politically between 1950 and 1974 the government displaced 664 000 people within the framework of the transmigration programme however from 1974 on with the world bank s support 3 5 million people were displaced and assisted and approximately 3 5 million people migrated on their own initiative the world bank directly contributed to displacements and relocations due to its loans it was possible on the one hand to almost totally cover the official migrations of 2 3 million people and on the other hand to catalyze the relocation of some 2 million people transmigrating spontaneously although the world bank qualified this transmigration as the biggest programme in the world for voluntary relocation it soon appeared that the programme was also used to rid java of undesirable inhabitants thus in the principal javanese cities nonconformists elderly people sick people including those with leprosy beggars and vagrants were forced either to disappear into the countryside where their chances of survival were slim or to transmigrate in the latter case they were herded into army trucks during the night and brought to transit camps where they were given training for their relocation marriage was an obligatory criterion for selection the authorities organized forced marriages of single people before their departure one should note that the world bank played a large role in recruitment operations for homeless people and political prisoners in order to send them to the remotest and least desirable transmigration sites the transmigration projects most heavily supported by the world bank were those involving private domestic or foreign firms likely to promote foreign trade and attract more ambitious transnational investments particularly projects for industrial plantations unrestricted foreign exploitation of the resources of the outer islands was pursued for the benefit of the central government and firms operating in the country but to the detriment of the local populations who saw a great portion of their habitat and their means of subsistence destroyed forever the lands of the outer islands were regarded as empty because the natives who lived there for millennia did not have ownership certificates these lands were then declared to be at the state s service and were forcefully confiscated most often without compensation in fact the world bank supported the government in its acts of expropriating land belonging to indigenous people although it never acknowledged it officially the people of the transmigration programme inherited land that was not reserved for forest concessions and that was generally far from productive for the government officials appointed to locate the sites to be cleared it did not matter whether they were cultivable or not their job was to fill up a chart with information relating to site access the number of hectares to be cleared and the number of families that could possibly be located there the forest a vital resource for the native dwellers gradually disappeared due to the operations of forestry companies and commercial plantations on the one hand and government teams entrusted with clearing the areas intended for agriculture and the installation of migrants on the other in addition mining companies see the case of the american mining company freeport mcmoran destroyed complete mountainsides and daily poured tons of industrial waste into the rivers polluting them beyond recovery these rivers being the only source of water for native dwellers major medical disasters occurred oil extraction along the coasts also caused great damage to the marine fauna and flora another source of food for the indigenous populations the real culprits in this matter were those who devised carried out and financed the project primarily they were the indonesian authorities and the international institutions the world bank first and foremost as well as certain western governments the us the uk germany and israel for example and the national and foreign companies involved in the project s materialization among the devastating effects of the project development and proliferation of intensive operations for the exploitation of natural resources a rapid increase in the surface areas intended for commercial plantations as a result of programmes financed by international loans these loans were always conditioned by the opening up of markets at all levels removal of tariff barriers attraction of foreign capital priority on monocultures for export liberalization and privatization of the goods and services distribution sectors etc at the end of 1980 vociferous criticism increased as much inside as outside the archipelago accusing the world bank of having taken part in a project of geopolitical domination typified by social and ecological blunders and infringing human rights in the course of its procedures the world bank indeed played a major part in this project with harmful and irreversible consequences control of the indigenous populations of the outer islands and violation of their right to land ownership the exorbitant cost of displacements 7 000 dollars per family according to world bank estimates in relation to the results achieved because according to a 1986 world bank study 50 of the displaced families lived below the poverty level and 20 below subsistence level persistent problems of density in java massive deforestation of the outer islands etc the world bank accused on all sides decided to cease financing the installation of new transmigration sites and the costs of transmigration travel nevertheless it concentrated its loans on the reinforcement of already existing villages and on maintenance of the commercial plantations thus only partially renouncing its participation in the programme the world bank obviously denied all the allegations brought by observers in 1994 it decided to carry out an internal evaluation study of the projects it financed in order to determine its eventual responsibilities in this report the world bank accepted a very small share share a unit of ownership interest in a corporation or financial asset representing one part of the total capital stock its owner a shareholder is entitled to receive an equal distribution of any profits distributed a dividend and to attend shareholder meetings of responsibility stating that the project in sumatra had negative and probably irreversible effects on the kubu a nomadic people whose survival relied on fallow cultivation hunting and gathering in the forest the audit admits that although the existence of kubu in the zones of the project was known since the project was planned few initiatives were carried out to avoid problems the loans of the world bank for the transmigration programme correspond in all respects to the constitution of an odious debt odious debt according to the doctrine for a debt to be odious it must meet two conditions 1 it must have been contracted against the interests of the nation or against the interests of the people or against the interests of the state 2 creditors cannot prove they they were unaware of how the borrowed money would be used we must underline that according to the doctrine of odious debt the nature of the borrowing regime or government does not signify since what matters is what the debt is used for if a democratic government gets into debt against the interests of its population the contracted debt can be called odious if it also meets the second condition consequently contrary to a misleading version of the doctrine odious debt is not only about dictatorial regimes see éric toussaint the doctrine of odious debt from alexander sack to the cadtm the father of the odious debt doctrine alexander nahum sack clearly says that odious debts can be contracted by any regular government sack considers that a debt that is regularly incurred by a regular government can be branded as odious if the two above mentioned conditions are met he adds once these two points are established the burden of proof that the funds were used for the general or special needs of the state and were not of an odious character would be upon the creditors sack defines a regular government as follows by a regular government is to be understood the supreme power that effectively exists within the limits of a given territory whether that government be monarchical absolute or limited or republican whether it functions by the grace of god or the will of the people whether it express the will of the people or not of all the people or only of some whether it be legally established or not etc none of that is relevant to the problem we are concerned with so clearly for sack all regular governments whether despotic or democratic in one guise or another can incur odious debts they were contracted by a despotic regime which used them for repression and not for the well being of the population consequently this debt is null and void it must be cancelled but it should not stop there the transmigration project supported by the world bank implied the forced displacement of certain populations the world bank cannot simply claim that it was not aware of this it was also an accomplice to the violation of the rights of the indigenous people who lived in the zones colonized by the transmigration project these very serious acts should not go unpunished the crisis of 1997 1998 in indonesia and its consequences from the 1980s and especially during the first half of the 1990s the world bank and the imf got the indonesian government to agree to free circulation of capital this had the effect of placing indonesia like the philippines thailand malaysia and south korea at the mercy of international speculation in the imf s annual report for the year 1997 one can read the compliments it pays to the indonesian authorities the administrators congratulated the authorities for indonesia s economic results during the previous years particularly the appreciable reduction of poverty and the improvement of many social indicators further on the administrators of the imf compliment the indonesian authorities for the importance attached to maintaining free circulation of capital while earlier in the document they themselves point out the risks powerful entries of capital posed important challenges for the authorities they continue their analysis by praising the authorities implying that they are capable of controlling the situation the flexibility with which the authorities adapted the proportioning of economic measures according to the evolution of the situation was one of the ingredients of their success and will remain an essential tool for taking up these challenges in 1997 a massive economic and financial crisis broke out in southeast asia after its appearance in thailand in february 1997 it spread to malaysia indonesia and the philippines by july 1997 these four countries described previously by the imf the world bank and the private banks as role models by reason of their opening up to the world market their low rate of inflation inflation the cumulated rise of prices as a whole e g a rise in the price of petroleum eventually leading to a rise in salaries then to the rise of other prices etc inflation implies a fall in the value of money since as time goes by larger sums are required to purchase particular items this is the reason why corporate driven policies seek to keep inflation down and high growth rate were now unable to resist the onslaughts of speculators between 2 july 1997 and 8 january 1998 the indonesian rupee was depreciated by 229 in relation to the us dollar after having been praised to the skies by the world bank and the imf the indonesian authorities were now strongly criticized for leaving too much of power in the hands of the state a state which in addition would have been wrong in accepting that the private financial and industrial institutions were overly involved in debt and speculation southeast asia s crisis of 1997 dealt a hard blow to indonesia in the space of less than a year foreign capital was withdrawn from the country mass unemployment set in at the end of 1998 according to government statistics 50 of the population lived below the poverty line estimated in indonesia at 0 55 per day for cities and 0 40 for the countryside the imf imposed its shock measures to resolve the crisis of 1997 they worsened the situation particularly by causing the bankruptcy of a large section of the banking sector and of many entrepreneurs the imf and the world bank pressed the government to transform the private debt of the banks into a public debt the indonesian public debt which accounted for 23 of the gross national product gross national product gnp the gnp represents the wealth produced by a nation as opposed to a given territory it includes the revenue of citizens of the nation living abroad gnp before the crisis 1997 literally exploded as a consequence of the policies imposed by the imf and the bank in 2000 the public debt amounted to 93 of the gnp on the other hand real wages plunged whereas there had been an increase of 46 between 1990 and 1996 they lost 25 1 of their value in 1998 the population directly suffered the effects of these measures and started protesting vigorously on 5 may 1998 within the framework of the agreements signed with the imf suharto eliminated the subsidies on basic commodities commodities the goods exchanged on the commodities market traditionally raw materials such as metals and fuels and cereals so that the price of kerosene electricity and petrol increased by 70 this intensified the huge popular mobilization that had begun several months before fifteen days later deserted by washington and denounced by the people suharto was forced to step down bringing an end to a dictatorial regime of 32 years today the largest portion of the state budget is devoted to repayment of the debt in 1999 and 2000 50 and 40 respectively were devoted to debt servicing in 2004 the figure was close to 28 according to the projections of the indonesian finance minister repayment of the external public debt has continue to increase in 2006 and reached a peak in 2008 remaining at a high level thereafter after the drama of the tsunami resulting in the death of 150 000 people in the indonesian province of aceh the world bank and the governments of the creditor countries had promised to show generosity the reality is quite different financial aid at first turned into a mega media event has been provided in a chaotic and transitory way while this show was being made to offer financial resources for reconstruction the creditors in the paris club paris club this group of lender states was founded in 1956 and specializes in dealing with non payment by developing countries who in addition direct the world bank and the imf decided to deduct late payment interest from the portion of debt servicing which was not made in 2005 the moratorium granted by the paris club is thus only a show of generosity since the states that accept it will make their populations pay right down to the last cent the indonesian government under pressure from its creditors imposed a steep increase 29 on the price of fuel on 1 march 2005 which occasioned deep popular discontent the tax revenue resulting from this rise was intended mainly for replenishing the budget deficit and repaying the debt as for human development many indicators are particularly worrying share of population living with less than 2 per day 52 4 life expectancy at birth 66 6 years infant mortality rate

third world the undp publishes an annual human development report which among other things classifies countries by their human development rating hdr world report on human development 2004 by way of conclusion the 1965 military coup d état deprived the indonesian people of the possibility of determining their own future yet with the bandung conference in 1955 indonesia had begun to affirm itself on the international scene it was the threat of seeing one of the most populous countries on earth playing a key role in establishing a new world order that led the united states and the bretton woods institutions to provide active support for the suharto dictatorship these institutions based their choice on political and geo strategic factors their financial support enabled suharto to carry out policies that went counter to human rights suharto served the interests of the major western powers in the region and enabled transnational corporations based in the industrialized countries to draw liberally on indonesia s natural resources the world bank and the imf were active accomplices in these policies the local ruling class supported suharto and did not seek to invest in the development of the country it preferred to abet the plundering of indonesia s natural resources by transnational corporations starting from the crisis in 1997 imf imposed measures aggravated the economic situation and brought about a sharp increase in the internal and external public debt the historical balance sheet of the imf s and world bank s role in indonesia is an unqualified disaster in consequence the claims they hold against this country must be cancelled in full moreover the world bank and the imf must be brought to account for their complicity in the suharto regime and for projects such as transmigration which in many respects constitute a crime against humanity the bilateral debts are in the hands of countries that directly backed the suharto dictatorship so they too must be cancelled the same applies to debts owed to foreign private companies that played a part in the corruption of the indonesian regime the pillaging of the country s natural resources and the exploitation of its workers a review of indonesia s debt shows a totally negative result in the matter of human development between 1970 and 2003 indonesia received 139 billion us dollars in the form of loans intended for the authorities and it has refunded 164 billion yet indonesia s external public debt has increased twenty fold between 1970 and 2003 total debt repayment represents 46 times the amount of the initial debt stock debt stock the total amount of debt since 1985 indonesia has refunded annually more than it has received in the form of loans this is irrefutable proof that the debt system is a fatal mechanism for extracting the country s wealth
us dollar forecast us china trade war talking points us china trade war tensions are continuously climbing where might this escalation lead beijing prepared to use rare earth minerals bureaucratic tools as leverage in trade talks will china push the proverbial nuclear button dumping its us treasuries portfolio see our free guide to learn how to use economic news in your trading strategy where is the us china trade war headed the us china trade war is a fundamental headwind that is continuing to blow the sails of the global economy increasingly closer to a rocky coastline the imf wto and other notable institutions have cited the conflict as the primary culprit behind deteriorating global growth prospects analysts have also highlighted the risk that weakening economic conditions could expose hidden weaknesses in the financial system at the time of writing officials in beijing and washington have dug their heels into the ground and threatened to escalate the situation the most recent incident came when us president donald trump imposed an additional 15 percent tariff on 200 billion worth of chinese goods in response to china s alleged back pedaling on key issues in the prospective trade agreement this was followed by a threat to impose an additional 25 percent tariff on 300 billion worth of chinese goods unless beijing was brought to heel some of these demands curbing its development of state owned enterprises soes which washington accused of giving local companies an unfair advantage china responded that it sees such a demand as an invasion of its sovereignty want to learn more about the history of trade wars see our interactive infographic here prc officials have reiterated that they will not swallow any bitter fruit and compromise on what they believe could undermine core interests starting in june in response to us tariffs beijing imposed a levy of 60 billion against us imported goods as both sides double down china has begun to explore alternative ways of retribution with one measure being so extreme it has been dubbed the nuclear option this would be to sell its 1 1 trillion holding of us treasuries more on that later how else then may china use any of the non military weapons in its arsenal to gain an advantage in trade negotiations with washington china may restrict access to rare earth minerals there are many steps before beijing would even consider a radical move like selling most or all of its treasuries portfolio including banning or at least strongly restricting the supply of rare earth mineral exports to the us speculation about such a policy began when chinese president xi jinping demonstratively visited a local rare earth processing facility despite the name china might use these rare earth minerals as leverage not because of their scarcity but rather because it dominates their processing here the world s number two economy wields an unparalleled advantage the facilities doing this work operate at a high financial and environmental cost which has been decisive in keeping competitors at bay in the us especially given the political atmosphere of reducing pollution and being more environmentally conscious attempting to ramp up production would be a long and costly process how would restricted supply of rare earth minerals impact financial markets china accounts for 80 percent of us rare earth mineral imports 17 of which are heavily used in high tech consumer electronics and military hardware some other applications include batteries catalysts in cars and wind turbines it has an advantage because most of the technology that the us already uses has these rare earth minerals embedded in it most notably in computers and cellphones apple inc uses many of these materials to enable the use of key features in its cellphone products which if restricted could dramatically disrupt production and hurt earnings as one of the largest companies in the world with a market cap of almost 800 billion significant price moves in apple stock could reverberate across global financial markets and sour sentiment cycle sensitive assets such as equities as well as the new zealand and australian dollars would likely sink while the ant risk japanese yen and us dollar along with treasury bonds would likely catch a haven bid the s p 500 in particular might suffer because of apple s significant weight in the index making the company a frequently cited bellwether for market sentiment wrapped in red how china may use bureaucracy as leverage in trade talks in addition to using mother nature china can also harness the vast power of the bureaucratic state to wrap us businesses in red tape in a recent us china business council survey 25 percent of firms reported increased scrutiny by regulators and greater barriers to entering the chinese market these include increased frequency of unannounced inspections and slower clearance for customs among many other obstacles while the chinese government has not explicitly stated that they directly ordered the implementation of these bureaucratic hurdles the timing is considered suspicious among analysts and market participants businesses have found themselves encountering more bureaucratic roadblocks almost exactly as us china trade relations began to severely sour in may a breakthrough in trade negotiations may miraculously result in customs and various checks disappearing and could speed up the process of regulatory clearance however until this occurs it is not likely that firms will find it any easier to enter and participate in the chinese market leading to greater speculation that us economic performance will take a hit the nuclear option will china dump its treasury holdings the short answer is probably no however to discount the unthinkable in inconceivable times would be as unthinkable as it is unconceivable china is the largest foreign holder of us debt owning approximately 1 1 trillion in treasuries since beijing has accrued such a large stockpile of us government bonds market participants have worried about what might happen if china were to rapidly divest its portfolio chinese officials have not exercised this option because the global impact would almost inevitably reverberate back to asia and undermine china s own growth prospects and financial stability however if the us continues its aggressive approach to trade talks it may back beijing into a corner leading to a greater probability that it will flex this muscle as a warning sign to a certain degree it already has in march china sold 20 billion worth of us treasuries the largest selloff in close to two years global financial markets were spooked on just the prospect that china would consider even using such a controversial weapon as a scare tactic what would be the short medium and long term consequences if china dumped all its us treasury holdings the short term reaction would almost certainly be market panic the us dollar along with sentiment linked currencies like the australian and new zealand dollars would likely drop alongside equities and growth geared commodities the sudden influx of us treasuries would depress bond prices and cause a dramatic spike in yields since the two typically move inversely to each other leading to a surge in borrowing costs for the us government yields on treasuries are where almost all other borrowing costs are benchmarked these include business and consumer credit corporate bonds mortgages etc the higher yield on us bonds would thus lift rates on a slew of interest bearing debts making them more expensive to service and reducing the overall rate of borrowing a slowdown in investment and economic growth would follow leaving the central bank to clean up the mess however it is not as if china would emerge unscathed in this scenario approximately 20 percent of chinese exports head to the us making it the country s largest customer if demand there plummets china s growth would be hurt as well furthermore the destabilizing effect would impair risk sentiment by way of the shockwave it would send throughout developed and emerging market economies the cost of commodities which are primarily priced in us dollars would soar due to a weaker greenback as a major importer of raw materials china would see its cost structure skyrocket this would undermine china s own economic prospects and may cause diplomatic relations with key allies to suffer a weaker us dollar might alleviate sovereign borrowers that have their debt denominated in usd however the benefits to be had from this relative to the costs incurred by global markets would be almost inconsequential in the us purchasing power would be radically reduced limiting domestic consumption the driver of growth in the largest economy in the world how might the fed be able to alleviate the crisis the fed could cut rates though by this point they may be limited in their ability to do so this might weigh on the dollar to some extent though by this stage in the trade war it is likely to be under severe strain already the result could then be a form of stagnation where inflation and unemployment both remain high much like the oil shock crisis in 1979 in this environment the central bank will probably struggle to craft effective policy that doesn t undermine its own objectives at least to some extent the longer term consequence of large scale chinese divestment from treasuries is that it would undermine confidence in the us dollar and provide policymakers with the impetus to find an alternative reserve currency the probability that beijing will pull such a maneuver seems low because it would essentially be pulling the rug from under itself by destabilizing the largest economy in the world and a key trading partner undermining its own performance in this regard the decision by china to dump all its holdings of us treasuries would be both its honey and hemlock the sweet taste of exerting such power would be swiftly replaced by the poison of the blowback to that end it seems chinese officials might do well to take a page from confucius before you

fed under the microscope the federal reserve remains the focus of all attention as its two day fomc meeting gets underway three things to watch from the fed meeting gavin friend senior market strategist at nab said the june meeting was a tricky one for the fed to navigate in its dot point forecasts we expect the remaining 2020 rate hike to be removed longer run 2 75 per cent might be shaved to 2 5 per cent or 2 625 per cent he wrote in a note the committee won t want to officially forecast a rate cut in 2019 given the run of better data and unpredictability of the trade dispute but a small minority will likely opt for a dot cut this year the new economic forecasts are likely to nudge core pce inflation down from 1 9 per cent to 2 0 per cent in 2019 given the run rate so far that would imply that any rebound in inflation under the transitory heading could be delayed if the fed wanted to stick with the wording which was new in may the 3 6 per cent to 3 8 per cent jobless

menafn dailyfx us dollar forecast us china trade war talking points us china trade war tensions are continuously climbing where might this scalation lead beijing prepared to use rare earth minerals bureaucratic tools as leverage in trade talks will china push the proverbial nuclear button dumping its us treasuries portfolio see our free guide to learn how touse economic news in your trading strategy where is the us china trade war headed the us china trade war is a fundamental headwind that is continuing to blow the sails of the global economy increasingly closer to a rocky coastline the imf wto and other notable institutions have cited the conflict as the primary culprit behind deteriorating global growth prospects analysts have also highlighted the risk that weakening economic conditions could exposehidden weaknesses in the financial system at the time of writing officials in beijing and washington have dug their heels into the ground and threatened to escalate the situation the most recent incident came when us president donald trump imposed an additional 15 percent tariff on 200 billion worth of chinese goods in response to china s alleged back pedaling on key issues in the prospective trade agreement this was followed by a threat to impose an additional 25 percent tariff on 300 billion worth of chinese goods unless beijing was brought to heel some of these demands curbing its development of state owned enterprises soes which washington accused of giving local companies an unfair advantage china responded that it sees such a demand as an invasion of its sovereignty want to learn more about the history of trade wars see our interactive infographic here prc officials have reiterated that they will not swallow any bitter fruit and compromise on what they believe could undermine core interests starting in june in response to us tariffs beijing imposed a levy of 60 billion against us imported goods as both sides double down china has begun to explore alternative ways of retribution with one measure being so extreme it has been dubbed the nuclear option this would be to sell its 1 1 trillion holding of us treasuries more on that later how else then may china use any of the non military weapons in its arsenal to gain an advantage in trade negotiations with washington china may restrict access to rare earth minerals there are many steps before beijing would even consider a radical move like selling most or all of its treasuries portfolio including banning or at least strongly restricting the supply of rare earth mineral exports to the us speculation about such a policy began when chinese president xi jinping demonstratively visited a local rare earth processing facility despite the name china might use these rare earth minerals as leverage not because of their scarcity but rather because it dominates their processing here the world s number two economy wields an unparalleled advantage the facilities doing this work operate at a high financial and environmental cost which has been decisive in keeping competitors at bay in the us especially given the political atmosphere of reducing pollution and being more environmentally conscious attempting to ramp up production would be a long and costly process how would restricted supply of rare earth minerals impact financial markets china accounts for 80 percent of us rare earth mineral imports 17 of which are heavily used in high tech consumer electronics and military hardware some other applications include batteries catalysts in cars and wind turbines it has an advantage because most of the technology that the us already uses has these rare earth minerals embedded in it most notably in computers and cellphones apple inc uses many of these materials to enable the use of key features in its cellphone products which if restricted could dramatically disrupt production and hurt earnings as one of the largest companies in the world with a market cap of almost 800 billion significant price moves in apple stock could reverberate across global financial markets and sour sentiment cycle sensitive assets such as equities as well as the new zealand and australian dollars would likely sink while the ant riskjapanese yenandus dollaralong with treasury bonds would likely catch a haven bid thes p 500in particular might suffer because of apple s significant weight in the index making the company a frequently cited bellwether for market sentiment wrapped in red how china may use bureaucracy as leverage in trade talks in addition to using mother nature china can also harness the vast power of the bureaucratic state to wrap us businesses in red tape in a recent us china business council survey 25 percent of firms reported increased scrutiny by regulators and greater barriers to entering the chinese market these include increased frequency of unannounced inspections and slower clearance for customs among many other obstacles while the chinese government has not explicitly stated that they directly ordered the implementation of these bureaucratic hurdles the timing is considered suspicious among analysts and market participants businesses have found themselves encountering more bureaucratic roadblocks almost exactly as us china trade relations began to severely sour in may a breakthrough in trade negotiations may miraculously result in customs and various checks disappearing and could speed up the process of regulatory clearance however until this occurs it is not likely that firms will find it any easier to enter and participate in the chinese market leading to greater speculation that us economic performance will take a hit the nuclear option will china dump its treasury holdings the short answer is probably no however to discount the unthinkable in inconceivable times would be as unthinkable as it is unconceivable china is the largest foreign holder of us debt owning approximately 1 1 trillion in treasuries since beijing has accrued such a large stockpile of us government bonds market participants have worried about what might happen if china were to rapidly divest its portfolio chinese officials have not exercised this option because the global impact would almost inevitably reverberate back to asia and undermine china s own growth prospects and financial stability however if the us continues its aggressive approach to trade talks it may back beijing into a corner leading to a greater probability that it will flex this muscle as a warning sign to a certain degree it already has in march china sold 20 billion worth of us treasuries the largest selloff in close to two years global financial markets were spooked on just the prospect that china would consider even using such a controversial weapon as a scare tactic what would be the short medium and long term consequences if china dumped all its us treasury holdings the short term reaction would almost certainly be market panic the us dollar along with sentiment linked currencies like the australian and new zealand dollars would likely drop alongside equities and growth geared commodities the sudden influx of us treasuries would depress bond prices and cause a dramatic spike in yields since the two typically move inversely to each other leading to a surge in borrowing costs for the us government yields on treasuries are where almost all other borrowing costs are benchmarked these include business and consumer credit corporate bonds mortgages etc the higher yield on us bonds would thus lift rates on a slew of interest bearing debts making them more expensive to service and reducing the overall rate of borrowing a slowdown in investment and economic growth would follow leaving the central bank to clean up the mess however it is not as if china would emerge unscathed in this scenario approximately 20 percent of chinese exports head to the us making it the country s largest customer if demand there plummets china s growth would be hurt as well furthermore the destabilizing effect would impair risk sentiment by way of the shockwave it would send throughout developed and emerging market economies the cost of commodities which are primarily priced in us dollars would soar due to a weaker greenback as a major importer of raw materials china would see its cost structure skyrocket this would undermine china s own economic prospects and may cause diplomatic relations with key allies to suffer a weaker us dollar might alleviate sovereign borrowers that have their debt denominated inusd however the benefits to be had from this relative to the costs incurred by global markets would be almost inconsequential in the us purchasing power would be radically reduced limiting domestic consumption the driver of growth in the largest economy in the world how might the fed be able to alleviate the crisis the fed could cut rates though by this point they may be limited in their ability to do so this might weigh on the dollar to some extent though by this stage in the trade war it is likely to be under severe strain already the result could then be a form of stagnation where inflation and unemployment both remain high much like theoilshock crisis in 1979 in this environment the central bank will probably struggle to craft effective policy that doesn t undermine its own objectives at least to some extent the longer term consequence of large scale chinese divestment from treasuries is that it would undermine confidence in the us dollar and provide policymakers with the impetus to find an alternative reserve currency the probability that beijing will pull such a maneuver seems low because it would essentially be pulling the rug from under itself by destabilizing the largest economy in the world and a key trading partner undermining its own performance in this regard the decision by china to dump all its holdings of us treasuries would be both its honey and hemlock the sweet taste of exerting such power would be swiftly replaced by the poison of the blowback to that end it seems chinese officials might do well to take a page from confucius before you

executives accounted for about two thirds of the surveys though the middle east the australia pacific region africa and the caribbean were also represented typical investment horizons were 12 months or more which is as expected since more funds are looking for longer term rois and are choosing projects that by their very nature require an extended time commitment this is particularly the case in developing nations and in infrastructure related projects which are finding favor swfi did not include 3rd party asset managers in the survey in order to provide the highest level of accuracy and value for our members the most crowded trades were long the u s dollar and long u s equities according to pundits shorting the pound sterling being long u s tech stocks and investing in private assets

shortages in rare earth metals which are used in multiple applications including technologies with the increased spending on infrastructure materials such as timber gravel and steel will be in demand paradoxically while material stocks such as vulcan materials have soared others such as u s steel have floundered for this fears of a supply glut steelmagedon and a credit analyst downgrade are partly to blame half of survey participants were concerned about geopolitical risk this includes a myriad of potential pitfalls including trade disputes wars and unsavory factions rising to power

metals which are used in multiple applications including technologies swfi s june survey laid out a mix of preferences from pensions and sovereign wealth funds as they relate to corporate cash flow 37 5 would like to see increased capital spending another 37 5 wants improved balance sheets the repaying of debts and pension plan solvency the remaining 30 would rather see the value returned to them in the form of buybacks dividends or cash acquisitions dividend increases tend to occur slowly but returning a large amount of cash to shareholders has also proven successful investors may recall that costco had a novel approach to returning income to shareholders in 2012 paying a special us 3 billion dividend to shareholders ahead of upcoming tax policy changes although the majority of the special payouts is transferred to owners executives and major shareholders it still spells lots of cash as reuters put it at the time for other investors the return of interest in a steady stream or even a torrential rain of income returns is the foundation for investing over the long term yet over the last few years capital appreciation has been substantial enough to make speculating even in broad index funds a more profitable strategy only 19 of investors expect to see earnings rise by 10 or more in the next year a full 81 do not expect such growth by comparison in june of 2018 beliefs were split on the question 50 50 this would lead us to believe that the economy is indeed slowing large institutions are planning for it but this is not to say that drivers of equity prices are not present

circulation and u s fiscal policy budged the needle about 6 each a year ago trade war talk u s fiscal policy errors and a possible stock market bubble loomed much heavier in managers minds making up a combined 58 of the pool for suspected tail risk the overall picture is one of caution and even a new paradigm u s equities are no longer attractive to the majority of managers real estate infrastructure and materials investments indicate that world capital is increasingly shifting to developing markets this has been an ongoing trend latin america including brazil is seeing large capital inflows africa has not yet seen such a drastic pickup in investment activity though a continuous albeit relatively modest stream of capital is flowing in and setting the stage for additional opportunities on the continent the u s faces a year of slow growth unexciting prospects and unenthusiastic investment on the part of global funds the u s dollar may give the markets a boost should it

new york cnn business the us dollar s share of global reserves is falling while the euro and chinese yuan are becoming more popular is the dollar s reign coming to an end not so fast although the united states trade policies are part of the reason central banks around the globe looking to diversify their currency holdings the dollar remains the world s reserve currency for a reason everyone trades it the american economy is strong and it is backed by the full faith and credit of the the us treasury last year the dollar s share of global reserves dropped to below 62 according to a report by the european central bank reviewing the international role of currencies and the euro that s the lowest level since the start of the economic and monetary union which was in 1992 the dollar s share is now more than seven percentage points lower than it was before the financial crisis but the total amount of dollars held in the world actually went up last year there have been some movements in reserves but dollar holdings have never been larger because total reserves in the world have grown said marc chandler chief market strategist at bannockburn global forex central banks and similar institutions hold dollars often in form of us treasuries as backup funds in case of a crisis event and also to facilitate international payments other currencies like the euro and more recently the chinese yuan are used to diversify so not all central bank eggs are in one dollar denominated basket the share of yuan reserves reached almost 2 last year nearly double compared with early 2017 the euro is the second most popular reserve with a global share just under 21 notwithstanding today s drop in the currency after ecb president mario draghi hinted at a path for more monetary stimulus in for the eurozone politics are likely playing are role in these movements with ongoing trade spats between the united states and its partners losing market share both politics and market volatility can be blamed for the dollar s loss of market share last year some central banks actively diversified their reserves to move away from the dominant dollar because of actions by the united states one example is russia one of the world s largest reserve holders which sold about 100 billion worth of us dollar denominated reserves in the wake of new rounds of us sanctions and purchased almost 90 billion worth of euro denominated and renminbi denominated assets in the second quarter of 2018 the ecb report said china also reduced its us treasury holdings to the tune of about 60 billion over the course of last year amid the escalating trade war according to the report but one fundamental problem for central banks is choosing an alternative to the greenback that is similar in liquidity and market depth said neil mellor chief currency strategist at bny mellon that is to say while it s a fine concept to want to diversify from us holdings to a smaller country s government bonds that market might not be sophisticated or large enough to make sense for this kind of investment another reason the dollar s share got knocked last year is that emerging markets such as turkey and argentina sold a lot of their foreign reserves to stabilize their own currencies as the federal reserve was raising interest rates at the time the dollar strengthened which caused pain for emerging markets many of which have dollar denominated debt between march and september 2018 emerging markets central banks sold some 200 billion in foreign exchange reserves according to the ecb report the dollar s share of global reserves might well continue to decline going forward even as overall reserves increase but so far it doesn t look like the dollar will lose its status as no 1 anytime soon it s too early to tell if this is the beginning of the end of the dollar as the king reserve currency said chandler the bannockburn market strategist if the dollar share is going down because people have lost confidence due to repeated recessions and financial crisis that s one thing but if it is about straight diversification that is not in and of itself a bad thing

corporate profits would be taxed and the distributed profits paid out to shareholders would also attract a tax the introduction of franking credits ended the process of double taxation making it more

twenty years of the ecb s monetary policy speech by mario draghi president of the ecb ecb forum on central banking sintra 18 june 2019 central banks were often established in the past with the aim of bringing stability in the aftermath of historic episodes the bank of england was established during the sovereign debt crisis of 1690 when the government was unable to obtain funding in the market the federal reserve was created after a series of panics that had rocked the us banking system in the late 19th and early 20th century the euro was introduced 20 years ago in response to repeated episodes of exchange rate instability and the need to secure the single market against competitive devaluations the ecb was established as the keystone of the new economic and monetary union emu the first decade of the monetary union was characterised by calm macroeconomic conditions with limited volatility and steady economic growth the second decade however has seen profound shifts in the prevailing environment including both financial and sovereign debt crises and our monetary policy strategy has had to adapt with it i would like to discuss this morning why this evolution came about and how it was achieved and what the past twenty years can tell us about the ecb s monetary policy in the future monetary policy before the crisis the ecb s mandate is given by the treaty as price stability in 1998 the governing council defined price stability as inflation within a range of 0 2 over the medium term which constitutes the ecb s objective then in 2003 the governing council clarified that within this range it would aim at a focal point of below but close to 2 which remains our medium term aim to this day this was a formulation that differed from the standard inflation targeting framework of the time which was typically based around a point target for inflation but there were sound reasons why this definition was put in place in common with central banks across the world the ecb faced a macroeconomic environment before the crisis that was predominantly defined by low volatility and moderate shocks with the distribution of shocks to inflation almost exclusively to the upside in the euro area hicp energy prices rose by 80 between january 1999 and september 2008 under these conditions establishing a strong reaction function against high inflation was seen as crucial to anchor inflation expectations emphasising an aim of below but close to 2 was seen to imply a stronger commitment than a standard inflation targeting regime but monetary policy in the euro area also faced a special challenge the ecb was a new central bank operating in a very heterogeneous monetary union which created a particular imperative to establish inflation credibility establishing a commitment to controlling inflation was seen as critical to cement lower inflation expectations across the euro area especially as moderate inflation was a relatively new phenomenon in several member states over the two decades up to 1999 inflation had averaged above 3 in 10 of the 12 original members the decline in inflation in many countries in the run up to emu was in large part due to expectations of joining as well as to a number of extraordinary actions taken by national authorities to meet the convergence criteria from 1989 99 long term inflation expectations had fallen from a range of between 2 5 4 5 in the four largest euro area economies to below 2 across the board it was now the task of the new central bank to lock in this moderate inflation environment and it did so successfully over the next decade inflation expectations internalised the ecb s commitment to keep inflation down and remained below 2 but this process of building inflation credibility had implications for the ecb s reaction function as a matter of accounting stabilising headline inflation largely caused by its volatile components must mean that core inflation adjusts downwards rolling cross correlations between energy inflation and core inflation show that an episode of high energy inflation between 1999 and 2007 was accompanied by a period of rapidly softening core inflation as a result between january 1999 and september 2008 headline inflation in the euro area averaged 2 35 while core inflation averaged 1 7 and exceeded 2 less than 15 of the time central banks in other advanced economies faced similar challenges and adopted similar strategies but differences in mandates and length of track records in fighting inflation led to differences in how much energy price pass through to headline inflation others were comfortable accommodating for example energy prices in the us cpi rose by 160 over the same period and headline inflation averaged 2 9 the federal reserve reacted less to headline inflation and core cpi inflation averaged 2 2 the upshot was that the euro area entered the crisis having succeeded in establishing its anti inflation credentials but with underlying inflation dynamics that were perhaps relatively weaker this was not immediately apparent as inflation stayed at fairly elevated levels for more than four years after the lehman crash monetary policy responded decisively to the global financial crisis and disinflationary threats seemed to pass quickly but in hindsight it seems reasonable to conclude that the inflation process was vulnerable to a shift in the environment which is what transpired from around mid 2012 onwards new challenges for monetary policy at this point headline inflation in the euro area began what was in retrospect a prolonged downward drift and core inflation fell by almost a percentage point from mid 2012 to early 2014 there are two factors that help explain the switch to a disinflationary trend first the distribution of shocks to inflation moved strongly to the downside and the amplitude of the shocks increased supply side shocks gradually dissipated over the years following the lehman crash and the sovereign debt crisis negative demand shocks driven at different times by domestic demand and external demand instead became the dominant source of macroeconomic fluctuations in the euro area ecb analysis shows that negative demand shocks have weighed on euro area inflation by more than 1 percentage point on average since the start of the crisis in the previous ten years their effect was neutral overall with periods of both upward and downward pressure the second factor was a change in the macroeconomic policy mix while in the first phase of the crisis fiscal and monetary policy had eased in tandem with fiscal policy loosening by a total of about 3 of potential gdp between 2008 and 2010 thereafter the stance of monetary and fiscal policy decoupled the euro area fiscal stance turned contractionary in response to the sovereign debt crisis tightening by around 4 percentage points of potential gdp until 2013 years the euro area was mostly in recession this stands in contrast to the united states where fiscal policy eased more in the initial phase of the crisis by about 6 5 of potential gdp in total over 2008 09 and then tightened by about 5 5 of potential gdp from 2011 to 2013 when the economic recovery was underway the euro area was forced onto a different path by the need in some countries to re establish fiscal credibility but on aggregate the euro area did not have less fiscal space than the united states public debt levels were similar in the two jurisdictions the key difference was that fiscal stabilisation in the united states took place at the federal level while the euro area lacked a central fiscal instrument to act counter cyclically the policy mix is also relevant when it comes to financial sector policies after the crisis it was inevitable that banking sectors in advanced economies would have to deleverage both to cover losses and to re focus their business models the united states ensured that this process happened quickly and early around 500 failing banks were resolved by the federal deposit insurance corporation while struggling banks were stress tested and recapitalised through the troubled assets relief program between 2008 and 2011 us banks improved their leverage ratio by 1 6 percentage points from 7 2 to 8 8 the response in the euro area was more sluggish despite being more levered than their us peers before the crisis euro area banks improved their leverage ratio by just 0 9 percentage points from 3 7 to 4 6 and this was achieved more through shedding assets and less through raising capital this in part reflected the fact that due to the fiscal rules public support for banks was concentrated in countries with fiscal space moreover without a common resolution framework only around 50 banks were resolved in the euro area in this period so a weak banking sector continued to drag on the euro area economy which was especially pernicious given the importance of the banking lending channel for financing in sum the ecb faced an environment where there was both an increasing need to counter demand shocks and an increasing burden on monetary policy to do so our strategy therefore had to adapt to these new circumstances in order to continue delivering our aim monetary policy responded first in the summer of 2012 by acting to defuse the sovereign debt crisis which had evolved from a tail risk for inflation into a material threat to price stability announcing outright monetary transactions omt established our commitment to counter unwarranted redenomination risks in sovereign debt markets and acted as a powerful circuit breaker while omt was never activated the effect of its announcement was equivalent to that of a large scale asset purchase programme spreads in vulnerable countries fell on average by more than 400 basis points over the next two years the macroeconomic impact of omt was also analogous to other purchase programmes ecb research finds that the gdp and price effects of omt were broadly in line with those estimated for the qe that took place in the united states and the united kingdom but the lingering effects of the sovereign debt crisis dented the capacity of this stimulus to counter the new disinflationary trend the delayed bank deleveraging process in the euro area began to accelerate with banks further shrinking their balance sheets and paying back central bank loans bank balance sheets declined by around 20 percentage points of gdp in 2013 alone and at the end of 2013 credit growth to the private sector was contracting at a rate of 2 4 relative to a year earlier on the demand side risk appetite in the private sector collapsed with investment subtracting 1 6 percentage points from gdp growth in 2012 the ecb therefore reacted again in 2013 by cutting its main refinancing rate twice from 0 75 to 0 25 and by seizing the opportunity of the launch of european banking supervision we carried out a comprehensive assessment of bank balance sheets with the aim of steering the process of balance sheet repair towards a positive macroeconomic outcome banks strengthened their balance sheets by over 200 billion in advance of the outcome that put the banking sector in a much stronger position to transmit our policy but at this point the euro area economy was hit by a further downward shock to inflation in the form of a 60 collapse in oil prices in mid 2014 which pushed inflation into negative territory with underlying inflation already weakening inflation expectations began to be affected as the scope for further interest rate cuts was now limited it became increasingly clear that our reaction function needed to evolve to address these new challenges indeed since our policy framework had never been systematically tested by persistent disinflationary risks the ecb had not yet had a chance to demonstrate its intolerance for inflation remaining below its aim for protracted periods of time at the same time there appeared to be some uncertainty about which tools we would be able to deploy if the effective lower bound were reached unlike in other major economies the ecb had not resorted to large scale asset purchases during the global financial crisis and its aftermath some even questioned the legality of asset purchases in europe and their effectiveness in our bank based economy if these uncertainties were not removed there was a material risk that falling inflation could become self fulfilling the public could begin expecting a smaller monetary policy response to future inflation undershoots and revise their inflation expectations further downwards in other words credibility now relied not just on perceptions of the ecb s commitment to our aim but also on perceptions of our capability to fight low inflation we responded to the situation in three main ways the ecb s policy response the first was by clarifying the symmetry of our aim while the quantitative definition of price stability was instrumental in establishing credibility in the first decade its asymmetric formulation may have led to misperceptions in a low inflation environment thus we made clear that our policy aim was fully symmetric and it was symmetric around the level that we had established in 2003 below but close to 2 it is achieving this aim over the medium term that steers our policy decisions in addition we clarified that symmetry meant not only that we would not accept persistently low inflation but also that there was no cap on inflation at 2 as i emphasised on a number of occasions our medium term orientation implies that inflation can deviate from our aim in both directions so long as the path of inflation converges back towards that focal point over the medium term policy horizon the second part of our response was to lay out the tools we would use to counteract downside inflation risks which began with a speech i gave in amsterdam in april 2014 that described three contingencies and the instruments we would use to react to them this established unambiguously that we had no taboos about resorting to unconventional measures there was nothing institutionally or legally special about the euro area that prohibited monetary policy from adding accommodation once the lower bound was approached third as these various contingencies played out we operationalised our reaction function by launching a series of new instruments we broke through the zero bound by lowering our deposit rate into negative territory launched our targeted longer term refinancing operations tltros to provide incentives for banks to lend and implemented a large scale asset purchase programme app of public and private securities these measures were deliberately designed to work as a package and ease the stance through complementary channels working both through banks and the wider matrix of capital markets the negative rate policy challenged market expectations that when rates reached zero they could only go up and not down which helped skew the distribution of rate expectations and depress the short end of the risk free curve a key benchmark for the pricing of bank loans asset purchases in tandem compressed yields at the longer end of the curve pushing down mortgage rates and at the same time making bank lending to firms more attractive in risk adjusted terms and bank based transmission was amplified by the tltros which lowered funding costs and increased competition among banks over time we also enhanced this framework with state and date based forward guidance allowing us to rotate the marginal tool for determining the policy stance from asset purchases to forward guidance as the economic outlook improved today this forward guidance links our expectations on the path of future rates to the path of inflation towards our aim leading to automatic easing if the convergence path towards 2 is delayed there is mounting evidence that these instruments have been effective negative rates have proven to be a very important tool in the euro area and more so than they would have been in an economy like the united states indeed the federal reserve eschewed negative rates in part due to concerns about their effects on the money market industry which are key intermediaries in the us financial system but this factor is less relevant in the euro area since many money market funds have been operating as variable net asset value funds and therefore are more flexible to extend duration to seek additional returns furthermore the euro area is a relatively open economy for its size with total trade making up 51 of gdp compared with 27 in the united states this means that the impact of negative rates on inflation and financing conditions via the exchange rate is more powerful in short faced with a new environment of downside risks and limited conventional policy space the ecb showed that it had no shortage of tools available to respond unconventional measures proved suitable substitutes for conventional ones using market prices to construct a so called shadow short rate the stimulus provided appears broadly in line with the recommendation of monetary policy rules as suggested by recent academic research our capacity to react in this way was made possible by the flexibility embedded in our mandate a flexibility that was confirmed by the recent ruling of the european court of justice this not only affirmed that asset purchases are a legal instrument of monetary policy in the euro area but emphasised the broad discretion of the ecb in using all our tools in a necessary and proportionate way to achieve our objective however although we have seen the successful transmission of monetary policy to financing conditions and from financing conditions to gdp and employment the final legs of the transmission process to wages and inflation have been slower than we expected wage growth is now strengthening as slack in the labour market diminishes but the pass through from wages to prices remains weak this may reflect structural changes such as globalisation and digitalisation which mostly have an impact at this point in the pricing chain lingering cyclical weakness can also delay wage price pass through as firms elect to squeeze margins rather than raise prices and risk losing market share current challenges for monetary policy in this environment what matters is that monetary policy remains committed to its objective and does not resign itself to too low inflation and as i emphasised at our last monetary policy meeting we are committed and are not resigned to having a low rate of inflation forever or even for now we have described the overall orientation of our monetary policy as being patient persistent and prudent patient because faced with repeated negative shocks we have had to extend the policy horizon persistent because monetary policy will remain sufficiently accommodative to ensure the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim and prudent because we will pay close attention to underlying inflation dynamics and to risks and will adjust policy appropriately this orientation is expressed in our current policy framework which allows us to adapt our forward guidance and react flexibly as the macroeconomic situation evolves that was illustrated by the monetary policy decisions taken at our meeting earlier in june looking forward the risk outlook remains tilted to the downside and indicators for the coming quarters point to lingering softness the risks that have been prominent throughout the past year in particular geopolitical factors the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets have not dissipated the prolongation of risks has weighed on exports and in particular on manufacturing in the absence of improvement such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened additional stimulus will be required in our recent deliberations the members of the governing council expressed their conviction in pursuing our aim of inflation close to 2 in a symmetric fashion just as our policy framework has evolved in the past to counter new challenges so it can again in the coming weeks the governing council will deliberate how our instruments can be adapted commensurate to the severity of the risk to price stability we remain able to enhance our forward guidance by adjusting its bias and its conditionality to account for variations in the adjustment path of inflation this applies to all instruments of our monetary policy stance further cuts in policy interest rates and mitigating measures to contain any side effects remain part of our tools and the app still has considerable headroom moreover the treaty requires that our actions are both necessary and proportionate to fulfil our mandate and achieve our objective which implies that the limits we establish on our tools are specific to the contingencies we face if the crisis has shown anything it is that we will use all the flexibility within our mandate to fulfil our mandate and we will do so again to answer any challenges to price stability in the future all these options were raised and discussed at our last meeting what matters for our policy calibration is our medium term policy aim an inflation rate below but close to 2 that aim is symmetric which means that if we are to deliver that value of inflation in the medium term inflation has to be above that level at some time in the future but fiscal policy should play its role over the last 10 years the burden of macroeconomic adjustment has fallen disproportionately on monetary policy we have even seen instances where fiscal policy has been pro cyclical and countered the monetary stimulus if the unbalanced macroeconomic policy mix in the euro area in part explains the slide into disinflation so a better policy mix can help bring it to a close monetary policy can always achieve its objective alone but especially in europe where public sectors are large it can do so faster and with fewer side effects if fiscal policies are aligned with it recreating fiscal space by raising potential output through reforms and public investment and respecting the european fiscal framework will maintain investor confidence in countries with high public debt low growth and low fiscal space but as fiscal expansion in the other countries may have limited spillovers national fiscal policies remain constrained so work on a common fiscal stabilisation instrument of adequate size and design should proceed with broader scope and renewed determination conclusion let me conclude the euro was introduced twenty years ago in order to insulate the single market from exchange rate crises and competitive devaluations that would threaten the sustainability of open markets it was also a political project that relying on the success of the single market would lead to the greater integration of its member states on both counts the vision of our forefathers has scored relatively well imagine where the single market would be today after the global financial crisis and rising protectionism had all countries in europe been free to adjust their exchange rates instead our economies integrated converged and coped with the most severe challenge since the great depression that leads me to four observations first the integration of our economies and with it the convergence of our member states has also greatly increased misalignments of real effective exchange rates between euro area countries are about a half those between advanced economies with flexible exchange rates or countries linked by pegged exchange rates and they have fallen by around 20 in the second decade of emu relative to the first second the dispersion of growth rates across euro area countries having fallen considerably since 1999 is since 2014 comparable to the dispersion across us states third this has been driven in large part by the deepening of european value chains with emu countries now significantly more integrated with each other than the united states or china are with the rest of the world most emu countries export more with each other than with the us china or russia fourth employment in the euro area has reached record highs and in all euro area countries but one stands above its 1999 level but the remaining institutional weaknesses of our monetary union cannot be ignored at the cost of seriously damaging what has been achieved logic would suggest that the more integrated our economies become the faster should be the completion of banking union and capital markets union and the faster the transition from a rules based system for fiscal policies to an institution based fiscal capacity the journey towards greater integration that our citizens and firms started twenty years ago has been long far from finished and with broad but uneven success but overall it has strengthened the conviction of our peoples that it is only through more europe that the implications of this integration can be managed for some that trust may lie in a genuine faith in our common destiny for others it comes from the appreciation of the greater prosperity so far achieved for yet others that trust may be forced by the increased and unavoidable closeness of our countries be that as it may that trust it is now the bedrock upon which our leaders can and will build the next steps of our emu
big government is expensive it is so expensive in fact that no matter how much you soak them even the rich cannot afford it progressives in the united states hold out europe as a model for caring governance they talk a lot about the benefits of universal health care subsidized college mandatory leave and other generous government initiatives they rarely mention the costs and never discuss who will pay for these proposals turns out it is not just the rich who pay the freight for the welfare state across europe even below average income earners are heavily taxed to pay for big government when european workers start earning more than just two thirds of the average wage about half of every dollar they earn above that amount is taken away by the government according to the organisation for economic cooperation and development they also pay an additional 20 percent value added tax in the united states that same taxpayer pays a 32 percent marginal wage tax and a 6 percent sales tax it may not feel like it but compared to the european welfare nations the united states is a low tax country and that is a good thing it means that americans get to keep more money they earn to spend as they wish but that gladsome state may not actually last if congress fails to curb federal spending it will ultimately have to raise taxes on low income and middle income americans taxes on the rich will not cover the cost of existing programs much less pay trillions of dollars for new programs from the green new deal to medicare for all touted by politicians on the far left in the most optimistic scenario the revenue raisers trumpeted by these progressives which are a wealth tax a financial transaction tax and an extreme 70 percent top income tax rate would bring only an additional 300 billion each year into treasury coffers that is about a third of the current budget deficit 15 percent of the likely budget deficit in 10 years and just 6 percent of the new federal spending called for by prominent progressives the everyday rhetoric about raising taxes on the rich is only half the political story income tax history shows that while it starts with narrow taxes on the rich it soon leads to broad taxes on everyone else as tax historian joseph thorndike notes high marginal income tax rates in the new deal era were used to help justify regressive consumption taxes on alcohol and tobacco those regressive consumption taxes funded up to half the federal government in the 1930s in the 1940s top income tax rates hit 94 percent but they were paired with dramatic tax increases on the middle class the high tax rates for the wealthy gave political cover for congress to shrink the lowest tax bracket cutting the threshold for paying a higher rate in half meanwhile those remaining in the lowest tax bracket saw their rates rise from less than 5 percent in 1940 to 23 percent by 1944 average tax rates for the bottom 90 percent of income earners increased from 0 percent to more than 6 percent during the same period of time europe already imposes high taxes on below average income workers in france single workers earning two thirds of the average wage hand over 43 percent of their potential income to their government the tax rate on additional income they earn known as their marginal tax is 70 percent things are no better in germany where below average income workers pay an average wage tax of 45 percent and a marginal tax of 56 percent the trend is clear big governments tend to tax lower income workers at higher rates if american fiscal policy continues to follow in the footsteps of europe such higher taxes will invariably follow those higher taxes have significant economic costs reducing opportunity and prosperity for all workers one reason europeans work less and are less entrepreneurial than americans is because if they work any harder or put in longer hours they would get to keep only half of those extra earnings which then get taken away again by a 20 percent value added tax when they spend it americans still have a choice by not adding any new spending programs and reforming the largest drivers of future deficits which are medicare medicaid obamacare and social security it will be possible to balance the budget and begin paying down the debt the heritage foundation blueprint for balance presents a roadmap for fiscal responsibility that would balance the budget in 10 years or less without raising taxes the progressive roadmap would take us on a different path that begins with sharply higher taxes on the rich and ends with heavy taxes on everyone adam michel is a senior policy analyst focused on tax policy issues with the grover hermann center for the federal budget of the heritage foundation
menafn jordan times new york last summer my colleague brunello rosa and i identified 10 potential downside risks that could trigger a us and global recession in 2020 nine of them are still in play today many involve the united states trade wars with china and other countries along with restrictions on migration foreign direct investment and technology transfers could have profound implications for global supply chains raising the threat of stagflation slowing growth alongside rising inflation and the risk of a us growth slowdown has become more acute now that the stimulus from the 2017 tax legislation has run its course meanwhile us equity markets have remained frothy since our initial commentary and there are added risks associated with the rise of newer forms of debt including in many emerging markets where much borrowing is denominated in foreign currencies with central banks ability to serve as lenders of last resort increasingly constrained illiquid financial markets are vulnerable to flash crashes and other disruptions one such disruption could come from us president donald trump who may be tempted to create a foreign policy crisis wag the dog with a country like iran that might bolster his domestic poll numbers but it could also trigger an oil shock beyond the us the fragility of growth in debt ridden china and some other emerging markets remains a concern as do economic policy financial and political risks in europe worse across the advanced economies the policy toolbox for responding to a crisis remains limited the monetary and fiscal interventions and private sector backstops used after the 2008 financial crisis simply cannot be deployed to the same effect today the tenth factor that we considered was the us federal reserve s fed interest rate policy after hiking rates in response to the trump administration s pro cyclical fiscal stimulus the fed reversed course in january looking ahead the fed and other major central banks are more likely to cut rates to manage various shocks to the global economy while trade wars and potential oil spikes constitute a supply side risk they also threaten aggregate demand and thus consumption growth because tariffs and higher fuel prices reduce disposable income with so much uncertainty companies will likely opt to reduce capital spending and investment under these conditions a severe enough shock could usher in a global recession even if central banks respond rapidly after all in 2007 2009 the fed and other central banks reacted aggressively to the shocks that triggered the global financial crisis but they did not avert the great recession today the fed is starting with a benchmark policy rate of 2 25 2 5 per cent compared with 5 25 per cent in september 2007 in europe and japan central banks are already in negative rate territory and will face limits on how much further below the zero bound they can go and with bloated balance sheets from successive rounds of quantitative easing central banks would face similar constraints if they were to return to large scale asset purchases on the fiscal side most advanced economies have even higher deficits and more public debt today than before the global financial crisis leaving little room for stimulus spending and as rosa and i argued last year financial sector bailouts will be intolerable in countries with resurgent populist movements and near insolvent governments among the risks that could trigger a recession in 2020 the sino american trade and technology war deserves special attention the conflict could escalate further in several ways the trump administration could decide to extend tariffs to the 300 billion worth of chinese exports not yet affected or prohibiting huawei and other chinese firms from using us components could trigger a full scale process of de globalisation as companies scramble to secure their supply chains were that to happen china would have several options for retaliating against the us such as by closing its market to us multinationals like apple under such a scenario the shock to markets around the world would be sufficient to bring on a global crisis regardless of what the major central banks do with the current tensions already denting business consumer and investor confidence and slowing global growth further escalation would tip the world into a recession and given the scale of private and public debt another financial crisis would likely follow from that both trump and chinese president xi jinping know that it is in their countries interest to avoid a global crisis so they have an incentive to find a compromise in the next few months yet both sides are still ratcheting up nationalist rhetoric and pursuing tit for tat measures trump and xi each seem to think that his country s long term economic and national security may depend on his not blinking in the face of a new cold war and if they each genuinely believe the other will blink first the risk of a ruinous clash is high indeed it is possible that trump and xi will meet for talks during the g 20 summit on june 28 29 in osaka but even if they do agree to restart negotiations a comprehensive deal to settle their many points of contention would be a long way off as the two sides drift further apart the space for compromise is shrinking and the risk of a global recession and crisis in an already fragile global economy is rising nouriel roubini a professor at nyu s stern school of business and ceo of roubini macro associates was senior economist for international affairs in the white house s council of economic advisers during the clinton administration he has worked for the international monetary fund the us federal reserve and the world bank
two weeks ago russia and china took a major step away from the use of the american dollar in agreeing to develop bilateral trade using the russian rouble and the chinese yuan russia and china intend to develop the practice of settlements in national currencies said president vladimir putin after meeting president xi jinping in st petersburg he added that both countries had signed agreements to expand the use of their currencies in bilateral financial operations this move is long awaited and makes perfect sense given the growing economic ties between moscow and beijing and attempts by the united states to exploit the special position of its currency to force other countries to do its bidding china russia bilateral trade reached us 24 2 billion in the first quarter of 2019 according to chinese customs up almost 30 per cent over the corresponding period last year china has become russia s largest trade partner with about 14 per cent of payments in yuan and 7 8 per cent in rouble there are plans to reach us 200 billion in mutual trade by 2020 sign a local currencies settlement agreement later this year and extend the use of the national credit card systems union pay and mir in both countries members of the eurasian economic union and other emerging economies have also declared their readiness to avoid using the us dollar and to increase settlements in local currencies in may last year china and the eurasian economic union signed a trade and economic agreement as a base to reduce dollar dominance in trade and as an important milestone in realising the linking of the union to the belt and road initiative china s massive infrastructure project china is the world s largest importer and second largest consumer of crude oil last year it launched a yuan denominated crude oil futures contract on the shanghai stock exchange the so called petroyuan amid a growing willingness from iran russia saudi arabia and venezuela to settle oil payments in yuan and other non dollar currencies despite the risk of currency fluctuations and the concerns of traders the petroyuan is a necessary step in creating a potential rival to dollar denominated benchmark oil prices west texas intermediate and brent crude and reducing the dollar dominance in the commodities trade given the ongoing trade war with the us its tariffs on chinese goods and western sanctions on russia iran and other chinese trade partners it is to china s benefit to promote de dollarisation and push the internationalisation of the yuan to reduce the negative effects of possible further actions from washington us trade sanctions have also encouraged alternatives to the dollar denominated payment system swift or society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunications european leaders have signed an agreement to develop an alternative to swift iran has joined china s cips or cross border interbank payment system and russia is promoting its system for transfer of financial messages there are also international institutions holding yuan reserves that receive heavy financial backing from china such as the asian infrastructure investment bank brics fund and russia china investment bank meanwhile china s outward direct investments in its belt and road projects alone reached us 15 6 billion last year in new economic sectors such as fintech there are also many opportunities to cooperate using electronic payments delinked from the us dollar this is especially relevant given the uncertainties surrounding chinese tech companies in the us and europe asian investors are also looking at other potentially lucrative markets such as in southeast asia and central asia and are seizing the opportunity to establish a foothold in the russian market especially in the fintech sector as noted at the asian financial forum in hong kong earlier this year this year russia has plans to issue federal bonds denominated in yuan for the first time with as much as us 1 billion worth of notes trading on the moscow exchange the combination of borrower reliability and high yields could attract a lot of attention and deepen the sino russian financial cooperation in dethroning the dollar source scmp
2019 bloomberg finance lp speaking truth to power is nice i guess but speaking truth while in power is exquisite mahathir mohammad prime minister of malaysia recently proposed a pan asian currency based on gold using the very public forum of the international conference on the future of asia in tokyo for this opportunity mahathir certainly ranks among asia s great leaders having well earned his position among the pantheon of superstars including singapore s lee kuan yew china s deng xiaoping and japan s ikeda hayato during his earlier term as prime minister of malaysia in 1981 2003 yes it was 22 years malaysia rose from an economy of subsistence rice agriculture rubber and palm oil plantations and tin mining to an industrial manufacturing center with a prosperous and modern middle class malaysians apparently know a good thing when they see it so again in 2018 they raised the 93 year old mahathir to the country s top job mahathir proposed that this gold based currency would serve as an alternative currency throughout asia used in international trade and investment perhaps in much the same way as the dollar serves as an alternative currency today alongside independent local currencies at the moment we have to depend upon the u s dollar but the u s dollar is also not stable so the currency that we propose should be based on gold because gold is much more stable he said at the conference mahathir s proposal has many similarities to proposals that he has made at least as far back as the asia crisis of 1997 1998 when many asian currencies collapsed then and continuing at least through 2007 mahathir proposed a gold dinar again for international use among islamic countries in asia this includes malaysia and indonesia along with many countries of the middle east the islamic countries have a very long history of a gold dinar a gold coin containing 4 5 grams of gold the dinar and its precursor the byzantine solidus was the basic currency of the islamic caliphates from the seventh century through the thirteenth century and the tradition carried on after that as well muammar gaddafi of libya also made similar comments in favor of a common gold standard policy for islamic north africa and africa as a whole some people think that the perceived threat of this plan to the hegemony of the floating fiat u s dollar was one motivation for the invasion of libya by u s led nato forces in 2011 which cemented gaddafi s downfall mahathir noted that in asia the idea of adopting another country s currency such as the yuan or yen is not popular due to fears of a loss of sovereignty thus the idea of an international currency is apparently to defuse such fears however in time if the project is popular local currencies could also follow the policy of linking to gold which would thus bring all of asia under a common currency standard this solution would also maintain domestic currency sovereignty without the need for centralized institutions like the european central bank and all the supranational superstructure that has accompanied it which britain and possibly italy are now trying to escape this is nothing new for asia asia actually has a long history of floating fiat currencies china had four centuries of experience with paper currencies in the 11th through 15th centuries it was so traumatic that china returned to a policy of silver gold and copper coins alone which continued until the 1930s many other asian countries copied the chinese paper currency model with similar results floating fiat paper currencies emerged in vietnam korea and japan long before they were ever seen in the west while the mongol paper currency of china s yuan dynasty was also apparently used in java indonesia and points west up to the borders of europe their history was not very good again and again asians returned to gold silver and copper coins until the 1870s silver and gold were largely interchangeable as currencies so a silver currency and a gold currency were almost identical beginning in the sixteenth century the spanish silver dollar served as a common international currency throughout asia by some estimates more than half of all the silver mined by the spanish in the new world ended up in asia in the form of these silver dollars much of it directly exported from acapulco on the pacific side of mexico the chinese called these spanish silver dollars yuan or round object to distinguish from their domestic copper coins known as wen the chinese term was eventually became won in korea and yen in japan the spanish silver dollar served as the original basis of those currencies just as it served as the original basis of the u s dollar philippine peso hong kong dollar and singapore dollar these circulated alongside gold coins such as the japanese ryo and gold ingots known in china as sycees after 1870 silver s long and close relationship with gold broke down and silver no longer served as an effective basis of money alongside gold asia began transitioning toward gold following europe and the u s the bank of japan formally went to a monometallic gold standard in 1897 the philippines went to gold in 1903 with u s guidance korea adopted the gold standard in 1901 china did so in the 1930s although this was immediately followed by a period of fiat currency debasement to fight the war with japan that began in 1937 after a catastrophic bout of hyperinflation in the late 1940s the chinese yuan was again linked to gold in 1950 and this gold basis continued unchanged throughout the 1950s and 1960s in malaysia then the malay states of the british empire the straits settlements singapore dollar was linked to gold in 1906 during the 1950s and 1960s malaysia s currency was linked to gold within the bretton woods gold standard system this gold link was severed in 1971 along with many other countries around the world as the bretton woods system disintegrated the idea of domestic macroeconomic manipulation via the use of floating fiat currencies is not as popular in asia as it has been in the u s and britain asians hew to the notion that a currency should be as stable reliable and unchanging as possible in recent decades this has more commonly taken the form of a u s dollar peg ideally everyone can share the same currency standard even if they maintain domestic currency sovereignty so that everyone can do business with one another without having to deal with different currencies with unstable foreign exchange rates in practice over the last 500 years in asia this has meant currencies based on silver and gold and then after 1870 gold alone it is possible to imagine although not so easy to actually do in the real world some kind of currency standard that through some kind of statistical aggregation or whatnot produces some kind of standard of value that is more stable in value than gold one problem here is that such a standard is not likely to be broadly accepted it would be dependent on some statistical agency itself the product of some individual government unfortunately every statistical agency has always come under political influences look at the many changes to the u s s own consumer price index over the years with each change making the statistics look better than they would have without the changes gold and historically its adjunct silver has been the only standard of currency value that all governments have enthusiastically adopted it is free of human influence although one could claim that it is not quite perfect nevertheless over centuries of experience we have found that it is perfect enough and no great practical difficulties arise from its use nothing better has ever been found the power of the gold standard increases as more and more countries use the same standard a common gold bloc in asia perhaps extending also to the islamic countries of the middle east would be a powerful response to the fiat currency hegemony of the west as mahathir suggests asia s leaders should begin taking steps in that direction in the past when writing articles like this i would argue that the west in general and the u s in particular seems to be on a path of decline that will probably be mirrored by a decline in currency quality but actually the u s has been on the yellen gold standard for some years now why don t we just shake hands and make it official it s what people did at a hotel in new hampshire back in 1944

likely than not that a further easing in monetary policy would be appropriate in the period ahead policymakers acknowledged that inflation has been below 2 3 target range for three years and even deteriorated to 1 5 in q1 unemployment rate had not declined any further in the last six months despite ongoing job growth it has eve edged up in the most recent two months thus a lower level of interest rates would support growth in the economy thereby reducing unemployment and contributing to inflation rising to a level consistent with the target also lower interests could support the economy through lower exchange rate reduced borrowing rates for businesses and lower interest payments for households and give the extent of spare capacity in the economy and the subdued inflationary pressures there was a low likelihood of a decline in interest rates resulting in an unexpectedly strong pick up in inflation instead lowest interest rates would stimulate activity and thereby improve

donald trump has accused the european central bank of unfairly manipulating the euro further raising the stakes for washington in its trade and diplomatic disputes around the world the us president suggested in a tweet that comments by mario draghi the head of the ecb had triggered an immediate slide in the value of the euro versus the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa reopening a spat over transatlantic trade with the eu that has repeatedly flared up during trump s presidency he warned brussels it had been getting away with this for years along with china and others mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others donald j trump realdonaldtrump june 18 2019 trump s comments come after draghi used one of his last major speeches before stepping down as ecb president to say the central bank could act to loosen monetary policy cutting interest rates or revamping its quantitative easing bond buying programme to stimulate the eurozone economy economic growth in the single currency area has struggled to generate momentum in the past 18 months while inflation across the bloc has stayed below the ecb s target level of 2 growth in key member states including germany europe s largest economy has come close to stalling while italy slid into recession in the absence of improvement such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened additional stimulus will be required draghi said speaking at the ecb s annual meeting in sintra portugal the euro weakened across the board on foreign exchanges straight after the speech dropping by 0 3 against the dollar to trade a two week low of 1 1182 on tuesday a weaker currency can help businesses to sell goods at more competitive prices to overseas buyers trump has long complained that the us buys more from eu firms than is sold the other way similar to his criticism of china with just four months of his eight year term left the slowdown in the eurozone may threaten to unpick draghi s legacy the italian is widely seen as having saved the euro after a promise in 2012 to do whatever it takes during the sovereign debt crisis draghi s latest intervention will likely help to reassure markets that the ecb is ready and willing to act despite his forthcoming departure while laying down the gauntlet to his successor to maintain lower borrowing costs to support the eurozone economy however the ecb faces challenges given its limited firepower with interest rates at record lows of zero and 0 4 for bank deposits the central bank could cut interest rates deeper into negative territory or buy more government bonds than previously allowed under its qe programme growth in the eurozone has stuttered in recent months in part because of the trump administration s trade war with china which has sapped global trade and cut demand for eu exports sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk draghi warned that trade disputes were among factors affecting growth in his speech advocating potential stimulus the risks that have been prominent throughout the past year in particular geopolitical factors the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets have not dissipated he said the us is also approaching a period of weaker growth after repeated interest rate hikes from the us federal reserve served as a headwind and as support from tax cuts introduced by trump gradually fades investors believe the fed could be forced into interest rate cuts this year as a consequence there are however hopes of a resolution in the us china trade dispute after trump said he would meet with the chinese president xi jinping at the forthcoming japan g20 summit next week in a tweet that prompted financial markets around the world to rally the us leader said had a very good telephone conversation with president xi of china we will be having an extended meeting next week at the g 20 in japan the ftse 100 closed up more than 85 points at 7 443 while the dow jones industrial average gained by more than 300 points on tuesday afternoon
the european central bank ecb will ease policy again if inflation fails to accelerate ecb president mario draghi said on tuesday signalling one of the biggest policy reversals of his eight year tenure and provoking the ire of us president donald trump with four years of unprecedented stimulus to revive the euro zone economy slowly bearing fruit the ecb had been preparing markets for policy tightening dubbed normalisation only to see a global trade war derail its plans within months the problem is that with rates at record lows and the ecb s balance sheet already swelled to 4 7 trillion euros s 7 23 trillion its remaining ammunition is limited raising doubts about the likely effectiveness of any further measures in the absence of improvement such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened additional stimulus will be required mr draghi told the ecb s annual conference in sintra portugal with just four months left of his term the slowdown is also a threat to mr draghi s legacy the italian s promise in 2012 to do whatever it takes to save the euro is widely credited with holding together the currency bloc during the darkest days of its sovereign debt crisis we will use all the flexibility within our mandate to fulfil our mandate and we will do so again to answer any challenges to price stability in the future mr draghi said on tuesday monetary policy remains committed to its objective and does not resign itself to too low inflation but the ecb is not alone in having to backtrack after abandoning interest rate hikes the us federal reserve may this week signal cuts in borrowing costs as global turmoil erodes confidence hitting stocks and global trade mr trump who has persistently called on the fed to ease monetary policy accused mr draghi of trying to weaken the euro to gain an unfair advantage in trade mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa mr trump wrote on twitter they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others trade is a main policy issue for mr trump who has raised disputes with a number of rival world economies including the european union mr draghi s comments which markets saw as unexpectedly dovish sent the euro down by a quarter of a per cent against the us dollar while stocks erased early losses and euro zone bond yields fell further many into record low territory mr draghi has often said the ecb does not target a currency level even if the exchange rate is an important factor for policy rate cuts qe mr draghi said the ecb which has consistently undershot its inflation target of just under two per cent since 2013 could still cut rates adjust its interest rate guidance and had considerable headroom for more asset purchases he also said the ecb could offer mitigating measures to offset the unwanted side effects of negative rates a comment indicating that a multi tier deposit rate was also on the table adding an argument for urgency of action he noted that risks to growth in the 19 countries that use the euro are tilted to the downside and that indicators for the coming quarters point to lingering softness the ecb will use the coming weeks to study its options he said suggesting that action may come sooner rather than later ecb policymakers next meet on july 25 markets have already priced in 15 20 basis points of cuts in the ecb s minus 0 4 per cent deposit rate a big change compared to the start of the year when rate hikes were firmly on the table limits mr draghi dismissed concerns about the ecb s depleted policy arsenal particularly the effectiveness of further bond purchases saying self imposed limits such as a rule that prevents the ecb buying more than one third of a particular country s debt could be adjusted he said the limits are flexible because the ecb s legal powers allow it to deploy tools that are both necessary and proportionate adding that the european court of justice had already confirmed it had broad discretion the ecj cleared the asset purchases in an earlier ruling but argued that limits on the ecb s bond buys must be in place suggesting that any tweaks to those limits could see the central bank back in court we are committed and are not resigned to having a low rate of inflation forever or even for now mr draghi said that aim is symmetric which means that if we are to deliver that value of inflation in the medium term inflation has to be above that level at some time in the future reuters
we hear a lot about suicide when celebrities like anthony bourdain and kate spade die by their own hand otherwise it seldom makes the headlines that s odd given the magnitude of the problem in 2017 47 173 americans killed themselves in that single year in other words the suicide count was nearly seven times greater than the number of american soldiers killed in the afghanistan and iraq wars between 2001 and 2018 a suicide occurs in the united states roughly once every 12 minutes what s more after decades of decline the rate of self inflicted deaths per 100 000 people annually the suicide rate has been increasing sharply since the late 1990s suicides now claim two and a half times as many lives in this country as do homicides even though the murder rate gets so much more attention in other words we re talking about a national epidemic of self inflicted deaths worrisome numbers anyone who has lost a close relative or friend to suicide or has worked on a suicide hotline as i have knows that statistics transform the individual the personal and indeed the mysterious aspects of that violent act why this person why now why in this manner into depersonalized abstractions still to grasp how serious the suicide epidemic has become numbers are a necessity according to a 2018 centers for disease control study between 1999 and 2016 the suicide rate increased in every state in the union except nevada which already had a remarkably high rate in 30 states it jumped by 25 or more in 17 by at least a third nationally it increased 33 in some states the upsurge was far higher north dakota 57 6 new hampshire 48 3 kansas 45 idaho 43 alas the news only gets grimmer since 2008 suicide has ranked 10th among the causes of death in this country for americans between the ages of 10 and 34 however it comes in second for those between 35 and 45 fourth the united states also has the ninth highest rate in the 38 country organization for economic cooperation and development globally it ranks 27th more importantly the trend in the united states doesn t align with what s happening elsewhere in the developed world the world health organization for instance reports that great britain canada and china all have notably lower suicide rates than the u s as do all but six countries in the european union japan s is only slightly lower world bank statistics show that worldwide the suicide rate fell from 12 8 per 100 000 in 2000 to 10 6 in 2016 it s been falling in china japan where it has declined steadily for nearly a decade and is at its lowest point in 37 years most of europe and even countries like south korea and russia that have a significantly higher suicide rate than the united states in russia for instance it has dropped by nearly 26 from a high point of 42 per 100 000 in 1994 to 31 in 2019 we know a fair amount about the patterns of suicide in the united states in 2017 the rate was highest for men between the ages of 45 and 64 30 per 100 000 and those 75 and older 39 7 per 100 000 the rates in rural counties are almost double those in the most urbanized ones which is why states like idaho kansas new hampshire and north dakota sit atop the suicide list furthermore a far higher percentage of people in rural states own guns than in cities and suburbs leading to a higher rate of suicide involving firearms the means used in half of all such acts in this country there are gender based differences as well from 1999 to 2017 the rate for men was substantially higher than for women almost four and a half times higher in the first of those years slightly more than three and a half times in the last education is also a factor the suicide rate is lowest among individuals with college degrees those who at best completed high school are by comparison twice as likely to kill themselves suicide rates also tend to be lower among people in higher income brackets the economics of stress this surge in the suicide rate has taken place in years during which the working class has experienced greater economic hardship and psychological stress increased competition from abroad and outsourcing the results of globalization have contributed to job loss particularly in economic sectors like manufacturing steel and mining that had long been mainstays of employment for such workers the jobs still available often paid less and provided fewer benefits technological change including computerization robotics and the coming of artificial intelligence has similarly begun to displace labor in significant ways leaving americans without college degrees especially those 50 and older in far more difficult straits when it comes to finding new jobs that pay well the lack of anything resembling an industrial policy of a sort that exists in europe has made these dislocations even more painful for american workers while a sharp decline in private sector union membership down from nearly 17 in 1983 to 6 4 today has reduced their ability to press for higher wages through collective bargaining furthermore the inflation adjusted median wage has barely budged over the last four decades even as ceo salaries have soared and a decline in worker productivity doesn t explain it between 1973 and 2017 productivity increased by 77 while a worker s average hourly wage only rose by 12 4 wage stagnation has made it harder for working class americans to get by let alone have a lifestyle comparable to that of their parents or grandparents the gap in earnings between those at the top and bottom of american society has also increased a lot since 1979 the wages of americans in the 10th percentile increased by a pitiful 1 2 those in the 50th percentile did a bit better making a gain of 6 by contrast those in the 90th percentile increased by 34 3 and those near the peak of the wage pyramid the top 1 and especially the rarefied 0 1 made far more substantial gains and mind you we re just talking about wages not other forms of income like large stock dividends expensive homes or eyepopping inheritances the share of net national wealth held by the richest 0 1 increased from 10 in the 1980s to 20 in 2016 by contrast the share of the bottom 90 shrank in those same decades from about 35 to 20 as for the top 1 by 2016 its share had increased to almost 39 the precise relationship between economic inequality and suicide rates remains unclear and suicide certainly can t simply be reduced to wealth disparities or financial stress still strikingly in contrast to the united states suicide rates are noticeably lower and have been declining in western european countries where income inequalities are far less pronounced publicly funded healthcare is regarded as a right not demonized as a pathway to serfdom social safety nets far more extensive and apprenticeships and worker retraining programs more widespread evidence from the united states brazil japan and sweden does indicate that as income inequality increases so does the suicide rate if so the good news is that progressive economic policies should democrats ever retake the white house and the senate could make a positive difference a study based on state by state variations in the u s found that simply boosting the minimum wage and earned income tax credit by 10 appreciably reduces the suicide rate among people without college degrees the race enigma one aspect of the suicide epidemic is puzzling though whites have fared far better economically and in many other ways than african americans their suicide rate is significantly higher it increased from 11 3 per 100 000 in 2000 to 15 85 per 100 000 in 2017 for african americans in those years the rates were 5 52 per 100 000 and 6 61 per 100 000 black men are 10 times more likely to be homicide victims than white men but the latter are two and half times more likely to kill themselves the higher suicide rate among whites as well as among people with only a high school diploma highlights suicide s disproportionate effect on working class whites this segment of the population also accounts for a disproportionate share of what economists anne case and angus deaton have labeled deaths of despair those caused by suicides plus opioid overdoses and liver diseases linked to alcohol abuse though it s hard to offer a complete explanation for this economic hardship and its ripple effects do appear to matter according to a study by the st louis federal reserve the white working class accounted for 45 of all income earned in the united states in 1990 but only 27 in 2016 in those same years its share of national wealth plummeted from 45 to 22 and as inflation adjusted wages have decreased for men without college degrees many white workers seem to have lost hope of success of any sort paradoxically the sense of failure and the accompanying stress may be greater for white workers precisely because they traditionally were much better off economically than their african american and hispanic counterparts in addition the fraying of communities knit together by employment in once robust factories and mines has increased social isolation among them and the evidence that it along with opioid addiction and alcohol abuse increases the risk of suicide is strong on top of that a significantly higher proportion of whites than blacks and hispanics own firearms and suicide rates are markedly higher in states where gun ownership is more widespread trump s faux populism the large increase in suicide within the white working class began a couple of decades before donald trump s election still it s reasonable to ask what he s tried to do about it particularly since votes from these americans helped propel him to the white house in 2016 he received 64 of the votes of whites without college degrees hillary clinton only 28 nationwide he beat clinton in counties where deaths of despair rose significantly between 2000 and 2015 white workers will remain crucial to trump s chances of winning in 2020 yet while he has spoken about and initiated steps aimed at reducing the high suicide rate among veterans his speeches and tweets have never highlighted the national suicide epidemic or its inordinate impact on white workers more importantly to the extent that economic despair contributes to their high suicide rate his policies will only make matters worse the real benefits from the december 2017 tax cuts and jobs act championed by the president and congressional republicans flowed to those on the top steps of the economic ladder by 2027 when the act s provisions will run out the wealthiest americans are expected to have captured 81 8 of the gains and that s not counting the windfall they received from recent changes in taxes on inheritances trump and the gop doubled the annual amount exempt from estate taxes wealth bequeathed to heirs through 2025 from 5 6 million per individual to 11 2 million or 22 4 million per couple and who benefits most from this act of generosity not workers that s for sure but every household with an estate worth 22 million or more will as for job retraining provided by the workforce innovation and opportunity act the president proposed cutting that program by 40 in his 2019 budget later settling for keeping it at 2017 levels future cuts seem in the cards as long as trump is in the white house the congressional budget office projects that his tax cuts alone will produce even bigger budget deficits in the years to come the shortfall last year was 779 billion and it is expected to reach 1 trillion by 2020 inevitably the president and congressional republicans will then demand additional reductions in spending for social programs this is all the more likely because trump and those republicans also slashed corporate taxes from 35 to 21 an estimated 1 4 trillion in savings for corporations over the next decade and unlike the income tax cut the corporate tax has no end date the president assured his base that the big bucks those companies had stashed abroad would start flowing home and produce a wave of job creation all without adding to the deficit as it happens however most of that repatriated cash has been used for corporate stock buy backs which totaled more than 800 billion last year that in turn boosted share prices but didn t exactly rain money down on workers no surprise of course since the wealthiest 10 of americans own at least 84 of all stocks and the bottom 60 have less than 2 of them and the president s corporate tax cut hasn t produced the tsunami of job generating investments he predicted either indeed in its aftermath more than 80 of american companies stated that their plans for investment and hiring hadn t changed as a result the monthly increase in jobs has proven unremarkable compared to president obama s second term when the economic recovery that trump largely inherited began yes the economy did grow 2 3 in 2017 and 2 9 in 2018 though not 3 1 as the president claimed there wasn t however any unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before as he insisted in this year s state of the union address anyway what matters for workers struggling to get by is growth in real wages and there s nothing to celebrate on that front between 2017 and mid 2018 they actually declined by 1 63 for white workers and 2 5 for african americans while they rose for hispanics by a measly 0 37 and though trump insists that his beloved tariff hikes are going to help workers they will actually raise the prices of goods hurting the working class and other low income americans the most then there are the obstacles those susceptible to suicide face in receiving insurance provided mental health care if you re a white worker without medical coverage or have a policy with a deductible and co payments that are high and your income while low is too high to qualify for medicaid trump and the gop haven t done anything for you never mind the president s tweet proclaiming that the republican party will become the party of healthcare let me amend that actually they have done something it s just not what you d call helpful the percentage of uninsured adults which fell from 18 in 2013 to 10 9 at the end of 2016 thanks in no small measure to obamacare had risen to 13 7 by the end of last year the bottom line on a problem that literally has life and death significance for a pivotal portion of his base trump has been awol in fact to the extent that economic strain contributes to the alarming suicide rate among white workers

the welcome indication from the sa reserve bank sarb last week that there is a possibility of a cut in interest rates was overshadowed by the news of attacks on two oil tankers off the coast of iran which saw the oil price jump as well as the continued weakness of the rand the interest rate on the one side and oil prices and the exchange rate on the other are forever important for sa consumers while a reduction in interest rates will put a bit of extra money in our pockets the possibility of yet another fuel price increase will take it out again just more than 10 years ago when oil prices surged to above 100 per barrel an american stockbroker published an interesting report that compared the effects of increases in the fuel price and interest rates on the us economy the study concluded that an increase of 1 in the price of a gallon of fuel would have the same effect as a certain increase in interest rates in other words an increase in fuel prices could be viewed very much as contractionary monetary policy locally thebe securities repeated the exercise and booked flights to present their findings to asset managers in cape town their conclusion was that certain consumer shares would be affected by fuel prices as much as by interest rates the calculations are quite simple and an update of the figures still yields interesting results the effect of a change in interest rates on the economy can be calculated using figures published by the sarb the latest summary of banking sector statistics as at the end of april 2019 shows that banks total outstanding loans amounted to r4 251 billion this includes r1 002 billion in home loans r983 billion in term loans r426 billion in lease and instalment loans and r362 billion in overdrafts and credit cards among other loan types interest rates down disposable income up a decrease of 50 basis points in interest rates would reduce the annual interest to be paid on the aggregate debt by just less than r21 3 billion or nearly r1 8 billion per month this translates to an increase of r1 8 billion in disposable income every month money that consumers can spend on pizza beer shoes and clothes if the sarb cuts the repo rate by 25 points at the next meeting of its monetary policy committee reversing the hike of november 2018 to take the prime rate back to 10 from the current 10 25 it would stimulate the economy to the tune of around r900 million per month this translates to an extra r10 billion that could potentially flow through the economy over the next year to bolster demand for products which creates opportunities for businesses to increase production and employ more people economists will be quick to point out that the effect would be much larger than the nominal r10 billion through the multiplier effect as each transaction in the economy leads to another neutralising effect unfortunately increasing petrol prices neutralises the positive effect of lower interest rates by far according to the sa petroleum industry association sapia motorists use around 11 2 billion litres of petrol and 12 1 million litres of diesel per annum every r1 increase in fuel prices increases the monthly spend on fuel by more than r1 9 billion in a nutshell an increase of 38c per litre in the price of fuel has the same effect on citizens aggregate disposable income as a change of 25 points in interest rates the monthly petrol price increases in sa since the beginning of the year amount to a moderate r1 57 per litre largely due to the big decrease in the petrol price at the beginning of january after prices spiked at the end of 2018 similarly the cumulative increase in the diesel price in the year to date is only 54c per litre limited by the decrease of r1 55 per litre in january nevertheless the moderate increase in the fuel price has claimed an additional r12 billion of spending in the economy in the first six months of the year or r2 billion per month this would equate to an increase in interest rates of just more than 50 basis points applying the same methodology on an individual household would show the same trend although the figures would differ in line with how much people drive and how much debt the household has according to two different home loan originators the average mortgage bond is just less than r1 million wesbank says the average loan for a new car is r300 000 and for a used car around r180 000 add some credit cards or a personal loan and it s possible that a middle class family has debt of around r1 4 million at current interest rates for home loans instalment finance agreements and personal debt the annual interest charges can amount to nearly r157 000 or r13 000 per month the monthly repayments are obviously much higher when including capital repayments a decrease in the prime lending rate from 10 25 to 9 75 would reduce interest charges on this debt to r149 750 per year or r12 480 per month swings and roundabouts the saving of r520 in interest every month if interest rates fall by 50 basis points would be very welcome but would bring little relief if fuel prices keep on increasing this calls for more assumptions such as the distance people drive every year and their vehicles fuel economy the south african revenue service sars works on an average of 30 000 kilometres per annum for personal travel for tax purposes and the second hand car industry uses a similar figure to determine the value of used cars a family with two vehicles can use around 365 litres of fuel per month assuming 30 000km per annum on one vehicle and 15 000km on the other at 10 litres per 100km the change in the petrol price since january would have increased the household s fuel cost by r570 a month more than the benefit of a relatively big fall of 50 basis points in the interest rate the economists at the sarb would be quick to point out that they make provision for fuel price increases in their models and that monetary authorities have control over interest rates but not over the oil price or exchange rate we therefore need to hope that the tanker incidents in the middle east do not escalate into a new war and that the oil price resumes its downward trend of the last few months more importantly we need to hope that the rand reverses its trend of the last few months and strengthens from the current r14 81 per dollar and that the sarb does cut the repo rate brought to you by moneyweb
this article originally appeared at tomdispatch com to receive tomdispatch in your inbox three times a week click here in early october 2016 as the most staggering presidential election campaign of our lives was nearing its end i wrote this about the man whom i suggested heartland working class whites might consider dispatching to the white house as an american version of a suicide bomber or think of it another way and it may be the newest way of all a significant part of the white working class at least feels as if whether economically or psychologically its back is up against the wall and there s nowhere left to go under such circumstances many of these voters have evidently decided that they re ready to send a literal loose cannon into the white house they re willing that is to take a chance on the roof collapsing even if it collapses on them in relation to his republican rivals and now hillary clinton he stands alone in accepting and highlighting what increasing numbers of americans especially white americans have evidently come to feel that this country is in decline its greatness a thing of the past or as pollsters like to put it that america is no longer heading in the right direction but is now on the wrong track in this way he has mainlined into a deep economically induced mindset especially among white working class men facing a situation in which so many good jobs have headed elsewhere that the world has turned sour and i wouldn t take back a word of that not in a country in which you can indeed feel a sense of decline still growing in which as tomdispatch regular rajan menon has recently made clear epidemics of self disrespect self loathing and self harm are distinctly the order of the day and speaking in fact of suicide and presidents as menon makes strikingly evident today in that very same heartland among that very same white working class suicide itself is rising to epidemic proportions and the suicide bomber in the white house is giving it quite a helping hand tom america s suicide epidemic it s hitting trump s base hard by rajan menon we hear a lot about suicide when celebrities like anthony bourdain and kate spade die by their own hand otherwise it seldom makes the headlines that s odd given the magnitude of the problem in 2017 47 173 americans killed themselves in that single year in other words the suicide count was

that violent act why this person why now why in this manner into depersonalized abstractions still to grasp how serious the suicide epidemic has become numbers are a necessity according to a 2018 centers for disease control study between 1999 and 2016 the suicide rate increased in every state in the union except nevada which already had a remarkably high rate in 30 states it jumped by 25 or more in 17 by at least a third nationally it increased 33 in some states the upsurge was far higher north dakota 57 6 new hampshire 48 3 kansas 45 idaho 43 alas the news only gets grimmer since 2008 suicide has ranked 10th among the causes of death in this country for americans between the ages of 10 and 34 however it comes in second for those between 35 and 45 fourth the united states also has the ninth highest rate in the 38 country organization for economic cooperation and development globally it ranks 27th more importantly the trend in the united states doesn t align with what s happening elsewhere in the developed world the world health organization for instance reports that great britain canada and china all have notably lower suicide rates than the u s as do all but six countries in the european union japan s is only slightly lower world bank statistics show that worldwide the suicide rate fell from 12 8 per 100 000 in 2000 to 10 6 in 2016 it s been falling in china japan where it has declined steadily for nearly a decade and is at its lowest point in 37 years most of europe and even countries like south korea and russia that have a significantly higher suicide rate than the united states in russia for instance it has dropped by nearly 26 from a high point of 42 per 100 000 in 1994 to 31 in 2019 we know a fair amount about the patterns of suicide in the united states in 2017 the rate was highest for men between the ages of 45 and 64 30 per 100 000 and those 75 and older 39 7 per 100 000 the rates in rural counties are almost double those in the most urbanized ones which is why states like idaho kansas new hampshire and north dakota sit atop the suicide list furthermore a far higher percentage of people in rural states own guns than in cities and suburbs leading to a higher rate of suicide involving firearms the means used in half of all such acts in this country there are gender based differences as well from 1999 to 2017 the rate for men was substantially higher than for women almost four and a half times higher in the first of those years slightly more than three and a half times in the last education is also a factor the suicide rate is lowest among individuals with college degrees those who at best completed high school are by comparison twice as likely to kill themselves suicide rates also tend to be lower among people in higher income brackets the economics of stress this surge in the suicide rate has taken place in years during which the working class has experienced greater economic hardship and psychological stress increased competition from abroad and outsourcing the results of globalization have contributed to job loss particularly in economic sectors like manufacturing steel and mining that had long been mainstays of employment for such workers the jobs still available often paid less and provided fewer benefits technological change including computerization robotics and the coming of artificial intelligence has similarly begun to displace labor in significant ways leaving americans without college degrees especially those 50 and older in far more difficult straits when it comes to finding new jobs that pay well the lack of anything resembling an industrial policy of a sort that exists in europe has made these dislocations even more painful for american workers while a sharp decline in private sector union membership down from nearly 17 in 1983 to 6 4 today has reduced their ability to press for higher wages through collective bargaining furthermore the inflation adjusted median wage has barely budged over the last four decades even as ceo salaries have soared and a decline in worker productivity doesn t explain it between 1973 and 2017 productivity increased by 77 while a worker s average hourly wage only rose by 12 4 wage stagnation has made it harder for working class americans to get by let alone have a lifestyle comparable to that of their parents or grandparents the gap in earnings between those at the top and bottom of american society has also increased a lot since 1979 the wages of americans in the 10th percentile increased by a pitiful 1 2 those in the 50th percentile did a bit better making a gain of 6 by contrast those in the 90th percentile increased by 34 3 and those near the peak of the wage pyramid the top 1 and especially the rarefied 0 1 made far more substantial gains and mind you we re just talking about wages not other forms of income like large stock dividends expensive homes or eyepopping inheritances the share of net national wealth held by the richest 0 1 increased from 10 in the 1980s to 20 in 2016 by contrast the share of the bottom 90 shrank in those same decades from about 35 to 20 as for the top 1 by 2016 its share had increased to almost 39 the precise relationship between economic inequality and suicide rates remains unclear and suicide certainly can t simply be reduced to wealth disparities or financial stress still strikingly in contrast to the united states suicide rates are noticeably lower and have been declining in western european countries where income inequalities are far less pronounced publicly funded healthcare is regarded as a right not demonized as a pathway to serfdom social safety nets far more extensive and apprenticeships and worker retraining programs more widespread evidence from the united states brazil japan and sweden does indicate that as income inequality increases so does the suicide rate if so the good news is that progressive economic policies should democrats ever retake the white house and the senate could make a positive difference a study based on state by state variations in the u s found that simply boosting the minimum wage and earned income tax credit by 10 appreciably reduces the suicide rate among people without college degrees the race enigma one aspect of the suicide epidemic is puzzling though whites have fared far better economically and in many other ways than african americans their suicide rate is significantly higher it increased from 11 3 per 100 000 in 2000 to 15 85 per 100 000 in 2017 for african americans in those years the rates were 5 52 per 100 000 and 6 61 per 100 000 black men are 10 times more likely to be homicide victims than white men but the latter are two and half times more likely to kill themselves the higher suicide rate among whites as well as among people with only a high school diploma highlights suicide s disproportionate effect on working class whites this segment of the population also accounts for a disproportionate share of what economists anne case and angus deaton have labeled deaths of despair those caused by suicides plus opioid overdoses and liver diseases linked to alcohol abuse though it s hard to offer a complete explanation for this economic hardship and its ripple effects do appear to matter according to a study by the st louis federal reserve the white working class accounted for 45 of all income earned in the united states in 1990 but only 27 in 2016 in those same years its share of national wealth plummeted from 45 to 22 and as inflation adjusted wages have decreased for men without college degrees many white workers seem to have lost hope of success of any sort paradoxically the sense of failure and the accompanying stress may be greater for white workers precisely because they traditionally were much better off economically than their african american and hispanic counterparts in addition the fraying of communities knit together by employment in once robust factories and mines has increased social isolation among them and the evidence that it along with opioid addiction and alcohol abuse increases the risk of suicide is strong on top of that a significantly higher proportion of whites than blacks and hispanics own firearms and suicide rates are markedly higher in states where gun ownership is more widespread trump s faux populism the large increase in suicide within the white working class began a couple of decades before donald trump s election still it s reasonable to ask what he s tried to do about it particularly since votes from these americans helped propel him to the white house in 2016 he received 64 of the votes of whites without college degrees hillary clinton only 28 nationwide he beat clinton in counties where deaths of despair rose significantly between 2000 and 2015 white workers will remain crucial to trump s chances of winning in 2020 yet while he has spoken about and initiated steps aimed at reducing the high suicide rate among veterans his speeches and tweets have never highlighted the national suicide epidemic or its inordinate impact on white workers more importantly to the extent that economic despair contributes to their high suicide rate his policies will only make matters worse the real benefits from the december 2017 tax cuts and jobs act championed by the president and congressional republicans flowed to those on the top steps of the economic ladder by 2027 when the act s provisions will run out the wealthiest americans are expected to have captured 81 8 of the gains and that s not counting the windfall they received from recent changes in taxes on inheritances trump and the gop doubled the annual amount exempt from estate taxes wealth bequeathed to heirs through 2025 from 5 6 million per individual to 11 2 million or 22 4 million per couple and who benefits most from this act of generosity not workers that s for sure but every household with an estate worth 22 million or more will as for job retraining provided by the workforce innovation and opportunity act the president proposed cutting that program by 40 in his 2019 budget later settling for keeping it at 2017 levels future cuts seem in the cards as long as trump is in the white house the congressional budget office projects that his tax cuts alone will produce even bigger budget deficits in the years to come the shortfall last year was 779 billion and it is expected to reach 1 trillion by 2020 inevitably the president and congressional republicans will then demand additional reductions in spending for social programs this is all the more likely because trump and those republicans also slashed corporate taxes from 35 to 21 an estimated 1 4 trillion in savings for corporations over the next decade and unlike the income tax cut the corporate tax has no end date the president assured his base that the big bucks those companies had stashed abroad would start flowing home and produce a wave of job creation all without adding to the deficit as it happens however most of that repatriated cash has been used for corporate stock buy backs which totaled more than 800 billion last year that in turn boosted share prices but didn t exactly rain money down on workers no surprise of course since the wealthiest 10 of americans own at least 84 of all stocks and the bottom 60 have less than 2 of them and the president s corporate tax cut hasn t produced the tsunami of job generating investments he predicted either indeed in its aftermath more than 80 of american companies stated that their plans for investment and hiring hadn t changed as a result the monthly increase in jobs has proven unremarkable compared to president obama s second term when the economic recovery that trump largely inherited began yes the economy did grow 2 3 in 2017 and 2 9 in 2018 though not 3 1 as the president claimed there wasn t however any unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before as he insisted in this year s state of the union address anyway what matters for workers struggling to get by is growth in real wages and there s nothing to celebrate on that front between 2017 and mid 2018 they actually declined by 1 63 for white workers and 2 5 for african americans while they rose for hispanics by a measly 0 37 and though trump insists that his beloved tariff hikes are going to help workers they will actually raise the prices of goods hurting the working class and other low income americans the most then there are the obstacles those susceptible to suicide face in receiving insurance provided mental health care if you re a white worker without medical coverage or have a policy with a deductible and co payments that are high and your income while low is too high to qualify for medicaid trump and the gop haven t done anything for you never mind the president s tweet proclaiming that the republican party will become the party of healthcare let me amend that actually they have done something it s just not what you d call helpful the percentage of uninsured adults which fell from 18 in 2013 to 10 9 at the end of 2016 thanks in no small measure to obamacare had risen to 13 7 by the end of last year the bottom line on a problem that literally has life and death significance for a pivotal portion of his base trump has been awol in fact to the extent that economic strain contributes to the alarming suicide rate among white workers his policies are only likely to exacerbate what is already a national crisis of

observers expect that the canadian dollar will rise against the u s dollar over the course of 2019 as more economists begin to anticipate a dramatic shift in u s monetary policy as the economy slows the dollar fell 1 1 per cent last week against the greenback and held near the 74 60 us cents level on monday but the longer term outlook is what s more important here as financial markets absorb the prospect of interest rate cuts by the u s federal reserve later this year the canadian dollar should get a boost citigroup strategist jeremy hale recommends betting against the u s dollar in favour of the canadian dollar as the two currencies diverge canadian economists see a similar pattern emerging this year i do think that we will continue to see the currency range trade but perhaps trade to the stronger side of that range not so much from what the bank of canada may be up to but what the fed may be up to michael gregory deputy chief economist at bmo nesbitt burns said in an interview he thinks the dollar will end the year at 1 325 or about 75 5 us cents that is nearly a full cent higher than the dollar s current level and up 2 2 cents from its 2018 close economists at national bank financial expect the dollar could rise as to as much as 77 us cents against the greenback by the end of the year if a trade deal between the united states and china lifts the price of crude oil while that might not be enough to alter travel plans it could give the bank of canada something to think about with its own monetary policy next year if canada s competitiveness falters with a stronger dollar we now see the fed cutting rates in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year so in order for the bank of canada to keep the loonie at a competitive level we think they ll have to cut interest rates in the second quarter of next year which would ultimately cause the canadian dollar to depreciate katherine judge an economist at cibc world markets said in an interview cibc expects the canadian dollar will retreat to 1 38 or 72 5 us cents by the end of 2020 erasing near term gains there are a lot of moving parts here though including simmering geopolitical tensions between the united states and iran the direction of commodity prices and the stability of global stock markets a correction could send investors back to the safety of u s dollars but economists are expressing some confidence in a shift in fed monetary policy last year rising bond yields reflected the widely held belief that the central bank would continue to raise its key interest rate in 2019 amid rising inflationary pressures and decent continuing economic growth now this outlook has changed even with the u s jobless rate at a 50 year low and economic growth at a remarkable 3 1 per cent in the first quarter the big reason trade if the current toxic tone of trade negotiations between the u s and its trading partners becomes more heated crystallizing downside risk to the economy the fed will deliver multiple rate cuts paul andré pinsonnault and jocelyn paquet economists at national bank financial said in a recent note indeed financial markets are pricing in three rate cuts in 2019 according to citigroup what s also important here though is the bank of canada s initial response to the fed the canadian economy looks to be on the mend after a couple of weak quarters at the end of 2018 and the start of 2019 while gross domestic product in the first quarter grew at an annualized rate of just 0 4 per cent after inflation the month over month pace of growth in march improved to 0 5 per cent that marks the strongest monthly economic growth in three years and should keep the canadian central bank on the sidelines with its monetary policy this year next year though is a different story during the recovery we leaned on using low interest rates to propel consumption and housing now that those are slowing the bank of canada wants to see a rotation in growth towards exports and business investment that can t happen unless we have a competitive loonie ms judge said
the european central bank will ease policy again if inflation fails to accelerate ecb president mario draghi said on tuesday signalling one of the biggest policy reversals of his eight year tenure and provoking the ire of u s president donald trump with four years of unprecedented stimulus to revive the euro zone economy slowly bearing fruit the ecb had been preparing markets for policy tightening dubbed normalisation only to see a global trade war derail its plans within months the problem is that with rates at record lows and the ecb s balance sheet already swelled to 4 7 trillion euros 4 2 trillion its remaining ammunition is limited raising doubts about the likely effectiveness of any further measures in the absence of improvement such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened additional stimulus will be required draghi told the ecb s annual conference in sintra portugal with just four months left of his term the slowdown is also a threat to draghi s legacy the italian s promise in 2012 to do whatever it takes to save the euro is widely credited with holding together the currency bloc during the darkest days of its sovereign debt crisis we will use all the flexibility within our mandate to fulfil our mandate and we will do so again to answer any challenges to price stability in the future draghi said on tuesday monetary policy remains committed to its objective and does not resign itself to too low inflation but the ecb is not alone in having to backtrack after abandoning interest rate hikes the u s federal reserve may this week signal cuts in borrowing costs as global turmoil erodes confidence hitting stocks and global trade trump who has persistently called on the fed to ease monetary policy accused draghi of trying to weaken the euro to gain an unfair advantage in trade mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa trump wrote on twitter they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others trade is a main policy issue for trump who has raised disputes with a number of rival world economies including the european union draghi s comments which markets saw as unexpectedly dovish sent the euro down by a quarter of a percent against the dollar while stocks erased early losses and euro zone bond yields fell further many into record low territory draghi has often said the ecb does not target a currency level even if the exchange rate is an important factor for policy rate cuts qe draghi said the ecb which has consistently undershot its inflation target of just under 2 since 2013 could still cut rates adjust its interest rate guidance and had considerable headroom for more asset purchases he also said the ecb could offer mitigating measures to offset the unwanted side effects of negative rates a comment indicating that a multi tier deposit rate was also on the table adding an argument for urgency of action he noted that risks to growth in the 19 countries that use the euro are tilted to the downside and that indicators for the coming quarters point to lingering softness the ecb will use the coming weeks to study its options he said suggesting that action may come sooner rather than later ecb policymakers next meet on july 25 markets have already priced in 15 20 basis points of cuts in the ecb s minus 0 40 deposit rate a big change compared to the start of the year when rate hikes were firmly on the table limits draghi dismissed concerns about the ecb s depleted policy arsenal particularly the effectiveness of further bond purchases saying self imposed limits such as a rule that prevents the ecb buying more than one third of a particular country s debt could be adjusted he said the limits are flexible because the ecb s legal powers allow it to deploy tools that are both necessary and proportionate adding that the european court of justice had already confirmed it had broad discretion the ecj cleared the asset purchases in an earlier ruling but argued that limits on the ecb s bond buys must be in place suggesting that any tweaks to those limits could see the central bank back in court we are committed and are not resigned to having a low rate of inflation forever or even for now draghi said that aim is symmetric which means that if we are to deliver that value of inflation in the medium term inflation has to be above that level at some time in the future source reuters by francesco canepa and balazs koranyi editing by catherine evans

the qatar crisis entered its third year this month and there is no indication that it will be resolved anytime soon when saudi arabia and the united arab emirates launched the economic blockade of qatar two years ago they were expecting it to be effective within a short time since over 60 percent of qatar s trade was transited through the uae ports and saudi border crossing the blockading countries expected the isolation to cause a painful disruption to the qatari economy this severe trade shock in combination with the anticipated support of president donald j trump surely would force qatar to accept the saudi demand for altering its unacceptable foreign policy international reactions to qatar s blockade much to saudi arabia and the uae s surprise neither of these predictions materialized as soon as the blockade was announced iran and turkey rushed to qatar s assistance by offering to establish new trade links and delivering a variety of consumer goods by ships and planes iran opened its airspace to commercial planes for flights to qatar that were no longer allowed to enter the airspaces of uae saudi arabia bahrain and egypt in his first reaction president trump expressed support for the blockade in a tweet soon after however it became clear that the u s official reaction as delivered by the state department was neutral during my recent trip to the middle east i stated that there can no longer be funding of radical ideology leaders pointed to qatar look donald j trump realdonaldtrump june 6 2017 secretary of state rex tillerson tried to resolve the issue through intermediation without supporting the saudi position as a result qatar remained defiant and it was further emboldened by turkish military support before the blockade turkey maintained a small number of troops in qatar as a symbolic gesture of military cooperation at qatar s request turkey raised its number of troops to 3 000 soon after the blockade qatar s wealth and resistant population in addition to these external factors the small national population of qatar and its large sovereign wealth also contributed to the country s ability to remain defiant and resist the blockade the qatari government used its massive financial reserves to pay for the higher transport costs of imports and to support the domestic industries that suffered huge losses as a result of the blockade in response to the blockade qatar s government intensified its efforts to attract foreign investment and prevent the businesses already in qatar from leaving the government prioritized financing for the massive construction projects that were underway in preparation for the 2022 world cup and many international firms that were managing their qatar businesses from their regional offices in dubai bypassed the blockade by establishing direct branches in qatar economic impact of blockade qatar s economic statistics for 2017 and 2018 indicate that the negative impact of the blockade on investment and economic activity was moderate the annual economic growth rate remained positive but declined from 2 1 percent in 2016 to 1 58 percent in 2017 and recovered to an estimated 2 2 percent in 2018 interestingly saudi arabia and the uae experienced 0 7 percent and 0 7 percent annual economic growth rates in 2017 furthermore despite causing temporary shortages of many goods the blockade did not lead to a significant price increase the annual inflation rate in 2017 was below 1 percent qatar crisis and gulf cooperation council at the same time the qatar blockade crisis has had important regional consequences it has practically paralyzed the six member gulf cooperation council gcc which was already suffering from factionalism and internal divisions established in 1981 in response to the regional threats from iran and iraq gcc countries took several steps towards security and economic cooperation it was also successful as a regional block in several rounds of investment and trade negotiations with europe china and india between 2000 and 2010 up until the qatar crisis the gcc members were able to manage the internal rivalries and disagreements to maintain a minimum posture of unity these included incidents such as the 2005 saudi bahrain dispute over the latter s free trade agreement with the u s and the 2010 saudi uae dispute over the location of a gcc central bank which never materialized the qatar crisis has caused a deeper division that might be much more difficult to repair some members are forming new alliances which can undermine gcc in late december 2017 saudi arabia and the uae announced the formation of a new bilateral military and economic alliance which is partly the result of their close cooperation in the yemen war and other regional issues balance on the opposite side of the dispute qatar has significantly strengthened its economic ties with iran and turkey turkish construction firms have won many contracts for world cup projects which otherwise would have been awarded to the uae based construction firms such as emaar many iranian businesses that have come under pressure in dubai because of the iran uae tensions have moved their operations to doha the united states offers military protection to each gcc country not only against external powers such as iran iraq or egypt but also against each other consequently a small nation like qatar can rely on u s protection to pursue an independent foreign policy without paying attention to its much larger gcc neighbors saudi arabia and the uae as long as the u s does not put pressure qatar to compromise saudi arabia and the uae cannot force qatar to concede and the crisis is likely to continue at the same time the heavy u s military presence in the region prevents either side from escalating the crisis into a military confrontation new normal since multiple attempts by various intermediaries have failed to end the qatar crisis the international community is beginning to view it as a new normal for dealing with gcc countries there has been little change in qatar s hyperactive foreign policy and it is actively competing with saudi arabia and uae for influence in the arab world and beyond in the latest episode of this competition both sides are trying to improve their relations with iraq much to the displeasure of saudi arabia which is courting the shia political groups that are opposed to iran s influence in iraq qatar has shown a willingness to court the shia factions that are close to iran disclaimer the views and opinions expressed here

italy talking points italy s politicians continue to keep markets on edge as their budget indiscipline intensifies and talks about further debt issuance are re ignited italian 10 year bond spreads continue to increase against the german bund financing will become more expensive as risk premiums increase eur could suffer further losses against major currencies as mini bot talks develop further markets have remained cautious of italy for most of the last year as the third largest economy in the monetary union has been running a large public deficit which has brought on conflict with the bloc s leaders in recent weeks eu lawmakers have been edging closer to imposing sanctions on italy over the state s handling of public debt and re ignited talks about the italian government issuing more debt to settle their current debt has meant that the euro continues to remain sensitive to political developments in italy despite talk about mini bots being around for some time the victory of matteo salvini s right wing league party in the european elections has captured the attention of the markets as the league and the five star movement which have led the country in a coalition for the last year hint at the return of the italian lira during their national election campaign last year the euro suffered sold off during the last quarter of 2018 as lawmakers in italy said that most of italy s problems would be resolved if it regained monetary independency by re introducing a national currency and recent developments in italy s parliament have the eurozone on edge as a motion has been passed for the italian government to review how it pays its commercial debts re igniting concerns about the premier s intentions although issuing a parallel currency is illegal under eu laws questions arise as to whether issuing mini bots could be the tool eurosceptics may use to facilitate italy s departure from the eurozone what exactly are mini bots the idea is that the italian government would issue short term interest free small sized government securities to be used as an internal currency to pay for the government s suppliers taxes and social contributions it would essentially be paying for its obligations through newly issued debt which could act as a debt multiplier but the belief is that it would allow companies to receive their overdue arrears which would increase liquidity and boost the economy but if these government securities were then enabled to change hands as a medium of exchange creditors could see a reduction in their income as the settlement of payments in a fiscal currency other than the legal tender would have less value if exchanged between parties other than the state a way for the government to safeguard the value of the securities would be to accept them as a future tax payment effectively acting as a fiscal stimulus and reducing tax revenues because of their nature in paper form and small denominations they would be expected to be spent locally which would stimulate growth in the italian economy with the expectation of an increase in short term tax revenues to offset future tax losses this would mean that italy could achieve fiscal expansion without relying on the euro are mini bots illegal the issuance of mini bots would not break any eu laws if they are simply issued as a security but their use as a parallel currency would be inconsistent with the eu s current legal framework however considering that italy s dispute with the eu over its budget indiscipline continues the issuance of more public debt could make the eu question whether italy s policymakers are taking matters seriously issuing mini bots would see risk premiums continue to increase widening even further the gap between italian debt and the benchmark german bund despite the likelihood of mini bots materialising being low the fact that they have captured eu lawmakers attention means that they are considered to be a threat to the stability of the eurozone specifics about the securities have not yet been released but influential european figures have been quick to reject the idea that they would be welcomed by the ecb as mentioned by mario draghi they are either money and then they re illegal or they re debt and then that stock goes up i don t see a third possibility but even more important than the specific characteristics of mini bots would be the message that they send about italeave if they are issued given remarks made by italy s politicians about the parallel currency it may be that they would be used as the first step towards italy s departure from the eurozone regardless of whether mini bots are illegal or not their success as a means of exchange depends greatly on whether they are widely accepted by the marketplace eu officials believe that if they were introduced they would not be accepted because of fears that italy could leave the eurozone which would lead to them trading at a discount to the euro and despite having the potential to increase purchasing power within the italian economy if sellers do not accept them as legal tender then their adoption and intended stimulus power is limited past evidence is mixed most economists remain very wary about governments issuing parallel currencies as previous occasions where ious have been issued have not yielded the expected results in 2002 the argentinian government issued parallel currencies to overcome the limits on printing pesos that were pegged to the us dollar at that time the peso was overvalued and the introduction of alternative currencies was intended to devalue against the peso and stimulate growth in the economy but the strong demand for the parallel currencies to overcome the shortage of pesos meant that the desired effect was not achieved and the currencies were abandoned a short time later in 2009 the state of california suffered a revenue shortage which led to increased fiscal budgets and the issuance of interest paying ious to pay short term obligations but the adoption of the ious as a means of exchange was limited because they were not widely accepted by merchants which diminished their stimulus effect and were later bought back by the government at par their lack of acceptance showed that a legal tender is deemed worthless if there is no trust in the creditworthiness of the issuing party but despite their lack of general adoption the californian government managed to increase their revenues and pay back its fiscal obligations which proved that although not permanent ious can be used as means to overcome temporary difficulties how will the euro react judging by how the euro has reacted to previous speculative mentions of mini bots we could see the euro lose value against most major currencies as developments unfold back in october 2018 the single currency experienced increased sell side pressure as rome and the eu s budget clashes intensified and italian politicians re introduced talks about min bots the eurodollar fell below the 1 1600 handle a level which it has not managed to overcome ever since eurusd price chart daily time frame sept 2018 june 2019 even if mini bots have no future in the eurozone traders will continue to focus on italy as its budgetary indiscipline continues to unfold it has emerged that the eu is planning to launch an excessive deficit procedure edp against italy which could result in a fine of up to eur 3 4 billion the equivalent of 0 2 of the country s gdp all in all considering that populist sentiments are flourishing in europe and secessionism is becoming an increased topic of discussion it is no wonder that the eu is feeling anxious about italy s rebellion after all we re in the middle of brexit and are staring down the barrel at a possible italeave

photo illustration jed egan photos getty images at least it s not globalcoin for months now rumors leaks and speculation have held that facebook s newly developed cryptocurrency the entrance of the most powerful private surveillance apparatus on the planet into a sector created by and for obsessively secretive cypherpunk libertarian cranks would be called globalcoin it felt a bit on the nose was newworldordercoin already taken instead the coin will be called libra a reference to the currency system of history s most famous conquering empire rome i personally would have gone with facebucks libra which was finally officially announced this morning is expected to launch in 2020 with calibra a digital wallet for securely storing the currency that can be used as a stand alone app or in whatsapp and facebook messenger previous reporting has suggested that indian whatsapp users will be first to have access to the cryptocurrency for no or low fee money transfers and facebook has apparently and uncharacteristically been wooing regulators and central bankers around the world to smooth the coin s landing the libra blockchain that is the shared ledger of all transactions made in libra will be maintained by a network of nodes which verify transactions and store the continuously updated record these nodes will be operated by outside companies early partners seem to include mastercard paypal uber and booking com each of which will reportedly pay 10 million for the privilege and the money from these licensing fees the information reports will be used to back libra with a basket of currencies and low risk securities from various countries keeping its value stable how precisely users will exchange libra for physical currency remains to be seen though the most likely option is that facebook partners with a cryptocurrency exchange and the information reports that there are plans for physical terminals similar to atms facebook is insistent that calibra will not share account information or financial data to it or to third parties but that the wallet will use facebook data to comply with the law secure customers accounts mitigate risk and prevent criminal activity what this means in practice is not precisely clear except that facebook wants to make sure you re aware that your libra account balance will not be used to help target you with ads on its main platform the coin itself will be governed by an independent foundation the libra association consisting of representatives from facebook financial institutions nonprofits merchants venture capitalists and the companies running the nodes facebook is already working on creating its own private supreme court after all why wouldn t it want its own private independent central bank as well this highly centralized structure is very different from that of traditional cryptocurrencies like bitcoin which spurn centralized authority and allow anyone to set up a node for free and unlike libra whose value will be fixed to the aforementioned basket of currencies and securities most cryptocurrencies don t maintain fixed exchange rates which is exactly what makes crypto such an exciting and volatile speculative market libra by contrast is intended to be boring because facebook s short term plans for the currency are similarly boring or at least straightforward facebook wants to enter and own the cross border payments market if it is indeed launching in india it s not as part of a test run but because nearly 80 billion in remittances were sent to india in 2018 with more than 200 million indian whatsapp users already the company is well positioned to make its apps and its currency the method of choice for international money transfers to india and eventually the world but domination of the 689 billion global remittance economy is not actually facebook s end goal in fact it almost certainly won t make much money directly from cross border payments since unlike its competition payment systems like m pesa or remittance apps like paypal s xoom facebook reportedly won t charge transaction fees for peer to peer payments that s a very bad way to make money but as facebook knows well it s a very good way to entice new users into your network and in turn to convince stores restaurants and other businesses to set up to accept globalcoin in payment this is the medium term plan for libra to compete not just with money transfer businesses but with credit card companies using cross border payments as the beachhead for all payments everywhere you receive a no fee libra payment from an expat family member and then use that libra to pay back a friend who in turn uses the libra to pay for a chicken maharaja mac at the local mcdonald s facebook here is openly mimicking wechat which is both china s largest social network and also the country s ubiquitous payment app an utterly dominant facebook whatsapp apple pay venmo seamless hybrid it s easy to see why facebook might want this there s a familiar business model in merchant fees though if you re levying payments in the currency that you yourself mint taxes might be a better word and payments fit much more naturally than advertisements in the privacy focused chat based future that mark zuckerberg claims is coming for his company but facebook insists that its merchant fees would only be high enough to cover the cost of fraud risk the real value of becoming the world s ubiquitous payment app outside of china at any rate goes beyond the revenue from merchant fees facebook s biggest problem right now the problem that lurks behind stagnant user growth in europe and north america is that it s just not essential like any megaplatform facebook wants to be infrastructure a service so important to daily life that most people have no choice but to use it but facebook in 2019 is increasingly easy for americans and europeans to quit without particular consequence in a way that google say isn t libra could if it takes off change that payment infrastructure isn t just potentially more lucrative than social infrastructure it s much less easy to replicate either on the business side or on the consumer side it s pretty easy to quit facebook the app where you fight with your childhood neighbor about politics it s much more difficult to quit facebook the app you use to pay your rent i imagine the widespread adoption of a digital currency on an aggressively centralized and privately surveilled blockchain tied to real name id is not really what the bitcoin faithful had in mind when they got into cryptocurrency in the first place even so there s some excitement about libra among crypto nerds who are hoping that facebook s backing will normalize cryptocurrency and entice the uninitiated into crypto culture but the opposite seems more likely to me once you ve got a usable digital currency why would you want to get into other currencies i use dollars every day but don t spend a lot of time buying up euro and yen still it s worth asking at this point why a cryptocurrency at all if the limit of zuckerberg s ambition is to be the western wechat or the new visa and american express why does facebook feel like it needs a whole new means of exchange it could partner with a global banking conglomerate to undercut rivals fees and leverage its already enormous network to enter the payment sector the way wechat or to a lesser extent apple has all without having to build out an enormous headache inducing technical and regulatory apparatus but since when has zuckerberg limited his ambition to competing with mere companies as far as i know there s only one other entity out there developing a blockchain based digital currency for a billion plus member economy china the people s bank of china has been amassing blockchain and digital currency patents as it develops its own cryptocurrency loosely pegged to a basket of other currencies just like libra which could help it more efficiently monitor and control capital flows so much for the decentralized anarchist dream of cryptocurrency facebook doesn t want to compete with mastercard or even with goldman sachs it wants to be the currency platform mastercard operates on facebook s payment product is a whole new currency because its long term competition isn t paypal or visa or even wechat but the renminbi the euro the yen and the dollar there s long been a segment of crypto nerds for whom the ultimate goal of bitcoin is that it replace the dollar as the global reserve currency held in mass quantities by monetary authorities and used as the dominant unit of account for international finance but for most of its still fairly short life bitcoin has been much too volatile difficult to use and unregulated for the idea of a global reserve cryptocurrency to be anything but a wild pipe dream but what if bear with me now you had a stable cryptocurrency created with regulator and institutional accession and already in frictionless circulation among 2 3 billion people plenty of economists and central bankers have suggested that a supranational instrument might make for a better reserve currency than one printed by a national monetary authority john maynard keynes s proposed currency the bancor is notable in that it might actually have a worse name than libra but it also seems to presage the ambition of zuckerberg s project albeit as the product of an international system of cooperating sovereign governments rather than as an app created by a roman empire obsessed programmer we ve now entered the realm of wild dystopian speculation of course facebook has already tried and failed to build a sustainable proprietary payment system called facebook credits and there s every chance that libra could similarly fail even its short and medium term goals of entering and dominating payment sectors will be difficult to achieve let alone the unprecedented idea of a corporation s private digital currency being widely enough adopted and respected to be the foundation of a global reserve currency but facebook right now is being very open about its plans to remake the world s financial systems people may even welcome that in the global banking industry facebook has probably found the one group of corporations less liked and less trusted than itself but if you think facebook is powerful now just wait until it s essentially the global federal reserve overseeing a global currency over which it has not just monetary control but a visible minable record of every transaction made maybe globalcoin would have been the right name after all

while nigerians and the world are waiting with expectation for a new economic roadmap from president buhari it is pertinent to remind the president of his next level promise to improve the living standard of nigerians and move the economy out of tottering recovery the delay in constituting a cabinet in his first term was alleged to have partly contributed to the economic recession the unlikely consequences of the 2015 general elections accounted for capital flight as investors moved their investments from nigeria in anticipation of likely electoral crisis while the delay lasted the emefiele led cbn took charge but the volatility of the world price of crude oil nigeria s major income earner nose dived and the economy got thoroughly bashed economy predators did not also help they collaborated to wreck the economy and godwin emefiele became the scape goat global economic protectionism the brexit and in particular the unending trade war between united states of america and china made the cbn came up with the suspension of 41 items to resolve the challenges facing the economy godwin emefiele gauging the temperature and architecture of the trade war between two economic giants and their allies and likely consequences it would have on global economic growth and stability came up with some home grown policies to secure and protect nigeria s fragile economy economic nationalism did not start today or with donald trump nigeria in 1972 under general yakubu gowon rtd the former head of state promulgated the nigerian enterprises promotion decree a k a indigenization decree the aim of the policy was to create opportunities for nigerian indigenous businessmen maximise local retention of profits and to raise intermediate capital and goods production it must be noted that the policy was predicated on a very strong conviction of political and economic nationalisation the policy was later reviewed by the murtala obasanjo regime in 1977 it was a radical policy politically initiated to set the stage for greater participation of nigerians in the ownership management and control of the productive enterprises in nigeria it was envisioned to enhance the industrial development of the country by encouraging foreign investment in intermediate and capital goods production unfortunately we missed the dream and successive administrations lost the vision and nigeria drifted away from economic realities the appointment of emefiele in june 2014 revealed the true health situation of the economy with inflation almost hitting the roof and the only revenue earning product for the country crude oil had its international price plummeted uncontrollably the local currency the naira was worst hit by the enterprises of currency speculators and round tripping held sway and embarrassingly the economy became dollarized it thus became obvious that if something drastic and decisive was not done nigeria might be put up for economic colonisation it took the initiative of godwin emefiele after devaluing the currency twice to embrace import substitution policy targeted at the goods draining the reserves and responsible for job loss the 43 items that can be locally produced nigerians knew the consequence of that action economic predators went up in arms but godwin emefiele stood his ground he only sought the support of well meaning nigerians that was emefiele s protectionist agenda designed to drastically reduce imports and encourage local production and create jobs at the heart of the policy was the desire to spur domestic economy which had been swallowed with warped taste for foreign goods and enhance production of suspended items he has eventually increased to 43 and promised to suspend more if the need arises this policy also seeks to discourage dumping of sub standard goods which were flooding the nigerian markets to ensure that a vacuum was not created the cbn came up with the anchor borrowers programme investors and exporters window youth entrepreneur development programme yepd real sector support fund facility rssp and accelerated agriculture development scheme aads this not to mention the n220bn msmedf acgs smecgs etc and importantly his own brand of economic nationalism produce add value and export pave however all these efforts to emefiele s detractors are unforgivable sins the voodoo economists have come again as they swarm on godwin emefiele in the days of economic adversity one of them wrote in a national business daily newspaper of monday 10th june 2019 emefiele a central bank governor in politician s image eventually this is a piece put together and apparently doing the job of paymasters for the writer to have said that president buhari reappointed emefiele because he pursued almost without reservation the president s statist and illiberal economic agenda including propping up favoured sectors notably agriculture and manufacturing with billions of naira protecting these sectors from international competition through high tariffs exchange control and outright import bans feeding buhari s deficit financing by extending massive overdrafts to his government and of course like buhari not wanting to kill the naira so instead of liberalising the foreign exchange market and allow the naira to adjust to its true market determined level he is operating different foreign exchange windows and foster different exchange rates which distort the economy and discourage investors i wondered if this writer a nigerian who claimed to be a visiting fellow at the london business school of economics is not on tramadol or codeine to be so dazed and blind to godwill emefiele s commendable strides at the cbn and how he has helped put the economy back on its feet he made some mundane comments that betrayed the disappointment of his payers who were apparently unhappy and disappointed with emefiele s reappointment i think emefiele himself knew that his reappointment would re energise the economic predators reason he said on his reappointment that the road ahead would be rough these disillusioned adversaries always come in different shapes colour and sizes as they failed to effect change at the headship of the bank and have the naira floated they have resulted to name calling blackmail and mudslinging maybe the writer because of his deluded grandstanding forgot that in 2008 09 the world economic crisis changed the way countries relate with each other and since then countries have embraced trade protectionism as tool to resolve negative perceptions and shocks in their respective countries and nigeria is not an exception if no one had the guts to do it in the past emefiele should be commended on his policies which are evident and has helped gave fresh breath to some hitherto comatose industries particularly agriculture and manufacturing which were the mainstay of the nigeria economy in the more buoyant years of the 1950s 70s with cocoa south west was built palm oil and rubber built mid west region coal built south east and the groundnut pyramids built the northern region the global uncertainties arising particularly from us hiking of interest rates and the trade war with china has impacted negatively not only on the nigerian economy but most developing economies and if not for the steeled patriotism of emefiele who was able to weather the storm despite these challenges to grow the reserves from 23bn to 45bn with a spate of 4 years is no mean achievement anchors borrowers programme currently has over 925 000 farmers enrolled with over 10millions jobs created direct and indirect the effort revolutionized rice production the investors and exporters window created by emefiele which detractors have labelled special window for the favoured has attracted over 50bn investments into the country within a spate of three years and inflation rate brought down from 19 per cent to about 11 8 as at may 2019 the politician central bank governor has been able to rally commercial banks chief executives to support his vision in growing the economy by setting aside 5 of their annual profit to finance agriculture and the real sector to created jobs and wealth he also erected a tripod structure to enhance financial inclusion strategy of the cbn the nirsal bankers committee and nipost to establish the national microfinance bank in 774 local government areas of the country to make cheap and sustainable credit at single digit interest rate available to the economic active but poor rural dwellers particularly the farmers and petty businesses the on going trade imbroglio between the us and china is assuming a worrisome posture and only god knows when it would end thus most of emefiele s policies are geared to step up production of goods and services with export potential to further appropriate the gains of the currency bilateral agreement with china the politician cbn governor has succeeded in achieving unbroken 3 year stability in the foreign exchange markets and has encouraged foreign direct investments fdi into nigeria cynics have started they are irritating distractions whose trademark is pulling him down at all

the dollar s fortitude suggests the aggressive pricing of rate cuts for this year by the bond market has not swayed currency traders just yet so far in 2019 investors have been rewarded for owning us dollar assets in bonds and equities but that view may well shift and pressure the dollar should the debt market s aggressive pricing of fed cuts play out this year the current january fed funds future for 2020 implies a rate of 1 72 per cent well below the central bank s current mid level of 2 375 per cent for overnight lending this is certainly a market expecting a dovish federal open market committee but there is a risk that the policymakers statement on wednesday afternoon thursday aest does not satisfy the bullish sentiment in bond land last week s release of retail sales and industrial production enables the fomc to outline a view that the economy is resilient while sticking to the script that softening inflation pressure remains transitory in nature as win thin at brown brothers harriman says most observers are looking ahead to the july 31 meeting for the first cut but it will all depend on the data if consumption remains firm and momentum carries over into q3 the fed will likely remain on hold then as well here the fomc s forecast of future interest rate changes via its dot plot could either calm or spur market volatility a general call for no change in policy during 2019 with some officials expecting one to two cuts next year would enable the fomc to thread the needle with the bond market and limit a bout of selling across wall street advertisement plenty also rides on fed chair jay powell being able to artfully tread a narrow line during the press conference communicating optimism over the economy while expressing a willingness to step in should downside risks such as a trade shock intensify where matters become more complicated between the fed and markets is over trade and of course the upcoming g20 meeting in spite of the us economy s resilience the bond market s pronounced rally in recent months and hefty expectations for rate cuts reflects a grim longer term view of sino us trade talks lou crandall at wrightson icap makes an interesting point here rather our expectation of rate cuts later this year is driven by our sense that the white house is willing to run extraordinary economic risks to deliver what it sees as a win on the trade front it seems increasingly likely that at some point the administration won t step back from the brink quickly enough and economic activity will take a bigger hit than it has thus far and lou adds that the central bank faces a new type of moral hazard via the trade talks promising to cut rates in the event of trade disruptions would incentivise the administration to run exactly the kind of risks that the fed would probably like to avoid advertisement there is no doubt that the fed would respond quickly if a slowdown in global trade posed a threat to us growth but it may be cautious about appearing to promise to do so preemptively while there may be a degree of disappointment over the fomc message this week with the likely consequence of knocking prices for havens the case for safe assets in 2019 is rather like running a marathon with testing periods of pain quick hits what s on the markets radar central banking forum at sintra opens mario draghi s opening remarks began with a tribute to the late martin feldstein and then a brief summary of the challenges facing monetary union that will be the focus of the forum on wednesday with fed policy easing in play the ecb s job is not easy particularly when forward starting inflation expectations are at a record low a trade canary sings singapore s non oil exports recorded their third consecutive double digit fall in may with electronics shipments falling 31 4 per cent the largest decrease since late 2008 after a 16 3 per cent drop in april marc ostwald at adm says the slide in electronics exports sends a dire signal as it represents a generally very reliable proxy for the semiconductor and telecoms sectors worldwide advertisement oxford economics note that their coincident and leading global trade indicators are continuing to trend downwards and the latter has fallen to its lowest level since 2009 while this does not mean that a global recession is around the corner it suggests that global growth will remain sluggish in the near term and that export orientated economies will continue to struggle a wave of easing expect plenty of central bank action from asia this summer as tariffs bite many countries on the continent have room to act given the relative stability in their currencies td securities outline the cutting timeline malaysia is likely to ease policy in july india indonesia and philippines are likely to ease by august singapore could shift to an easier stance in october south korea taiwan and thailand are likely to ease later in h2 19 financial times financial times

tuesday defended president trump s use of tariffs to squeeze concessions from adversaries and trading partners lighthizer spoke before a senate panel where lawmakers expressed worries about recent moves by trump ratcheting up the trade war with china and the potential blowback for the economy mosads if there s a better idea than tariffs i d like to hear it i haven t heard it he told the senate finance committee when asked about trump s strategy if trade talks with china fail i know one thing that won t work and that is talking to them because we ve done that for 20 years he added the hill s niv elis takes us there the background lawmakers from both parties have been critical of trump s decisions to threaten and impose tariffs in a multi front trade war complaining that the import taxes increase prices on u s consumers and invite retaliation that shuts exporters out of global markets trump increased tariff rates on 200 billion of chinese imports last months as trade talks between the two countries faltered and the president has threatened to impose new tariffs on an additional 300 billion of imports those tariffs along with existing ones would hit nearly every chinese import to the united states the moves have only sparked more anxiety about trump s strategy and the risk to the u s economy the president s actions have driven away our allies and there is no discernable strategy guiding the way forward said sen ron wyden d ore the ranking member of the senate finance committee i don t agree that tariffs should be the tool we use in every instance to achieve our trade policy goals said finance committee chairman chuck grassley r iowa what comes next lighthizer appears before the house ways and means committee on wednesday where he will face another round of

trump s top economic adviser said tuesday that the white house is not considering demoting federal reserve chairman jerome powell brushing off earlier reports that the president had looked into it we are not taking any actions to change his status said national economic council director larry kudlow about powell who president trump appointed to chair the fed in 2017 kudlow s comments come after bloomberg news reported that trump had explored in february whether he could legally demote powell from the fed s chairmanship kudlow declined to confirm or deny the bloomberg article saying it allegedly happened six months ago though the report said trump considered the demotion four months ago in february it s not happening today and therefore i have nothing to say about it kudlow added the fine print trump is barred by the federal reserve act from firing fed board members without cause which is generally understood to be personal misconduct or gross negligence not policy differences the law is less clear on whether trump could demote the fed chairman and render him a regular member of the fed board of governors if the demotion were legal trump could appoint a new fed chairman without removing powell from the central bank entirely the feud trump has bashed powell and the fed for close to a year accusing the bank and its chairman of suppressing the economy by unnecessarily raising interest rates the fed has raised rates four times under powell a republican appointed by trump to lead the central bank trump reportedly considered firing powell in december as the stock market cratered into a bloody sell off after the fed s final rate hike of the year powell has said that he cannot be fired by trump and would not resign if asked to by the president waving off concerns about political pressure the bloomberg report comes as the fed kicks off a highly anticipated monthly meeting where the bank faces a critical decision on whether to cut interest rates the fed is expected to announce wednesday that it will keep rates steady for now but may project at least one cut by the end of the year while the u s economy continues to grow and enjoy low unemployment trump s escalating trade battles and recent signs of slowness in key economic data have left investors anxious and trump is ratcheting up the pressure on his hand picked chairman seeking the fed s help as he attempts to end a trade war with china and clinch another presidential term in 2020 the question of how to move interest rates is just one of several challenges facing the fed as it grapples with intense political pressure and an uncertain economic forecast the fed has to wrestle with not only all of the uncertainty that s in the market because of the trade battles but an unprecedented amount of political risk said karen shaw petrou managing partner at federal financial analytics i ve got more on the fed s big test here maxine waters calls on facebook to halt cryptocurrency project house financial services committee chairwoman maxine waters d calif on tuesday called on facebook to halt its new cryptocurrency project until regulators and congress weigh in on the endeavor in a statement waters said that the social media giant should back away from the financial services industry because of the company s repeated privacy breaches alleged violation of consumer protection laws and a string of other controversies involving user data with the announcement that it plans to create a cryptocurrency facebook is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users waters said in a tuesday statement given the company s troubled past i am requesting that facebook agree to a moratorium on any movement forward on developing a cryptocurrency until congress and regulators have the opportunity to examine these issues and take action i explain why here what happened facebook on tuesday unveiled its plans to launch project libra a payments system based on a cryptocurrency supported by more than two dozen major corporations including uber mastercard spotify vodafone coinbase and women s world banking facebook said that the cryptocurrency project would be operated by the non profit libra association and separate from the social media platform facebook s immense size reach market power and pervasive privacy breaches raised concerns across the political spectrum about libra s potential effect on financial markets rep patrick mchenry r n c ranking republican on the financial services panel asked waters in a tuesday letter to hold a hearing on project libra and its potential unprecedented impact on the global financial system facebook is already too big and too powerful and it has used that power to exploit users data without protecting their privacy added sen sherrod brown ranking democrat on the senate banking committee in a tuesday statement the bottom line it usually takes allegations of severe abuse like with wells fargo or a massive data breach like with equifax to prompt this level of bipartisan concern from the financial regulatory leaders in congress it s obviously early but facebook has clearly struck a chord with lawmakers expect more action on this down the pipeline good to know republican and democratic leaders in congress will meet wednesday with senior white house

fed under the microscope the federal reserve remains the focus of all attention as its two day fomc meeting gets underway three things to watch from the fed meeting gavin friend senior market

shaved to 2 5 per cent or 2 625 per cent he wrote in a note the committee won t want to officially forecast a rate cut in 2019 given the run of better data and unpredictability of the trade dispute but a small minority will likely opt for a dot cut this year the new economic forecasts are likely to nudge core pce inflation down from 1 9 per cent to 2 0 per cent in 2019 given the run rate so far that would imply that any rebound in inflation under the transitory heading could be delayed if the fed wanted to stick with the wording which was new in may the 3 6 per cent to 3 8 per cent jobless

frankfurt germany ap â the european central bank could unleash more stimulus if the economy doesn t pick up soon its president warned tuesday sparking a sharp drop in the euro and drawing an angry tweet from u s president donald trump mario draghi told a conference in sintra portugal that the ecb was not resigned in its quest to perk up the economy and said that in the absence of improvement additional stimulus will be required europe s top central banker even held out the prospect of cutting interest rates though they are already at record lows further cuts in policy rates remain part of our tools he said draghi noted it was also possible to re start a bond buying stimulus program that had been halted only in december investors read the comments as a clear step toward more stimulus in coming months causing stock markets to rally and sending the euro lower against the dollar draghi s statement was met with anger from trump who suggested it was an effort to boost european exports by weakening the currency trump wrote on twitter that the lower euro was making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others asked about the tweet by a conference moderator draghi said that the european central bank was ready to use all available tools to achieve its mandate of stable prices and added that we do not target the exchange rate the euro traded at 1 1187 by late afternoon in europe down from 1 1241 before draghi s speech germany s main stock index surged over 2 rate cuts and monetary stimulus are aimed at loosening credit for businesses and consumers and at the same time can send a currency s exchange rate lower since stimulus measures can do both it can be a matter of debate about how much intent there was to lower the currency a weaker euro can give european exporters a price advantage over u s businesses trump has cited the currency issue in his criticism of europe over what he describes as unfair trade practices talk of re starting stimulus comes only six months after the ecb phased out a 2 6 trillion euro 2 9 trillion bond purchase program that pumped new money into the economy over almost four years in an attempt to drive inflation higher the ecb s shift to a pro stimulus stance mirrors that of the u s federal reserve which has halted a series of interest rate hikes fed chair jay powell has said that the fed is prepared to respond if it decides the u s china trade conflict is threatening the u s economy investors read his remarks as a signal that the fed will likely cut interest rates this year both the ecb and the fed which holds a policy meeting tuesday and wednesday have cited similar reasons for their policy shift â the threat of a softening global economy if trump and the chinese don t reach agreement on trade any rate cuts by the fed could in theory add to pressure on the ecb if they result in a weaker dollar against the euro eurozone inflation of 1 2 is below the european central bank s goal of just under 2 considered best for the economy while growth prospects are under pressure from uncertainty about issues such as the u s china trade dispute which could lead to more tariffs and less trade there is also no clarity on the terms of britain s planned departure from the european union draghi said that in the absence of stronger inflation additional stimulus will be required and that the bank would use all the flexibility in our mandate to push inflation toward the goal the remarks largely echoed statements at his news conference following the bank s last policy meeting on june 6 on tuesday he emphasized that bank officials are not resigned to having a low rate of inflation forever or even now at the june 6 meeting the central bank extended the earliest date for an interest rate increase from year end to the middle of next year the bank s key policy rates are at record lows zero for lending to banks and minus 0 4 on deposits left overnight at the ecb by commercial banks the negative rate is a penalty aimed at pushing banks to lend the money the frankfurt based ecb sets monetary policy for the 19 european union countries that have joined the shared euro currency it tries to steer inflation by adjusting interest rate benchmarks and if needed by purchasing financial assets central bank actions have wide ranging impact on consumer pocketbooks and the finances of banks companies and governments lower rates and monetary stimulus measures mean cheaper borrowing but scantier returns for savers stimulus can also push up the prices of assets such as stocks and bonds copyright 2019 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
imf predicts economic growth for guyana in 2019 says influx of migrants could put strain on hinterland communities the international monetary fund imf monday said that economic growth strengthened in guyana last year with broad expansion across all major sectors and is predicting economic growth in excess of four per cent this year it said that real gross domestic product gdp growth grew by 4 1 per cent up from 2 1 per cent the previous year and was led by the construction and services sectors the imf which has a mission currently here holding talks with various stakeholders said that inflation remained steady at 1 6 per cent at the end of last year on the back of stable food prices and exchange rate for 2019 the mission projects real economic growth of 4 4 per cent driven by continued strength in the construction and services sectors ahead of oil production in 2020 and strong recovery in mining the imf said in a statement adding that the authorities do not foresee any significant spillovers from the crisis in venezuela at present influx of migrants however the influx of migrants into the hinterland and rural areas could put socio economic pressures on the local communities it warned with respect to the number of venezuelans fleeing the south american country as a result of the economic and political turmoil the imf said weaker export performance and higher imports driven by high value imports related to oil production contributed to a weaker current account balance in 2018 the current account deficit rose to 17 5 per cent of gdp from 6 8 per cent in 2017 it said the deficit was largely financed by foreign direct investments fdi related to the petroleum sector and that reserves stood at us 528 million in december 2018 the washington based financial institution said that public finances in guyana improved in 2018 the central government s deficit was 3 5 per cent of gdp lower than the budgeted 5 4 per cent of gdp the better than expected outturn was largely supported by stronger revenues arising from the pick up in economic activity as well as continued improvements in tax administration and the tax amnesty program which relaxed interest and penalties on payments of outstanding taxes in addition expenditure grew at a weaker pace due to slower capital spending as a result of capacity issues in both the public and private sector in 2019 the fiscal stance is projected to be appropriately expansionary at 5 percent of gdp driven by significant need for infrastructure development and capacity building ahead of oil production the imf said favourable prospects it said guyana s medium term prospects are very favourable the commencement of oil production in 2020 presents an opportunity to scale up capital and current spending at a measured pace over the medium term to address infrastructure gaps and human development needs while attenuating debt sustainability concerns at the same time the imf mission said it welcomed the passage of the natural resource fund nrf legislation for managing the country s natural resource wealth saying it underscores the authorities commitment to fiscal responsibility to ensure fiscal responsibility is achieved the mission recommends complementing the nrf legislation with a fiscal framework that constrains borrowing and achieves a balanced budget in the near to medium term the statement noted to achieve this target the annual non oil deficit should not exceed the expected transfer from the nrf this would ensure that excessive public expenditure will not lead to debt growing at the same time as the nrf accumulates it is also necessary to preserve the spirit of the nrf framework which appropriately aims to save part of the income from oil as net wealth for future generations the pace of scaling up public spending needs to be gradual to reduce bottlenecks from absorptive capacity constraints avoid waste and minimize macroeconomic distortions related to dutch disease that has often inflicted economies experiencing sizable increases in resource based income the imf said it supports the continued efforts by the authorities to strengthen institutional governance and management practices which will also help reduce vulnerability to corruption it commends the ongoing efforts in modernising the revenue administration and strengthening the public investment management system at the same time the imf reiterates the importance of addressing the weaknesses identified in the 2017 public investment management assessment greater urgency is attached to these reforms ahead of the expected increase in public spending as oil production begins the mission notes authorities intent to move to rigorous project selection and prioritization criteria within the context of the new long term green state development strategy the imf said it is encouraging building on recent progress in strengthening transparency and governance guyana completed its first extractive industries transparency initiative eiti report in 2019 and started implementing its recommendations to further enhance transparency in the extractive industry in addition the recent re establishment of the integrity commission has resulted in over 50 per cent of politically exposed persons peps and other required officers making declarations within the first year ensuring greater compliance over time with the asset declaration regime would underscore the authorities support and commitment to the un convention against corruption the imf said adding that it also welcomes the progress made in strengthening public procurement and encourages the authorities to ensure timely compliance with existing regulations and take further actions to fortify the transparency of the procurement system it said that the authorities have indicated their concerns that the absence of a ring fencing arrangement in the stabroek production sharing agreement could potentially affect the projected flow of government oil revenues the rapid appraisal and development of multiple oil fields could affect the timing and amount of profit oil to be shared with the government from a producing oil field by allocating costs from various fields under development to the producing field the authorities are developing strategies to mitigate such a possibility including a national oil depletion policy to guide extraction and production and clearer ring fencing rules for new investments reassess money policy the imf said it is recommending that the authorities continually reassess the monetary policy stance to reflect changes in macroeconomic outlook or risks surrounding the outlook and is encouraging exchange rate flexibility as part of the monetary policy framework given the expected large and potentially volatile foreign inflows from oil production it is also encouraging the authorities to consider developing over the medium term supported by imf technical assistance the necessary infrastructure for a suitable monetary policy framework that facilitates economic growth and adjustment to oil price shocks while maintaining price stability the washington based financial institution said guyana s financial sector remains stable and it supports the resolute efforts of the authorities in implementing 2016 financial sector assessment program fsap recommendations it said credit to the private sector grew by four per cent in 2018 faster than 2 1 per cent in 2017 the banking sector nonperforming loans npls to total loans ratio have fallen slightly to 11 9 per cent as of the end of december 2018 from 12 2 per cent a year before but remained high the imf executive board is expected to discuss guyana s article iv consultation in august 2019

the fed could try to hold out one more month before committing to rate cuts and note that the policy stance is appropriate right now the dollar could rally if the fed reiterates their patient stance but the more likely scenario is for powell to begin to adopt a dovish stance how dovish of statement and how many rate cuts are shown in the dot plots will likely determine how far the dollar could fall dot plots if the fed does not surprise markets with a rate cut investors will quickly look to see how the dot plot forecasts are updated each quarterly meeting the central bank will show what each policy makers expectations are for interest rates over the next few years the last update in march saw 11 of the 17 fomc officials expected rates to remain on hold for the rest of the year while four expected a 25 basis point increase and two expected interest rates to rise by half a percentage point this will be the first time the dot plots are being updated to what is expected to be interest rate cuts and not hikes historically the rate projections have only been used to show a gradual path of increases so markets will closely watch how dovish each member becomes how big will the first cut be with markets preparing for the fed to begin an easing cycle many will look to see if policy makers are opting for a half percent move over a quarter point adjustment when beginning an easing cycle in both 2001 and 2017 the fed decided to surprise markets with a 50 basis point cut over a quarter point adjustment the argument for a steeper rate cut stems from the recent success with market impact in delivering a stronger dovish signal fed officials may lose this surprise however if the dot plot forecasts prompt investors expectations economists mostly agree that the december rate hike was a policy mistake and if the fed wants to send a clear dovish message a half a percentage point cut in july could do the trick inversions the yield curve inversion between the 3 month and 10 year yields has been inverted for 19 straight day currently at 14 7 basis points the 10 year and 2 year spread which has yet to invert in this cycle has narrowed to 19 18 basis points the 10 year yield on treasuries continues to slide and is approaching the 2 00 level which is well below the current fed funds target range of 2 25 2 50 a fed rate cut will help the current strain on bank lending

boost on expectations that trade talks are showing some positive signs following president trump s tweets oil did not see much of reaction to the api inventory report which showed a draw of 0 8

front trump tweeted that he spoke with xi and that the us and china will hold an extended meeting next week at the g 20 in japan while today s positive trade tone was heavily embraced meaningful progress at the g 20 remains an unlikely scenario the base case remains that we will not see an escalation in tariffs and that we could see a plan that outlines a potential removal of some tariffs

jerome powell chairman of the u s federal reserve right walks with mario draghi president of the european central bank ecb during the spring meetings of the international monetary fund imf and world bank in washington d c u s on friday april 20 2018 it s quite ironic that president donald trump is criticizing the outgoing head of the european central bank for currency manipulation when he s counting on his own central bank head jerome powell to do the exact same thing mario draghi indicated the ecb could add fresh stimulus to a struggling eurozone economy a comment that has pushed german interest rates deeper into negative territory and has driven the euro down to 1 11 draghi as the federal reserve does has every reason and right to contemplate further stimulus whether it s some kind of rate cut more quantitative easing or other measures that would keep the entire continent from sliding into recession despite trump s constant calls for the fed to cut rates in the absence of any looming inflationary threat the ecb has a much stronger argument for making a move unlike the u s the eurozone is tilting toward recession german manufacturing the engine of european growth has stalled france italy and spain have seen recession like conditions while italy s heavy debt burden has complicated the outlook across the pond also with the prospects of a so called no deal brexit looming if the u k crashes out of the eu economic troubles could spread from britain to berlin the biggest reason the euro is weakening is not currency manipulation but the fact that the u s is still better off than the rest of the world positive interest rates in the u s in contrast to 12 trillion in negative yielding sovereign debt around the world is drawing investors into u s treasury bonds pushing up the value of the dollar rates in germany and japan aren t necessarily negative because of central bank intervention that would be confusing cause and effect real rates are negative around the world because the world is not growing contrast that to the u s where there has been an obvious slowing of economic activity but the outlook has yet to indicate recession on the immediate horizon true with interest rates in the u s plunging a good portion of the treasury yield curve inverting consumer spending decelerating for three straight quarters and no end to the trade war with china in sight it may well be advisable for the fed to take back its december rate cut as early as wednesday
listen to sens bernie sanders and elizabeth warren speak and the two couldn t be more stylistically different at the poor people s campaign presidential forum held monday on poverty and racism warren laid out her vision to end inequality with we start in america with a wealth tax explaining in detail her proposal for a 2 percent tax levied on assets more than 50 million she emphasized her brand as the candidate with the plans as the washington post s dave weigel pointed out sanders stuck to his brand too of calling for a political revolution in my view there will never be any real change in this country unless there is a political revolution sanders said at the event and that means that millions of people have got to stand up and take on the corporate interests the billionaire class the 1 percent and tell them that in this country our economy and our government belong to all of us and not just wealthy campaign contributors sanders and warren are clearly two separate human beings but within the liberal to left political intelligentsia there s a debate are they actually the same it s been a question that both warren and sanders have had to answer to and a longstanding argument among the pundit class it s been made all that more poignant as sanders and warren have been duking it out for second place in early 2020 polls an indication that progressive voters are beginning to split between the two sanders and warren s teams see clear differences as do their supporters warren will quickly point out that sanders is a self avowed democratic socialist although there s a debate about that too she on the other hand is a capitalist who believes in markets as long as they are strongly regulated others say it s a difference in praxis much of it comes down to the matter of regulation vs revolution writes elizabeth bruenig a columnist with the washington post warren s vision is deeply rooted in her policies solving the ills of society whereas sanders is calling for a social movement to upend the american political order as we know it then again it s hard to ignore that they back many of the same policies enough so that some like vox s matt yglesias argue that they are interchangeable as progressive candidates there are actual differences between warren and sanders both in how they navigate policy and very much so in ideology and political style but what this means for the presidential nomination is still unclear it is after all extremely early in the race how the two candidates perform in the debates on the campaign trail and so forth will likely go a long way to help voters differentiate the two warren and sanders generally agree on a lot of policy elizabeth and i end up agreeing on a lot of issues sanders said at a cnn town hall in april it s true side by side their agendas don t look too different sanders and warren both want to make college free sanders has not yet unveiled a new plan for free college but his campaign says they will be coming out with a proposal for universal free college that will also forgive substantial student loan debt sanders has previously proposed eliminating undergraduate tuition at four year institutions by committing 47 billion per year to states that participate in a 2 to 1 federal funding match program and has a student loan refinancing proposal warren has proposed a plan which eliminates tuition at four year institutions and has a debt forgiveness program that cancel up to 50 000 in student loan debt for an estimated 42 million americans both support universal child care and preschool they both want to raise the minimum wage to 15 an hour both have been strong supporters of unions and the labor movement sanders has fought alongside mcdonald s amazon and disney workers to raise their wages and improve conditions his campaign has repeatedly supported different unionization efforts including at vox media which owns this website both see unfettered greed gnawing away at the country s middle class they both have progressive wealth taxes to pay for a bigger social safety net warren has a proposal to implement a wealth tax on americans with fortunes worth over 50 million sanders has a proposal to dramatically expand the estate tax leaving most estates untaxed save for estates of the very rich topping out at a maximum rate of 77 percent both have aggressive agendas targeted at wall street sanders has a proposal that would put a cap on the size of financial institutions that jeff stein at the washington post reported would break up six of the biggest firms jpmorgan bank of america citigroup wells fargo goldman sachs and morgan stanley warren has a corporate governance proposal which vox s matt yglesias explained would give workers bigger say over corporate boards limit corporate executives ability to sell shares of stock that they receive as pay she has also pledged to break up big tech companies like facebook and apple but much as they agree there are policy and governance areas where the two notably diverge warren has shown support for reparations for descendants of enslaved people sanders said he was opposed to direct payments however like warren said he would sign a bill to research the idea as president warren is for ending the filibuster in the senate sanders has warned against it and when it comes to health care the policy issue democratic voters consistently list as their top priority warren and sanders don t have the same convictions warren has co sponsored sanders s single payer proposal but on the campaign trail keeps her talking points on universal health care she speaks about medicare for all more in terms of expanding public options for health care rather than eliminating private insurance altogether it s in stark contrast to sanders who takes every opportunity to explain and advocate for single payer health care making the case that the incentives cannot be truly in the interest of the patients unless private insurance is out of the equation another is foreign policy the two have taken the lead on establishing a progressive approach to foreign policy on the road to 2020 however as the new yorker s osita nwanevu writes sanders s critique of american foreign policy generally runs deeper and goes back farther as often pointed out by the sanders supporting contingent in this debate warren who has made a point to target pentagon corruption on the campaign trail herself has been seen as a champion for defense contractors in her own state of massachusetts where giants like general dynamics and raytheon are major employers and hold billion dollar defense contracts with the federal government all said to a more casual political observer their takeaway messages can sound very similar sanders likes to say at the end of the day the 1 percent may have enormous wealth and power but they are just the 1 percent when the 99 percent stand together we can transform society and warren says she s in a fight to build an america that works for everyone not just the wealthy and the well connected the fundamental difference in ideology underlying all this is a fundamental difference in how sanders and warren see themselves on the ideological spectrum warren is a social democrat sanders is a democratic socialist the difference between the two is best explained by how warren and sanders convey their skepticism toward capitalism said sheri berman a political scientist with barnard college who has written extensively on the history of the left both sanders and warren have put forth a slew of policies a couple of election cycles ago would have been seen just far ahead of where the democratic party was berman said if you believe in capitalism and you believe it has gone a little off the rails in the last generation but it remains the best system to maintain economic growth and democracy then warren is the better candidate for you or do you believe that capitalism is inherently unjust inherently unstable then sanders is the right fit berman said prominent writers on the left argue this ideological divide has played out in practice too in january the intercept s zaid jilani wrote for jacobin when warren says that the primary difference between sanders and herself is that she s a proponent of capitalism it s not just rhetoric her life s work has been to make markets more competitive and equitable not to redistribute money from the rich to the poor and remove big chunks of economic life from the private sector to the problem is not so much that the rules are rigged so people can t become entrepreneurs or that regulators need to be empowered to act on behalf of the public the problem is that the government is not doing enough to bypass the private sector to directly deliver funds and services to the poor and working class this difference goes a long way to explain how warren and sanders present themselves on the campaign trail as warren brands herself has the progressive policy wonk ready and eager to dive deeply into each of her many intricately crafted proposals sanders pivots back to his political revolution this all goes back to what bruenig writes in the washington post for a number of reasons alienation and disengagement among the electorate and the extraordinary power of big business and finance over government doesn t believe that even the cleverest most uniformly applied regulations will solve what he views as a political and economic crisis the fight for a living wage sanders s campaign is sending people to join workers on the picket lines ending the united states involvement in the war in yemen sanders said his priority is to build a grassroots political movement to urge congress to act this matters because sanders and warren might be splitting votes on the left the question around whether any of this actually matters comes down to how this plays out in the polls in that vein it might make more sense to look at the democratic primary as a whole rather than as a fight between the two most progressive candidates in the race the biggest divide in the primary is not between warren and sanders but between the kind of economic and political world view currently being espoused by biden the leading candidate and the progressive wing of the party the movement inspired and organized by sanders and his team has more potential to reshape global politics than anything since fdr ryan grim the washington bureau chief at the intercept tweeted but warren is an ally of that movement not its enemy if that gets confused the whole project could collapse there is enough evidence to show so far that voters interested in progressive ideas are beginning to split between sanders and warren recently warren has been challenging sanders no 2 spot in the polls behind biden her numbers have been rising both in the democratic primary field and in the head to head matchups against trump in the latter she still lags sanders something his advisers point to in making the case for sanders over warren it s early but it will be important to watch how these two campaigns interact with each other in the months ahead correction sanders despite opposing direct cash payments for reparations did say in april he would support researching the idea if elected president
italy is now experiencing its third recession in a decade its economy s downward trajectory increasingly resembling dante s descent into his inferno s nine circles of hell minus the prospects of ultimate redemption following the eu rule book to which it promised compliance has asphyxiated italy s domestic demand and exports and resulted not just in economic stagnation and a generalized productivity slowdown but in relative and absolute decline in many major dimensions of economic activity writes economist servaas storm the sovereign bond buying program initiated by the european central bank ecb president mario draghi likely prevented the destruction of europe s capital and credit markets and therefore saved the monetary union as the monopoly issuer the ecb was the only institution that could credibly make the pledge to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro but draghi s monetary gymnastics have been singularly ineffective in restoring his native country s economic growth because the ecb s aid is tied to the continued embrace of fiscal austerity by the recipient national governments this condition was introduced to allay berlin s concerns that profligates such as italy would otherwise get a free ride on prevailing low german interest rates which in theory would enable their governments to spend away without consequence thereby creating a potential weimar 2 0 within the eurozone as a whole far from creating hyperinflation however the arbitrary fiscal rules governing the european monetary union emu are actually exacerbating existing disparities by locking countries like italy into further deflationary impoverishment the obvious solution would be to model the eu on a true federal fiscal union such as the united states canada or australia and therefore better align the political institutional arrangements with economic needs that was a step too far when the treaty on european union aka the maastricht treaty was ratified to further european integration in 1992 given intensifying strains between the eu s historically closest allies today the political conditions to create a viable supranational fiscal union are even more problematic there are however other ways to resolve italy s economic stagnation that rationally get us beyond this mindless adherence to the emu rulebook in a recent interview in the italian publication libero quotidiano former prime minister silvio berlusconi mooted the introduction of a parallel domestic currency the so called mini bills of treasury mini bots for short which would in theory allow italy to exit austerity without exiting the eurozone italy s five star lega coalition government has also embraced the idea the ecb and the european commission predictably oppose the mini bot s introduction seeing it as an existential threat to the single currency and a means of avoiding the fiscal rules established at its creation are these fears justified or can it work what are the potential consequences and what forces stand in its way the ongoing obduracy of brussels to any unconventional proposal that goes beyond its tired stability and growth pact the sgp the fiscal rulebook governing membership in the single currency union potentially represents an even greater existential threat to the euro than italy s proposed new fiscal experiment much like captain bligh s promise that the beatings will continue until morale improves the european commission s overreaction ignores the fact that the economics behind the mini bot are sound they are grounded in a theory known as chartalism chartalists argue that currencies become money because of the active involvement of the state predicating his functional finance approach on neo chartalist insights the american economist abba lerner made the following argument in his essay on money and taxation in the 1947 edition of the american economic review the modern state can make anything it chooses generally acceptable as money it is true that a simple declaration that such and such is money will not do even if backed by the most convincing constitutional evidence of the state s absolute sovereignty but if the state is willing to accept the proposed money in payment of taxes and other obligations to itself the trick is done emphasis mine lerner s key insight is that in a post gold standard world fiat currency has no intrinsic value per se money is tax driven and its value comes from the state s imposition and enforcement of a tax liability on its citizens which in turn creates the demand for people to hold it and use it as the principal economic means of exchange the key proviso is that the state alone has the capacity to determine what is necessary to pay taxes and likewise it alone has a monopoly on enforcing that tax liability two private parties can agree to use any form of payment that they like e g a cryptocurrency but they cannot mandate using this unit of account to pay taxes only the state can do that determining what constitutes legal tender for the settlement of tax liabilities opens up considerably more fiscal policy space for a national government hence the appeal to rome as their proposed mini bot would give italy s government more policy options to generate an economic expansion commensurate with higher incomes and more job growth there are past instances of parallel currencies operating alongside and in support of the national currencies these have been particularly effective during periods of acute economic distress for example in argentina as the financial crisis deepened after 2000 local governments began to issue patacones bonds with interest as local currencies to pay workers and suppliers as rob parenteau and i noted utility companies began to accept them knowing they could pay part of their taxes with them and acceptance spread even to international corporations such as mcdonald s emphasis mine in the same paper we also highlighted multiple examples of parallel scrip operating at the same time in the united states during the 1920s these were used interchangeably and included gold certificates redeemable in gold coin until fdr s prohibition on private citizens holding gold silver certificates redeemable for coin or bullion national bank notes issued by us government chartered banks with equivalent face value of bonds deposited by bank at treasury united states notes issued directly by treasury and also called legal tender notes but with no backing federal reserve notes redeemable in gold on demand at treasury or in gold or lawful money at any federal reserve bank until fdr s prohibition when it was just declared legal tender redeemable in lawful money at the fed or treasury in none of these cases did the countries concerned experience hyperinflation nor did these quasi currencies actually undermine the existence of the prevailing national currency so on the face of it there is nothing in the mini bot proposal per se which would suggest that it constituted an existential threat to the euro or indeed to italy s monetary system in fact quite the opposite if it is a success as it could establish a workable template for other distressed member states assuming the tacit support of brussels which could otherwise undermine it in conjunction with the ecb as any greek could attest the latter qualifier is key as the mini bot remains highly controversial both politically and legally in terms of the latter many such as lorenzo codogno a former chief economist at the italian treasury claim that the introduction of a parallel domestic currency would contravene the terms of the european monetary union treaty the maastricht treaty itself was not explicit on this point see here for the alternative view from one of the co designers of the euro bernard lietaer who advocated for parallel currencies the real concern is political a view typified by riccardo puglisi an economist at the university of pavia puglisi sees the mini bot not as a complement to the euro but rather as a way to facilitate the exit of italy from the eurozone those who share puglisi s suspicions are not without cause given the number of members in the italian cabinet who are explicitly anti euro notably the minister of the interior matteo salvini also the leader of the lega party in the governing coalition concerns remain that salvini regards the mini bot as a means of engineering a full exit from the euro in furtherance of his party s broader nationalist populist agenda so we have the makings of a battle between the custodians of the currency notably the european central bank versus italian populists and other anti euro supporters of the nation state many of whom are calculating that brussels will ultimately yield on austerity on the grounds that the alternative an italexit would represent a greater threat to the single currency and indeed a catastrophic step back from an ever closer union salvini s view is by no means the definitive one in the italian coalition neither its technocrat prime minister giuseppe conte nor the italian president sergio mattarella supports full on exit from the emu to avoid a split or constitutional crisis on the issue which could force new elections rome is therefore currently trying to have it both ways arguing that since there has been no legislation to turn the mini bot into authentic legal tender it therefore does not represent a violation of eurozone membership the vote taken on the mini bot was classified as non binding but ultimately if the mini bot is tacitly sanctioned for use in tax payments by the coalition government it does constitute legal tender in practice this is the very essence of what turns the instrument from a being a simple iou between two private transacting parties to something with much broader national fiscal implications therefore the coalition is walking a fine line between on the one hand proposing a policy designed both to secure a broader national consensus and to mobilize credit badly needed to generate economic recovery and on the other hand risking widespread bank runs if the italian public begins to fear that the mini bot does in fact represent the first step toward exit from the single currency there are no signs of bank runs yet and lo spread the gap between italian and german bond yields has not significantly widened to dangerous levels even though it has recently expanded so far it doesn t appear as if the markets are yet taking the italian government s proposal too seriously and based on the coalition s own past fiscal timidity perhaps this is rational the problem is that absent support from the ecb and the european commission former greek finance minister yanis varoufakis who tried to introduce something similar in greece gives a taste of the likely outcome based on his own country s tussle with brussels and the ecb once these short term notes trade on the open market they would become a de facto currency a new lira in waiting italy would have a split monetary system the euro would unravel from within my guess is that the ecb would first ration and then cut off target2 support for the bank of italy if the italian government still didn t fall into line capital controls would be the inevitable result as well as outright expulsion from the single currency argues varoufakis the question is who gets hurt more in these circumstances the italian government which would now have full fiscal freedom to counteract the impact from expulsion or the creditor nations of the euro consider that french banks hold around 385 billion of italian debt derivatives credit commitments and guarantees on their balance sheets while german banks are holding 126 billion of italian debt as of q3 2018 according to a bank for international settlements bis report cited by servaas storm in his appropriately titled article how to ruin a country in three decades an italexit could therefore generate a european wide banking crisis in the past whenever a country has breached the rules of the sgp a kabuki like ritual has been played out much like the old soviet union joke they pretend to pay us and we pretend to work the brussels based european commission issues a rebuke to the offending country which after token resistance for home political consumption eventually responds and promises to adopt spending cuts to bring them back into compliance these cuts if they are in fact implemented become self defeating in practice because they can deflate economic growth absent an improvement in exports or an expansion of private debt which is difficult to do when both borrowers and lenders are already stressed the problem becomes worse as stagnation is perpetuated and public debt levels continue to rise via rising unemployment less taxpayer revenue and correspondingly increased social welfare payments italy is a perfect illustration of this conundrum as storm argues the country did more than make token efforts to comply after 1992 italy did more than most other eurozone members to satisfy emu conditions in terms of self imposed fiscal consolidation structural reform and real wage restraint the reward perpetual economic stagnation including the onset of yet another recession today storm quantifies the overall damage until the early 1990s italy enjoyed decades of relatively robust economic growth during which it managed to catch up with other eurozone nations in income per person in 1960 italy s per capita gdp at constant 2010 prices was 85 of french per capita gdp and 74 of weighted average per capita gdp in belgium france germany and the netherlands the euro 4 economies by the mid 1990s italy had almost caught up with france italian gdp per person equaled 97 of french per capita income and also with the euro 4 italian gdp per capita was 94 of per capita gdp in the euro 4 this growth however was reversed in the 1990s as italy increasingly embraced the reforms demanded for membership in the single currency union the result of such policies as storm highlights is that the income gap between italy and france is now as of 2018 18 percentage points which is more than what it was in 1960 italian gdp per capita is 76 of per capita gdp in the euro 4 economies hence the rise of the current populist government what is harder to understand is why this populist backlash paradoxically coexists uneasily with ongoing support among italians to remain in the emu the answer appears to be because many italians associate the old national currency the lira with italy s sordid history a country long synonymous with political corruption the widespread infiltration of organized crime in short a bizarro world that often appears to be the antithesis of a national development state to provide one illustration italy has the highest proportion of small businesses in europe the employment laws discourage the formation of medium to large businesses which facilitates infiltration by organized crime syndicates because small shops and businesses are easy prey for them large companies such as eni or telecom italia do not pay a mafia tax but virtually every family owned business does this is not the eu s doing but a homegrown problem that many fear would become even worse if italy was left to its own devices again all of which largely explains why so many italians still tolerate the country s economic serfdom under brussels however this may be a classic instance of the population confusing correlation with causality as dysfunctional as italy was in the bad old days its economy still grew and living standards improved in both absolute and relative terms in spite of the mafia domestic terrorism or widespread political corruption what changed post the maastricht treaty and the corresponding introduction of the euro was the reversal of italy s rising living standards the country s older political and social pathologies still remain unresolved membership in the single currency union didn t help there the only thing that changed was that the replacement of the lira with the euro turned a once sovereign nation into a quasi colony forced into a seemingly perpetual fiscal straitjacket consequently italy now has the worst of both worlds rome still has a few months before it has to respond to the brussels report which could ultimately lead to the coalition government facing significant financial penalties if it fails to implement the requisite budget cuts to comply with the eurozone s fiscal rules the government has already rejected the threat but that s also nothing new as the two sides went through this same dance with brussels just last autumn there is however a new complicating variable today the current ecb president an italian mario draghi is stepping down in october so we ll be in a situation in which a new ecb president possibly a german jens weidmann will have his her credibility immediately tested at a time when an increasingly powerful populist government s own mandate to deliver growth could well be at stake perhaps much as it was the lifelong anti communist president richard nixon who initiated america s opening to the people s republic of china we need an anti inflation ordo liberal german as head of the ecb to facilitate real change in the eurozone that would certainly make the political calculus less predictable the outcomes more binary a disaster or a blessing argues martin wolf of the financial times the phony war will end soon the parallel currency at least offers a fresh approach to reverse italy s relative economic decline however the european commission s reluctance to tolerate any degree of experimentation its politically tone deaf browbeating of the italian government to fall into line with prevailing economic orthodoxy actually feeds the anti establishment and anti euro forces now politically ascendant in italy the ingredients are therefore in place for a conflict as serious as any that has taken place in europe during the past half century lest more creative economic statesmanship is demonstrated in the months ahead

this is a good development i strongly appreciate a u s president who believes in the intelligence of the u s voter to understand what is taking place president trump is not selling the u s electorate short on their ability to understand the financial dynamic of globalists vs nationalists president trump is calling attention to currency manipulation by china and the eu in the big picture what these global economies are doing is trying to offset president trump s america first policy there are trillions at stake and when you stand back and evaluate the scale of economic cost in this process you begin to recognize the severity of ideology and history of controlled financial manipulation by lowering the value of their currency china and the eu are attempting to block the impact of tariffs against their export position lowering the price of chinese yuan renminbi or euro makes their exports cheaper to a stronger u s dollar this is what has been happening for the past six months there are trillions at stake despite what the wall street financial pundits have been saying we have been importing their manufactured deflation for six months u s consumers are not paying the tariffs on imported goods the devaluation of currency is why costs of import goods are actually less year over year dollar strong this is a strategy on their part to counter trump tariffs etc the globalist economies are trying to wait out trump 2020 we see the evidence of this in the cpi import prices source link a stronger dollar and a weakened euro or yuan or any other currency makes the imported goods cost less paid in dollars this offsets any tariff impact and keeps the u s prices low in essence we are importing deflation stand back and contemplate the scale of globalist ideology at work in this dynamic the nations that devalue their currency drive up inflation within their own economy in german france etc and or in china bread cheese butter or basically any product costs more people within those economies pay more for their stuff as the central planning group drive down the value of their currency it hurts the internal citizens of the country doing the devaluation inflation hurts them their wages buy less stuff costs them more but the big club within the domestic economy doesn t care about the cost to their citizens they are trying to fight trump in an effort to carry out their globalist ideological fight to stop trump from reclaiming wealth through new trade positions and the return of blue collar manufacturing these nations are willing to subsidize an effort to retain status even if it means hurting their own citizens in the process bottom line they are driving down their own currency trying to defeat u s policies while waiting out trump 2020 and hoping he is defeated so long as the devalued nations trade among themselves the lower value of their currency doesn t necessarily cost them anything however as soon as they engage with the non manipulated currency ie usa where the currency is not devalued their lowered currency costs them a bunch in the short term their exports to the u s drop in cost and we import their deflation however in turn they cannot afford to purchase u s products and this can hurt our exports fortunately the u s economy is not necessarily dependent on exports we use around 80 of the stuff we make or generate internally but with a higher dollar u s agricultural exports go up in price hence the big ag multinationals rail against trump the moves by china and the eu to lower their currency makes our exports more expensive in turn this effect becomes fuel for the big club multinationals wall street to rail against president trump again this is all part of the globalist plan to defeat trump within this dynamic u s inflation is low because the prices for durable good imports are now intentionally lowered simultaneously the prices of perishable goods remains low because the domestic supply is being exported less cth predicted this dynamic back in 2016 when we said the prices of imports would not rise even with tariffs and the prices of domestics would likely fall it s one of the key reasons we said u s inflation would be detached from massive growth in the u s economy in essence the entire world of suppliers are trying to keep the u s economy as customers for imported goods they desperately don t want to see the u s take their jobs back into america right now an american worker with higher wages can buy imported stuff cheap and can also travel cheap if desired our dollar is strong again 80 of our gdp is internal we are generally a self sufficient nation that is our strength but the globalists can only hold out so long before their intentionally constructed anti trump dynamic makes their own citizens misery so bad they will grab the pitchforks the globalists are hoping they don t have to wait longer than november 2020 there are trillions at stake

insecurity can cause revolution if unchecked lawyer and rights activist mr femi falana san in this interview with adebisi onanuga and robert egbe speaks on how the government can tackle insecurity would you say the governments of the various states have done enough in ensuring the security and properties of their people if not how can this be achieved only a few state governments are assisting the police to provide security for the people it is regrettable to note all the governors have abdicated their powers to supervise the police the nigerian police council is constitutionally empowered to administer organise and supervise the nigeria police force that body is constituted by the president inspector general of police chairman of police service and the 36 governors but the council does not function it held its second meeting in four years last week for the purpose of approving the appointment of the acting inspector general of the police mr ibrahim adamu since the body is moribund its powers have been taken over by every sitting president since 1999 governors are not as helpless when it comes to the maintenance of law and order in any state in the country if state governments cannot establish state police why are governors not making a case for adequate number of police men and women to provide security for the people in their states why is security vote not spent on the security of the people but pocketed by some governors why are the state attorneys general not prosecuting the criminal elements arrested by the police and other security agencies from time to time the special armed robbery squad otherwise called sars is fully funded by state governments but why have the governors failed to protect the people from the intimidation of the sars in the states do you know that it is the exclusive responsibility of state attorneys general to prosecute cases of culpable homicide or murder kidnapping banditry and armed robbery south africa held a general election a fortnight ago the following day all electoral offenders arrested by the police were arraigned in court our own election was concluded about three months ago hundreds of electoral offenders were arrested but they have not been charged with any offence we just cannot maintain law and order in an atmosphere of impunity between the north and the south where would you say insecurity is higher even with allegations of fulanisation and islamisation the crisis of insecurity is worse in the northern part of the country than the south with insurgency in the northeast banditry in the northwest and kidnapping in the northcentral life has completely collapsed in many areas in the north of course the buhari administration has been completely overwhelmed by the murderous activities of armed gangs i believe that it is the unpardonable failure of the federal government to address the crisis of insecurity in the country that has led to the diversionary campaign of stigmatising the criminal elements that have subjected the people in all states of the federation to intimidation therefore let the federal government and the various state governments address the serious security challenge facing the country by funding the police to secure the life and property of every person living in nigeria in your view how did boko haram emerge in the country the boko haram sect emerged through the criminal negligence of the federal government under former president obasanjo s watch specifically in 2000 governor sanni yerima announced that he was going to proclaim the sharia law in zamfara state based on section 10 of the constitution which provides that the state shall not adopt any official religion as a state policy the human rights community requested the then attorney general of the federation and minister of justice the late chief bola ige san to challenge the dangerous agenda of governor yerima at the supreme court chief ige agreed and was determined to test the constitutional validity of the adoption of sharia law in zamfara state but president obasanjo kicked against the proposed legal action hence governor yerima proclaimed the sharia law since the governor had his way other muslim governors in other states in the north followed suit they did not want to be accused of infidelity and thereby lose the 2003 election of course the adoption of the sharia law led to civil disturbances and ethno religious crises which claimed many lives in some of the states but in the implementation of the sharia law in the muslim dominated northern states the poor people were subjected to brutal capital punishment for stealing adultery etc the sharia courts convicted some poor people and sentenced them to death by stoning and cutting of hands even though the massive campaign of the global human rights community stopped the implementation of the sharia law many groups of young people had emerged to enforce the sharia law and turned nigeria into an islamic state one of such groups is the boko haram sect in fact one of the governors in the northeast region funded the boko haram sect and used the group for his re election in 2003 the fellow has since decamped from the pdp to the apc to shield himself from prosecution it is on record that the obasanjo administration did nothing to stop such brazen manipulation of religion to the detriment of peace and political stability in the country it was the umaru yar adua administration that belatedly declared war on the boko haram sect in 2009 but at that material time the sect had already recruited thousands of young people equipped and mobilised them to fight for the creation of an islamic republic in nigeria following the betrayal of africa by nigeria and south africa at the security council of the united nations the west decided to invade libya under president muamar gaddafi the military invasion of the country and the removal of gaddafi from office led to the looting of the armoury of the well fortified country since nigeria foolishly failed to buy off the looted weapons the boko haram sect bought them and set up a powerful army what is your view on claims by former president obasanjo that boko haram is not about western education but is for fulanisation and islamisation of african countries of which nigeria is a part the boko haram sect has never hidden its plan to turn nigeria into a muslim state its dubious policy is to islamise any area annexed or conquered by its well equipped army it has been confirmed that the satanic sect has linked up with the islamic state of iraq and syria that is isis the most notorious terrorist organisation in the world but as majority of the members of the sect are of the kanuri ethnic nationality it has nothing to do with fulanisation of west africa or africa as alleged by chief olusegun obasanjo but the dreaded group is out to islamise west africa i am of the strong view that if the nigerian armed forces are well equipped and well motivated they can defeat the dreaded body instead of relying on foreign governments after all boko haram once annexed and controlled about 27 local government areas in the country in fact the bombing of cities in kano gombe kaduna niger states and the federal capital territory which was prevalent under the jonathan administration has been curtailed by the current administration but since bombing has continued in the northeast region the boko haram sect cannot be said to have been defeated even if degraded however i read recently in the social media that the fulani herders have invaded the southwest region and have created not less than 1 300 cells in the forests i want to believe that chief obasanjo s latest outburst was informed by such campaigns in the social media whoever knows the location of the fulani cells should expose them to the security forces i have the list of all the kidnappers arrested and paraded by the police in the last four years from the list i have found that the majority of the criminal elements including armed robbers kidnappers and other nihilists terrorising people in the southwest region are of the yoruba extraction the dangerous impression should therefore not be created that all the kidnappers and other violent criminals operating in the southwest are of the fulani extraction alone the country is still battling boko haram insurgency do you agree with claims that the sect festered because the present administration has failed in curtailing it being a former military commander and an ex military dictator majority of nigerians had thought that president buhari would deal with the menace of insurgency in a decisive manner with respect it does appear that the president only relies on briefing from the service chiefs having defended some members of the armed forces who were charged with mutiny and other war crimes before courts martial i can say without any fear of contradiction that the war on terror is being prosecuted by ill motivated and ill equipped nigerian troops to compound the crisis the troops in the battle front seriously believe that the bulk of the funds earmarked for the counter insurgency is being diverted there is also the allegation of internal sabotage arising from the refusal of president buhari to replace the service chiefs who no longer command respect and loyalty in the armed forces the other day the chief of army staff denied any plan by the armed forces to organise a coup and sack the civilian regime with due respect the assurance is not sufficient since the constitution has decreed that the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government the buhari administration has an urgent duty to deal decisively with the menace of terrorism banditry kidnapping armed robbery poverty and reckless looting of the treasury by unpatriotic public officers that is the only antidote against coup de tat and anarchy in the country what should be done to bring the boko haram menace under control the boko haram sect has continued to attract many young people to its fold on account of pervading illiteracy and poverty in the north in other words the disenchantment of the youth has enhanced the recruitment policy of the boko haram sect in the southern part of the country unemployed youths including fresh graduates have joined armed robbery and kidnap groups to terrorise innocent people in the society others are involved in illegal yahoo yahoo business a couple of years ago only 28 candidates sat for the wasc examination in zamfara state that means that the state that first proclaimed the sharia law did not promote the education of the children of the poor are you surprised that bandits have virtually taken over the state when the crisis started former governor abdullahi yari said the people were being punished by allah because of their involvement in fornication can you believe that nonsensical statement or will you say that zamfara state is being fulanised or islamised out of the 36 states in the country 12 northern states have refused to adopt the child s right law on the ground that it is against the islamic religion which aspect of the islamic religion say that the children of the poor should not be allowed to acquire basic education in a state where the rulers are sending their own children to expensive schools at home and abroad unfortunately the insurgents and bandits are recruiting the children of the poor who have been kept away from school by the state governments that are also opposed to the child s right law even though the obasanjo regime spent 16 billion to generate darkness here egypt has just delivered 14 000 megawatts of electricity with 9 billion is egypt not a leading muslim state the united states and other western countries are preparing to wage a war against iran for acquiring nuclear power is iran not a muslim state in the first place the nation needs fresh ideas to combat terrorism secondly the federal government should equip and upgrade the capacity of the armed forces to defend the nation s territorial integrity thirdly the people in the northeast region should be fully mobilised and enlisted in prosecuting the war on terror furthermore the welfare of the troops has to be urgently addressed you cannot win any modern war with outdated equipment no serious nation can send troops to the battle front when their lives are not insured you cannot expect the best performance from troops whose family members are abandoned if they are killed in the front the boko haram sect is preaching the ideology of hate but the federal government has no plan to demystify the sect and expose its fake ideology to the youth the country has had to deal with issues of herdsmen and others how can all these be curtailed the violent clashes between herders and farmers is not an african phenomenon i am sure that chief obasanjo is not unaware that the problem has been addressed scientifically by many african countries specifically countries like ethiopia kenya mozambique and botswana have established ranches where the herders take care of their cattle in those african countries herders and cattle are restricted to the ranches it may interest you to know that botswana has a population of 1 2 million people but the cattle population is 2 8 million but with ranches botswana is the largest producer and exporter of meat in africa so it is primitive to be talking of grazing routes and anti grazing laws in this age and time i expect serious minded leaders to embark on the establishment of ranches in nigeria instead of whipping up ethnic and religious sentiments of course the buhari administration should be held responsible for its failure to establish ranches by the way in the first republic there were ranches in the country set up and maintained in mokwa in niger state akunnu in ondo state and obudu in cross river state they were maintained by the regimes of ahmadu bello obafemi awolowo and nnamdi azikwe under the yakubu gowon regime the audu bako regime in kano state had many functional ranches in 2014 the jonathan administration dispatched some young nigerians to botswana to learn animal husbandry particularly ranching they trained and came back the n100 billion released to state governments to build ranches was diverted as the ranches were not built the young people who had been trained were left in the lurch in 2016 the buhari administration embraced ranching as a policy fifty five thousand hectares of land were acquired from 11 states in the north for the establishment of ranches but not a single one has been built hence the violent clashes between farmers and herders have continued unabated do you agree with the view that the fulanis and other tribes from the north should be held responsible for high incidences of crime in southern states of the country for goodness sake why are some people deceiving the victims of the criminal negligence of the neocolonial state under president obasanjo no fewer than 20 000 people were killed in ethno religious violence in the country were the fulanis alone responsible for the mindless killings on one occasion the can in the jos area protested the incessant killing of its members the visiting president obasanjo said can my foot certainly the fulanis were not responsible for the military attacks on the unarmed people of odi zaki biam and gbaramotu we have become so helpless that a former security chief who was alleged to have been involved in the bombing of the critics of thieving military dictators have suddenly become the defender of the security of the southwest zone i once tasked a governor in the southeast zone to stop demolishing the homes of suspected kidnappers without subjecting them to trial in lagos state we have witnessed the robbing of banks by marine armed robbers the kidnapping of secondary students the kidnapping of business people who were forced to pay ransom in dollars euros and pounds sterling the information extracted from police diary confirmed that such high level criminal offences were not committed by the fulanis but by southerners instead of holding the government fully responsible for insecurity in the southern and northern parts of the country why should we descend to the level of stigmatising criminal elements on the basis of their religion and ethnicity are the defenders of the southwest region not aware that all the armed robbers and kidnappers have pastors and imams and even babalawos and marabouts who pray for them before every nefarious operation many of the people who were kidnapped and freed have attested to the fact that majority of the kidnappers speak flawless english can such well educated people be fulani kidnappers mind you i am not making a case for kidnappers who are of the fulani ethnic group do you know that we have reached a dangerous level where members of the security agencies collect ransom to deliver to kidnappers the point i am labouring to make is that the kidnappers and armed robbers terrorising our people in the north and the south are made up of all nationalities and religions in the country they should be arrested and prosecuted period nigeria is said to be responsible for the appreciable percentage of global crimes how can nigeria check global crimes like laundering given her bad image global crimes are largely caused by imperialism for instance under the pretext of fighting terrorism the united states and her allies invaded afghanistan iraq and libya the west is involved in the war in syria the trump regime is planning to invade iran and venezuela other nations that are semi independent are invaded through the international monetary fund and the world bank which insist on the implementation of neo liberal polices like currency devaluation capital flight privatisation removal of subsidies from social service etc the millions of people who are victimised by the poverty and inequality caused by capitalism have been turned into refugees and migrants in western countries others have embraced terrorism hence the rising wave of violent crimes on a global scale since nigeria operates a peripheral capitalist system manned by incompetent rent collectors the situation is bound to be pretty worse i can say without any fear of contradiction that the anarchy that is ongoing is a mere rehearsal for the bloody revolution that has become inevitable do you share the view that former heads of intelligent agencies and ex service chiefs should be invited to help tackle insecurity with due respect if the former rulers and former service chiefs had institutionalised an effective security system for the country we would not be in the mess in which we have found ourselves if these former rulers are not on trial yet for the crimes against humanity committed through wanton corruption and abuse of office when they were in power they should stop giving the highly erroneous impression that they have solutions to the problems created by them by the way there are some fora established by law through which former presidents can render advice on a range of issues for instance former presidents are members of the council of state chaired by the incumbent president and one of the functions of the council is to advise the president on national security or the maintenance of public order in the country however such advice is usually rejected when former presidents insist rather arrogantly that they are the repository of knowledge and wisdom by the way no nation consults former presidents who had wasted the opportunity to fix problems but engaged in the criminal diversion of huge fund earmarked for the purchase of military equipment last november you said an organisation of which you are a member would begin to take street kids off the streets and move them to the government houses unless government sees to their welfare why did you say this and what is the update on the matter what is the name of that organisation i belong to a new political movement called the peoples alternative which has decided to ensure that every child of school age is enrolled in school to acquire free and compulsory basic education in line with the provisions of the child s right law we are going to commence the experiment in lagos state with a view to stopping street trading by children of school age the only way we can do that effectively is to draw the attention of the government to its duty to every child by ensuring that they are enrolled in school this is in accordance with the child s right act which has been adopted and enacted into law by the lagos state government we have also joined other progressive organisations to campaign and mobilise the 12 states that have not enacted the child s right law to do so while we are monitoring its implementation by states that have adopted and enacted the law in this regard we are in touch with the universal basic education commission which provides us with information very regularly how do you rate the performance of the asset management corporation of nigeria amcon on the recovery of bad loans and assets of debtors the modus operandi of the amcon has made it impossible for the recovery of the loans amcon appoints receiver managers who take over companies with ex parte court orders armed with such orders the receiver managers embark on closing down factories and offices for months and sometimes for years at the end of the day the companies collapse workers lose their jobs while the debts continue to pile up in the books of the banks so amcon has become an undertaker of companies that are indebted to banks amcon is reportedly facing difficult challenges on the disposal of recovered assets of high obligators which book value stood at n182billion is selling of these assets the best way to go on account of the comatose state of the economy there are no buyers for seized assets some of the seized goods are perishable it is another area where the amcon has to be creative the seized assets should be auctioned in a transparent manner instead of warehousing them to await highest bidders some of the properties should be farmed out to be managed by credible estate companies seized vehicles should be auctioned instead exposing them to bad weather and wasting them if cases are pending in court sell the vehicles and bank the proceed in an interest yielding account whoever wins the cases should claim the money what is your reaction to government s threat to go after high profile obligators of cbn in a renewed attempt to recover bad bank debts it will not work in the words of the late president fidel castro of cuba some of the debts are unrecoverable the loans were taken when the exchange rate was n150 to a dollar through secret devaluation by the central bank a dollar now sells for n360 it is unfair and immoral to insist on payment at n360 if the exchange rate was n150 when the loan was taken i know an airline that was taken over by amcon through a receiver manager at the time it was taken over the airline had 10 aircraft and about 2 000 staff instead of acquiring part of the shares of the airline and paying for same to keep the company in business amcon injected billions of public funds to run the company after a year of receivership the workforce has been reduced to about 1 000 while the fleet of aircraft has been reduced to three very soon the airline will have no aircraft left and will be liquidated like the nigeria airways meanwhile the loans are mounting frankly speaking amcon has to review its strategy as it is not working in the interest of the economy how do you think amcon should best handled these assets if the idea is to make up for bad loans the law setting up the asset management corporation of nigeria ought to be reviewed without any further delay we had the failed bank tribunal decree promulgated by one of the former military dictators which ensured substantial recovery of bank loans and the prosecution of indicted bank officials and their collaborators for sabotaging the national economy what the system requires is an effective investigation department of the amcon and a special division of the federal high court to handle cases of the toxic debts with dispatch amcon cannot recover the outstanding debts of n5 4 trillion allegedly owed by less about 350 individuals and companies in the federal high court as it is highly congested with other cases right now some of the judges have been posted to election petition tribunals for six months you once advised amcon to stop selling seized assets and sealing of company premises of high profile obligators what would you suggest as best practices for debt recovery by amcon i have always advised governments against the closure of business premises if the objective is to recover loans the businesses involved should be allowed to continue to run and thrive why should you lock up a hospital because the proprietor took a loan from a bank to build it why should a cinema house in a city be closed down because of a bad debt how can you lock up a farm that produces rice which is in high demand since companies are being given loans to produce rice for the nation why should amcon not apply for fresh loans from boi or the agricultural bank to run the company under a new management instead of ruining businesses by locking them up amcon should look out for competent hands to operate companies in receivership so that they can repay their loans for me that is the best recovery strategy

the european central bank could unleash more stimulus if the economy doesn t pick up soon its president warned tuesday sparking a sharp drop in the euro and drawing an angry tweet from u s president donald trump mario draghi told a conference in sintra portugal that the ecb was not resigned in its quest to perk up the economy and said that in the absence of improvement additional stimulus will be required europe s top central banker even held out the prospect of cutting interest rates though they are already at record lows further cuts in policy rates remain part of our tools he said draghi noted it was also possible to re start a bond buying stimulus program that had been halted only in december investors read the comments as a clear step toward more stimulus in coming months causing stock markets to rally and sending the euro lower against the dollar draghi s statement was met with anger from trump who suggested it was an effort to boost european exports by weakening the currency trump wrote on twitter that the lower euro was making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others asked about the tweet by a conference moderator draghi said that the european central bank was ready to use all available tools to achieve its mandate of stable prices and added that we do not target the exchange rate the euro traded at 1 1187 by late afternoon in europe down from 1 1241 before draghi s speech germany s main stock index surged over 2 rate cuts and monetary stimulus are aimed at loosening credit for businesses and consumers and at the same time can send a currency s exchange rate lower since stimulus measures can do both it can be a matter of debate about how much intent there was to lower the currency a weaker euro can give european exporters a price advantage over u s businesses trump has cited the currency issue in his criticism of europe over what he describes as unfair trade practices talk of re starting stimulus comes only six months after the ecb phased out a 2 6 trillion euro 2 9 trillion bond purchase program that pumped new money into the economy over almost four years in an attempt to drive inflation higher the ecb s shift to a pro stimulus stance mirrors that of the u s federal reserve which has halted a series of interest rate hikes fed chair jay powell has said that the fed is prepared to respond if it decides the u s china trade conflict is threatening the u s economy investors read his remarks as a signal that the fed will likely cut interest rates this year both the ecb and the fed which holds a policy meeting tuesday and wednesday have cited similar reasons for their policy shift the threat of a softening global economy if trump and the chinese don t reach agreement on trade any rate cuts by the fed could in theory add to pressure on the ecb if they result in a weaker dollar against the euro eurozone inflation of 1 2 is below the european central bank s goal of just under 2 considered best for the economy while growth prospects are under pressure from uncertainty about issues such as the u s china trade dispute which could lead to more tariffs and less trade there is also no clarity on the terms of britain s planned departure from the european union draghi said that in the absence of stronger inflation additional stimulus will be required and that the bank would use all the flexibility in our mandate to push inflation toward the goal the remarks largely echoed statements at his news conference following the bank s last policy meeting on june 6 on tuesday he emphasized that bank officials are not resigned to having a low rate of inflation forever or even now at the june 6 meeting the central bank extended the earliest date for an interest rate increase from year end to the middle of next year the bank s key policy rates are at record lows zero for lending to banks and minus 0 4 on deposits left overnight at the ecb by commercial banks the negative rate is a penalty aimed at pushing banks to lend the money the frankfurt based ecb sets monetary policy for the 19 european union countries that have joined the shared euro currency it tries to steer inflation by adjusting interest rate benchmarks and if needed by purchasing financial assets central bank actions have wide ranging impact on consumer pocketbooks and the finances of banks companies and governments lower rates and monetary stimulus measures mean cheaper borrowing but scantier returns for savers stimulus can also push up the prices of assets such as stocks and bonds
