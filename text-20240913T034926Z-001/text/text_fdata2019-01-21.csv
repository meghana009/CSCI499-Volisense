the imf said the forecasts for both this year and next were previously pared partly because of the negative effects of tariff increases enacted in the united states and china earlier that year the further downward revision since october in part reflects carry over from softer momentum in the second half of 2018 including in germany following the introduction of new automobile fuel emission standards and in italy where concerns about sovereign and financial risks have weighed on domestic demand but also weakening financial market sentiment as well as a contraction in turkey now projected to be deeper than anticipated the imf said the outlook remained clouded risks to global growth tilt to the downside an escalation of trade tensions beyond those already incorporated in the forecast remains a key source of risk to the outlook financial conditions have already tightened since the fall a range of triggers beyond escalating trade tensions could spark a further deterioration in risk sentiment with adverse growth implications especially given the high levels of public and private debt these potential triggers include a no deal withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european

whether his state of the union address this year is written delivered in person to congress or delivered in person elsewhere president trump should use it to launch a new program called middle class capitalism here s an overview of what that is why it s what america needs right now and why it fits trump s platform and style the economy median inflation adjusted u s wages have barely budged for 30 years this problem has especially existed during the prior two presidential administrations and it is high time we do something about it the tax reform bill is a start it made corporate tax rates competitive with the rest of the world and is causing jobs and investment dollars to stay in america but that isn t enough because of senate rules only the corporate rate cut was permanent the individual tax cut and small business tax cut were not made permanent it is time to make those cuts permanent and look for new ways to cut middle class and working class taxes that will raise wages for the average american going forward any tax cuts to business have to be paid for with cuts to wasteful spending and corporate welfare another factor suppressing american wages is the rise of oligopolies and monopsonies corporations that have too much market power over their customers or suppliers our current antitrust law uses rules crafted a century ago and now focuses too narrowly on the effects a merger or trade practice would have on near term consumer prices but anticompetitive practices also lead to lower wages for american employees due to warped markets that play out on a large scale in the long term and a stagnation in the competition that fuels american ingenuity and productivity two essential ingredients for sustainable and shared economic growth aside from lax antitrust enforcement low interest rates have allowed companies to buy competitors with cheap debt unsurprisingly corporate credit as a percent of america s economic output is at a historic high this record merger activity of the last 30 years has consolidated market power and reduced the competition within industries companies have even used cheap debt to buy up would be competitors especially in the case of the tech industry before these potential adversaries can get too powerful that s why trump should announce a new anti cartel agenda branded middle class capitalism cartels in any form should no longer be allowed our antitrust laws should be updated to fit with the 21st century economy new antitrust enforcement should with a special eye to big tech companies hamper the practice of using acquisitions to block potential competitors courts and regulators should be required to examine the effects industry consolidation has on wages paid to employees and the negotiating power a company has over its suppliers middle class capitalism isn t anti business it isn t even anti big business the simple aim is greater competition fair markets and higher wages for the american people in his address president trump should also ask congress to create a new apprenticeship program in place of a four year college degree that focuses on providing on the job technical and skilled trades education to our wonderful young people as part of this push america should invest in infrastructure specific to boosting our manufacturing base especially in urban and rural areas blighted by poverty and crime health care america s health care system is also plagued by cartels and too big a chunk of americans paychecks goes toward paying medical bills president trump s middle class capitalism agenda must aim to specifically crack down on anti competitive practices within the health care industry that reduce quality and drive up costs for consumers too often hospitals whether for profit or legally designated as not for profit seek to restrict competition outdated laws lobbied for by wealthy hospitals limit the supply of new hospitals hospitals with monopoly power have also struck secret deals with insurers which harms competition pushing up the cost of insurance and resulting in higher medical bills this directly leads to higher prices for americans in areas with less competition adding insult to injury poorly thought through provisions in obamacare also increased hospital mergers and acquisitions creating more monopolistic power that harms americans with higher prices and reduced access and reducing the incentives for doctors to open their own practice even though that leads to lower prices for consumers middle class capitalism would see this big hospital cronyism come to an end cronyism exists in other areas of health care too needlessly pushing up cost for example middle class capitalism would end the kickbacks set up between hospitals group purchasing organizations and drug companies needlessly driving up drug prices middle class capitalism would also examine drug pricing and seek to reform drug patenting rules middle class capitalism would also use simple measures to create greater competition and more transparency yes americans need more choice when buying health insurance the trump administration has worked toward this and congress needs to repeal and replace obamacare but reforms cannot end there choice doesn t just involve your health insurance company it also involves the doctor s office here the president should start out by talking about the stress everyday americans feel when they receive a medical bill in the mail we don t know what the hospital is going to charge us for or how much money the provider is going to charge for a lot of americans the amount of the bill received is always far more than they deem fair or could have imagined that s because the current system we have today at least partly caused by longstanding government incentives makes it almost impossible for consumers to easily see the price of basic health care procedures just imagine pulling things off the grocery store shelf and not being able to see the price what would happen to the cost of milk and eggs that s why one health care procedure might cost 1 000 in one hospital but cost many times as much at a hospital only miles away that s also a big reason health care costs have risen so much over the last several decades consistently outpacing the overall price increases in our economy caused by inflation it s currently almost impossible for consumers to easily see the price of basic health care procedures with more americans depending on high deductible plans it is absolutely imperative that consumers be able to shop around for basic procedures a simple solution already applied in several countries with successful free market medical systems might do the trick president trump should call on congress to mandate that providers publish the clear and standardized out of pocket prices for a routine visit to a medical professional and the clear and standardized out of pocket prices of basic procedures obamacare did include a vague provision about price transparency its implementation was heavily fought by the providers lobby and only recently put into place by the trump administration a decade later but the new price lists hospitals provide are purposefully completely unintelligible and still make it impossible to compare prices instead healthcareprice gov should be funded and set up by a new office of competition within dhhs to allow consumers to easily compare providers out of pocket prices against each other providers lobbies would raise cain but such is the behavior of an entrenched lobby coupled with this trump should push congress to expand health savings accounts a pre tax pool of money that you can use to shop around for health care finally trump should say that the american people have been lied to they have been told that republicans won t protect americans with preexisting conditions yet nothing is further from the truth people with pre existing conditions often aren t able to get health insurance through an employer instead they are stuck in the so called individual market but the tax incentive for employer provided coverage put in place by congress decades ago means that buyers in the individual market are at a disadvantage compared to everyone else the tax incentive for employer provided coverage means that buyers in the individual market are at a disadvantage compared to everyone else democrats said obamacare would fix this problem but their law opting for overcomplicated big government instead of common sense solutions attempted to hide the costs of helping americans with preexisting conditions by making younger healthier people subsidize americans with preexisting conditions when younger and healthier people decided to stay out of the individual insurance market even if that meant paying a fine costs skyrocketed and health care options decreased this hurts americans with preexisting conditions that s why the republican plan makes sure that insurance companies don t deny americans with preexisting conditions and that americans with serious health issues receive targeted assistance that is a more honest efficient and compassionate way to help americans with preexisting conditions than is found in obamacare the goal should be to bring down costs in the individual market while directly assisting poorer and older americans who have costly health issues in all these reforms we need to be compassionate health care for poor children should always be provided and should never be used as a political bargaining chip we also need to fight to make sure that medicaid the government s primary health program for poor americans actually leads to increased access and better outcomes president trump needs to point out that too often politicians are judged by their intentions instead of results in one example because providers are undercut by the medicaid program medicaid recipients in impoverished areas have insurance without real health care access in another example obamacare s expansion of medicaid to able bodied adults has crowded out resources for disabled americans who depend on the program the most in yet another states that expanded medicaid to able bodied adults have seen increased opioid abuse because for as low as a 1 co pay medicaid beneficiaries can get up to 240 oxycodone pills that can be resold for 4 000 healthcare has become a highly partisan issue but it shouldn t be ordinary americans on both sides want more affordable care and believe in markets but also want the government to help the weakest among us especially the disabled and poor children capitalism for the middle class means busting the cartels and striking a balance between compassion and affordability trade fair and reciprocal trade is also essential to the goal of driving up american wages much of america s overall wage stagnation is explained by the wage stagnation felt by americans who were or are employed in manufacturing how to fix this overall we should want lower global trade barriers to fair and reciprocal trade but two things stand in the way of that first hypocrisy is rife in china and even europe foreign leaders claim to stand for free trade but are really arguing for a system where america is at a disadvantage as of 2017 according to the world trade organization the average tariff rate in china was almost 10 percent in the european union it was over 5 percent but in america it was only 3 4 percent the only way to expose this hypocrisy is to play hardball this approach is uniquely conservative and republican don t forget that it was ronald reagan who negotiated the 1985 plaza accord which went after japan for currency manipulation and significantly reduced japan s share of america s trade deficit today the big cheater is china through hacking and other forms of espionage china steals or attempts to steal secrets from american companies on an alarming scale when american companies do business in china beijing requires that they hand over their intellectual property and china s corporate giants such as telecommunications giant huawei were entirely started by replicating american technology and know how but cracking down on chinese trade abuses won t be enough to significantly lower our trade deficit that brings us to the second thing in the way of fair and reciprocal trade economics 101 tells us that the trade deficit is a function of our federal government s overspending and too low u s household savings this is due to bad monetary policy and spendthrift politicians in washington not just bad trade deals any normal country that overspent and ran a huge trade deficit would see its currency fall sharply and suffer a loss of purchasing power the only fix would be to produce more goods that the world wanted and buy less from overseas but because the u s dollar is the world s primary reserve currency dollars flow overseas in exchange for foreign goods but are never brought back home foreign countries especially including china are content to sit on our dollars instead of using these dollars to purchase goods made in the united states this artificially suppresses the cost of foreign labor more than would be the case in a free market so the consequences for america s collective excess are placed on the shoulders of our blue collar workers again such a set up is not free trade nor is it a free market and it has disproportionately harmed blue collar americans even if america overall has benefited from trade monetary reform that s why president trump should announce that he is creating a presidential commission to examine international monetary reform and that he will work with our global partners on examining a new monetary system to better promote fair and reciprocal trade another aspect of monetary reform must be ensuring america s middle class receives a positive return on hard earned savings trump has been critical of federal reserve chairman jay powell for his rate increases as the president has judged these increases have gone too far which risks dampening economic growth for no good reason that may be the case but one of the foundations of the middle class is a positive return on savings and the ability to save money and not lose purchasing power because of inflation that s why trump should also ask that congress begin to examine domestic monetary reform as well which would include ditching the fed s 2 percent inflation targeting regime and support passing a bill to audit the federal reserve to ensure monetary policy decisions are being made with ordinary americans in mind capitalism for the middle class would finally end the practice of policy initiatives that are marketed to hurting americans but conveniently are facilitated with corporate power and result in more corporate welfare middle class capitalism isn t something new or radical it is actually something very old in america embedded in the core of who we are as witnessed by names like jackson lincoln mckinley cleveland and eisenhower it is something that has been around for a very long time we ve only just lost sight of

following two years of risk on market fervor 2018 delivered a reality check to bond investors even with new leadership the federal reserve continued to raise short term interest rates and simultaneously pared back its quantitative easing inflated balance sheet both were efforts to normalize monetary policy while u s economic data appeared strong a strengthening dollar escalating u s trade policy fears and myriad geopolitical tensions further rattled markets at points throughout the year which ended with a meager single basis point return for the bloomberg barclays u s aggregate bond index the broad intermediate term bond morningstar category lost 50 basis points for the year though funds with less duration and more tailored exposure to u s treasuries and mortgages outperformed those with a significant overweight in corporate credit jpmorgan mortgage backed securities ombix which has a morningstar analyst rating of silver was a good example of this generating a 1 8 gain for the year while gold rated western asset core plus bond wacpx lost 1 5 on the back of significantly more credit exposure and a longer duration a return to normalcy the fed s extreme measures in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis which included years of rock bottom interest rates and robust purchases of u s treasuries and mortgages provided support to a fragile economy but also left many questioning when and how the central bank would extricate itself from those programs without upsetting the apple cart a decade on the fed signaled its answers chairwoman janet yellen initiated a slow but steady increase in short term rates in late 2017 and successor jerome powell followed suit in 2018 four quarter point rate hikes in march june september and december lifted the federal funds rate to a 2 25 2 50 range its large balance sheet still under scrutiny the fed continued to pare back its u s treasury and agency mortgage holdings as well all of that activity was not lost on the treasury and agency mortgage markets the latter eked out a roughly 1 gain for the year despite the impacts of fed selling and duration extension from expectations that homeowners would pull back on refinancings the short end of the treasury curve rose steadily over 2018 while the long end refused to follow at various points even falling in the fourth quarter on balance though yield spikes in the first and third quarters resulted in a 1 8 loss for bloomberg barclays long treasury index in 2018 a reversal from its 8 5 return a year prior when riskier fare sold off in december investors piled into intermediate maturity treasuries the year end volatility also stoked speculation of an impending yield curve inversion and the possibility of a follow on recession as the spread between two and 10 year treasuries tightened to 11 basis points in mid december from 78 basis points in february on the brink nowhere were anxieties more palpable than in the corporate credit markets the prior two calendar years generated healthy returns underpinned by low interest rates and relatively muted volatility many expected the late 2017 passage of u s corporate tax reform to boost earnings and provide a counterweight to looming interest rate hikes that goldilocks outcome proved elusive in the bond markets with the size of outstanding u s corporate debt according to the securities industry and financial markets association having nearly doubled to 9 0 trillion from 5 5 trillion a decade earlier balance sheets looked more vulnerable in the face of aggressive fed tightening a surge of tariff rhetoric tossed between the united states and china also left many fearful of a trade war and erratic commodity prices a barrel of west texas intermediate oil rose to roughly 77 by late june before reversing course to 44 by late december only compounded a sense that a recession might come sooner rather than later against this backdrop investors in corporate credit became jumpy investment grade corporate bonds where treasury volatility is felt more sharply than in riskier tiers toppled 2 5 while corporate high yield slipped a less dramatic 2 1 the bank loan sector with its combination of higher credit risk and floating rate structure fared better than investment grade credit too as the s p lsta leveraged loan index returned 0 4 for the year the high yield bond category looked worse on average with a 2 6 drop in 2018 but it was marked by a range of outcomes less duration and more differentiated security selection worked in favor of some funds such as bronze rated diamond hill corporate credit dhstx which returned 0 6 those with a broad risk appetite fared much less well including silver rated fidelity capital income fagix which has held around 20 of the portfolio in equities and lost 5 8 stressed currencies and muted global growth jitters around central banking policy weren t limited to the u s in 2018 the european central bank left short term rates unchanged for the year but its leader mario draghi announced in october that the bank would pare back its asset purchases suspending the program by the end of the year bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda also signaled in remarks that it was time to limit asset purchases while intending to continue buying jpy 80 trillion a year for asset price stability in either case the signal is that tightening monetary policy is on the horizon but remains a challenge in the face of anemic global growth in japan inflation is nowhere as high as its target while the situation in europe is hampered by political tensions two populist political parties formed a governing coalition in italy but their proposed budget doesn t comply with european union guidelines and the situation has exacerbated tensions around the country s place in the trading bloc additionally a lack of agreement on the terms for the united kingdom s march 2019 exit from the eu led to contentious politicking and negotiations during 2018 but remained undefined at year s end keeping britain s economic uncertainty simmering rioters across france protested an increased gas tax and president emmanuel macron relented another clash of tensions between the reality of slow growth and a political desire to redirect a country s economic future emerging markets debt also faced challenges despite a heated economy turkey s central bank refused to raise interest rates and its currency plummeted roughly 30 relative to the u s dollar in the third quarter before capitulating with a rate hike in september argentina was running a large current account deficit and creditors became impatient over the course of 2018 ultimately the international monetary fund stepped in with a bailout package in september but by the end of the year the argentine peso lost half its value relative to the u s dollar the bloomberg barclays global aggregate index lost 1 2 for 2018 while the u s dollar hedged version of the benchmark fared better given the strengthening dollar and delivered a 1 8 gain funds with significant non u s currency exposures and emerging markets debt allocations were at a disadvantage such as silver rated brandywineglobal global opportunities bond gobsx which lost 4 9 in contrast gold rated templeton global bond tgbax rode its ultrashort duration positioning and currency short to the euro to a 1 4 return for the year despite holding significant emerging markets debt the little engine that could back in the u s investors worried that demand for municipal bonds would decrease over 2018 with lower tax rates set by the tax cuts and jobs act and that the asset class would suffer as interest rates rose after a first quarter stumble though it regained its footing on the strength of the u s economy and muted supply through the end of the year the municipal market remained stable and aided by healthy technicals in november and december the sector returned 1 3 for the year municipal funds with strong fundamental security selection that were able to navigate market potholes including tobacco bonds puerto rico and finicky general obligation debt stayed a step ahead of the pack the winners included silver rated nuveen intermediate duration municipal bond nuvbx which returned 1 6 for 2018 relative to the broad muni national intermediate category s 0 8 gain

in most countries the global financial crisis has led to a ballooning of sovereign debt levels large scale economic stimulus programs and bank bailouts have been a costly affair a fresh study bears out some 10 years ago at the height of the global financial crisis many economists warned against forthcoming state bankruptcies hyperinflation and the need for crisis mode currency reforms and who would have argued with them that the dangers of that happening were very real we now know that these doomsday prophecies did not come true there was no need for currency reforms says a study by berenberg and the hamburg institute of international economics hwwi even the euro which suffered a severe loss of trust in the interim did not implode and there has still not been any significant consumer price inflation in the major industrial countries and with the exception of greece there were no state bankruptcies alarming sovereign debt levels the survey doesn t fail to notice though that in a majority of nations the global financial crisis has led to a steep increase in sovereign debt governments across the world came up with extensive economic stimulus packages to cushion the impact of the crisis and to counter the collapse of private sector spending on top of that central banks initiated drastic interest rate cuts as part of their expansive monetary policy that s only now being wound back add to this the vast amounts of money used to bail out struggling lenders yes those too big to fail and you get an idea of how heavy the financial burden has been for many governments the upshot of it all has been a dramatic rise in sovereign debt which had already been running at high levels before the crisis kicked in the study points out that in the eurozone sovereign debt to gdp ratio rose by 14 5 percent between 2008 and 2018 debt levels of the major industrial nations g7 climbed by 27 percent in the same period the united states has no small share in this seeing its debt to gdp ratio surge by 31 percent to reach over 100 percent in the corresponding period see infographic some figures are truly mind boggling in terms of industrial countries japan has by far the highest debt level amounting to 230 percent of gdp in 2017 the study says there are no signs of saving with government spending set to increase further far less dramatic are the figures for the world s second largest economy china there the debt ratio is around 50 percent of gdp and is the lowest among the major national economies on the other hand it s a rather high level for an emerging country while corporate debt levels of over 160 percent are a true cause for concern germany standing out germany is one of the few countries that have bucked the trend the beginning of the global financial crisis wouldn t have suggested a better performance over time as the debt ratio and public deficit levels rose in germany too but the country logged a balanced budget in 2014 and later managed to record budget surpluses helping the government to actually reduce sovereign debt in relation to gross domestic product but also in absolute figures the year 2017 marked the first time since 2010 that debt returned to a level below 2 trillion 2 27 trillion the study noted it added that the low interest environment had certainly helped germany to pull off that feat but it is in particular the powerful german growth levels and the resulting higher tax revenues that have led to this positive result risk factors berenberg said the strong performance of the global economy had seen the issue of sovereign debt slipping out of focus in recent years which didn t mean the problem had been solved it mentioned a number of key factors that could lead to a new debt crisis but hastened to add that such a crisis was not really around the corner yet nevertheless slowing growth would certainly not be conducive to nations efforts to cut sovereign debt nor would be more interest rate hikes as envisaged by central banks over the next couple of years as this would increase governments cost financing

economist at the washington based institute of international finance the immediate financial linkages are relatively modest but they are swamped by sentiment channels loading to be sure further slowing in china is not the only risk the global economy faces a disorderly british exit from the european union or a financial crisis in debt ridden italy could also be unsettling in the united states the national debt is rising and the stimulus from large tax cuts may start to wear off by next year the federal reserve could keep raising interest rates to keep inflation at bay making it more expensive to borrow money though it isn t clear exactly what the american central bank will do still the big question now is to paraphrase the line about las vegas will what happens in china stay in china or will it become a global problem the world bank aptly titled its review of this year s outlook darkening prospects it warned that china s slowdown could affect countries that export a great deal to it china is the world s second largest importer after the united states but the composition of its imports is unusual alarm bells sounded when apple said growth in china was slowing credit bloomberg it is the largest market for a long list of commodity exporters from australia to uruguay thanks to its voracious appetite for iron ore food energy and other raw materials it needs to keep its economy humming china is also a large market for factory equipment made in countries like germany and japan but its imports of manufactured goods overall are few for an economy of its size that has limited the dependence of workers elsewhere particularly in the united states on the chinese economy the global impact of the chinese slowdown underway could be limited if beijing decides to borrow and spend its way into more growth already this month china has issued a series of announcements approving six municipal subway construction projects and three new intercity rail lines at a combined cost of us148 billion the weaker the data gets the more confident we get that they ll tip a lot of stimulus into keeping the economy moving said michael blythe chief economist at the commonwealth bank of australia in sydney many of the biggest new construction projects are in china s western regions said wang min chairman of xuzhou construction machinery group a state owned giant the projects have been good for his company china s largest producer of huge earth moving equipment and its orders have soared in recent months but linking together towns in sparsely populated areas of mountains and deserts is expensive it adds large sums to china s already very high levels of debt and the investment may produce scant new economic activity to pay off that extra debt previously accumulated debt lies at the heart of a one two punch that has laid china s overall economy low in recent months vice premier liu he promised at davos a year ago that china would rein in the growth of credit within three years chinese officials were confident at the time that they could head off a trade war with the united states they set about putting stringent limits on the country s extensive shadow banking networks those networks had been providing a gusher of loans to the country s small and midsize enterprises which china s big state owned banks have long neglected in favour of lending to state owned enterprises china s property sector is stuttering credit bloomberg but by the end of april as the economy started slowing chinese officials started to say that three years was not enough time as credit dried up and many private sector businesses started running low on cash top regulators expressed worry at a shanghai financial conference in june that they might have already gone too far at the same time momentum was building in beijing to extend the influence of the communist party and state owned enterprises mainly at the expense of the private sector the private sector is responsible for most job creation in china and the rhetoric from beijing further scared investors less than a month after the shanghai conference the trade war began in earnest president donald trump imposed the first of three tranches of tariffs on imports from china corporate executives say that by the time the third tranche hit in late september consumer confidence was crumbling purchases of big ticket goods especially cars fell fast business confidence slumped as well a survey of 270 importers in the united states conducted in late december and early january by panjiva a trade data service found that 71 per cent planned to change how and where they bought their goods if tariffs stayed unchanged and 87 per cent said they would do so if the trump administration raised tariffs further as companies start moving their supply chains the main beneficiaries seem to be southeast asian nations like vietnam and indonesia but to the extent that those countries buy more factory equipment from places like germany some of the negative effects overseas from weaker sales in china could be offset most economists are predicting that the first quarter of this year will be weak in china many are predicting that the second will be too but quite a few say they still have confidence in china s consistent four decade track record of pulling itself out of slumps quickly chinese officials have put new emphasis in recent weeks on rebuilding confidence and they are at least trying to reassure private companies that the government will not favour state owned enterprises over them
news national by staff reporter get latest news by email subscribe powered by zimbabwe will struggle to get financial support from international financial institutions due to its high debt levels the international monetary fund imf has said gerry rice the imf spokesperson said the southern african country need policies that would stabilise the economy i would say that of course zimbabwe is facing major challenges and just in terms of the unrest we encourage all stakeholders to collaborate peacefully in developing and implementing policies that will stabilise the economy and promote sustainable and inclusive growth he said on the overall economic situation debt and the imf there has been no real change in what i have said here recently which is why zimbabwe continues to be in a difficult situation regarding debt with protracted arrears to official creditors including multilateral creditors such as the world bank which severely limits zimbabwe s access to international financial support rice added the southern african country is battling its worst economic crisis in a decade due to a severe shortage of foreign currency resulting in fuel shortages labour unrests temporary company closures and high unemployment rates market analysts say the current fuel crisis is just part of zimbabwe s overarching economic decline under president emmerson mnangagwa who briefly inspired hope after taking over from his mentor longtime ruler robert mugabe with the help of the military in november 2017 zimbabwe s economy which was already struggling when mnangagwa took over has dramatically tanked since he narrowly won disputed elections in july last year inflation rose to 31 percent in november last year the highest since 2009 while foreign currency shortages could force some of the few factories still operating to close soon in terms of the imf zimbabwe has in fact cleared its arrears to us to the fund but our rules preclude lending to a country that is still in or under arrears to other international financial situations so until that particular situation is resolved we would not be moving forward with financial support for zimbabwe i said here the last time that the authority s economic policies we felt were headed in the right direction broadly in terms of addressing the fiscal deficit and monetary policy and so on i won t repeat what i said the last time but that s where we are on zimbabwe rice said zimbabwe abandoned its own currency in 2009 after hyperinflation reached 500 billion percent according to the international monetary fund the united states dollar has dominated daily transactions since then but due to widespread shortages of dollars most people must now use a government issued surrogate currency called bond notes which are supposed to be equal to a us dollar as well as electronic money both are quickly devaluing against the dollar on the black market some businesses such as pharmacies are now only accepting united states dollars in cash in the fuel sector where the government controls prices fuel companies are forced to accept bond notes and electronic money for petrol and diesel at the official exchange rate the government then provides the firms with dollars to import the products but of late the central bank has not been allocating firms adequate funds to import sufficient fuel for the country leading to the shortages
national flags from different countries are displayed at the first china international import expo in shanghai in november 2018 xinhua the 2019 world economic forum wef annual meeting convened in davos switzerland on january 22 25 under the theme of globalization 4 0 shaping a new architecture in the age of the fourth industrial revolution brought together senior government officials executives from major global companies leaders of international organizations and non governmental organizations and other prominent figures for intensive deliberations according to the wef globalization 4 0 refers to a new type of globalization with four major transformations global economic leadership is no longer dominated by multilateralism but characterized by plurilateralism the balance of global power has shifted from unipolar to multipolar ecological challenges including climate change are threatening socioeconomic development and the fourth industrial revolution is introducing technologies at a speed and scale unparalleled in history in the face of these changes china will integrate into the world economy with a more open and inclusive attitude to instill continuous vitality into the country itself and the world at large economic outlook viewed from the current situation the world economy in 2019 will see stable expansion the market demand of major economies will keep growing however as the impact of anti globalization continues and as the monetary policies of some major economies tighten and geopolitical tensions persist the world economy faces downward pressure and possible intensified market fluctuations the past five years have seen relatively rapid global economic growth which can be attributed to the cyclical recovery of the world economy and the implementation of an easy monetary policy by major developed economies in 2019 the effects of these two factors will weaken indicators of major economies such as industrial production and the manufacturing purchasing managers index have presented a deceleration trend growth in real estate markets in developed countries has slowed down these are signs that the economies are experiencing a transformation from fast growth to stable growth according to the world economic outlook report released by the international monetary fund in october 2018 the anticipated growth rate of the world economy in 2019 was adjusted from 3 9 percent to a pessimistic 3 7 percent anti globalization has added uncertainty to the global economy in recent years the trend has been extending worldwide prominently manifested by the rise of trade protectionism and the tightening constraint on capital flow the growth of the world trade volumeâ affected by intensified trade frictionsâ is projected to decrease to 3 7 percent in 2019 from 3 9 percent in 2018 dropping for two consecutive years according to the world trade organization the rise of trade protectionism in advanced economies like the u s has led to a disadvantageous change of the policy environment in the world making it difficult to maintain stable growth possibilities for inconsistency in the international market are likely to be aggravated in the past years stock markets in advanced economies have been on the rise the prices of bulk commodities have rebounded also other economies have played a positive role in supporting global economic growth and propelling world trade in 2019 international financial and commodity market risks are likely to heighten with a higher possibility of fluctuations the increasingly downward risk of the real economy also discourages entrepreneurs and investors which may restrain the prices of financial assets and bulk commodities the rules of international trade will restructure at a fast pace while economic globalization faces challenges a new round of international trade rule restructuring is advancing quickly on the one hand the multilateral trading system faces difficulties as different economies have not reached an agreement on the direction and specific ways of reform on the other hand while provoking trade frictions the u s has committed to making rules for its own interests by starting trade talks with the european union on zero tariffs zero non tariff barriers and zero subsidies on non auto industrial goods signing a revised free trade agreement fta with the republic of korea planning to conduct negotiations with japan on a trade agreement on goods and adding a non market economy clause into the new united states mexico canada agreement widening the door in april 2018 president xi jinping delivered a keynote speech at the opening of the boao forum for asia annual conference where he said china s door of opening up will not be closed and will only open even wider against the backdrop of profound transformations in the international environment china will continue to adhere to its fundamental national policy of opening up and pursue development with its door wide open notably the belt and road initiative has made great headway in 2018 trade in goods between china and countries along the belt and road accounted for 27 percent of china s total up from 25 percent in 2013 to date china has signed cooperation agreements with more than 130 countries and international organizations on jointly pursuing the initiative in the years ahead emerging markets and developing countries will play an increasingly important role in china s foreign trade which will diversify the country s international markets and optimize their structure in addition the belt and road initiative will facilitate the development of the central and western parts of china transforming them from peripheral areas of opening up to the frontlines the sustained release of potential from these regions will promote balanced development across china and help narrow regional gaps china has made steady progress in forging ftas by the end of 2018 china had reached 17 ftas with 25 economies around the world from europe to asia oceania south america and africa currently china is conducting negotiations with 27 countries on signing and upgrading 12 ftas as its fta network expands china will experience greater opportunities in foreign trade and investment foreign trade has achieved more bala nced development in recent years china has underlined the importance of imports turning to a new idea where the roles of imports and exports are equally valued the first china international import expo held in november 2018 in shanghai attracted 172 countries regions and international organizations and more than 3 600 enterprises the expo introduced a great deal of high quality goods and services and created sound conditions for diversifying domestic supply and satisfying import needs in 2018 china cut its tariffs several times as the overall tariff level decreased to 7 5 percent from 2017 s 9 8 percent in response to the anti globalization trend and world economic development uncertainties the chinese government formulated and implemented a string of specific policies to encourage opening up in 2018 for instance china cut the overall time for both import and export customs clearance and the number of documents required by another one third while reducing the cost of customs clearance in addition china announced it would improve the tax refund policy for the export of goods while shortening the process in an effort to ease the burden on enterprises and secure stable foreign trade growth the chinese government also took the initiative to cultivate new business models for foreign trade with the total number of cross border e commerce comprehensive pilot areas reaching 35 all these measures aim to shore up the confidence of exporters and importers further steps while china celebrated the 40th anniversary of its reform and opening up in 2018 the world is also making strides in a brand new era of globalization 4 0 for china there are opportunities and challenges along with motivations and pressures in order to achieve sustainable and healthy development and deal with an uncertain external environment with ease china needs to focus on the following aspects it is crucial to improve quality and efficiency during this period past experiences in world economic development have shown that a high growth rate cannot last forever many economic powers have entered a long term low growth rate period after a short term economic boom however a low growth rate does not indicate a deteriorating economy it could also signify high quality and competitive growth china is transforming from high speed development to high quality progress as long as stable employment is ensured there is no need to overemphasize growth rates exploring the depth of opening up is of great importance a new negative list for foreign investment which specifies sectors where access to foreign investors is denied was released on june 28 2018 the list provides a roadmap and schedule of opening up the financial and auto sectors gradually widening the opening up process and allowing a transition in relevant industries the independent innovation of key technologies also plays a crucial role since the u s has put the export of hi tech products under increasingly severe scrutiny indigenous innovation will become the main theme china should convert pressure into driving forces strengthen basic scientific research promote the shift from science to technology and create a new engine for economic and

congresswoman maxine waters d ca chairwoman of the house committee on financial services delivered the following remarks during her first policy speech in the 116th congress as prepared for delivery thank you for the very warm welcome and to the center for american progress for holding this event cap s research and policy work are highly respected and a valued resource for members of congress and our staffs i am very pleased to be here with you today to discuss the new congress and my priorities as chairwoman of the house financial services committee i am deeply honored to have been selected by my colleagues to become the first woman and the first african american to serve as chair of the financial services committee i have served on the committee since 1991 and since 1995 i have served as ranking member or chairwoman of every subcommittee under the committee s jurisdiction and have taken on important issues on behalf of consumers investors and vulnerable families so i consider it a privilege to hold the gavel and i am looking forward to working with my colleagues on the committee on the many critical issues we are responsible for trump shutdown now given the current circumstances in washington i would first like to address the shutdown and its impact on the important programs under the financial services committee s jurisdiction we are now in the midst of the longest government shutdown in history all because this president is throwing a tantrum about a senseless border wall the trump shutdown is harming hardworking americans and our financial markets the shutdown has all but closed the doors of the securities and exchange commission sec which is wall street s cop on the block as a result of the shutdown the sec is unable to carry out most enforcement actions against bad actors businesses planning to enter the stock market for the first time through an initial public offering ipo may also be delayed because the sec cannot approve their documents harming american entrepreneurs and job creation the shutdown also has a serious impact on critical housing programs 95 of the department of housing and urban development s staff has been furloughed millions of families that rely on hud rental assistance programs are perilously close to losing their homes due to projected lapses in funding what s more it was recently reported that hud under secretary carson s leadership has failed to follow its own contingency plan and as a result 1 150 project based rental assistance contracts have expired with hundreds more hanging in the balance if this shutdown does not end families aspiring to the american dream of homeownership may have their federal housing administration fha or rural housing loans delayed or be unable to close on their loans during the shutdown and in rural communities very low income elderly homeowners who rely on hud grants and loans to address health and safety hazards may not receive disbursements and as a result may be forced to live in dangerous conditions these are just a few examples of the serious ways that this shutdown is harming american families and businesses this shutdown must end immediately i call on republicans in congress to join with us and put a stop to it and open the government so that we can put an end to all of the harm that this shutdown is causing the consumer financial protection bureau and financial regulation an ongoing priority for me is ensuring that we have a strong consumer financial protection bureau and strong financial regulation that protects consumers investors and our economy let s talk about why the consumer bureau is so important we all remember how devastating the financial crisis was 11 million americans lost their homes 13 trillion in wealth was lost nearly 9 million americans lost their jobs and the unemployment rate hit 10 percent it was catastrophic for communities across the country the crisis was a result of wall street running amok with abusive institutions peddling toxic products like no doc loans interest only mortgages and other predatory products with no agency responsible for prioritizing consumer protection ultimately the economy was sent tumbling into the abyss in response democrats crafted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act to improve accountability in the financial system and protect consumers investors and the economy from abusive wall street practices as the centerpiece of that law we created the consumer financial protection bureau which is the only federal agency solely dedicated to protecting consumers from being ripped off by financial firms under former director richard cordray the consumer bureau returned 12 billion to more than 30 million harmed consumers handled over 1 3 million consumer complaints about financial institutions implemented much needed rules on mortgages prepaid cards payday loans and auto title loans required clear disclosures from financial institutions and provided consumers with easy to understand materials to empower them to make the best decisions but congressional republicans and the trump administration have been determined to undermine and destroy the consumer bureau trump installed mick mulvaney his budget director to serve as acting director of the consumer bureau and during his tenure mulvaney made it a priority to dismantle the consumer bureau from within to name just a few of his actions mulvaney fired all members of the consumer advisory board and requested zero dollars in operating funds for the consumer bureau from the federal reserve he also created an office of cost benefit analysis as a way to internally block important regulations under the guise of cost benefit analysis he also moved to strip the consumer bureau s office of fair lending and equal opportunity of its enforcement and supervisory authority but that s not all mulvaney closed the office of students and young consumers at a time when 44 million student borrowers collectively carry over 1 5 trillion in student loan debt he also helped out payday lenders for example he withdrew a lawsuit against a group of deceptive payday lenders who allegedly failed to disclose the true cost of loans which carried interest rates as high as 950 percent a year now kathy kraninger was confirmed as the new director in december and we will see what she does mulvaney has since moved on to become this president s acting chief of staff but i ve written to mr mulvaney to inform him that while his time running the consumer bureau may be over the time for accountability for his actions is about to begin this congress i am going to be working diligently to undo the damage that mulvaney has wrought during his time at the consumer bureau i have a bill the consumers first act that reverses many of his known harmful actions which i will soon be reintroducing but it s not just mick mulvaney who i will be paying attention to i will be keeping a watchful eye on all of the financial regulators to make sure that they are carrying out their statutory duties including holding bad actors accountable and promoting financial stability as we saw during the 2008 financial crisis large wall street banks that aren t subject to strong oversight and safeguards to protect our economy can do a lot of damage and so in dodd frank we put in place robust reforms for our largest and most complex financial institutions including increased capital reduced leverage improved liquidity vigorous stress testing and thorough living wills all designed to improve financial stability dodd frank established the financial stability oversight council to eliminate regulatory gaps and improve oversight of the entire financial system including shadow banking dodd frank also established the volcker rule to ensure that big banks don t gamble away their customers deposits all of these reforms were designed to help prevent a future financial crisis the committee will be paying close attention to whether financial regulators try to weaken these important reforms and keeping an eye on the big banks and their activities including by holding many hearings regulators also need to address the evolving financial marketplace appropriately one emerging area the financial services committee will be paying very close attention to is the growth of financial technology or so called fintech firms as americans are banking and accessing credit in new ways it is important that we encourage responsible innovation with the appropriate safeguards in place to protect consumers and without displacing community banks and credit unions i have great hopes that fintech firms can open up opportunities for those who have been excluded from access to responsible credit but i strongly believe that there must be strong protections for consumers of these financial products and that abusive payday lending practices must not be allowed as the fintech sector grows there are opportunities for unmet credit needs to be addressed as well as risks that minority communities may be preyed upon or discriminated against by some of these companies so we will be closely examining these issues in committee to make sure that our regulators eliminate the risks and meet the opportunities credit reporting is another issue i will be scrutinizing in the wake of the equifax data breach it s absolutely critical for congress to reform the nation s credit reporting system we need to shift the burden of removing mistakes from credit reports onto the credit bureaus and furnishers and away from consumers we also need to place limits on credit checks for employment purposes reduce the time period that negative items stay on credit reports and make other reforms to fix the serious problems with the credit reporting sector for the sake of consumers across the country credit reporting needs a comprehensive overhaul housing a very important issue we will be bringing renewed attention to in the financial services committee is housing this country is experiencing a housing affordability and homelessness crisis today there are over half a million people experiencing homelessness here in the richest country in the world over one fifth of whom are children this includes veterans who we failed to support when they returned home after serving our country women fleeing domestic violence people who have left prison after serving their debt to society and people who have simply fallen on hard times it is simply shameful and congress has a responsibility to act to tackle the homelessness crisis congress needs to provide a surge of funding and resources just as congress puts billions of dollars into defense spending we must provide the funding necessary to ensure that all americans have access to safe decent and affordable housing so i will soon be reintroducing my bill the ending homelessness act which would help to ensure that every american has a safe decent and affordable place to call home the bill provides 13 27 billion in new funding over five years to federal programs and initiatives to prevent homelessness in addition we will be holding committee hearings on homelessness and important housing issues that have gone ignored during the last congress in order to elevate housing issues into a national discussion and present proactive solutions and remedies the committee also has a responsibility to look at our housing finance system and address the fates of fannie mae and freddie mac the government sponsored enterprises the gses have been in government conservatorship for more than a decade contrary to republican claims fannie mae and freddie mac did not cause the financial crisis the financial crisis inquiry commission and others have made that clear the financial crisis was driven by predatory lending the private market packaging those toxic risky loans into securities and then selling those securities to unsuspecting investors fannie and freddie did not drive those actions but the events that transpired during the crisis made clear the need for their reform when it comes to housing finance reform i have advocated for core principles that i believe should be part of legislative efforts to address the future of housing finance reform the principles include maintaining access to the 30 year fixed rate mortgage ensuring sufficient private capital is in place to protect taxpayers providing stability and liquidity so that we can withstand any future financial crisis ensuring a smooth transition to a new finance system requiring transparency and standardization in a way that ensures a level playing field for all financial institutions especially credit unions and community banks maintaining access for all qualified borrowers that can sustain homeownership and serving homeowners of the future and ensuring access to affordable rental housing it is particularly important to ensure that underserved borrowers and communities are not overlooked this means housing finance reform will need to include a comprehensive strategy around access to affordable mortgage credit as well as access to affordable rental housing also important for housing access is the rigorous enforcement of our fair housing laws unfortunately our fight to make progress on fair housing has become much more challenging under the trump administration let s not forget that president trump himself was sued by the government for serious violations of the fair housing act under trump s leadership the affirmatively furthering fair housing mandate under the fair housing act was badly undercut when secretary carson halted implementation of the obama administration s affirmatively furthering fair housing rule in fact secretary carson once likened the rule to a failed social experiment secretary carson has also reportedly proposed taking the words free from discrimination out of hud s mission statement he also reportedly halted several fair housing investigations and sidelined top advisors in hud s office of fair housing enforcement these are unprecedented attacks on fair housing that we will not stand for to that end in addition to conducting robust oversight of the trump administration s activities at hud i will be reintroducing the restoring fair housing protections act my bill to reverse the harmful steps taken by secretary carson and the trump administration to undermine fair housing i promise to continue to stand up for fair housing opportunities for all people diversity and inclusion another very important issue that i am going to continue to work on as chairwoman is diversity and inclusion as a nation we are becoming increasingly diverse racially and ethnically the u s census bureau estimates that more than half of all americans will belong to a minority group by the year 2044 at the same time there is a growing body of research showing a connection between the level of diversity at a company and the strength of its financial performance despite these facts the government accountability office gao has found a continued trend of low representation of minorities and women in the financial services industry minorities and women have particularly low representation at the senior management levels within the financial services industry this needs to change diverse representation in these institutions and particularly at the management level is essential to ensure that all consumers have fair access to credit capital and banking and financial services now as many of you know i believe that it is essential to promote better workforce and supplier diversity i am one of the proud authors of section 1116 of the housing and economic recovery act and section 342 of the dodd frank act together these provisions direct most of the federal financial services agencies to create offices of minority and women inclusion which we refer to as omwis omwis have the important responsibility of overseeing all diversity matters in management employment and business activities at their agencies the creation of these offices was a major step forward but we all know that laws that promote racial ethnic and gender equality are only as strong as the implementation and enforcement of those laws and congressional oversight is essential to ensure that implementation and enforcement are strong so i am very pleased and very proud to announce that i will be creating a subcommittee on diversity and inclusion the subcommittee will be the first in its kind in congress dedicated to looking at diversity and inclusion issues under the committee s jurisdiction international affairs turning to the international jurisdiction of the committee i plan to focus on the important work of the world bank and the regional development banks in ending global poverty we have in the past worked in a bipartisan fashion to support the international monetary fund or imf in times of crisis at the same time that we pressed the fund to pay more attention to the social dimension of problems when decisions about economic assistance are made while the spirit of cooperation on issues related to global economic governance in congress has been lacking i am optimistic that this congress will see renewed bipartisan attention under my leadership the financial services committee will ensure that accountability and effectiveness at the international financial institutions remain strong that broad public debate about the imf s and the multilateral development banks policies remains active and that the international interests of poverty alleviation growth and economic stability continue to be advanced sanctions another area that i hope will be bipartisan is the issue of protecting american interests and democratic institutions from assault both internally and from abroad this brings me to the issue of u s sanctions against russia for its hostile actions and its efforts to undermine the u s presidential election i believe the administration s approach to russia sanctions has been haphazard and weak as well as inconsistent with its approach to sanctions imposed on other countries such as iran i am very concerned about the treasury department s recent actions to lift sanctions on businesses connected to oleg deripaska deripaska is a russian oligarch with close ties to vladimir putin who also has a history with paul manafort former trump campaign chairman who has been convicted of serious financial crimes uncovered as a result of special counsel mueller s investigation into russian interference in the last presidential election what s more deripaska has faced numerous allegations of criminal activity and was cited by the treasury department in april as saying he does not separate himself from the russian state i believe the delisting agreement for deripaska s companies is too favorable to deripaska including by allowing him to benefit from potentially tens of millions of dollars in debt forgiveness by transferring some of his shares to a russian bank to satisfy debts that deripaska owes that bank i also don t believe deripaska should be allowed to retain any influence or level of control over these companies i look forward to working with my colleagues in both chambers and across the aisle to closely monitor all further developments on russia sanctions to hold the administration accountable for its actions in this area and to ensure that the strongest possible sanctions against russia are implemented and remain in place bipartisanship i would like to take a few minutes to address how i will approach working with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle as chairwoman throughout my career i have looked for opportunities to build consensus and work across the aisle on commonsense solutions to benefit hardworking americans as chairwoman i will continue to find areas where we can all work together ranking member mchenry and i have a relationship and just last congress we worked together on several bills the fix crowdfunding act to boost crowdfunding and enhance investor protections and the supporting america s innovators act to make it easier for more angel investors to finance startup companies and small businesses the supporting america s innovators act became law previously we also worked together on the promoting transparent standards for corporate insiders act a bill to limit the ability of corporate insiders to illegally trade on non public information i am very pleased to announce that ranking member mchenry and i are reintroducing the promoting transparent standards for corporate insiders act together so i am very hopeful that we will be able to get some good bipartisan work done in committee some of the big issues we are going to try to work on a bipartisan basis include long term reauthorization and reform of the national flood insurance program nfip terrorism risk insurance tria and the reauthorization of the job creating export import bank and so it is a new day in congress and for the financial services committee as chairwoman i will continue to work every day to create opportunities for hardworking americans ensure fairness and protect the economic wellbeing of all americans i will also continue to hold this administration and its appointees accountable thank you again to the center for american progress for having me today about post author

demand also held largely steady commentary larry hu economist at macquarie capital hong kong there are three key drivers of the chinese economy infrastructure property and exports we see that infrastructure is rebounding but property and exports are slowing down we expect an escalation of stimulus in infrastructure and property in the second half raymond yeung chief economist greater china anz i believe they want to see an aggressive target above 6 5 percent as they celebrate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the prc china can t rely on exports or a very difficult manufacturing sector but we see an upside in infrastructure the government will approve a lot more projects in the pipeline 2019 will be more of a domestic story especially on the investment side julian evans pritchard senior china economist capital economics the latest data suggest that economic growth remained weak at the end of 2018 but held up better than many feared in part thanks to a policy driven recovery in infrastructure spending still with the headwinds from cooling global growth and the lagged impact of slower credit growth set to intensify in the coming months china s economy is likely to weaken further before growth stabilises in the second half of the year on the back of expanded policy stimulus masaaki kanno chief economist sony financial holdings tokyo there was no surprise from the gdp data but the basic message is that the chinese economy is still slowing down the renminbi appears to have stabilised it shows that the investors do not seem to have a big concern in the near term outlook of the chinese economy and are probably expecting some positive impact from policy measures today s retail sales are slightly higher than expected we hope the uptrend should be sustained but we don t know what will happen to consumer sentiment in china it probably depends on the result of the u s china negotiation on trade we hope the negotiation should end up with some more positive impact on sentiment today s industrial production is a slightly positive number but the manufacturing sector still appears to have a downside risk in the first quarter the chinese government s announcement that is to focus on stimulating the economy appears to be focusing on the tax cut to stimulate the consumption it takes time to take effect compared to previous measures that were taken in the form of the increase in more direct spending on infrastructure we still think the chinese economy could bottom out in the middle of the year toru nishihama chief economist dai ichi life research institute tokyo china s gdp headline was within expectation but its industrial production was unexpectedly firm which was probably due to infrastructure investments the chinese economy lacks momentum impact from u s china trade tensions are appearing and its adverse impact will continue in addition to that uncertainties over the global economy are increasing the focus will be how china s domestic demand will offset worsening external demand it will be a close watch how the government s measures such as subsidies and infrastructure investment will support domestic demand hunter chan economist greater china standard chartered the gdp data was on expected lines main drag was from the external side we expect further stimulus from the fiscal side in 2019 focus would continue to remain on reducing the tax burden and easing conditions for smes the domestic labour market remains stable this will likely support domestic demand and consumption going forward we see the yuan appreciating to 6 65 in 2019 rajiv biswas asia pacific chief economist ihs markit singapore on market impact one positive factor in terms of the outlook for the yuan and the equities market looking at 2019 is that the chinese government is now taking a lot of stimulus measures to support growth the reserve requirement ratio cuts have already been implemented and more will follow and a ramping up of public expenditure on infrastructure and the impact of tax cuts will also help the economy we do expect growth to be relatively strong this year at around 6 3 per cent that should support stability of the yuan and also help to underpin the stock market the big risk to all of that is what will happen with the u s china trade war if there is no deal and if the trade measures escalate then this would be a negative for the currency the growth outlook and the equity market a lot will hinge on what happens in the u s china trade war and if a deal can be concluded in the first half of this year naoto saito chief researcher daiwa institute of research tokyo the data shows the economy is steadily slowing down although we had thought we could have seen a bigger slowdown it is hit by three factors a slowdown in the global economy including china s own due to rising u s interest rates the u s china trade war and weak demand for mobile phones which accounts for about 70 per cent of the fall in china s exports in december the government has means to support the economy they can expand infrastructure spending and they can cut banks reserve requirement ratio so we don t need to worry about capital spending but the problem lies in consumption as the u s and china clash on many fronts consumer sentiment appears to have been hurt until now solid wage growth has been supporting consumption but now there appears to be a sense of vague anxiety about the future steve cochrane chief apac economist moody s analytics it s pretty clear that the government will try to use as much selective stimulus to keep the economy on a good track they could easily reduce the rrr again it is still not down to where it was back during the financial crisis that plus some tax cuts the difficulty will be trying to ramp up consumer spending and that s because of the high debt load consumers are in right now the corporate debt load is high as well local governments are strapped with debt so it s not the question of if government being able to provide for the stimulus but really the effectiveness of it jeff ng chief economist asia continuum economics the data continues to reflect a slowdown in china that is caused by both domestic and external weakness some positives to take away are that ip and retail sales beat expectations in december that highlights some degree of resilience in the economy and shows that some of the targeted stimulus measures are helping a little to support the economy the trade war didn t directly impact on the growth figures so much because growth is mostly domestically supported but its impact on both consumer and investor confidence was much greater shane oliver chief economist amp capital sydney no real surprises there the gdp number is down a little bit but that has been expected it s consistent with the commentary around a slowdown in chinese growth the ip and retail data point to some stabilisation in growth towards the end of last year overall they are not bad numbers although there will be some debate about how reliable these numbers are we are expecting a slowdown in q1 led by exports although for the year as a whole we are seeing 6 2 per cent as far as policy response is concerned i don t think we are likely to see the kind of stimulus we saw in 2015 16 christy tan asia head of markets strategy research national australia bank singapore the headline on its own is not much of a surprise for markets if you look at some of the positive spin for this data the december ip and retail sales came in better than expected if we look at the breakdown of the commodity output they seem to have grown at or above average levels for december that may help remove or reduce some of the concerns of a growth slowdown becoming more entrenched this year the unemployment number in the data has edged up and we should not ignore that that number edging up is not good there will be more stimulus they have already announced some of the plans which are in approval stage and will be carried out over the course of the year it s still not time to relax on that front and we will see more effort on stimulus this year background an escalating trade war between beijing and washington has heaped more pressure on china s already cooling economy adding to fears of slower global growth and weaker corporate profits this year washington and beijing have agreed to a 90 day truce in a trade war that has disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods if solid progress towards a deal is not reached by a deadline of early march washington has threatened to sharply hike tariffs on chinese goods but a comprehensive agreement to end the dispute is seen as unlikely by the negotiating deadline given the number of highly divisive and politically sensitive issues on the table even if a durable trade deal is reached dismantling current tariffs analysts say it would be no panacea for china s ailing economy which is being weighed down by weak investment and faltering consumer confidence beijing has been stepping up policy support to avert a sharper slowdown but top officials have vowed not to resort to massive stimulus as in the past which left a mountain of debt the people s bank of china pboc has cut banks reserve requirement ratio rrr five times in a year with further reductions expected it has also been guiding market interest rates lower but a cut in benchmark rates may not happen soon the government is putting a greater emphasis on fiscal policy measures to cushion the downturn with deeper tax cuts and more infrastructure spending expected this year investment growth has inched higher in the last few months as regulators fast track infrastructure projects but it is still not far from record lows while retail sales growth is the weakest since 2003 and the property sector looks wobbly corporate sales and profits are weakening discouraging fresh investment and raising the risk of higher job losses while some economists say china may be facing a significant slowdown no one is expecting a crash at this point still policy support measures will take some time to kick in and the world s second largest economy is not expected to convincingly stabilise until summer reporting by hong kong and singapore newsrooms and asia bureaux editing by jacqueline wong

continuous vitality into the country itself and the world at large economic outlook viewed from the current situation the world economy in 2019 will see stable expansion the market demand of major economies will keep growing however as the impact of anti globalization continues and as the monetary policies of some major economies tighten and geopolitical tensions persist the world economy faces downward pressure and possible intensified market fluctuations the past five years have seen relatively rapid global economic growth which can be attributed to the cyclical recovery of the world economy and the implementation of an easy monetary policy by major developed economies in 2019 the effects of these two factors will weaken indicators of major economies such as industrial production and the manufacturing purchasing managers index have presented a deceleration trend growth in real estate markets in developed countries has slowed down these are signs that the economies are

opinion columnist victor bhoroma is business and economic analyst with expertise in business management aspects he is a marketer by profession and holds an mba from the university of zimbabwe uz for feedback mail him on vbhoroma gmail com or skype victor bhoroma1 there is no doubt that the unresolved currency issue lies at the heart of zimbabwe s economic meltdown in the past 3 years and the price distortions in the local market the origins of the currency crisis can be traced back to august 2015 when treasury passed the rbz debt assumption bill which involved the government assuming the rbz debt of over 1 4 billion by issuing treasury bills tbs the objective of this debt assumption bill was to clean the rbz balance sheet and allow the apex bank to resume its clearing role through the rtgs system this role had weakened during the gnu era of 2009 2013 when the apex bank operated under a tight cash budgeting policy which meant that government departments expenditure was within what treasury collected through taxes in order to sustain uncontrolled government expenditure in 2015 the rbz started crediting local banks with electronic balances rtgs which were not backed by tax revenues and nostro foreign currency balances as a result broad money supply grew by over 1 billion in less than 12 months domestic demand grew and nostro accounts dwindled due to foreign currency externalization as 5 year treasury bills were being sold at a discount by alert investors who preferred credits in their offshore accounts than future losses cash shortages started to creep in by february 2016 to close the cash shortage gap in the market the apex bank announced that it was going to introduce an export incentive named bond notes before year end but alas the horses had already bolted the bond note was introduced in november 2016 amid immense resistance from business and local consumers who had realized that 2008 was now in replay and savings would be eroded what was not known publicly was that the apex bank had added 2 3 billion into the market by october 2016 through rtgs and tbs had been issued to banks pension funds and the corporate sector to back demands for cash withdrawals as banks were running dry soon after the bond note introduction the parallel market found its feet again by exchanging rtgs bank balances with us dollar and bond notes at premiums of at least 10 15 even though the apex bank capped physical money supply to 500 million the devil was in the billions that were circulating in the economy through the rtgs by the end of 2016 government expenditure had skyrocketed and the budget deficit for 2016 expanded to 1 421 billion from the 393 million recorded in 2015 the value of treasury bills tbs issued by the government surged coincidentally with the introduction of bond notes from 2 1 billion as of october 2016 to 7 6 billion in august 2018 an increase of 5 5 billion in less than 2 years by december 2018 domestic debt stood at over 9 5 billion that figure includes out of statute borrowings of more than 2 3 billion through the rbz overdraft facility back in 2009 the government was forced to dump the zimbabwean dollar due to record hyperinflation and economic decline which had wiped off 50 of the economic value the introduction of the multi currency regime stabilized the market largely because government expenditure was kept in check with actual budget surpluses realized from 2009 to 2012 fdi inflows and industry capacity utilization picked up with the economy growing at an average of 10 from 2009 to 2012 nostro account balances were also stable with import cover of more than 800 million as of august 2012 domestic debt closed 2012 at 276 million with the bulk of the borrowed funds used in local by elections the economy was liberalized so as to manage inflation allow for industry to retool and improve basic goods supply under a strong dollar the negative impact of the multi currency regime during that stable period was mainly felt on the export earnings front as zimbabwe s exports could not compete in the region due to the strong us dollar that was mainly used for trading in the economy currently the zimbabwean government has limited options in terms of currency reforms because foreign debt is over 8 5 billion and international funders including the chinese have stopped advancing any loans to harare so as to back any meaningful currency reforms joining the rand monitory union has been touted as the best remedy to the economy considering that south africa is zimbabwe s major trading partner and accounts for most of the fdi inflows and tourist arrivals into the country in 2017 alone zimbabwe trade with south africa topped 4 2 billion the arguments for joining the rmu therefore carry a lot of weight before other preconditions are considered key among the conditions is curbing zimbabwe s debt levels with public debt now over 18 5 billion having a local currency and stringent rules on monitory policy to control broad money supply faced with the rock and hard place scenario the government has announced that the zimbabwean dollar will be introduced before the end of 2019 questions remain on whether any currency can save the zimbabwean economy without addressing key economic fundamentals the fundamental aspects that need urgent attention include low agricultural and industrial production capacity which leads to a high import bill and low export capacity average trade deficit of 1 8 billion from 2016 to 2018 and insufficient foreign currency earnings high government expenditure average budget deficit of 2 3 billion from 2016 to 2018 lack of confidence in the economy poor domestic and foreign investment high production costs driven by a punitive tax system and high levels of public debt highlighted above other limitations in the economy include massive corruption command policies that crowd out private sector investment foreign currency externalization loopholes porous border posts that promote smuggling weak institutions rule of law respect for property rights and governance culture non performing state enterprises and poor tax compliance due to market informalization it is essential to point that the bond note served in almost the same capacity as the zimbabwean dollar only that it could not be traded on the international money market the economic challenges that bedevil zimbabwe since 2013 have largely remained the same and coalesced around the government s insatiable appetite to spend beyond its tax collections the government has largely chosen to act on symptoms such as multi tier pricing inflation rate cash shortages labour demands commodity shortages especially fuel cooking oil and grain without addressing the real fundamentals that underpin economic growth any currency introduced by the government will not sustain as long as key economic fundamentals that support economic growth are negative even if it was possible to raise billions in united states dollars in offshore accounts to support the introduction of the zimbabwean dollar those too will be exhausted over time leaving the country with massive debts as long as decisive economic reforms are not implemented to arrest the budget deficit trade deficit and confidence deficit sound economic management policy by the treasury from 2009 to 2012 provides the foundation upon which the current government needs to start on so sustain any currency in the economy the only sustainable way to grow foreign earnings is by allowing the economy to flourish raising foreign currency by incurring more debt without addressing economic fundamentals will not eliminate the black market and the market distortions that are destroying the economy a currency is sustained by a healthy economy not external borrowings to shore up the country s nostro accounts or subsidize a flawed exchange rate
the united states and allied nations in latin america are ratcheting up pressure on venezuela in what appears to be a coordinated effort to remove venezuelan president nicolás maduro from office maduro was sworn in last week to a second 6 year term following his victory in last may s election which was boycotted by the opposition days before maduro was sworn in opposition figure juan guaidó became head of the national assembly which soon voted to declare maduro a usurper in an effort to remove him from office the united states brazil and other nations have welcomed the effort as the political crisis intensifies maduro has reached out to the united nations to help establish a peace dialogue in venezuela we speak with jorge arreaza venezuelan foreign minister he met with u n secretary general antónio guterres this week amy goodman this is democracy now i m amy goodman the united states and allied nations in latin america are ratcheting up pressure on venezuela in what appears to be a coordinated effort to remove venezuelan president nicolás maduro from office maduro was sworn in last week to a second 6 year term following his victory in last may s election which was boycotted by the opposition days before maduro was sworn in opposition figure juan guaidó became head of the national assembly which soon voted to declare maduro a usurper in an effort to remove him from office the united states brazil and other nations have welcomed the effort vice president mike pence tweeted the u s strongly supports the courageous decision by juan guaidó to declare the country s presidency vacant on the day of maruro s inauguration january 10th u s secretary of state mike pompeo called guaidó to congratulate him on his election victory to head the national assembly then national security adviser john bolton announced quote the united states does not recognize venezuelan dictator nicolás maduro s illegitimate claim to power unquote brazil now led by the far right president jair bolsonaro has gone a step further by saying it recognizes juan guaidó as the rightful president of venezuela even though guaidó himself hasn t even claimed that title a group of latin american countries known as the lima group also recently voted to not recognize the legitimacy of maduro s presidency mexico was the sole dissenter the u s led effort targeting the oil rich nation of venezuela dates back two decades since the late hugo chávez became president in 1999 in november john bolton accused venezuela cuba and nicaragua of being part of a troika of tyranny in september the new york times reported the trump administration conducted secret meetings with rebellious military officers in venezuela to discuss overthrowing maduro in august maduro survived an assassination attempt when he was attacked by a small drone he accused the u s and colombia of being involved in the plot in 2017 president donald trump said he could not rule out a quote military option to deal with venezuela all of this comes as venezuela is facing a staggering economic crisis caused in part by falling oil prices and broad u s sanctions according to the imf inflation is over 1 million percent in the last year the highest rate in the world there are widespread reports of food and medicine shortages the united nations estimates 3 million venezuelans have left venezuela since 2015 resulting in what the u n has described as an unprecedented migration crisis in latin america as the political turmoil intensifies venezuelan president nicolás maduro has reached out to the united nations to help establish a peace dialogue in venezuela venezuela s foreign minister jorge arreaza met this week with u n secretary general antónio guterres here in new york on thursday i had a chance to interview foreign minister arreaza who has served as foreign minister for the past three years from 2013 to 16 he served as venezuela s vice president i began by asking him if he believes venezuela is being set up for a coup jorge arreaza of course it s evident and you see this man who nobody knows in venezuela you ask in the streets who is juan guaidó and nobody knows him but he s being pushed to say that he is the new president by the u s he hasn t said that but pompeo says it almagro from the oas says it and other presidents say that now he s the president they are trying to push a political conflict in venezuela they are calling the armed forces to make pronunciations against president maduro that s what they want a coup d état in venezuela they want a war in venezuela and it s not going to happen amy goodman so let s talk more about what you believe is the role of the united states in coalescing opposition to maduro jorge arreaza they are the bosses of the opposition they tell them what to do nothing that the opposition does is without the permission or authorization of the state department at least here in the united states and they confess this they say we have to make consultations with the embassy we have to make consultations with the department of state it happens i mean they are not free they are not independent but in spite of all of that the president is trying to sit again with the opposition with the democratic opposition not the extremist opposition that makes violent demonstrations and burns people alive no and that is what he s going to insist on the dialogue but this what is happening now john bolton tweeting and doing communiqués and pompeo and everyone saying that maduro is not the president that he s illegitimate that he s a usurper come on that is a coup d état again against venezuela amy goodman well explain that term a usurper i mean it looks like you know a case is being built for an overthrow when he when guaidó the opposition the head of the national assembly announces that maduro is a usurper jorge arreaza i mean they are manipulating the venezuela constitution they say that the elections where almost 10 million venezuelans voted and more than 6 million voted for maduro that this didn t happen no amy goodman the opposition boycotted jorge arreaza yes they boycotted it not only the opposition washington and bogotá and lima and santiago these governments no neoliberal governments in latin america so they said when the elections were conveyed three months before the elections they said they re going to be a fraud and they wouldn t recognize the results and then they pressed the potential candidates of the opposition not to register and when some of them registered they pressed them to retire to withdraw and they didn t and now they say that because the elections were a fraud then there s no president of venezuela so the president of the national assembly has to be the new president and all these governments and the u s government are encouraging this thesis so it s very dangerous amy goodman i want to continue on what the u s is doing in november national security adviser john bolton claimed venezuela was part of a troika of tyranny john bolton the troika of tyranny in this hemisphere cuba venezuela and nicaragua has finally met its match in venezuela the united states is acting against the dictator maduro who uses the same oppressive tactics that have been employed in cuba for decades he has installed an illegitimate constituent assembly debased the currency for political gain and forced his people to sign up for a corrupt food distribution service or face certain starvation amy goodman in december venezuelan president nicolás maduro accused u s national security adviser john bolton of leading a plan to invade venezuela president nicolás maduro today i come out once again to denounce the plot set forth by the u s to destroy venezuela s democracy to assassinate me and to impose a dictatorship in venezuela mr john bolton has been assigned once again as the chief of a plot to fill venezuela with violence and to seek a foreign military intervention a coup assassinate president maduro and impose what they call a transitory government amy goodman foreign minister can you elaborate on this and also this term troika of tyranny very much reminiscent of george w bush s axis of evil jorge arreaza yes the axis of evil no and it s reminiscent of the language used in the cold war nixon mccarthy all that dark history no and it has no sense we re in the 21st century you have to respect the sovereign nations we have the right to build our own model democratic model and yes the united states government especially the obsession of bolton of john bolton against president maduro they are behind everything that is happening in venezuela yes they almost killed assassinated president maduro august the 4th with drones and it amy goodman well let s talk about this this was the first drone attack attempted assassination on a head of state in history jorge arreaza yes amy goodman august 4th it was a saturday it was in front of the palace of justice jorge arreaza yes amy goodman maduro was giving a speech and explain exactly what happened jorge arreaza what happened is that suddenly a drone appeared and it exploded amy goodman were you there jorge arreaza i wasn t there but most of the ministers were there and the military forces were there and the other branches of power were there and it was two drones these people were trained in colombia we told we gave this information to the colombian government we gave them the place where they were trained the people who were involved the names of the people of the officials of migration that led them across to venezuela with the drones we gave the u s government the information about these people in miami who met there and also were part of this plot against president maduro and nothing happened amy goodman well before it in april at the latin american summit in lima peru vice president mike pence said more must be done to isolate venezuelan president nicolás maduro vice president mike pence we must all stand with our brothers and sisters suffering in venezuela and i can promise you the united states will not rest we will not relent until democracy is restored in venezuela and the venezuelan people reclaim their birthright of libertad amy goodman so that s vice president mike pence in june venezuelan president nicolás maduro called u s vice president mike pence a viper and vowed to defeat what he called washington s attempts to force him from power president nicolás maduro every time the poisonous viper of mike pence opens his mouth i feel stronger clearer of what the road is the road is ours it is venezuelan it is not the one mike pence points out to us not 20 poisonous snakes not 20 vipers like mike pence amy goodman foreign minister arreaza explain why what is mike pence s particular interest here you re looking at pence bolton jorge arreaza bolton amy goodman and pompeo now secretary of state jorge arreaza pompeo as well you know pence you know he s a religious guy he s from the extreme right you know him and he s obsessed as well with the venezuelan revolution you see they say that you have to restore democracy in venezuela we have a democracy we have had 25 elections in 20 years we ve had elections for president in 1998 in 2000 2004 2006 in 2009 2012 2013 2018 i mean our people are used to and not only democracy because the constitution says you have to elect these presidents and parliament members and mayors and governors no because we have our society is organized in community councils consejos comunales and communes and you take the decisions every single day venezuelans are exercising democracy we have democratized the access to education which was being privatized before the revolution we have democratized access to housing which was also exclusive for the rich before the revolution we have democratized access to health we have doctors all over they used to be cubans now they re venezuelans all over the country you walk one block and you have the doctor there so we are really trying to build a root democracy rooted in the people and that is what they don t like because that is not what they would like from the countries of latin america amy goodman i want to talk about sanctions and the effect they re having on the venezuelan economy you have henry kissinger still an elder statesmen consulted by democrats and republicans alike let s go back half a century go back decades he wanted to make the chilean economy under allende scream he said jorge arreaza yes amy goodman you have the half century embargo against cuba what does economic pressure economic sabotage if you will look like in venezuela in november the congressional research service published a short overview of current u s sanctions in venezuela and mentions the trump administration is considering a new wave of sanctions but the report also states quote although stronger economic sanctions could influence the venezuelan government s behavior they also could have negative effects and unintended consequences analysts are concerned that stronger sanctions could exacerbate venezuela s difficult humanitarian situation which has been marked by shortages of food and medicines increased poverty and mass migration many venezuelan civil society groups oppose sanctions that could worsen humanitarian conditions now again this is not the venezuelan president saying this this is the u s congressional research service can you talk about the effect of u s sanctions on venezuela jorge arreaza the venezuelan people are suffering because of these so called sanctions which are cohesive unilateral measures this is not approved by the united nations security council it has no legality these are decisions taken by one government unilaterally to impose a blockade against venezuela so it s difficult for us to import food to import medicine we cannot use the dollar as a currency to exchange we have to switch only this switching from dollars to euros is more than what we need to invest in in importing the vaccines for our children or the treatment for hiv in venezuela for two years and it s probably the figure that i can give you is more than 20 000 million that we have lost because of the so called sanctions in more than a year amy goodman so these sanctions are overt are there covert sanctions against venezuela jorge arreaza of course because it s not only this that is official it s pressing the companies not to work with venezuela it s threatening to seize a company that we have here in the united states citgo we cannot repatriate the profit from our company in the united states to invest it in food and medicine in venezuela amy goodman and for people to know citgo which is venezuelan state oil company jorge arreaza owned yes amy goodman has been used for many years in the united states to support poor people jorge arreaza yes yes amy goodman in their programs for to have oil in the winter jorge arreaza yes and we intend to keep on using it for this in the united states but most of the profit annually should be sent to venezuela and we cannot do it it has to be here in the banks of the united states blocked we have more than 1 600 million or euros blocked in europe in this company intermediary it s called euroclear why because of the sanctions amy goodman you mentioned russia on wednesday russian foreign minister sergey lavrov expressed concerns over u s meddling in venezuela jorge arreaza yes sergey lavrov we have heard talk that allows for military involvement in venezuela talk that the united states will now recognize as the president of venezuela not nicolás maduro but the representative of the parliament all this is very alarming and all this shows is that the approach of undermining governments the united states doesn t like stays on as a priority of their activity in latin america and in other regions amy goodman if you can talk about the significance of lavrov weighing in also the latest news in december russia landing two nuclear capable blackjack bombers in venezuela as part of a joint training exercise jorge arreaza you know russia has been friends of venezuela for over 16 years we believe that the world has to have several poles several centers not only the united states the united states cut all the military cooperation with venezuela 20 years ago and we have military cooperation with russia and these planes aircrafts that came this year they came in 2013 as well and nothing happened but this year it was taken like it was that we were trying to bomb the u s and come on that s nonsense we have the right to have cooperation with russia with china with whatever country in the world and what lavrov said there is exactly what the united states is doing and he knows that they are trying to manipulate the people the media the constitution of venezuela even to impose a man who has not been elected president amy goodman venezuelan foreign minister jorge arreaza we ll be back with him in 30 seconds amy goodman this is democracy now democracynow org the war and peace report i m amy goodman as we continue with my interview with the venezuelan foreign minister jorge arreaza amy goodman you have massive flight from venezuela the u n high commissioner for refugees has called the ongoing venezuelan migration crisis unprecedented in latin america the u n estimates about 3 million venezuelans have left since 2015 another 2 million are projected to leave this year about a million of them are living in colombia half a million in peru ecuador argentina chile panama brazil all have large numbers why foreign minister arreaza are so many people so many venezuelans leaving jorge arreaza well first it s not you know how many colombians live in venezuela six million colombians live in venezuela over peruvians and ecuadoreans over 1 million spaniards italians portuguese arabs over 2 million so of course there is migration at the moment because we are blocked because it s difficult to find medicine to find some products of food and the hyperinflation process with an exchange rate amy that is not set by the national authorities in venezuela by the central bank it s set by webpages in miami you know the exchange rate the day before maduro s inauguration was 1 1 000 bolívares which is crazy well the day of the inauguration it duplicated it was 2 000 bolívares for 1 and that has no economic logic that is all political that is warfare that is using the currency against our own people so we are worried of course because there are it s not 3 million venezuelans it s probably 1 million venezuelans and most of the people that have gone to colombia are colombians that live in venezuela and that have gone back to their country and we are willing them to come back to venezuela that s what we want for the venezuelans and the colombians that lived in venezuela to come back to venezuela amy goodman but the economy inflation over a million percent last year jorge arreaza yeah but that amy goodman the highest rate in the world jorge arreaza that s the figure of the imf that s not the exact that s not the figure at all it s probably 10 times less than that it s a very difficult problem but this inflation is induced from abroad it is produced by these webpages and all this warfare economic warfare against venezuela it is not only because we have not taken some measures in venezuela of course it s not and it makes things very difficult for the venezuelan people amy goodman so food and medicine shortages do you feel that your government the maduro government takes some responsibility for what s taking place jorge arreaza of course we are not perfect as the government here is not perfect at all and the government in argentina is not perfect of course we have responsibilities but most of the problem the vast majority of the problems in venezuela are caused by the blockade are caused by the warfare economic warfare against venezuela and in spite of all of that we are in a better situation today than we were in 2016 there is more food there is more medicine there s more the employment is under 6 unemployment is under 6 percent and many things i mean we have not closed one school one university one hospital we have not expelled the cuban doctors because we have to protect our people we have delivered more than 2 000 500 houses to our people in the last four years and that is investment that we have made in spite of the sanctions in spite of the blockade against venezuela amy goodman so let me ask you about human rights watch and the venezuelan ngo foro penal recently releasing a report accusing venezuelan intelligence and security forces of detaining and torturing military personnel accused of plotting against the government the report claims quote some detainees were subjected to egregious abuses that amount to torture to force them to provide information about alleged conspiracies jorge arreaza that s psychological warfare against venezuela of course there are detainees that were in plots last year to overthrow president maduro but no one is torturing them this happened in the last century in venezuela we were used to torture we were used to students being killed in the streets every week we were used to repression that stopped with the bolivarian revolution it doesn t happen anymore but these ngos are paid also by the usaid and by the government of the united states and they say what they have to say because they are paid amy goodman so i want to ask you about other leaders in latin america on the one hand you have brazil s far right president now jair bolsonaro and argentina s president mauricio macri meeting to discuss joint opposition to the venezuelan government and then you have the newly elected president of mexico amlo andrés manuel lópez obrador who is not joining with these other countries who are opposing venezuela but first talk about the macri bolsonaro alliance and what that means joining with the u s jorge arreaza yes as i told you it s in latin america it s like a company you know a corporation trump is the ceo of a corporation and these presidents who are businessmen are his directors and they want to be promoted by president trump so they have to do they have to follow the orders and they have been said that they have to isolate maduro that they have to not recognize maduro s government and they have to do what the united states says so in order to overthrow maduro and that s what they re doing of course we are worried about brazil because this man is far on the right it s fascism again it s what we felt that what we believed to have disappeared from the latin american history it s happening again this man hates women this man hates the black population this man hates the homosexual community this man hates venezuelans he s a racist we are worried about brazil he hates the poor but amy goodman and loves the brazilian former brazilian military dictatorship jorge arreaza yes he loves the dictatorship amy goodman and what does it mean to you that amlo the president of mexico andrés manuel lópez obrador the stance he has taken in support of venezuela jorge arreaza i believe that the president of mexico is right we have to respect each other we have to respect the principles of international law i mean if you join the united nations it s because you respect the internal affairs of the other states it s because you respect the equality of states it s because you don t have the right to interfere in other nations that s not what the united states does they have done wars in iraq president trump said that he regretted we regretted that the united states invaded iraq because now the situation is worse than it was with saddam hussein and the same in libya amy goodman and yet you see the same thing happening and of course a very serious similarity you have george w bush coining the term or his people writing the term and him saying it in 2002 axis of evil which set up the foundation for the invasion of iraq and then you have the u s talking about the troika of tyranny jorge arreaza yes amy goodman and the similarities between iraq and venezuela are three letters oil and interestingly many years ago the original name of the invasion of iraq was going to be operation iraqi liberation but they realized the acronym was oil and they had to change it that was the united states but what about this similarity this resource focusing on countries that are you know the world s most important oil providers jorge arreaza i am sure that if in venezuela we only had bananas none of this intervention would be happening but we have oil we have gas we have gold we have silver we have bauxite we have iron we have water i mean venezuela is a very rich wealthy nation and that is why we are they want to rule the country again as they did until 1998 they want to have control of the venezuelan resources and that is why they are so obsessed to overthrow maduro because they want to have these resources for the development of capitalism here in the united states amy goodman what do you think this coup will look like if it takes place jorge arreaza well first of all it cannot take place because we have to defend our constitution and we have to defend the peace of the venezuelan people and the military forces in venezuela are aligned with the constitution they support the constitution and as a consequence of that they support the legitimate president who is nicolás maduro no doubt about it so it won t happen but what they would like to happen is that some militaries say that maduro is not the president anymore and then that they will appoint this young fellow guaidó as president with no constitutional support and then they will have control of pdvsa of the oil of venezuela you said it the oil they will have control of the companies of venezuela of the resources the gold and everything and they believe that is possible that s not possible not in venezuela maybe in some other country but not in venezuela amy goodman i m looking at a tweet that just came over from florida senator marco rubio he says we must support those members of military in venezuela who have announced they will defend the constitution and recognize guaidó as legitimate interim president that s the president of the national assembly jorge arreaza yes you know that those are supposed to be military people they live in peru they don t live in venezuela that s part amy goodman you re talking about the picture he tweeted out jorge arreaza yes that s a video amy goodman of military men jorge arreaza that s a video that last night came and it s supposed to be venezuelan militaries who live in peru i mean that s part of the show they are probably paid maybe by the peruvian government i don t know they are in the peruvian tv but that s not happening in venezuela that s what marco rubio wants that this were to happen in venezuela that the military were to announce that they don t recognize president maduro that s not going to happen and if it were to happen a small group we are ready for any scenario but that s they want a coup d état in venezuela that s a good proof of what bolton pence and trump and marco rubio want for venezuela amy goodman well let me ask you about the issue of press freedom in venezuela jorge arreaza yes amy goodman in december the 75 year old newspaper el nacionalpublished its last issue it was the largest remaining opposition newspaper publishing in venezuela the committee to protect journalists reported the closure was due to restrictions that the government imposed on access to newsprint according to cpj over 20 venezuelan publications have been forced out of print due to government restrictions on newsprint natalie southwick of cpj said quote the disappearance of el nacional s print edition is the latest casualty of the venezuelan government s ever expanding campaign to silence critical reporting and limit the voices of independent media in the country jorge arreaza you know before all this economical trouble and problems we have we used to subsidize the import of paper for the newspapers and now it s the private newspapers that have to import their own newspaper and it s more expensive so that s what happened to el nacional but el nacional you can check the social networks you can check twitter you can put in google you can google kill maduro matar a maduro maldito maduro and it s all over all the media in venezuela the radio stations newspapers tv broadcasting channels of the opposition probably 70 percent of the media in venezuela which is private is against the government and encouraging all these situations to happen because they are owned by the wealthy families traditional wealthy families of venezuela but i mean that s part of the show saying that in venezuela there is no free press and freedom of speech amy goodman but what about the shutting down of this almost two dozen papers jorge arreaza that s not true amy goodman el nacional is not jorge arreaza they re bankrupt they don t have enough money they don t sell enough newspaper in order to have money to import their own paper amy goodman for a non venezuelan audience how would you define the bolivarian revolution i mean you are the foreign minister under maduro you re also the son in law of hugo chávez talk about that history jorge arreaza the history of the bolivarian revolution is a process of independence of giving back the people their rights of guaranteeing that the people have access to health to education to housing to culture to their national identity to their sovereignty that is the venezuelan revolution democratizing our society really democratizing the human rights in venezuela that is what we re trying to do using the wealth of the oil and the other natural resources to invest it in the people for the people as abraham lincoln said that s our mean that s our goal that s what happened but because those resources are not for the u s are not for other interests in the world they are trying to overthrow president chávez and then president maduro and they will continue president maduro would like to have a conversation with president trump and it would probably solve some issues because i am sure that when they if they were to talk and see each other to the eyes they would see that they can coexist and they can fulfill some agreements between them but there s no way i haven t been able to have a meeting with not with pompeo who is like a minister of foreign affairs no with no one in the state department they don t want to have dialogue with the venezuelan authorities what s that that s uncivilized amy goodman final question and this is about the international criminal court in september argentina canada chile colombia paraguay peru called on the icc to investigate venezuela human rights watch hailed the move saying in two crackdowns in 2014 and 2017 venezuelan security forces committed systematic abuses against critics including torture human rights watch research shows they detained more than 5 400 people between april and july 2017 members of the security forces have beaten detainees severely and tortured them with electric shocks asphyxiation sexual assault and other brutal techniques jorge arreaza that s part also of the show now you can compare the human rights record of venezuela with argentina or brazil or any of these countries that are doing manipulating the international institutions and using them to attack venezuela we are waiting for michelle bachelet who is the high commissioner of human rights of the united nations to visit venezuela she s amy goodman michelle bachelet the former president of chile jorge arreaza yes she is amy goodman a torture survivor herself jorge arreaza yes she is and she s been invited by president maduro and we re waiting for her to come to venezuela and to see the situation by herself of course this is part of the warfare against venezuela but as i told you this is going to be part of the past amy these governments right wing governments in latin america are going to be over some of them this year some of them next year and venezuela is going to be there at least the revolution amy goodman how do explain this right wing wave throughout latin america of course excluding mexico jorge arreaza yes mexico bolivia nicaragua the caribbean nations they have popular governments as well but it s uruguay of course has a progressive government as well but it s part of the cycle you know it s part of the cycles but i must say that the united states was focused on the middle east after 9 11 and they invested all these funds and money and suddenly the progressive governments became majority in latin america and when they turned their head they said hey what s happening here we have to do something we have to do a coup d état in honduras because this zelaya is trying to do a progressive government we have to fund the candidates of the right we have to so they have had success until now but the peoples of latin america are seeing are witnessing this and they will change the conditions they will change because the peoples have the right to be in power in latin america amy goodman jorge arreaza venezuelan foreign minister he was here in new york to meet with the u n secretary general he s also the former vice president of venezuela and the son in law of the late president hugo chávez the views expressed in this article are the author s own and do not necessarily reflect those of the venezuelanalysis editorial staff

demand also held largely steady commentary larry hu economist at macquarie capital hong kong there are three key drivers of the chinese economy infrastructure property and exports we see that infrastructure is rebounding but property and exports are slowing down we expect an escalation of stimulus in infrastructure and property in the second half raymond yeung chief economist greater china anz i believe they want to see an aggressive target above 6 5 percent as they celebrate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the prc china can t rely on exports or a very difficult manufacturing sector but we see an upside in infrastructure the government will approve a lot more projects in the pipeline 2019 will be more of a domestic story especially on the investment side julian evans pritchard senior china economist capital economics the latest data suggest that economic growth remained weak at the end of 2018 but held up better than many feared in part thanks to a policy driven recovery in infrastructure spending still with the headwinds from cooling global growth and the lagged impact of slower credit growth set to intensify in the coming months china s economy is likely to weaken further before growth stabilises in the second half of the year on the back of expanded policy stimulus masaaki kanno chief economist sony financial holdings tokyo there was no surprise from the gdp data but the basic message is that the chinese economy is still slowing down the renminbi appears to have stabilised it shows that the investors do not seem to have a big concern in the near term outlook of the chinese economy and are probably expecting some positive impact from policy measures today s retail sales are slightly higher than expected we hope the uptrend should be sustained but we don t know what will happen to consumer sentiment in china it probably depends on the result of the u s china negotiation on trade we hope the negotiation should end up with some more positive impact on sentiment today s industrial production is a slightly positive number but the manufacturing sector still appears to have a downside risk in the first quarter the chinese government s announcement that is to focus on stimulating the economy appears to be focusing on the tax cut to stimulate the consumption it takes time to take effect compared to previous measures that were taken in the form of the increase in more direct spending on infrastructure we still think the chinese economy could bottom out in the middle of the year toru nishihama chief economist dai ichi life research institute tokyo china s gdp headline was within expectation but its industrial production was unexpectedly firm which was probably due to infrastructure investments the chinese economy lacks momentum impact from u s china trade tensions are appearing and its adverse impact will continue in addition to that uncertainties over the global economy are increasing the focus will be how china s domestic demand will offset worsening external demand it will be a close watch how the government s measures such as subsidies and infrastructure investment will support domestic demand hunter chan economist greater china standard chartered the gdp data was on expected lines main drag was from the external side we expect further stimulus from the fiscal side in 2019 focus would continue to remain on reducing the tax burden and easing conditions for smes the domestic labour market remains stable this will likely support domestic demand and consumption going forward we see the yuan appreciating to 6 65 in 2019 rajiv biswas asia pacific chief economist ihs markit singapore on market impact one positive factor in terms of the outlook for the yuan and the equities market looking at 2019 is that the chinese government is now taking a lot of stimulus measures to support growth the reserve requirement ratio cuts have already been implemented and more will follow and a ramping up of public expenditure on infrastructure and the impact of tax cuts will also help the economy we do expect growth to be relatively strong this year at around 6 3 per cent that should support stability of the yuan and also help to underpin the stock market the big risk to all of that is what will happen with the u s china trade war if there is no deal and if the trade measures escalate then this would be a negative for the currency the growth outlook and the equity market a lot will hinge on what happens in the u s china trade war and if a deal can be concluded in the first half of this year naoto saito chief researcher daiwa institute of research tokyo the data shows the economy is steadily slowing down although we had thought we could have seen a bigger slowdown it is hit by three factors a slowdown in the global economy including china s own due to rising u s interest rates the u s china trade war and weak demand for mobile phones which accounts for about 70 per cent of the fall in china s exports in december the government has means to support the economy they can expand infrastructure spending and they can cut banks reserve requirement ratio so we don t need to worry about capital spending but the problem lies in consumption as the u s and china clash on many fronts consumer sentiment appears to have been hurt until now solid wage growth has been supporting consumption but now there appears to be a sense of vague anxiety about the future steve cochrane chief apac economist moody s analytics it s pretty clear that the government will try to use as much selective stimulus to keep the economy on a good track they could easily reduce the rrr again it is still not down to where it was back during the financial crisis that plus some tax cuts the difficulty will be trying to ramp up consumer spending and that s because of the high debt load consumers are in right now the corporate debt load is high as well local governments are strapped with debt so it s not the question of if government being able to provide for the stimulus but really the effectiveness of it jeff ng chief economist asia continuum economics the data continues to reflect a slowdown in china that is caused by both domestic and external weakness some positives to take away are that ip and retail sales beat expectations in december that highlights some degree of resilience in the economy and shows that some of the targeted stimulus measures are helping a little to support the economy the trade war didn t directly impact on the growth figures so much because growth is mostly domestically supported but its impact on both consumer and investor confidence was much greater shane oliver chief economist amp capital sydney no real surprises there the gdp number is down a little bit but that has been expected it s consistent with the commentary around a slowdown in chinese growth the ip and retail data point to some stabilisation in growth towards the end of last year overall they are not bad numbers although there will be some debate about how reliable these numbers are we are expecting a slowdown in q1 led by exports although for the year as a whole we are seeing 6 2 per cent as far as policy response is concerned i don t think we are likely to see the kind of stimulus we saw in 2015 16 christy tan asia head of markets strategy research national australia bank singapore the headline on its own is not much of a surprise for markets if you look at some of the positive spin for this data the december ip and retail sales came in better than expected if we look at the breakdown of the commodity output they seem to have grown at or above average levels for december that may help remove or reduce some of the concerns of a growth slowdown becoming more entrenched this year the unemployment number in the data has edged up and we should not ignore that that number edging up is not good there will be more stimulus they have already announced some of the plans which are in approval stage and will be carried out over the course of the year it s still not time to relax on that front and we will see more effort on stimulus this year background an escalating trade war between beijing and washington has heaped more pressure on china s already cooling economy adding to fears of slower global growth and weaker corporate profits this year washington and beijing have agreed to a 90 day truce in a trade war that has disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods if solid progress towards a deal is not reached by a deadline of early march washington has threatened to sharply hike tariffs on chinese goods but a comprehensive agreement to end the dispute is seen as unlikely by the negotiating deadline given the number of highly divisive and politically sensitive issues on the table even if a durable trade deal is reached dismantling current tariffs analysts say it would be no panacea for china s ailing economy which is being weighed down by weak investment and faltering consumer confidence beijing has been stepping up policy support to avert a sharper slowdown but top officials have vowed not to resort to massive stimulus as in the past which left a mountain of debt the people s bank of china pboc has cut banks reserve requirement ratio rrr five times in a year with further reductions expected it has also been guiding market interest rates lower but a cut in benchmark rates may not happen soon the government is putting a greater emphasis on fiscal policy measures to cushion the downturn with deeper tax cuts and more infrastructure spending expected this year investment growth has inched higher in the last few months as regulators fast track infrastructure projects but it is still not far from record lows while retail sales growth is the weakest since 2003 and the property sector looks wobbly corporate sales and profits are weakening discouraging fresh investment and

feedback mail him on vbhoroma gmail com or skype victor bhoroma1 the most remarkable economic turnaround story of the 21st century undoubtedly belongs to the people s republic of china as the country marks the 40th anniversary of economic reforms and opening the world looks back at the rise of the new dragon in world economics the country s rapid economic transformation is puzzling as it generates a great deal of skepticism in equal measure how could a nation with 1 386 billion people transform itself so rapidly from a vastly impoverished agricultural economy into a formidable industrial powerhouse when so many tiny nations have been unable to do so despite their more favorable socio economic conditions how could their economic reforms be so effective in such a short space of time to change the scope of a capitalist based global trade order according to the world bank china transformed from a 192 billion economy in 1980 to a 13 trillion economy as of october 2018 with an average gdp growth rate of 10 since 1990 no county can beat china in terms of long term sustained and high growth in its economy it has taken china only 30 odd years to achieve what took other countries several decades or even more than a hundred years this transformation lifted over 800 million people out of poverty and placed the country firmly as the second largest economy in the world after the usa china s economic story paints a picture so clear it requires most developing nation s especially african countries to take notes on economic reforms export led growth investment policies research and development strategies agriculture transformation and import policies in 1980 china s per capita income was only 220 one third of sub saharan africa s per capita income today sub saharan africa per capita income is 1 560 while that of china is 10 047 6 times more china has grown to be the world s largest manufacturing country as it produces nearly 50 of the globe s major industrial goods including crude steel cement coal automobiles and industrial patent applications china is also the world s largest producer of ships high speed trains robots tunnels bridges highways chemical fibers machine tools computers cellphones and other small merchandise mainly consumed in developing countries china is the world s largest trading nation with exports valued over 2 26 trillion and imports of 1 84 trillion thereby generating a trade surplus of 42 billion what makes chinese trade a marvel is that its largest trading partners are the united states european union and japan who account for over 53 of the global economic output china also holds the world largest reserves of foreign currency valued at over 3 062 trillion as of november 2018 china reached all the set millennium development goals mdgs by 2015 and made a major contribution to the achievement of the mdgs globally since it accounts for 20 of the world s population china s growth has reduced poverty with only 3 3 of the population living below the poverty line set at 2 300 yuan 333 it is evident that chinese growth was hinged on industrial exports which account for over 95 of the country s export earnings however there are a lot of economic policies that the chinese nailed in order to rapidly industrialize the country in december 1978 china s free market principles under deng xiaoping signposted a turning point in its economic management and trajectory for this to happen the country s leadership had to accept the painful truth that maoist version of the centrally planned economy had failed to produce efficient economic growth and had caused china to fall far behind not only the industrialized nations of the west but also the new industrial powers of asia such as japan south korea singapore taiwan and hong kong during the years of the centrally planned economy citizens had to grapple with rationed clothing basic shortages inadequate housing high inflation rates and a service sector that was inefficient deng s policies strengthened the authority of institutional managers and economic decision makers at the expense of party officials from the chinese communist party the effect of this policy was to separate economic policy from political interference and ensure efficient allocation of resources to economic development the country also improved its investment policies by allowing investment into high tech industries and exchanging manufactured goods for technology the growth in technology oriented research and development also meant the cost of production for various goods gradually went down the purpose of the reform program was not to abandon communism but to make it work better by substantially increasing the role of market mechanisms in the economy through reducing not eliminating government planning and direct control by 1987 the program had achieved remarkable results in increasing supplies of food fuel and other consumer goods which helped to control inflation a new climate of dynamism entrepreneurship and opportunity in the economy had improved the quality of goods and services in the economy the first years of reforms looked at economic readjustment during which the major goals of the readjustment process were to earn foreign currency by growing exports rapidly through establishing export hubs and overcome key deficiencies in transportation communications coal iron steel building materials and electric power that were the major cost drivers in the economy the government also sought to redress the imbalance between light and heavy industry by increasing the growth rate of light industry which makes bulk of chinese exports and reducing investment in heavy industry during an era of the first industrial revolution agricultural production was stimulated in 1979 by an increase of over 22 in the procurement prices paid for farm products the move was meant to reward key producers of rice wheat potatoes tomato sorghum peanuts tea millet barley cotton oilseed and soybeans this phase featured the sprouting of millions of rural enterprises from 1 5 million to 18 9 million and growth in gdp from agriculture food security was achieved and aggregate wages for farmers increased 12 fold the second industrial revolution featured policies oriented toward mass production of goods for the domestic and international markets it also looked at massive investment into energy transport communication and industrial infrastructure in agriculture driven country sides because of the rapidly and enormously expanding domestic market for intermediate goods machinery and transportation there was a big surge in the consumption and production of coal steel cement chemical fibers machine tools highways bridges tunnels and ships in all 2 6 million miles of public roads were built including more than 70 000 miles of express highways twenty eight provinces out of 30 have high speed trains the result was that cost of production drastically fell and made chinese products attractive on the world market infrastructure investments also opened up markets for various producers in the local market and abroad through export led cities at the country s borders the growth of the chinese economy can be termed as the triumph of marketism free markets impose economic incentives to compete profits impose discipline on management so as to control risk and on technology adoption so as to improve quality and control cost of production it also promotes destructive innovation where inefficient producers monopolies and bureaucratic structures fall foreign investment inflows grew rapidly post 1990 according to the 2018 world investment report published by unctad china was ranked the world s second largest fdi recipient after united states the country s economy was ranked the second most attractive to multinational companies for 2017 2019 fdi inflows continue to increase between 2016 and 2017 from 133 billion to 136 billion this growth is favored by economic liberalization policies the rapid development of the high tech sector and the establishment of free trade zones the absorption of fdi is part of the policy of opening china to the outside world aiming at creating a better business environment structures and distribution of investment across the country the government s efforts to achieve a better geographical spread of investments have allowed central china to see its fdi increase over 35 652 foreign funded companies were set up in china in 2017 thanks to the large base of internal customers china s favorable investment tag is hinged on the importance of foreign currency reserves and effective public debt management by chinese government labour costs remain comparatively low in the region for global brands manufacturers such as nike coca cola kfc apple toyota mitsubishi samsung hyundai lg and kia who operate in the country among others despite fears of massive pollution caused by rapid industrialization overcrowding in shanghai corruption by top government officials and massive debt overhang from funding state owned entities soes china s will surely

the world economy muddled through 2018 amid harrowing uncertainties caused by rising protectionism a gradual tightening of global financial conditions and mounting trade tensions among major economies where is it heading in 2019 despite persistent complexities the global economy is expected to continue its expansion with certainty but at a slower pace said chen fengying former director of the world economy institute at the china institutes of contemporary international relations speaking at a press salon held by the all china journalists association on tuesday continued but slower growth chen said that although the world bank warned of darkening skies for the world economy in its newly released global economic prospects report its forecast of expansion at 2 9 percent is still above the average annual growth rate of about 2 5 percent in the past 40 to 60 years the chinese researcher said she was sure of continued global growth but also a slowdown which will be mainly attributable to the united states and china the possibility of weaker economic circumstances in the world s two largest economies spell increasing downward pressure for global growth chen said chen also said that the waning impact of u s tax cuts promises the country s economic slowdown after a strong performance in 2018 with its gross domestic product gdp growth hitting 3 percent according to federal reserve statistics in december the central bank s policy setting board lowered its estimate for u s gdp in 2019 to 2 3 percent growth down from a september projection of 2 5 percent the deceleration of china s economic growth is also unavoidable due to the country s determined efforts to deleverage cut overcapacity and reduce excess inventory chen said adding that the quality and sustainability of its development are being improved greater certainty and stability chen forecast that the global economic situation will be more stable and predictable this year than in 2018 thanks to the temporary trade truce between the u s and china as well as fewer rate hikes by the fed she further said that the restart of sino u s trade negotiations plus a return to rationality and sincerity on the part of the resolve of the two leaders is expected to raise global economic certainty after its latest monetary policy meeting in december the fed raised the federal funds rate to the 2 25 to 2 5 percent range adding that this was much closer to a neutral interest rate that will neither boost nor cool the economy the fed raised the federal funds rate four times in 2018 and lowered its projections on the number of rate hikes in 2019 from 3 to 2 during the latest rate hike announcement chen said that a steady u s dollar index will help calm the turmoil in emerging markets whose currencies took a hit in 2018 due to a robust greenback new round of globalization chen said that despite new forms of backlash globalization continued to gather momentum during the past year the deal to upgrade the north american free trade agreement nafta the success of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp and the acceleration of the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep negotiation all heralded a new round of globalization she said according to chen the reforms of the world trade organization wto should be put at the top of the world s economic agenda for 2019 she noted that globalization is irreversible and the wto dispute settlement regime which is at risk of paralysis needs immediate amendment to uphold the rules based multilateral trading system source china org

demand also held largely steady commentary larry hu an economist at macquarie capital hong kong there are three key drivers of the chinese economy infrastructure property and exports we see that infrastructure is rebounding but property and exports are slowing down we expect an escalation of stimulus in infrastructure and property in the second half raymond yeung chief economist greater china anz i believe they want to see an aggressive target above 6 5 percent as they celebrate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the prc china can t rely on exports or a very difficult manufacturing sector but we see an upside in infrastructure the government will approve a lot more projects in the pipeline 2019 will be more of a domestic story especially on the investment side julian evans pritchard senior china economist capital economics the latest data suggest that economic growth remained weak at the end of 2018 but held up better than many feared in part thanks to a policy driven recovery in infrastructure spending still with the headwinds from cooling global growth and the lagged impact of slower credit growth set to intensify in the coming months china s economy is likely to weaken further before growth stabilises in the second half of the year on the back of expanded policy stimulus masaaki kanno chief economist sony financial holdings tokyo there was no surprise from the gdp data but the basic message is that the chinese economy is still slowing down the renminbi appears to have stabilised it shows that the investors do not seem to have a big concern in the near term outlook of the chinese economy and are probably expecting some positive impact from policy measures today s retail sales are slightly higher than expected we hope the uptrend should be sustained but we don t know what will happen to consumer sentiment in china it probably depends on the result of the u s china negotiation on trade we hope the negotiation should end up with some more positive impact on sentiment today s industrial production is a slightly positive number but the manufacturing sector still appears to have a downside risk in the first quarter the chinese government s announcement that is to focus on stimulating the economy appears to be focusing on the tax cut to stimulate the consumption it takes time to take effect compared to previous measures that were taken in the form of the increase in more direct spending on infrastructure we still think the chinese economy could bottom out in the middle of the year toru nishihama chief economist dai ichi life research institute tokyo china s gdp headline was within expectation but its industrial production was unexpectedly firm which was probably due to infrastructure investments the chinese economy lacks momentum impact from u s china trade tensions are appearing and its adverse impact will continue in addition to that uncertainties over the global economy are increasing the focus will be how china s domestic demand will offset worsening external demand it will be a close watch how the government s measures such as subsidies and infrastructure investment will support domestic demand hunter chan economist greater china standard chartered the gdp data was on expected lines main drag was from the external side we expect further stimulus from the fiscal side in 2019 focus would continue to remain on reducing the tax burden and easing conditions for smes the domestic labour market remains stable this will likely support domestic demand and consumption going forward we see the yuan appreciating to 6 65 in 2019 rajiv biswas asia pacific chief economist ihs markit singapore on market impact one positive factor in terms of the outlook for the yuan and the equities market looking at 2019 is that the chinese government is now taking a lot of stimulus measures to support growth the reserve requirement ratio cuts have already been implemented and more will follow and a ramping up of public expenditure on infrastructure and the impact of tax cuts will also help the economy we do expect growth to be relatively strong this year at around 6 3 percent that should support stability of the yuan and also help to underpin the stock market the big risk to all of that is what will happen with the u s china trade war if there is no deal and if the trade measures escalate then this would be a negative for the currency the growth outlook and the equity market a lot will hinge on what happens in the u s china trade war and if a deal can be concluded in the first half of this year naoto saito chief researcher daiwa institute of research tokyo the data shows the economy is steadily slowing down although we had thought we could have seen a bigger slowdown it is hit by three factors a slowdown in the global economy including chine s own due to rising u s interest rates the u s china trade war and weak demand for mobile phones which accounts for about 70 percent of the fall in china s exports in december the government has means to support the economy they can expand infrastructure spending and they can cut banks reserve requirement ratio so we don t need to worry about capital spending but the problem lies in consumption as the u s and china clash on many fronts consumer sentiment appears to have been hurt until now solid wage growth has been supporting consumption but now there appears to be a sense of vague anxiety about the future steve cochrane chief apac economist moody s analytics it s pretty clear that the government will try to use as much selective stimulus to keep the economy on a good track they could easily reduce the rrr again it is still not down to where it was back during the financial crisis that plus some tax cuts the difficulty will be trying to ramp up consumer spending and that s because of the high debt load consumers are in right now the corporate debt load is high as well local governments are strapped with debt so it s not the question of if government being able to provide for the stimulus but really the effectiveness of it jeff ng chief economist asia continuum economics the data continues to reflect a slowdown in china that is caused by both domestic and external weakness some positives to take away are that ip and retail sales beat expectations in december that highlights some degree of resilience in the economy and shows that some of the targeted stimulus measures are helping a little to support the economy the trade war didn t directly impact on the growth figures so much because growth is mostly domestically supported but its impact on both consumer and investor confidence was much greater shane oliver chief economist amp capital sydney no real surprises there the gdp number is down a little bit but that has been expected it s consistent with the commentary around a slowdown in chinese growth the ip and retail data point to some stabilisation in growth towards the end of last year overall they are not bad numbers although there will be some debate about how reliable these numbers are we are expecting a slowdown in q1 led by exports although for the year as a whole we are seeing 6 2 percent as far as policy response is concerned i don t think we are likely to see the kind of stimulus we saw in 2015 16 christy tan asia head of markets strategy research national australia bank singapore the headline on its own is not much of a surprise for markets if you look at some of the positive spin for this data the december ip and retail sales came in better than expected if we look at the breakdown of the commodity output they seem to have grown at or above average levels for december that may help remove or reduce some of the concerns of a growth slowdown becoming more entrenched this year the unemployment number in the data has edged up and we should not ignore that that number edging up is not good there will be more stimulus they have already announced some of the plans which are in approval stage and will be carried out over the course of the year it s still not time to relax on that front and we will see more effort on stimulus this year background an escalating trade war between beijing and washington has heaped more pressure on china s already cooling economy adding to fears of slower global growth and weaker corporate profits this year washington and beijing have agreed to a 90 day truce in a trade war that has disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods if solid progress towards a deal is not reached by a deadline of early march washington has threatened to sharply hike tariffs on chinese goods but a comprehensive agreement to end the dispute is seen as unlikely by the negotiating deadline given the number of highly divisive and politically sensitive issues on the table even if a durable trade deal is reached dismantling current tariffs analysts say it would be no panacea for china s ailing economy which is being weighed down by weak investment and faltering consumer confidence beijing has been stepping up policy support to avert a sharper slowdown but top officials have vowed not to resort to massive stimulus as in the past which left a mountain of debt the people s bank of china pboc has cut banks reserve requirement ratio rrr five times in a year with further reductions expected it has also been guiding market interest rates lower but a cut in benchmark rates may not happen soon the government is putting a greater emphasis on fiscal policy measures to cushion the downturn with deeper tax cuts and more infrastructure spending expected this year investment growth has inched higher in the last few months as regulators fast track infrastructure projects but it is still not far from record lows while retail sales growth is the weakest since 2003 and the property sector looks wobbly corporate sales and profits are weakening discouraging fresh investment and raising the risk of higher job losses while some economists say china may be facing a significant slowdown no one is expecting a crash at this point still policy support measures will take some time to kick in and the world s second largest economy is not expected to convincingly stabilise until summer reporting by hong kong and singapore newsrooms and asia bureaux editing by jacqueline wong

21 january 2019 14 57 utc 04 00 by anatole kaletsky london if there is one useful conclusion that economists and investors can draw from the crazy year that has just ended indeed from the whole crazy decade since the global financial crisis of 2008 it is this as they say in hollywood nobody knows anything in the film industry the richest and most experienced studios and producers spend vast amounts of time and money on audience research but still have no idea if their latest creations will turn out to be hits or flops so why be surprised if the same is true of financial markets or for that matter of commodity prices policymaking and corporate performance why be shocked if the world s richest company admits as apple did after christmas that it has no idea how many iphones it will sell in china or if the world s best informed energy traders predict a global supply shortage that will boost oil prices above 100 just when a supply glut sends the market tumbling to 50 or if the us president doesn t know if he hates or loves global trade or if stock markets predict a global economic boom when bond markets predict recession and then both reverse suddenly contradicting each other in the opposite direction at this time last year economic expectations were almost universally optimistic every region of the world appeared to be simultaneously booming for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis central bankers were confident that they could safely start to withdraw their extraordinary monetary stimulus and stock market investors were almost unanimously bullish yet 2018 turned into the worst year for investors since the financial crisis forcing central bankers to begin backing away from their plans to normalize monetary policy economists to downgrade their growth forecasts and many businesses to prepare for recession in 2019 or 2020 what went wrong economic data were only slightly weaker than expected in the second half of 2018 the world bank for example has reduced its estimates of global growth in 2018 and 2019 by just 0 1 percentage points to 3 and 2 9 respectively since its june outlook the main cause for concern has been the behavior of financial markets many economists saw the simultaneous plunge in long term interest rates and equity prices in december as an indicator of recession either investors know something awful that is not yet evident in the statistics or declining market sentiment would become a self fulfilling prophecy by causing businesses or consumers to cut back but before concluding that financial markets can always predict or shape the future we should recall that economic and policy changes usually move financial expectations not vice versa so what events apart from market volatility would cause a recession or severe global slowdown a popular answer is simply the passage of time the global economic expansion that began in 2009 has already lasted almost ten years if a us recession does not occur by 2020 the country will have experienced the longest uninterrupted expansion in its history there is nothing in economic theory or historical experience to suggest that expansions die of old age or that recessions happen spontaneously but expansions do become more vulnerable to diseases of old age high interest rates rising energy prices accelerating inflation or banking crises that are triggered when unsustainably high property prices suddenly collapse and if none of these economic mishaps occurs eventually political leaders can become recklessly overconfident leading to wars trade conflicts or gross budgetary mismanagement several of these problems began to appear in 2018 rising interest rates in the us fiscal tightening in italy and much of europe an escalating tariff war between the us and china and higher energy prices around the world it is not surprising therefore that the world economy slowed in 2018 instead of accelerating as most economists including me expected but many of the forces that caused last year s slowdown are now reversing oil prices have fallen us bond yields are back to almost where they started in 2018 trade conflicts appear to be subsiding and china is easing macroeconomic policy at least to some extent and will probably move to outright stimulus if its economy weakens much further the policy changes and political events just described were clearly the main drivers of last year s market shocks for example january s stock market correction and volatility surge were clearly caused by fears of us overheating and rising bond yields once the overheating concerns subsided bond repricing turned out to be very limited equities everywhere rebounded and the dollar remained very weak dollar weakness and global equity strength reversed abruptly in may when markets were hit by a perfect storm of the three political shocks that i had considered most likely soaring oil prices in anticipation of iran sanctions the us china tariff war and the formation of a left right populist government in italy in october with political risks receding emerging markets started to outperform stock markets stabilized elsewhere even in europe the oil price returned to what looked like a stable pre sanctions range of 60 65 and the strengthening of the dollar ended in short markets seemed to move broadly in line with the changing political and macroeconomic fundamentals until everything suddenly went haywire in early december for the next three weeks until december 24 the s p 500 collapsed by 16 for no apparent reason brent oil plunged from 61 to 50 the dollar again strengthened and yields on ten year us bonds fell from 3 to 2 7 if all of the main fundamentals suggest that economic growth in 2019 could end up as strong or even stronger than in 2018 why did equity prices and bond yields suddenly collapse last month could it be that investors are so confused by political chaos that they have given up trying to anticipate what could happen next if so then markets instead of being predictive become increasingly reactive simply extrapolating recent events in a world where nobody knows anything investors may be no better than

we still have relatively strong growth but we do see rising risks on the horizon and an increasing likelihood that some of these risks might actually materialize said elliott harris united nations chief economist in comments coinciding with the launch of the world economic situation and prospects 2019 wesp report among these looming dangers accelerating trade tensions are already having an impact on global trade and employment mr harris told un news in addition rising national debt is also crippling many countries ability to provide basic services but this and other risks such as those from climate change and waning support for international cooperation could be avoided or minimized if countries worked together to do so the un s top economist insisted with mounting pressures in the areas of international trade international development finance and tackling climate change the report underscores that strengthening global cooperation is central to advancing sustainable development yet these threats come at a time when international cooperation and governance are more important than ever many of the challenges laid out in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development are global by nature and require collective and cooperative action waning support for multilateralism also raises questions around the capacity for collaborative policy action in the event of a widespread global shock un report spotlights uneven progress according to the wesp report published by the un department of economic and social affairs more than half the world s economies saw growth accelerate in 2017 and 2018 developed economies grew at 2 2 per cent in both years while unemployment rates dropped among developing economies east asia and south asia saw the strongest gains in 2018 at 5 8 per cent and 5 6 per cent respectively while commodity exporting countries continued their gradual recovery this improvement was particularly true for fuel rich emerging nations despite high debt levels caused by a fall in commodity prices in 2014 15 although the overall picture among developing economies is largely positive many are nonetheless experiencing uneven progress the un report cautioned amid falling individual per capita wealth in several nations further declines or weak per capita growth are anticipated in 2019 in central southern and west africa western asia and latin america and the caribbean homes to nearly a quarter of the global population living in extreme poverty it noted and even where growth is strong it is often driven by core industrial and urban regions the wesp 2019 report continued such that rural areas are being left behind to overcome this and for poverty to be eradicated by 2030 the un report suggests that there will need to be both double digit growth in africa along with steep reductions in unequal pay levels us china trade tensions on the issue of trade tensions it noted that these had led to a fall in global trade levels in 2018 from 5 3 per cent in 2017 to 3 8 per cent and as a result of the united states china uncertainty the expectation is that trade volumes in 2019 will be lower still mr harris suggested government subsidies have to some extent softened the impact of the tariff hikes in the us and china whose growth is expected to decrease from 6 6 per cent in 2018 to 6 3 per cent this year but the risk is that developing economies may suffer the fallout too unless the dispute is settled if the trade dispute becomes more widespread we will likely to see disruptions of global value change mr harris explained bear in mind that the participation of global trade has been one of the ways that developing countries have participated in the rising global prosperity and have accelerated their own developments so anything that disrupts that of course will have a negative impact on their abilities to increase their levels of prosperity and to develop sustainably this cautionary assessment is telling because the us in 2018 contributed more to global trade than japan or the european union according to un economists at unctad the un conference on trade and development which contributed to the wesp 2019 report rising interest rates in the us or a strengthening of the dollar could also make matters worse for fragile emerging economies the wesp report noted adding that many low income countries have already seen a substantial rise in interest repayments on their debt these include lebanon and sri lanka where over 40 per cent of government revenue is spent servicing its debt as well as pakistan and jamaica where around a quarter of their budget is used to pay interest on national debt representing a major constraint on public services slow steady growth in eu but brexit looms on the european union s prospects the wesp report estimates growth of two per cent for the next two years with much stronger performances potentially from states who became members since 2004 the pack is led by poland which saw its economy grow by five per cent in 2018 the bloc s biggest economy germany is set to see more moderate growth however at 1 8 per cent amid potential disruption to the domestic car industry from new technologies new competitors and significant legal and financial consequences from past sales practices related to the diesel technology france is also set to see lower than average growth 1 8 per cent linked to its weaker export outlook while the uk 1 4 per cent is projected to pay for trade uncertainty linked to its plans to exit the eu or brexit with companies moving assets or diverting investment from the uk to the eu wesp 2019 notes the brexit fallout may also be felt outside the eu the un report warns with a possible 10 15 per cent decline in funding available to eu accession countries commonwealth states central europe slso see modest growth in most commonwealth of independent states cis which includes russia most saw accelerating growth and slowing inflation last year amid supportive commodity prices despite this overall growth is forecast to slow modestly this year to two per cent and 2 5 per cent in 2020 wesp 2019 suggests amid concerns that strong expansion in smaller economies may be unsustainable while lower public spending is expected in others focusing on russia the un report notes that lifting the value added tax vat rate may encourage inflation and curb household spending while ongoing sanctions could deter investment from abroad other large commodity exporting countries such as brazil and nigeria should see a moderate pickup in growth in 2019 2020 albeit from a low base noting robust growth in central asia s tajikistan thanks to increased aluminium and gold exports wesp 2019 also suggests a much more positive future for the whole region once china s belt and road initiative becomes operational frequently hailed as a 21st century version of the ancient silk road trade route the region should benefit from upgrades to countries railway road and energy infrastructure improved connections with china and europe and better market access the report explains elsewhere south eastern europe saw faster growth in 2018 and its overall gross domestic product gdp is expected to expand by 3 7 per cent in 2019 and 2020 serbia the region s largest economy benefited from double digit growth in investment amid strong performances in farming and construction while albania also saw solid economic performance wesp 2019 noted before cautioning that longer term improvements risk being constrained unless there are improvements in industrial infrastructure and

tau tawengwa indeed it will be a bumpy ride but we are in the right direction by tau tawengwa the just ended three day national strike monday 13 january 2019 wednesday 15 january gave me an opportunity to read the government s transitional stabilisation program tsp and try to understand where we are as a nation and whether there is light at the end of the tunnel for our political economy i must state here that i m often criticised by my marxist schooled and labour centred friends for being biased towards capital and big business that is a bias i cannot deny i am a capitalist perhaps even an elitist nevertheless i also strongly believe that the state is obligated to 1 facilitate a socio economic environment where citizens can live decently and with enough opportunity to aspire to become whatever they want to be in life and 2 to build strong institutions that guarantee the rule of law it s with these two themes in mind that i decided to take time to understand whether or not the tsp and the consequent government interventions are going to do zimbabwe any good in the long run ironically as it stands today worker s organisations such as the zimbabwe congress of trade unions zctu and even industrialists unions such as the confederation of zimbabwean industries czi are concurrently calling upon the executive to expeditiously intervene in the economy business and labour are usually on opposite ends it s very rare to hear the two singing from the same songbook one the one hand the zctu and affiliate bodies are calling upon the government to remunerate workers in hard currency united states dollars in particular while on the other hand the czi has been lobbying the government to avail foreign currency so that industry can import raw materials needed for production the czi has unequivocally stated that zimbabwe s businesses are left with less than a month s supply of foreign sourced raw materials and that the country could come to a complete standstill if hard currency is not availed urgently interestingly in the midst of this furore the executive has insisted that the country is on the right track and that the most recent government intervention in the form of increasing the price of fuel is the right move in this article i will try to make sense of the current state of zimbabwe s political economy and attempt to determine whether or not we are moving in the right direction as a country bumpy ride ahead on christmas eve 2018 president emmerson mnangagwa addressed the nation in his address he informed that while the process of national renewal and economic recovery was started in 2018 citizens should brace for more difficulties lying ahead there is so much more to be done and there will be further bumps along the road i am aware that many will have a difficult christmas i encourage all of us to be patient resilient and to work harder in collective unity as we create a better democratic and prosperous zimbabwe for all he stated while many misinterpreted this statement to mean that the president is arrogant uncompassionate and even detached from the sufferings of ordinary citizens i believe that the opposite is true i think the president is well aware of the difficulties currently faced by zimbabweans and as he rightly stated there is no easy way out the road to the promised land will be a bumpy one in fact it is not a secret that zimbabwe needs to implement extensive political and economic reforms before the country can unlock significant funding from bretton woods institutions in the forms of the imf and the world bank in short in order to unlock fresh funding zimbabwe is required to effect a comprehensive structural adjustment programme similar to the economic structural adjust programme e s a p that we implemented in the early 1990s for those who are not in the know the world bank backed e s a p came at a time when zimbabwe s economy was deep in recession owing particularly to the severe 1991 1992 drought which deeply affected zimbabwe s agro economy esap was proposed as a world bank backed intervention which would liberalize zimbabwe s economy and put the country back on a growth trajectory essentially e s a p contained the following key deliverables 1 the reduction of government expenditure by retrenching 25 percent of the civil service 2 removing government subsidies on essential products 3 commercialising and privatising some state owned companies and 4 introducing user fees in the health and education sectors while it is widely agreed that e s a p assisted in stabilising the zimbabwean macro economy it is argued that e s a p did not address unemployment and poverty if anything unemployment worsened owing to retrenchments and privatisation arguably the impact of esap fuelled labour strikes and food riots that characterized the country in the mid nineties perhaps in the same way that the tsp is fuelling the same today in fact an article on e s a p in the mid nineties published in the indiana university journal of sociology social welfare stated the following it has been noted that the programs generally lead to retrenchment skyrocketing of prices of goods rising inflation to record levels and steep devaluation of local currencies these situations have lead sic to loss of power instability and or increased military repression i believe that statement is true even today the t s p is another e s a p now it s important to note that zimbabwe s t s p has all the characteristics of the neo liberal e s a p i will highlight three key components of the t s p that expose its neo liberal nature firstly the tsp speaks about restructuring the civil service which should be read as mass lay offs in fact paragraph 374 of the tsp states that the imperative for the transitional stabilisation programme is to reposition re dimension and pivot the civil service to become a more efficient and cost effective vehicle to deliver national development results and outcomes simply put this means the government will effect mass lay offs arguably this is inspired by observations made by the international monetary fund imf in recent years that the public sector employment costs remain at an unsustainable level consequently it s no coincidence that in january 2019 zimbabwe s government began the process of laying off just over 3 000 workers from its youth ministry the most recent retrenchments followed government s 2018 initiatives to retire senior civil servants who are above the age of 65 the reason for the restructuring is simply that the government has to cut expenditure in order to repay about 2 billion in arrears to creditors this is a precondition of the imf before we are able to access fresh support while labour unions and other civic bodies may disagree with the intent to implement mass layoffs in the civil service personally i think it s the way forward because our civil service is bloated and largely unproductive and therefore retrenchment of government workers is a noteworthy intervention secondly the t s p speaks to the matter of privatisation paragraph 384 of the t s p says the following public enterprises reform 384 review of the ownership and oversight model of the state owned enterprises sector is provided for in the short to medium term reform framework whose implementation is now underway furthermore paragraph 387 of the t s p highlights the following deliverables the privatisation of 11 state owned enterprises 6 idc subsidiaries and 17 zmdc subsidiaries liquidation of 2 state owned enterprises and 3 idc subsidiaries merging of 11 entities departmentalisation of 7 state owned enterprises into line ministries essentially privatisation is a key component of structural adjustment and it is therefore no wonder that the issue of privatisation is contained in the t s p however my hope is that while government goes ahead with its privatisation push state assets are disposed of transparently and at fair market prices we do not want key state resources to be sold off for a pittance as we have observed recently in zambia again privatisation is the right way to go as it will raise much needed revenue for government in this light the pandemonium we observed when olivine announced its indefinite closure was uncalled for as it stands olivine is already on the list of state owned entities that are to be privatised and in that context there is no need for government to continue pumping scarce foreign currency into a loss making entity that is soon to be disposed of the closure of entities like olivine is not armageddon in fact it is in line with the t s p finally two recent pronouncements by the executive are telling clues that demonstrate zimbabwe is in the midst of structural adjustment the first was the executive s pronouncement of the separation of fca and rtgs bank accounts and the second was the executive s pronouncement that fuel prices will increase while the t s p does not explicitly make mention of these interventions our finance minister did tacitly indicate that our local currency has been devalued responding to questions on the issue during a dialogue at chatham house in london in october 2018 prof ncube said he would not argue against market forces as he admitted that the bloated rtgs balances were being devalued on the parallel market despite being officially rated at par with the us value on the currency front i think the market is doing all the work for me i don t have to announce it s very clear that the economy is in essence self dollarizing if you look at the rtgs exchange rate and bond note exchange rate the market has said these are not at par and i am not about to argue with the market said professor mthuli ncube the devaluation of the local currency has not been welcomed by zimbabwean workers as it diminishes their buying power and eats into their savings while at the same time fuelling inflation however from where i m sitting there is no other way indeed it is a painful intervention but it is also a necessary intervention in the middle to long term we will start seeing the results conclusion let me conclude by using what happened in south africa in the past as an example when nelson mandela became president of south africa in 1994 the trade union and communist partners of the african national congress anc in the forms of the congress of south african trade unions cosatu and the south african communist party sacp assumed that the right economic policy for the country was the pro poor socialist centred reconstruction and development programme rdp while that policy was a noble initiative on paper in flopped in practice it was noble because it sought to address the main socio economic challenges of black south africans particularly housing healthcare electrification land reform and access to healthcare nevertheless the rdp policy flopped simply because the south african government didn t have the finances or human resources to implement those initiatives at that time as a result by the time that the pro capital economist in the form of thabo mbeki took office in 1999 the south african government had abandoned rdp for the neo liberal pro capital growth employment and redistribution gear policy which focussed on removing exchange controls privatisation and the introduction of flexible labour which should be read as the ability to fire or retrench easily the gear policy was a neo liberal structural adjustment inspired policy just like the t s p is in zimbabwe today the gear policy brought positive economic to south africa additionally management of public finances improved drastically under gear while the policy was constantly criticized by the south african opposition and cosatu for being anti poor and pro capital arguably south africa is what it is today because of thabo mbeki s leadership and the gear policy similarly we zimbabweans should give president emmerson mnangagwa finance minister mthuli ncube and the t s p the opportunity to flourish indeed it will be a bumpy ride but we are in the right direction tau tawengwa is a researcher and published author based in harare

we still have relatively strong growth but we do see rising risks on the horizon and an increasing likelihood that some of these risks might actually materialize said elliott harris united nations chief economist in comments coinciding with the launch of the world economic situation and prospects 2019 wesp report among these looming dangers accelerating trade tensions are already having an impact on global trade and employment mr harris told un news in addition rising national debt is also crippling many countries ability to provide basic services but this and other risks such as those from climate change and waning support for international cooperation could be avoided or minimized if countries worked together to do so the un s top economist insisted with mounting pressures in the areas of international trade international development finance and tackling climate change the report underscores that strengthening global cooperation is central to advancing sustainable development yet these threats come at a time when international cooperation and governance are more important than ever many of the challenges laid out in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development are global by nature and require collective and cooperative action waning support for multilateralism also raises questions around the capacity for collaborative policy action in the event of a widespread global shock tweet url global economy set to grow steadily at around 3 in 2019 2020 but there are signs that growth has peaked read wesp2019 the definitive un desa report on the economy pic twitter com fl5en6kwcl un desa undesa un report spotlights uneven progress according to the wesp report published by the un department of economic and social affairs more than half the world s economies saw growth accelerate in 2017 and 2018 developed economies grew at 2 2 per cent in both years while unemployment rates dropped among developing economies east asia and south asia saw the strongest gains in 2018 at 5 8 per cent and 5 6 per cent respectively while commodity exporting countries continued their gradual recovery this improvement was particularly true for fuel rich emerging nations despite high debt levels caused by a fall in commodity prices in 2014 15 although the overall picture among developing economies is largely positive many are nonetheless experiencing uneven progress the un report cautioned amid falling individual per capita wealth in several nations further declines or weak per capita growth are anticipated in 2019 in central southern and west africa western asia and latin america and the caribbean homes to nearly a quarter of the global population living in extreme poverty it noted and even where growth is strong it is often driven by core industrial and urban regions the wesp 2019 report continued such that rural areas are being left behind to overcome this and for poverty to be eradicated by 2030 the un report suggests that there will need to be both double digit growth in africa along with steep reductions in unequal pay levels us china trade tensions on the issue of trade tensions it noted that these had led to a fall in global trade levels in 2018 from 5 3 per cent in 2017 to 3 8 per cent and as a result of the united states china uncertainty the expectation is that trade volumes in 2019 will be lower still mr harris suggested government subsidies have to some extent softened the impact of the tariff hikes in the us and china whose growth is expected to decrease from 6 6 per cent in 2018 to 6 3 per cent this year but the risk is that developing economies may suffer the fallout too unless the dispute is settled if the trade dispute becomes more widespread we will likely to see disruptions of global value change mr harris explained bear in mind that the participation of global trade has been one of the ways that developing countries have participated in the rising global prosperity and have accelerated their own developments so anything that disrupts that of course will have a negative impact on their abilities to increase their levels of prosperity and to develop sustainably this cautionary assessment is telling because the us in 2018 contributed more to global trade than japan or the european union according to un economists at unctad the un conference on trade and development which contributed to the wesp 2019 report rising interest rates in the us or a strengthening of the dollar could also make matters worse for fragile emerging economies the wesp report noted adding that many low income countries have already seen a substantial rise in interest repayments on their debt these include lebanon and sri lanka where over 40 per cent of government revenue is spent servicing its debt as well as pakistan and jamaica where around a quarter of their budget is used to pay interest on national debt representing a major constraint on public services un department of economic and social affairs desa in this together why cooperation is the only way forward for global economy slow steady growth in eu but brexit looms on the european union s prospects the wesp report estimates growth of two per cent for the next two years with much stronger performances potentially from states who became members since 2004 the pack is led by poland which saw its economy grow by five per cent in 2018 the bloc s biggest economy germany is set to see more moderate growth however at 1 8 per cent amid potential disruption to the domestic car industry from new technologies new competitors and significant legal and financial consequences from past sales practices related to the diesel technology france is also set to see lower than average growth 1 8 per cent linked to its weaker export outlook while the uk 1 4 per cent is projected to pay for trade uncertainty linked to its plans to exit the eu or brexit with companies moving assets or diverting investment from the uk to the eu wesp 2019 notes the brexit fallout may also be felt outside the eu the un report warns with a possible 10 15 per cent decline in funding available to eu accession countries commonwealth states central europe slso see modest growth in most commonwealth of independent states cis which includes russia most saw accelerating growth and slowing inflation last year amid supportive commodity prices despite this overall growth is forecast to slow modestly this year to two per cent and 2 5 per cent in 2020 wesp 2019 suggests amid concerns that strong expansion in smaller economies may be unsustainable while lower public spending is expected in others focusing on russia the un report notes that lifting the value added tax vat rate may encourage inflation and curb household spending while ongoing sanctions could deter investment from abroad other large commodity exporting countries such as brazil and nigeria should see a moderate pickup in growth in 2019 2020 albeit from a low base noting robust growth in central asia s tajikistan thanks to increased aluminium and gold exports wesp 2019 also suggests a much more positive future for the whole region once china s belt and road initiative becomes operational frequently hailed as a 21st century version of the ancient silk road trade route the region should benefit from upgrades to countries railway road and energy infrastructure improved connections with china and europe and better market access the report explains elsewhere south eastern europe saw faster growth in 2018 and its overall gross domestic product gdp is expected to expand by 3 7 per cent in 2019 and 2020 serbia the region s largest economy benefited from double digit growth in investment amid strong performances in farming and construction while albania also saw solid economic performance wesp 2019 noted before cautioning that longer term improvements risk being constrained unless there are improvements in industrial infrastructure and dependence on foreign financing
with more than 5 000 years of civilized history the chinese nation created a brilliant chinese civilization made outstanding contributions to mankind and became a great nation of the world chinese president xi jinping1 introduction historical overview china s history dates back nearly five millennia historians credit the armies of numerous dynasties throughout those many centuries with unifying the early warring states building the great wall send ing the fleets of early ming dynasty maritime explorer zheng he to far off foreign lands and defending against foreign incursions however the people s liberation army pla has existed for less than a century initially referred to as the red army under mao zedong the pla is not a national institution but rather the military arm of the chinese communist party ccp established in 1927 the army spent much of its first two decades engaged in fighting the nationalists led by chiang kai shek during the intermittent chinese civil war as well as fighting against the japanese during world war ii which china refers to as the war of resistance against japan mao s red army declared victory over the nationalists in october 1949 even as combat continued that same year the pla expanded to include the pla navy and the pla air force the pla remained technologically inferior to western militaries during its early decades but china s leaders readily employed pla forces against the united states in korea and vietnam beijing s willingness to rely on the pla as a tool of foreign policy strengthened the pla s position in china even as mao led china through the upheaval of the great leap forward and the cultural revolution the pla endured although the pla emerged from the cultural revolution in the mid 1970s as one of the stronger pillars of ccp power its com bat power was not commensurate with that of other large states armed forces 1978 present china s military rise mao s rule was brought home during the 1979 conflict between china and vietnam when the pla s performance exposed grave weaknesses in operational planning tactics command and control c2 logistics and weaponry the persistent exchanges of fire with vietnamese forces during the 1980s highlighted the need for changes even as large numbers of pla ground troops from around the country were rotated to the border to gain combat expe rience meanwhile the pla began to study contemporary foreign particularly western military operations more closely such as the falklands war 1982 and the bombing of libya 1986 for insights on how to modernize china s combat forces in 1989 pla units intervened with lethal force on behalf of the ccp to suppress political demonstrations in tiananmen square which considerably damaged the pla s domestic and international image world events in 1991 fur ther shook ccp leaders confidence in the pla the u s military s performance in the per sian gulf war provided the pla stark lessons regarding the lethal effectiveness of informa tion enabled weapons and forces particularly mobility and precision strike capabilities that after deng xiaoping s assumption of power in 1978 the path to today s pla was set when national defense was included as the fourth of china s four modernizations the others being industry science and technology and agricul ture national defense was accorded the low est priority which carried implications for mil itary funding and development the failure to achieve comprehensive modernization during had become the standard for effectively waging war in the modern era as a result in the early 1990s beijing altered its military doctrine concluding that the most likely conflict that china would face would be a local war under high technology conditions later amended to conditions of informatization referring to warfare in the digital age this differed mark edly from the mao era mindset that the pla would need to be prepared to fight a war more akin to world war ii the pla s strategy also changed moving away from the maoist para digm of luring an enemy into china to fight a people s war with regular troops irregular guerrilla forces and the general populace instead the pla began to emphasize a more offensive version of the pla s historical strate gic concept of active defense take advantage of longer range precision guided munitions primarily ballistic and cruise missiles to keep a potential enemy as far as possible from the economically fast developing chinese coastal areas by fighting a noncontact short sharp conflict like the persian gulf war china s changing strategic threat percep tions also shaped military doctrine and the direction of pla development although the soviet union had loomed large as a potential military opponent the threat of a soviet inva sion diminished during the 1980s shifting the focus away from preparing for a world war ii style conflict furthermore the u s 7th fleet aircraft carrier intervention during the 1996 china taiwan missile crisis and the acciden tal nato strike against china s embassy in serbia in 1999 led beijing to focus on building capabilities to counter u s forces in addition to capabilities to dissuade taiwan from any political activity beijing deemed unacceptable entering the 21st century china s leaders recognized the confluence of several factors that led them to expand the scope and quicken the pace of pla development china s growing global economic and political interests rapid technology driven changes in modern warfare and perceptions of increased strategic level external threats including to china s mari time interests at this time chinese leaders perceived a period of strategic opportunity wherein the country presumably would not be involved in a major military conflict before 2020 allowing time for economic and military development as a result throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s china s leaders initi ated several practical steps to modernize the pla as a warfighting instrument to accelerate the pla s modernization and address capability shortfalls beijing increased the pla s budget by an average of 10 percent per year from 2000 to 2016 beijing also estab lished a pla general armaments depart ment in 1998 to rationalize equipment mod ernization and acquisition processes and instituted several broad scientific and tech nical programs to improve the defense in dustrial base and decrease the pla s depen dence on foreign weapon acquisitions the pla also revamped its training programs with all services attempting to prepare more realistically for conflict by emphasizing mis sion focused exercises multiservice opera tions mobility better c2 and staff work and enhanced logistic support as well as achiev ing battlefield advantage by applying infor matized warfare regional conflicts defined by real time data networked c2 methods beijing also implemented personnel changes to professionalize the pla while beijing was focused on economic development in the late 1970s the pla had been allowed to operate nonmilitary businesses to offset limited invest ment and resources this led to widespread cor ruption and drew attention away from training for actual military operations in 1998 chi nese leaders ordered the pla to stop operat ing nonmilitary businesses and focus solely on professional military tasks as a result the pla divested from a number of business ven tures but still remains to some extent involved in business schemes the pla developed a noncommissioned officer corps and began pro grams to recruit more technically competent university graduates to operate its modern weapons pla political officers assigned to all levels of the military acquired broader person nel management responsibilities in addition to their focus on keeping the pla ideologically pure and loyal to the ccp in 2004 then president hu jintao outlined for the pla the historic missions of the armed forces in the new period of the new century more commonly referred to as the new historic missions of the pla to aug ment the pla s role as a diplomatic and mil itary instrument and as a guardian of china s global interests these new missions included ensuring china s sovereignty territorial integ rity and domestic security preserving the period of strategic opportunity for china s development safeguarding china s expanding national interests and helping ensure world peace hu s endowment of the pla with these missions at a time when economic interests had become substantial drivers of beijing s foreign policy signified a critical inflection point in the pla s assumption of a global role and transition away from a force bound only to defending china s immediate territorial and sovereignty interests subsequent pla activities such as counter piracy operations in the gulf of aden since 2009 international training and exercises noncombatant evacuations in libya and yemen and expanded peacekeeping opera tions in africa under un auspices have all been part of china s increasingly ambitious vision for expanding pla activities to support its growing global clout china s establishment of its first overseas military base in djibouti in 2017 overturning beijing s insistence from its first defense white paper issued in 1998 that china does not station troops or set up military bases in any foreign country is only the latest development in this progression the pla s evolution since president xi jinping s transition to power in 2012 has built on the hu era but also marked a shift with xi concurrently taking the helm of the party military and state enabling him to shape the direction of the pla earlier during his tenure xi has focused on strengthening the pla as a force underscor ing the themes of party rule over the military improving military capabilities and enhanc ing the military s professionalism 2 xi has also expanded the scope and ambition of pla mod ernization clearly affirming the pla s overseas role and providing the institutional framework to enable substantial military growth beyond the pla s traditional security threats china s military strategy reflects beijing s drive to establish a coherent unified approach to managing national security in a world where beijing perceives that china s expanding interests have made it more vulnerable at home and abroad the following excerpt from the document illustrates beijing s perception of this security environment china s military strategy is directed primarily at an internal audience thus it is replete with party jargon but it does contain the broad underpinnings of china s military decision making calculus for example beijing sees both threats and opportunities emerging from the evolution of the international community beyond the u s led unipolar framework toward a more integrated global environment shaped by major power dynamics furthermore china sees itself as an emerging major power that will be able to gain influence as long as it can main tain a stable periphery as it emerges beijing will use its growing power to shape the regional environment in the face of interconnected threats while trying to avoid conflict over core interests sovereignty development and unification more specifically china believes it must plan to address the many threats to regional stability because they are individually complex and at the same time contain a potential for external actors most importantly the united states to become involved nevertheless china must also look to safeguard its international interests as they multiply and incur additional threats finally as new threats emerge and as other militaries adjust their acquisition strategies and structure china knows the pla must be prepared to fight in new realms and adapt to the modern high tech battlefield with a generally favorable external environment china will remain in an important period of strategic opportunities for its development a period in which much can be achieved china s comprehensive national strength core competitiveness and risk resistance capacity are notably increasing and china enjoys growing international standing and influence domes tically the chinese people s standard of living has remarkably improved and chinese soci ety remains stable china as a large developing country still faces multiple and complex security threats as well as increasing external impediments and challenges subsistence and development security concerns as well as traditional and nontraditional security threats are interwoven therefore china has an arduous task to safeguard its national unification territorial integrity and development interests as the world economic and strategic center of gravity is shifting ever more rapidly to the asia pacific region the u s carries on its rebalancing strategy and enhances its military presence and its military alliances in this region japan is sparing no effort to dodge the postwar mechanism overhauling its military and security policies such development has caused grave concerns among other countries in the region on the issues concerning chi na s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests some of its offshore neighbors take provocative actions and reinforce their military presence on china s reefs and islands that they have illegally occupied some external countries are also busy meddling in south china sea affairs a tiny few maintain constant close in air and sea surveillance and recon naissance against china it is thus a longstanding task for china to safeguard its maritime rights and interests certain disputes over land territory are still smoldering the korean peninsula and northeast asia are shrouded in instability and uncertainty regional ter rorism separatism and extremism are rampant all these have a negative impact on the security and stability along china s periphery the taiwan issue bears on china s reunification and long term development and reunifi cation is an inevitable trend in the course of national rejuvenation in recent years cross taiwan strait relations have sustained a sound momentum of peaceful development but the root cause of instability has not yet been removed and the taiwan independence sep aratist forces and their activities are still the biggest threat to the peaceful development of cross strait relations further china faces a formidable task to maintain political security and social stability separatist forces for east turkistan independence and tibet indepen dence have inflicted serious damage particularly with escalating violent terrorist activities by east turkistan independence forces besides anti china forces have never given up their attempt to instigate a color revolution in this country consequently china faces more chal lenges in terms of national security and social stability with the growth of china s national interests its national security is more vulnerable to international and regional turmoil ter rorism piracy serious natural disasters and epidemics and the security of overseas inter ests concerning energy and resources strategic sea lines of communication slocs as well as institutions personnel and assets abroad has become an imminent issue the world revolution in military affairs rma is proceeding to a new stage long range precise smart stealthy and unmanned weapons and equipment are becoming increasingly sophisticated outer space and cyberspace have become new commanding heights in strate gic competition among all parties the form of war is accelerating its evolution to informa tization world major powers are actively adjusting their national security strategies and defense policies and speeding up their military transformation and force restructuring the aforementioned revolutionary changes in military technologies and the form of war have not only had a significant impact on the international political and military landscapes but also posed new and severe challenges to china s military security excerpt from china s military strategy may 2015 china s leaders see china as a country that is moving closer to center stage to achieve the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation 11 this ambition permeates china s national security strategy and the pla s role in sup porting the party since the early 1980s when china initiated its reform and opening pol icy china s economy has grown rapidly the ccp remained focused primarily on economic growth throughout the 1980s and 1990s and in the early 2000s it identified the initial decades of the 21st century as a period of strategic opportunity in the international environment that would allow china to focus on building comprehensive national power the ccp s contemporary strategic objectives are to perpetuate ccp rule maintain domestic stability sustain economic growth and development defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity secure china s status as a great power china has taken deliberate steps to modern ize the ccp its military the government and other institutions in an attempt to improve coherence before 2015 departments across the government formulated separate security strategies but in early 2015 china s leaders adopted china s first publicly released national security strategy outline a framework to guide china s approach to addressing both domes tic and international security threats and called for international engagement to address shared security problems 12 the strategy outlines beijing s aim to ensure security promote modernization as well as preserve china s socialist system in addition to the strategic objectives above the document emphasized the necessity of contrib uting to world peace and development and called for attention to promoting rule of law in support of national security 13 this led the national people s congress to pass a package of laws in 2015 and 2016 intended to address national security concerns including harsher punishments for crimes involving terrorism and extremism cybersecurity measures and increased restrictions for foreign nongovernmental organizations 14 15 although china s national security strategy out line contained both inward and outward look ing elements beijing s view of china s role in the international community was further elab orated in an article on xi jinping s thoughts on diplomacy published in mid 2017 by one of china s top diplomats yang jiechi yang paints a picture of chinese diplomacy that focuses on china s ambition for national rejuvenation and becoming a world power yang describes a confident china that is ready to shoulder its responsibility as a major country and build a global network of partnerships but one that is resolved and uncompromising as it upholds its sovereignty and security interests 16 the pla s role in national security china s military strategy built on a series of biennial defense reviews that beijing published beginning in 1998 to mitigate international con cern about the lack of transparency of its mil itary modernization what differentiated the document from its predecessors was that it for the first time publicly clarified the pla s role in protecting china s evolving national security interests and shed light on policies such as the pla s commitment to nuclear deterrence the report affirmed many of china s longstanding defense policies but also signaled a shift toward emerging security domains such as cyber and space and also emphasized the need to focus on global maritime operations safeguard china s interests in new domains such as space and cyberspace safeguard china s overseas interests maintain strategic deterrence participate in international security cooperation maintain china s political security and social stability conduct emergency rescue disaster relief and rights and interest protection missions beijing almost certainly views these missions as necessary national security tasks for china to claim great power status in 2017 beijing emphasized several of these tasks in its white paper on china s policies on asia pacific secu rity cooperation stressing the need for a pla that is able to conduct expeditionary operations and other activities to defend and secure grow ing chinese national interests overseas from destabilizing and uncertain factors 18 the pla coordinates with china s law enforcement foreign ministry and other security entities as needed on military related activities particu larly operations beyond china s borders military leadership the report outlined eight strategic tasks or types of missions the pla must be ready to execute 17 safeguard the sovereignty of china s territory safeguard national unification china s military leaders are influential in defense and foreign policy as the ccp s armed wing the pla is organizationally part of the party apparatus career military officers for the most part are party members and units at the company level and above have political officers responsible for personnel decisions pro paganda and counterintelligence these polit ical officers also are responsible for ensuring that party orders are carried out throughout the pla ccp committees led by the political officers and military commanders make major decisions in units at all levels 19 the cmc the pla s highest decisionmaking body is technically both a party organ subor dinate to the ccp central committee and a governmental office appointed by the national people s congress but it is staffed almost exclusively by military officers the cmc chairman is a civilian who usually serves con currently as the ccp general secretary and china s president during the past decade the cmc s membership has included two military vice chairmen who serve concurrently on the politburo the minister of national defense who serves as the face of the military for for eign engagement the service commanders and the directors of the four general head quarters departments this framework occa sionally shifts it was revised during the 19th party congress in october 2017 at which point the service chiefs were removed from the body leaving the chairman vice chair men minister of national defense joint staff department chief political work department director and discipline inspection commission secretary 20 21 these changes align the military s top body to its postreform structure and underscore key themes of jointness party loyalty and anticorruption the pla has been a politicized party army since its inception and exists to guarantee the ccp regime s survival above all else serving the state as a secondary role in contrast to most western militaries which are considered apolitical professional forces that first and foremost serve the state maintaining this party military identity even as the pla embarks on major structural reforms is the top priority for china s leadership pla reforms include establishment of the political work department which appears to have assumed many responsibilities of the former general political department the pla s political work system is the primary means through which the ccp controls the gun in accordance with mao zedong s famous dictum that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun most pla officers are party members and in recent decades pla officers typically have constituted about 20 percent of the ccp s central committee moreover since 1997 the two uniformed vice chairmen of the cmc have served concurrently on the ccp politburo the tiers of political work in the pla are interlocking reinforcing systems that allow the ccp to penetrate the military from top to bottom these tiers comprise the political com missar system the party committee system and the party discipline inspection system political commissars are responsible for personnel education security discipline and morale the political work department the director of which serves on the cmc manages the pla s political commissars and is the locus for day to day political work in the military the party committee system is replicated in some fashion at each level of command party committees fall under the supervision of the cmc political work department and are intended to ensure loyalty at all levels they propagate the party positions policies and directives throughout the force party discipline inspection bodies monitor the performance of party members in the mil itary and ensure upright behavior the pla central discipline inspection commis sion cdic was elevated to the cmc level during recent restructuring from its previous position as a subordinate office within the former general political department 24 these changes culminated with the cdic head s appointment as a member of the cmc during the 19th party congress the cdic has played a key role within the military in recent years overseeing investigations to weed out graft and uproot politically powerful networks in the ranks as part of china s ongoing anticorruption campaign in november 2015 xi also announced the creation of a new pla politics and law commission mirroring a sim ilar party organization that oversees legal and judicial issues in the state bureaucracy 25 stability issues we must do more to safeguard china s sovereignty security and development interests and staunchly oppose all attempts to split china or undermine its eth nic unity and social harmony and stability xi jinping speech at the 19th party congress china s leaders for decades have prioritized domestic stability and the continued rule of the ccp since the 1990s however china has confronted chronic social protest spurred by an often unresponsive and corrupt political and legal system and a range of economic social and environmental problems under president xi jinping beijing has responded to these chal lenges with a mixture of increased repression and ccp led efforts to address some of these underlying problems xi is using the ccp to assert control over all facets of the chinese state restricting the space for independent activity across social political and economic spheres this push includes a sweeping anticorruption campaign a faithfully propagandistic media a tightly constrained civil society and an all en compassing concept of national security 26 in ethnic minority regions such as tibet and xinjiang the ccp has promulgated repres sive regulations against alleged extremism by tightening limits on peaceful religious expres sion and ethnic identity beginning in april 2017 xinjiang authorities detained hundreds of thousands possibly millions of muslims in the region ostensibly for antiextremism reeducation as part of the xinjiang campaign security officials greatly expanded their use of high tech and big data surveillance systems which they are expected to extend countrywide in an effort to curb social unrest 27 china s armed forces support the ccp s domestic ambitions without question in 2015 top military guidance reaffirmed this role as one of the force s main strategic tasks main tain china s political security and social sta bility 28 china s military and paramilitary leaders are actively developing doctrine and forces to backstop local police respond to riots and natural disasters and stop terrorism the people s armed police pap is at the fore front of this mission the pap is a paramili tary force of more than 500 000 troops that for decades has focused on domestic security and economic development tasks under the shared command of the cmc and state council in 2018 beijing moved the pap entirely under cmc control and out of civilian channels and announced additional reforms intended to modernize its force structure streamline its command system and increase its oper ational effectiveness 29 changes to the pap also reflect a shift toward a more operational mindset trading legacy site security missions for rapid deployment counterterrorism and maritime patrols 30 in recent years beijing s longstanding suspi cion that so called hostile foreign influences constitute a significant threat to internal sta bility and ccp rule has led it to step up efforts to pursue political security related goals over seas in 2015 china passed a counterterror ism law that included a provision authorizing pla pap police and intelligence operations abroad evidence that party leaders are con sidering this possibility 31 the pla engages with foreign militaries to demonstrate its growing capabilities improve its tactics techniques and procedures enhance china s image and influence abroad and further china s diplomatic objectives bilateral and multilateral exercises provide political benefits to china and opportunities for the pla to improve capabilities in areas such as counterterrorism mobility operations and logis tics senior level visits and exchanges provide china with opportunities to increase military officers international exposure communicate china s positions to foreign audiences under stand alternative worldviews and advance foreign relations through interpersonal contacts and military assistance programs china advances its day to day overseas military diplomacy using pla officers assigned as military attachés in at least 110 countries 32 china s military attachés serve as military advisers to the ambassador support ministry of foreign affairs and pla foreign policy objec tives and perform a variety of duties tied to pla military and security cooperation includ ing counterpart exchanges with host nation and third country personnel expanded pla travel abroad enables pla officers to observe and study foreign military command structures unit formations and operational training 33 as china s regional and international inter ests have grown the pla has substantially expanded its international engagement especially in the areas of peacekeeping oper ations pkos counterpiracy humanitarian assistance and disaster relief hadr counterterrorism and multinational combined exercises for example many latin american and caribbean countries send officers to the strategic level college of defense studies at china s national defense university some of these countries also send officers to other pla schools in addition to furthering pla modernization these engagements probably will remain focused on building china s polit ical ties explaining china s rise and building china s international influence particularly in asia africa and latin america 34 defense budget 5 to 7 percent growth during the past 2 years the official defense budget has remained at 1 2 to 1 4 percent of gross domestic product for the past decade allowing for steady sustainable expenditure growth and qualitative improve ments throughout the pla estimaing actual military expenses is difficult because of china s poor accounting transpar ency and incomplete transition to a market economy the formal defense budget process does not include funding for foreign weapons procurement some research and development china s approach to funding security require ments has been deliberate and substantial china s military spending increased by an aver age of 10 percent inflation adjusted per year from 2000 to 2016 and has gradually slowed to r d and certain personnel benefits other government ministries distribute defense funds in addition to extra budgetary funds that supplement personnel living subsidies equipment maintenance and other budgetary items 35 36 however using 2018 prices and exchange rates as an example china s total military related spending for 2018 probably exceeded 200 billion a threefold increase since 2002 such spending has been on the rise since the 1990s when china formally began to empha size defense related programs throughout the course of several five year plans although the total dollar value of china s defense budget remains significantly below that of the united states china has benefited from latecomer advantage in other words china has not had to invest in costly r d of new technologies to the same degree as the united states rather china has routinely adopted the best and most effective platforms found in foreign militaries through direct pur chase retrofits or theft of intellectual prop erty by doing so china has been able to focus on expediting its military modernization at a small fraction of the original cost china s military goal is to build a strong combat effective force capable of win ning regional conflicts and employing integrated real time c2 networks 37 the doc trine that supports this strategy is evolving with ongoing pla reforms for instance in 2017 the pla began to implement revised military training regulations that focused on real istic training for modern warfare and preparations for joint combat operations 38 china characterizes its military strategy as one of active defense a concept it describes as strategically defensive but operationally offensive the strategy is rooted in the con cept that once beijing has determined that an adversary has damaged or intends to damage china s interests at the strategic level beijing will be justified in responding defensively at the operational or tactical level even if the adversary has not yet conducted offensive military operations beijing interprets active defense to include mandates for deescalating a conflict and seizing the initiative during a con flict and has enshrined the concept in china s major strategy documents 39 president xi s speech during the 90th anniversary parade of the pla further highlighted that china would never conduct invasion and expansion but would never permit any piece of chinese territory to separate from china 40 china s approach to its dispute with japan over the senkaku islands partially illustrates this concept china has employed both mili tary and law enforcement assets proactively to challenge japan s administration of the islands since beijing determined that japan s purchase of the islands from a private owner in 2012 constituted a serious infringement on china s sovereignty claims although the pla has not yet carried out kinetic strikes on jap anese forces around the islands china s active defense concept could potentially justify such attacks if beijing perceived japan to have fur ther escalated the dispute perceptions of modern conflict the pla often uses the term informatization to describe the transformation process of becoming a modern military that can operate in the digi tal age the concept figures prominently in pla writings and is roughly analogous to the u s mil itary s concept of net centric capability a force s ability to use advanced information technology and communications systems to gain operational advantage over an adversary the pla uses the term informatized warfare to describe the process of acquiring transmitting processing and using information to conduct joint military operations across the domains of land sea air space cyberspace and the electromagnetic spec trum during a conflict pla writings highlight the benefit of near real time shared awareness of the battlefield in enabling quick unified effort to seize tactical opportunities 41 in 2015 china s leaders adjusted guidance on the type of war the pla should be prepared to fight by directing the pla to be capable of fighting and winning informatized local wars with an emphasis on maritime military strug gle chinese military strategy documents also emphasize the growing importance of offensive air operations long distance mobility opera tions and space and cyber operations in other words china expects that its future wars mostly will be fought outside its borders and will involve conflict in the maritime domain china promul gated this through its most recent update to its military strategic guidelines the top level directives that china s leaders use to define con cepts assess threats and set priorities for plan ning force posture and modernization 42 the pla considers information the critical enabler for these maritime focused digital age operations and as a result china invests heavily in the development and proliferation of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance equipment force structure and a universal network that processes information across all of its operational domains these domains include c2 comprehensive support multidi mensional protection joint firepower strike and battlefield maneuver a key driver of ongoing military reforms is beijing s desire to increase the pla s ability to carry out joint operations on a modern high tech battlefield 43 prior to reforms no permanent joint c2 mechanism existed in fact service head quarters had operational authority over their own forces during peacetime and the former army centric military regions were responsible for conducting joint operations during wartime although this was never attempted this con struct was impractical because it would have forced the pla to transition from a service ori ented peacetime construct to a war ready joint construct on a moment s notice senior leaders recognized this flaw and president xi remarked in 2013 that establishing a joint c2 system should be given primary importance and establishing a cmc and theater command joint c2 system should not be delayed 44 consequently core elements of national and regional level military reforms since 2015 have focused on refining the pla s c2 structure producing a joint operational command system with decisionmaking emanating from the cmc to theater commands and down to operational units 45 46 the reform plan aimed to establish two clear lines of authority under the cmc giving the services authority over force management issues while empowering theater headquarters to command operations a distinction that had been ambiguous 47 one aspect of the new struc ture that is different from previous chinese a war footing speaking on behalf of the pla a ministry of national defense spokesman said reforms sought to improve leadership admin istration and command of joint operations so that the pla would have a force structure able to fight and win modern conflicts core elements of command and control reform theater commands the pla transitioned from seven military regions to five theaters of operations or joint commands 48 this struc ture is aligned toward beijing s perceived strategic directions geographic areas of stra tegic importance along china s periphery in which the pla must be prepared to operate joint operations command centers the cornerstone of the military s new joint c2 sys tem is the pla s national and theater level joint operations command centers joccs staffed by personnel drawn from all services the national level joint operations command center also known as the cmc jocc coordi nates the efforts of the five theater commands to achieve the pla s strategic objectives the theater level joccs are responsible for all tasks in their area of responsibility including carrying out around the clock watch functions maintaining situationa awareness managing joint exercises and providing a communica tions hub linking theater commanders with service component commanders and forces 49 theaters of operation according to china s ministry of national defense the theater of operations construct will enhance combat effectiveness joint staff department during pla reforms the cmc dissolved the former gen eral staff department establishing a num ber of cmc subordinate departments from the former organization according to the ministry of national defense the joint staff department jsd is responsible for combat planning c2 support and formulating strat egy and requirements 50 the formation of the cmc jsd is likely to result in more stream lined and efficient operational planning because other former general staff department functions such as mobilization train ing and administration have been assumed by separate departments the jsd is pur ported to have greater representation from across the pla s services potentially enhancing joint operational planning and execution 51 modernizing joint command and control china continues to place a high priority on modernizing the pla s command control communications computers intelligence sur veillance and reconnaissance c4isr sys tem as a response to trends in modern war fare that emphasize the importance of rapid decisionmaking and information sharing and processing the pla is seeking to improve its technological capabilities and organizational structure to command complex joint operations in near and distant battlefields with increasingly sophisticated weapons 52 supporting the reforms with technological improvements to c4isr systems is essential to improving the speed and effectiveness of decisionmaking while providing secure reliable communications to fixed and mobile command posts the pla is fielding advanced automated command systems such as its integrated command platform with units at lower echelons across the force the adoption of the integrated command platform enables multiservice communications necessary for joint operations new technologies which are being introduced into the pla enable sharing of information intelligence battlefield information logistic information and weather reports on robust redundant communication networks to improve commanders situational awareness in particular the transmission of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr data in near real time to commanders in the field could facilitate the commanders decision making processes and make operations more efficient 53 as these technical improvements are brought on line they greatly enhance the pla s flexibility and responsiveness informatized operations no longer require in person meetings for command decision making or labor intensive processes for execution commanders can issue orders to multiple units at the same time while on the move and units can rapidly adjust their actions through the use of digital databases and command automation tools the nature of these reform and modernization efforts in part resembles a western style joint c2 structure in which operational command ers develop force packages from units that are trained and equipped by the services the cre ation of a permanent joint c2 structure that places more emphasis on naval and aerospace forces along with a dedicated strategic sup port force responsible for electronic warfare and operations in the space and cyberspace domains reflects an emerging pla capacity to more effectively execute joint operations 54 even as pla capabilities have improved and units have begun to operate farther from the chinese mainland beijing has continued to emphasize what it perceives as a period of stra tegic opportunity during which it can pursue development without a major military conflict in line with this perception beijing has imple mented an approach to external engagement that seeks to enhance china s reach and power through activities calculated to fall below the threshold of alarming the international com munity about china s rise or provoking the united states its allies and partners or others in the asia pacific region into military conflict or an anti china coalition this is particularly evident in china s pursuit of its territorial and maritime sovereignty claims in the south and east china seas in the south china sea china primarily uses maritime law enforcement ships with its navy ships in protective positions to pressure other claimants and limit access to chinese occupied features china s expansion of disputed features and construction in the spratly islands using large scale land reclama tion demonstrates china s capacity and a shift in willingness to exercise that capacity short of military conflict to strengthen china s control over disputed areas enhance china s presence and challenge other claimants 55 china s maritime emphasis and concern with protecting its overseas interests have increasingly drawn the pla beyond chi na s borders and immediate periphery the evolving focus of the pla navy plan from offshore waters defense to a mix of offshore waters defense and open seas pro tection reflects china s desire for a wider operational reach since 2009 the pla has incrementally expanded its global opera tions beyond the previously limited port calls and un pko missions the plan has expanded the scope and frequency of extended range naval deployments military exercises and engagements the establishment in djibouti of the pla s first overseas military base with a deployed company of marines and equipment and probable fol low on bases at other locations signals a turn ing point in the expansion of pla operations in the indian ocean region and beyond 56 57 58 59 these bases and other improvements to the pla s ability to project power during the next decade will increase china s ability to deter by military force and sustain operations abroad today s pla is still far from being able to deploy large numbers of conventional forces globally but china has developed nuclear space cyberspace and other capabilities that can reach potential adversaries across the globe the pla has expanded and militarized china s outposts in the south china sea and china s coast guard backed by the plan beijing s longstanding interest to eventually compel taiwan s reunification with the mainland and deter any attempt by taiwan to declare independence has served as the primary driver for china s military modernization beijing s anticipation that foreign forces would intervene in a taiwan scenario led the pla to develop a range of systems to deter and deny foreign regional force projection the implementation of hu s new historic missions in 2004 led to the incremental expansion of the military s modernization priorities to develop a pla capable of operating in new domains and at increasing distances from the mainland during this modernization process pla ground air naval and missile forces have become increasingly able to proj ect power during peacetime and in the event of regional conflicts beijing almost certainly will use this growing ability to project power to bolster international perceptions of its role as a regional power and global stakeholder although beijing states that its intent is to serve as a stabilizing force regionally in prac tice the pla s actions frequently result in increased tensions since 2012 beijing has routinely challenged tokyo s senkaku island claims in the east china sea china s coast guard frequently conducts incursions into the contiguous zone surrounding the islands to further china s claims while its navy operates around the claims to enforce administraships in the region examples of incremental improvements to pla power projection in the region are readily found in annual military exercises and opera tions 60 for instance in 2015 the pla air force plaaf carried out four exercise training mis sions past the first island chain through the bashi channel the northernmost passage of the luzon strait and through the miyako strait closer to japan the miyako strait flights were 1 500 kilometers from guam within range of the plaaf s cj 20 air launched land attack cruise missile lacm 61 also in 2015 the plaaf began flying the h 6k medium range bomber the plaaf s first aircraft capable of conducting strikes on guam with air launched lacms like the cj 20 past the first island chain into the western pacific china is also developing new capabilities that will enhance beijing s ability to project power in september 2016 then plaaf commander gen ma xiaotian confirmed for the first time that the plaaf was developing a new long range bomber that would undoubtedly exceed the range and capabilities of the h 6k although the h 6k recently began flying with lacms this chinese built airframe is the 10th design variant of the soviet tu 16 which began flying in 1952 62 in 2016 china and ukraine agreed to restart production of the world s largest transport aircraft the an 225 which is capable of carrying a world record payload of nearly 254 tons china expects the first an 225 to be delivered and operational by 2019 63 if used by the military this capability would facilitate the pla s global reach in addition to land based aircraft china is currently building its first domestically designed and produced aircraft carrier 64 the primary purpose of this first domestic aircraft carrier will be to serve a regional defense mis sion beijing probably also will use the carrier to project power throughout the south china sea and possibly into the indian ocean 65 the carrier conducted initial sea trials in may 2018 and is expected to enter into service by 2019 66 other areas that reflect china s growing mil itary presence abroad include china s partici pation in un peacekeeping operations 67 sep arately china routinely employs its modern hospital ship peace ark to support hadr missions worldwide in 2015 the pla con ducted its first permissive noncombatant evacuation operation to extricate chinese and other civilians from yemen supported by yemeni security forces china s efforts to enhance its presence abroad such as establishing its first foreign military base in djibouti and boosting economic con nectivity by reinvigorating the new silk road economic belt and 21st century maritime road under the belt and road initiative bri could enable the pla to project power at even greater distances from the chinese mainland 68 69 70 in 2017 china s leaders said that the bri which at first included economic initiatives in asia south asia africa and europe now encompasses all regions of the world including the arctic and latin america demonstrating the scope of beijing s ambition growing pla mission areas and enhanced presence abroad may lead to an increase in demand for the pla to protect china s over seas interests and provide support to chinese personnel china s increased presence also introduces the possibility that the pla could play a more prominent role in delivering global public goods in the future separately china s modern naval platforms include advanced missile and technological capa bilities that will strengthen the force s core war fighting competencies and enable credible com bat operations beyond the reaches of land based defenses the expansion of naval operations beyond china s immediate vicinity will provide china with a diverse set of capabilities for strik ing targets across the pacific and indian ocean conducting offensive missions such as blockades and sovereignty enforcement as well as defensive operations farther from china s shores china also focuses on enhancing the pla s isr capabilities which will enable improved targeting and timely responses to perceived threats abilities such as exercising control of slocs improving bluewater capabilities will extend china s maritime security buffer to protect china s near and far seas interests more effectively china s current aircraft carrier and planned follow on carriers will extend air defense umbrellas beyond the range of coastal systems and help enable task group operations in far seas sea based land attack probably is an emerging requirement for the plan chinese military experts argue that to pursue a defensive strategy in far seas the plan must improve its ability to control land from the sea through development of a long range lacm 71 the pla s land based missile and air forces enable other military assets to focus on con china invests considerable resources to main tain a limited survivable nuclear force that can guarantee a damaging retaliatory strike 72 73 as part of this china has long maintained a no first use nfu policy stating it would use nuclear forces only in response to a nuclear strike against china 74 75 76 there is some ambiguity however over the conditions under which china s nfu policy would apply some pla officers have written publicly of the need to spell out conditions under which china might need to use nuclear weapons first for example if an enemy s conventional attack threatened the survival of china s nuclear force or of the regime itself 77 nevertheless there has been no indication that national leaders are willing to attach such nuances and caveats to china s nfu doctrine china is developing a new generation of mobile missiles with warheads consisting of multi ple independently targetable reentry vehicles mirvs and penetration aids intended to ensure the viability of its strategic deterrent in the face of continued advances in u s and to a lesser extent russian strategic isr preci sion strike and missile defense capabilities 78 china is enhancing peacetime readiness levels for these nuclear forces to ensure responsive ness china maintains nuclear capable deliv ery systems in its rocket force and navy as of 2017 the air force had been reassigned a nuclear mission probably with a developmen tal strategic bomber 79 80 81 82 83 the bomber s deployment would provide china with its first credible nuclear triad of delivery systems dis persed across land sea and air a posture considered since the cold war to improve sur vivability and strategic deterrence pla writings express the value of a launch on warning nuclear posture an approach to deterrence that uses heightened readiness improved surveillance and streamlined deci sionmaking processes to enable a more rapid response to enemy attack these writings highlight the posture s consistency with chi na s nfu policy china is working to develop a space based early warning capability that could support this posture in the future 84 the pla is developing a range of technologies to counter u s and other countries ballistic missile defense systems including maneu verable reentry vehicles marvs mirvs decoys chaff jamming thermal shielding and hypersonic glide vehicles 85 86 87 in addition the pla is likely to continue deploying more sophisticated c2 systems and refining c2 pro cesses as growing numbers of mobile intercon tinental ballistic missiles icbms and future nuclear powered ballistic missile submarine ssbn deterrence patrols require the pla to safeguard the integrity of nuclear release authority for a larger more dispersed force china maintains a stockpile of nuclear war heads and continues research on and develop ment and production of new nuclear weapons 88 the pla probably has multiple nuclear war head designs that are decades old and require routine observation maintenance or refur bishment to maintain effectiveness 89 china s nuclear weapon design and production orga nization the china academy of engineering physics is the key organization in developing and maintaining china s nuclear force 90 it employs tens of thousands of personnel and its scientists are capable of conducting all aspects of nuclear weapon design research including nuclear physics materials science electronics explosives and computer modeling 91 92 china s nuclear weapons program has been supported by a number of facilities that include production processing research and development and testing china has the required industrial capacity to enrich uranium and produce plutonium for mil itary needs the china national nuclear cor poration operates several uranium enrichment facilities organized under three plants 93 china probably intends the bulk of its enrichment capacity to support its burgeoning nuclear power industry but could devote some enrich ment capacity to support military needs 94 chi na s plutonium production reactors probably ceased operation in the 1980s 95 however chi na s reprocessing facilities can extract pluto nium from spent reactor fuel 96 biological and chemical warfare china has declared that it once operated a small chemical weapons program for offensive purposes however beijing has consistently maintained that the program was dismantled china has consistently claimed that it has never researched produced or possessed bio logical weapons and would never do so 97 bei jing says china has researched only defensive biological technology necessary for china s defense 98 china acceded to the biological weap ons convention bwc in 1984 99 it declared the academy of military science s institute of microbiology and epidemiology in beijing as a biodefense research facility 100 china regularly and voluntarily submits to confidence building measures under the bwc 101 although china is not a member of the australia group chi na s export control regulations have been in line with australia group guidelines and con trol lists since 2002 102 103 china s biotechnology infrastructure is sufficient to produce some bio logical agents or toxins on a large scale 104 105 106 and all agents and munitions were used before china ratified the chemical weapons conven tion cwc in 1997 107 beijing also has declared two historical chemical warfare production facilities that may have produced mustard gas phosgene and lewisite 108 109 in 1998 beijing published chemical export control regulations consistent with organization for the prohibi tion of chemical weapons opcw standards it also has consistently updated its chemical control list to reflect changes made to the aus tralia group chemical control list china contin ues to reaffirm its compliance with the cwc as well as its support for the activities conducted by the opcw 110 111 112 since acceding to the cwc china has declared hundreds of dual use facilities and has hosted hundreds of facil ity inspections and opcw led seminars 113 114 china probably has the technical expertise to weaponize chemical and biological war fare cbw agents and china s robust arma ments industry and numerous conventional weapon systems including missiles rockets and artillery probably could be adapted to deliver cbw agents 116 china has the technical expertise military units and equipment necessary to detect cbw agents and to defend against a cbw attack 117 entities and individuals in china continue to supply countries of concern with technologies components and raw materials applicable to weapons of mass destruction and missile pro grams such material and technology transfers could assist countries in developing their own production capabilities 118 the pla historically has managed china s space program and continues to invest in improving china s capabilities in space based isr satellite communication satellite naviga tion and meteorology as well as human space flight and robotic space exploration 119 china uses its on orbit and ground based assets to support national civil economic political and military goals and objectives strategists in the pla regard the ability to use space based sys tems and deny them to adversaries as central to enabling modern informatized warfare as a result the pla continues to strengthen its military space capabilities despite its public stance against the militarization of space space operations probably will form an integral compo nent of other pla campaigns and serve a key role in enabling actions to counter third party intervention during military conflicts china continues to develop a variety of counter space capabilities designed to limit or prevent an adversary s use of space based assets during crisis or conflict in addition to the research and possible development of satellite jammers and directed energy weapons china has probably made progress on kinetic energy weapons including the anti satellite missile system tested in july 2014 120 china is employing more sophisticated satellite operations and probably is testing on orbit dual use technologies that could be applied to counterspace missions the pla s strategic support force ssf established in december 2015 has an import ant role in the management of china s aero space warfare capabilities 121 consolidating the pla s space cyber and electronic warfare capabilities into the ssf enables cross domain synergy in strategic frontiers the ssf may also be responsible for research development testing and fielding of certain new concept weapons such as directed energy and kinetic energy weapons the ssf s space function is primarily focused on satellite launch and oper ation to support pla reconnaissance nav igation and communication requirements space and counterspace capabilities like mis sile forces advanced air and seapower and cyber capabilities are critical for china to fight and win modern military engagements to support various requirements china has built a vast ground and maritime infrastructure enabling spacecraft and space launch vehicle slv man ufacture launch c2 and data downlink satellites china employs a robust space based isr capa bility designed to enhance its worldwide situ ational awareness used for civil and military remote sensing and mapping terrestrial and maritime surveillance and military intelligence collection china s isr satellites are capable of providing electro optical eo and synthetic aperture radar imagery as well as electronic intelligence and signals intelligence data 122 china pursues parallel programs for military and commercial communications satellites comsats and owns and operates about 30 comsats used for civil commercial and military satellite communications the pla operates a small number of dedicated military comsats 123 china s civil comsats incorpo rate turnkey off the shelf commercially manu factured components and china produces its military dedicated satellites domestically 124 china continues to launch new comsats to replace its aging satellites and increase its overall satellite communications bandwidth capacity availability and reliability china uses its domestically produced dong fanghong 4 dfh 4 satellite bus the struc ture that contains the components of the sat ellite for its military comsats 125 even though early satellites suffered mission ending or mission degrading failures the dfh 4 has become a reliable satellite bus the pla and government continue to vigorously support the program and have signed numerous contracts with domestic and international customers for future dfh 4 comsats the dfh 4 bus has also allowed china to position itself as a competitor in the international comsat market orchestrating many contracts with foreign countries to supply on orbit satellites ground control systems and training in 2008 china launched the first tianlian data relay satellite of its china tracking and data relay satellite constellation as of december 2017 china had four tianlian data relay satellites on orbit allowing china to relay commands and data to and from its satellites even when those satellites were not over chinese territory in 2000 china launched its first beidou satellites to test the development of a regional satellite navigation system by 2012 china had established a regional satellite navigation constellation consisting of 10 beidou satellites and had initiated testing of a global constellation similar to the u s global positioning system gps 126 as beidou satellites continue to be placed in orbit by 2020 china will complete its global constellation of 27 beidou satellites while maintaining a separate regional constellation providing redundant coverage over asia 127 china owns and operates 10 domestically produced fengyun and yunhai meteorolog ical satellites 128 the china meteorological administration supports civilian and mili tary customers with the delivery of meteoro logical data and detailed weather forecasts the newer satellites house almost a dozen all weather sensors concerning atmospheric conditions as well as maritime terrain data for military and civilian customers china s membership in the world meteorological organization grants it free access to global meteorological data from the international organization s 191 members 129 counterspace the pla is acquiring a range of technologies to improve china s counterspace capabilities china is developing antisatellite capabilities including research and possible development of directed energy weapons and satellite jam mers and probably has made progress on the antisatellite missile system that it tested in july 2014 china is employing more sophisti cated satellite operations and probably is test ing dual use technologies that could be applied to counterspace missions 130 china has not publicly acknowledged the exis tence of any new programs since it confirmed it used an antisatellite missile to destroy a weather satellite in 2007 pla writings emphasize the necessity of destroying dam aging and interfering with the enemy s recon naissance and communications satellites suggesting that such systems as well as nav igation and early warning satellites could be among the targets of attacks designed to blind and deafen the enemy 131 132 human spaceflight and space exploration probes china became the third country to achieve independent human spaceflight in 2003 when it successfully orbited the crewed shenzhou 5 spacecraft followed by space laboratory tian gong 1 and 2 launches in 2011 and 2016 respectively china intends to assemble and operate a permanently inhabited modular space station capable of hosting foreign payloads and astronauts by 2022 133 china is the third country to have soft landed a rover on the moon deploying the rover yutu as part of the chang e 3 mission in 2013 china s lunar exploration program plans to launch the first mission to land a rover on the lunar far side in 2018 chang e 4 followed by its first lunar sample return mission in 2019

space station lm 11 and kuaizhou series solid next lift for emergency response cyberspace authoritative pla writings identify con trolling the information domain sometimes referred to as information dominance as a prerequisite for achieving victory in a modern war and as essential for countering outside intervention in a conflict 140 the pla s broader concept of the information domain and of infor mation operations encompasses the network electromagnetic psychological and intelli gence domains with the network domain and corresponding network warfare roughly analogous to the current u s concept of the cyber domain and cyberwarfare 141 the pla strategic support force ssf may be the first step in the development of a cyber force by combining cyber reconnaissance cyberattack and cyberdefense capabilities into one organization to reduce bureaucratic hur dles and centralize command and control of pla cyber units official pronouncements offer limited details on the organization s makeup or mission president xi simply said during the ssf founding ceremony on 31 december 2015 that the ssf is a new type combat force to maintain national security and an import ant growth point for the pla s combat capa bilities 142 the ssf probably was formed to consolidate cyber elements of the former pla general staff third technical reconnais sance and fourth network based c2 c4isr logistics and com mercial activities third cyberwarfare capabili ties can serve as a force multiplier when coupled with conventional capabilities during a conflict pla military writings detail the effectiveness of information operations and cyberwarfare in modern conflicts and advocate targeting an adversary s c2 and logistics networks to affect the adversary s ability to operate during the early stages of conflict one authoritative source identifies an adversary s c2 system as the heart of information collection control and application on the battlefield it is also the nerve center of the entire battlefield 145 chi na s cyberwarfare could also focus on targeting links and nodes in an adversary s mobility sys tem and identifying operational vulnerabilities in the mobilization and deployment phase the pla could use its cyberwarfare capabili ties to support military operations in three key areas first cyber reconnaissance allows the pla to collect technical and operational data for intelligence and potential operational planning for cyberattacks because the accesses and tac tics techniques and procedures for cyber recon the pla also plays a role in cyber theft in may 2014 the u s department of justice indicted five pla officers on charges of hacking into the networks of u s companies for commercial gain beijing maintains that the chinese gov ernment and military do not engage in cyberes pionage and that the united states fabricated the charges 146 147 naissance translate into those also necessary to conduct cyberattacks second the pla could employ its cyberattack capabilities to establish information dominance in the early stages of a conflict to constrain an adversary s actions or slow mobilization and deployment by targeting the pla uses military deception to reduce the effectiveness of adversaries reconnaissance and to deceive adversaries about the pla s warfighting intentions actions or major tar gets 148 pla tradition emphasizes deception and psychological manipulation to create asymmetric advantages and enable surprise the pla has a longstanding doctrine for logistics and defense industrial modernization deception and claims that it regularly practices deception during training pla sources describe military deception as a form of com bat support on par with isr meteorological support missile calculation engineering and logistic support denial and deception activities include 149 concealing and camouflaging blending false or misleading military movements with actual deployments and war preparations employing counterreconnaissance understanding and evading jamming or destroying the whole spectrum of enemy reconnaissance activities against pla units and facilities using deceptive maneuvers psycholog ical ploys and unorthodox schemes to deceive confuse or otherwise manipulate an adversary into a militarily disadvanta geous position 150 skillfully employed deception can paralyze an enemy force and achieve decisive results options range from no warning strikes vio lent multiaxis strikes and envelopment to a less ambitious attempt to confuse the adver sary regarding the exact timing nature direc tion or scope of a pla operation 151 152 the pla s increased focus on developing the capabilities required to conduct joint oper ations under informatized conditions that began in the 1990s has spurred efforts during the past two decades to develop the pla s capacity to supply and sustain its operations along these lines the pla has taken steps to modernize its defense industrial base to ensure that the pla is developing capabil ities to meet future mission requirements key areas of focus have included civil military integration support to joint combat operations and high tech weapons development logistics according to various military officials the pla s logistics system historically has been plagued with inefficiencies that degrade com bat readiness and restrict its ability to support and sustain modern joint combat opera tions 153 154 155 since the late 1990s the pla has invested in the modernization of its logistics system force structure and supporting infra structure to enable a transition from a rigid command directed and manpower dependent system rife with corruption the overarching objective of these reforms is to build a preci sion logistic support system that is capable of comprehensive timely and accurate logistic support to pla joint operations 156 157 this transformation is dependent on building high efficiency transportation and warehouse infrastructure fielding new combat support equipment integrating comprehensive infor mation systems and developing a new breed of officer capable of leveraging these capabilities to support rapid mobilization and high tempo combat operations 158 159 for china logistics modernization also is heavily dependent on the pla s ability to leverage the full potential of china s comprehensive national power to max imize combat capabilities ensure peacetime efficiencies and guarantee a constant state of combat readiness 160 the pla has made great progress in logistics reform by improving logistics resources and procedures during the past two decades and enhancing the pla s ability to mobilize rap idly and project support along internal lines of communication for large operations mostly disaster responses and exercises 161 162 163 164 since 2016 the pla has implemented struc tural reforms to improve command and con trol procedural reforms to improve civil military integration and oversight mechanisms to eliminate waste and inefficiencies that stem from longstanding corrupt practices within the logistics sector the successful implementation of these measures remains to be seen given the substantial cultural challenges of execut ing joint operations and reducing corruption 165 the extent to which the pla will be able to sustain external military force projection oper ations effectively also remains in question because the pla s experience is still nascent efforts to support the pla s first overseas mili tary base in djibouti may provide insight into these capabilities defense industrial base china s defense industrial complex comprises both a military and a state sector governed by the cmc and state council respectively under oversight of the chinese commu nist party central committee 166 the cmc s equipment development department over sees weapons planning research develop ment and acquisition rda in conjunction with the military service armament organi zations for china

key organ respon sible for overseeing china s state owned defense industrial corporations and enter prises 167 168 twelve sastind subordinate defense industrial enterprises conduct rda and production in six distinct scientific engi neering and technological domains aerospace missile naval maritime aviation ground systems ordnance electronics nuclear during a speech at an equipment quality work conference in 2015 cmc vice chairman gen eral xu qiliang stressed the need to build a strong defense industrial base to support mil itary development xu emphasized themes of quality innovation technology and improving combat readiness but also said it would be necessary to strengthen laws regulations and accountability within the defense industry to increase quality standards 169 the pla initiated defense industrial reforms in 2016 that aimed to reduce bureaucracy develop a more structured rda and produc tion decisionmaking apparatus streamline developmental timelines promote innovation and institutionalize civil military integration within an industrial context the latter entails establishing a formal relationship between china s defense and civilian industrial bases to develop a technologically advanced domes tically reliant and internationally relevant defense industrial complex 170 key components of the initiative include the establishment of widely distributed science cities industrial parks and high tech zones most near china s defense industrial corporations and commer cial industrial centers large cities and pro vincial capitals harboring significant rda and manufacturing capabilities to facilitate effi cient logistics and supply 171 172 these reforms are expected to be implemented by 2020 a key emphasis of defense industrial reforms is developing an innovative military indus trial complex capable of delivering cutting edge technologies to meet future pla requirements china s research and development apparatus is designed to both identify and maximize the utility of emerging and potentially disruptive science and technology for military use scien tific and technological disciplines with military applications targeted for development include hypersonics nanotechnology high performance computing quantum communications space systems autonomous systems artificial intel ligence robotics high performance turbofan engine design new more efficient and power ful forms of propulsion advanced manufac turing processes including additive manufac turing 3 d printing and advanced aerospace quality materials just to name a few 173 underground facilities the use of underground facilities for warfighting protection and concealment enhances china s military capacity with particular emphasis on protecting c4i functions and missile assets the pla maintains a robust technologically advanced underground facility ugf program given its nfu nuclear policy china assumes it might have to absorb an initial nuclear strike while ensuring that leadership and strategic assets survive china determined in the mid to late 1980s that it needed to update and expand its military ugf program this modernization effort took on a renewed urgency after china observed u s and coalition air operations during the 1991 persian gulf war and in the balkans in 1999 the resul tant emphasis on winning high tech battles precipitated research into advanced tunneling and construction methods these military cam paigns convinced china it needed to build more survivable deeply buried facilities resulting in the widespread ugf construction effort we have detected throughout china for the past decade missions other than war china has broadened its participation in un pkos since 2008 to support foreign policy and military objectives by improving china s inter national image providing the pla with oper ational experience and opening avenues for intelligence collection china provides civilian police military observers engineers logistic support specialists and medical personnel to missions in 2016 china had more than 3 000 peacekeepers deployed in support of 10 un missions around the globe the largest contin gent of any permanent member nation of the un security council and separately com mitted to establish an additional 8 000 mem ber peacekeeping standby force china has rained about 500 foreign peacekeepers and the pla views nonwar missions as a compo nent of its readiness preparations broader mil itary modernization efforts and military diplo macy these operations also reflect the pla s increasing role beyond china s borders 174 in practice the military shares many of these mis sions with the people s armed police china s largely domestically oriented paramilitary force has pledged to increase this number to 2 500 in the near future in august 2017 beijing announced that china s first helicopter unit to be deployed to a un mission area had arrived in sudan to support the united nations afri can union mission in darfur 175 as of 2018 china has more than 2 500 troops police and military observers committed to un missions beijing s increased participation in un pko missions particularly in terms of securing chi na s international image has not come without costs for instance in 2016 after three chinese peacekeepers were killed in action and six were wounded in two high profile attacks in mali and south sudan some international media reports accused chinese peacekeepers of failing to interdict attacks on civilian foreign aid workers these reports implicitly questioned china s ability to perform as a responsible global actor in 2017 china sustained its contributions to counterpiracy operations in the gulf of aden through the deployment of its 28th naval escort task force to the region since 2008 during the same period the plan continued to use sup port for counterpiracy to justify chinese sub marine patrols to the indian ocean in 2016 a nuclear powered attack submarine conducted a port call in karachi pakistan during an official visit by the plan commander marking chi na s first port call in south asia by a nuclear submarine in 2017 chinese attack submarines conducted port calls in seppangar malaysia and karachi but sri lanka denied a port call request in colombo 176 these submarine patrols demonstrate the plan s emerging capability to protect china s slocs and to increase china s power projection into the indian ocean china continues to use humanitarian and disas ter relief and counterterrorism cooperation as low threat avenues to advance military engage ment with many of its foreign partners in march 2016 beijing also proposed the creation of a mar itime joint search and rescue hotline with the association of southeast asian nations probably in part as a means of assuaging regional concerns over chinese activities in the south china sea china s military modernization efforts have followed the broader growth and development of china as a whole the pla has made efforts toward reducing corruption professionalizing train ing and education developing a science and technology base for research and develop ment and organizing the force for effective c2 with its economic and security interests reaching around the globe beijing perceives further modernization of the pla as an imper ative for continued stability and security of its growing interests during the past decade alone from counter piracy operations in the gulf of aden to an expanded military presence in the east and south china seas china has demonstrated a willingness to use the pla as an instrument of national power in the execution of historic missions in the new century improvements in pla equipment and capabilities that have focused on generating combat power across the pla services present beijing with additional response options as china faces increasing global security concerns expected advances in areas such as nuclear deterrence power projection cyberspace space and electromagnetic spectrum operations will continue to be critical components of the pla s developing capabilities china also continues to develop capabilities for nonwar missions such as hadr and counterpiracy in the coming years the pla is likely to grow even more technologically advanced with equipment comparable to that of other mod ern militaries the pla will acquire advanced fighter aircraft naval vessels missile systems and space and cyberspace assets as it organizes and trains to address 21st century threats far ther from china s shores the world today is undergoing unprecedented changes and china is at a critical stage of reform and development in their endeavor to realize the chinese dream of great national rejuvenation the chinese people aspire to join hands with the rest of the world to maintain peace pursue development and share prosperity china s destiny is vitally interrelated with that of the world as a whole a prosperous and stable world would provide china with opportunities while china s peaceful development also offers an opportunity for the whole world china will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development pursue an independent foreign policy of peace and a national defense policy that is defensive in nature oppose hegemonism and power politics in all forms and will never seek hegemony or expansion china s armed forces will remain a staunch force in maintaining world peace building a strong national defense and powerful armed forces is a strategic task of china s modernization drive and a security guarantee for china s peaceful development subordi nate to and serving the national strategic goal china s military strategy is an overarching guidance for blueprinting and directing the building and employment of the country s armed forces at this new historical starting point china s armed forces will adapt themselves to new changes in the national security environment firmly follow the goal of the communist party of china to build a strong military for the new situation implement the military strategic guideline of active defense in the new situation accelerate the modernization of national defense and armed forces resolutely safeguard china s sovereignty security and development interests and provide a strong guarantee for achieving the national strategic goal of the two centenaries and for realizing the chinese dream of achieving the great reju venation of the chinese nation excerpt from china s military strategy may 2015 note the two centenaries is a reference to the 2021 centenary of the ccp as well as the 2049 centenary of the people s republic of china intentionally left blank the pla army plaa is the world s largest standing ground force with approximately 915 000 active duty personnel in combat units 177 china s military reforms since 2015 have included creating a separate plaa head quarters for the first time in the pla s his tory in april 2017 the pla announced the reduction of 5 of the plaa s 18 group armies corps sized units and the restructuring to a corps brigade battalion force structure this new design implemented more mobile modular units and integrated maneuver elements into combined arms brigades 178 the plaa is also modernizing c4i systems to enhance its forces interoperability roles and missions the plaa s role is to serve as the primary ground fighting force for the pla accordingly the plaa s mission falls into five areas with eight supporting capabilities roles and missions plaa strategic purpose 1 respond to emergencies and military threats 2 safeguard the sovereignty and security of china s territory china s security interests in new domains and overseas interests 3 participate in security cooperation and maintain regional and world peace 4 maintain china s political security and social stability 5 perform emergency rescue and disaster relief required tactical and operational capabilities 1 remote maneuver actions 5 occupation and control actions 2 information countermeasures 6 regional guard actions 3 firepower strike options 7 special operations actions 4 mobile assault actions 8 all dimension defensive actions plaa produced publications consistently discuss new type operations which are operations that emphasize an effects based application of combat power to neutralize key nodes diminish the enemy s capability to effectively fight systems confrontation and achieve operational objectives quickly at the tactical level plaa battalion training most likely includes use of precise long range fire to maximize protection and surprise dispersion of formations of weapon platforms while relying on advanced communications technologies and increasingly lethal munitions to enable plaa commanders to produce mass effects on an enemy the plaa is the world s largest army units the development of the plaa s new type operational forces reflects china s desire to plan and construct a force that is multifaceted with capabilities for operations ranging from high in tensity conflict to security stability operations these forces stress the importance of isr and leveraging information to enable future com bat they can conduct three dimensional operations army aviation air mobility and airborne forces and can operate in a severely degraded communications environment operations emphasize engaging the enemy from much longer distances place greater importance on protection and survivability and emphasize the employment of cyberoperations future plaa units will be smaller more modular and less dependent on headquarters for resources this new construct envisions generating com bat power and effectiveness across warfighting functions from smaller more flexible units 179 armor and infantry the majority of the plaa s armored and infantry units are orga nized as combined arms brigades but the plaa maintains a few maneuver units organized into divisions the combined arms brigades vary in size and composition containing up to 5 000 troops infantry units include motorized infan try those equipped with trucks for transpor tation as well as mechanized infantry units which can be equipped with either wheeled or tracked armored infantry fighting vehicles equipment in plaa infantry units varies and may include a mix of obsolete platforms from the 1960s up to some of the region s most mod ernized and capable platforms plaa armored units similarly comprise a wide range of legacy tanks and modernized third generation main battle tanks 182 artillery artillery is the key component of the plaa s strike capability 183 its primary function is supporting ground assault mis sions and artillery accounts for more than one third of the army s operational unit strength 184 the current family of modernized systems emphasizes long range deployment firepower operations and mobile warfare the key attributes that the plaa requires in its newest artillery systems 185 air defense plaa air defense units comprise active duty forces and reserve forces active duty units provide air defense for the mobile forces these units are equipped with a mix of tactical antiaircraft missiles antiaircraft artil lery antiaircraft gun and missile systems and man portable antiaircraft missile systems an extensive reserve antiaircraft artillery force comprising divisions and separate brigades provides primarily area antiaircraft artillery protection for china s urban areas and critical economic areas 186 187 electronic countermeasures electronic countermeasure ecm units are equipped with a range of modern ground based elec tronic warfare systems capable of targeting large portions of the electromagnetic spectrum plaa ecm units use hf vhf uhf radar and unmanned aerial vehicle uav borne jamming systems to support maneuver forces special operations forces consistent with the plaa s recent emphasis on infor mation and intelligence driven operations the plaa s special operations forces sof have undergone substantial expansion accord ing to plaa doctrine sof missions include carrying out special reconnaissance special sabotage harassment attacks seizing and controlling key targets guiding precision attacks conducting rescues behind enemy lines and dealing with border armed con flicts and unexpected events 188 plaa sof appears to focus primarily on special recon naissance and direct action missions 189 army aviation pla army aviation comprises 13 brigades these units are subordinate to corps level units in the five theater commands the pla considers pla army aviation a new type operational force and a priority for mod ernization since 2010 pla army aviation has transformed from an auxiliary transport role to that of a main combat force and has increased its regiments to brigade echelon newly fielded and forthcoming helicopters combined with structural and operational changes under way in the plaa indicate a pattern of development designed to mold a three dimensional new type army aviation force with all weather day or night capability 190 and aircraft and facilities ports docks and hospitals during large scale training exercises equipment 192 193 main battle tanks the plaa armored corps comprises a mix of older obsolete tanks and a variety of more modern tanks the plaa is mod ernizing its armored units by fielding third gen eration tanks with updated armor packages larger caliber cannons improved fire control systems and advanced electronics and commu nications the most capable of these tanks are the type 96a and type 99 main battle tank 194 logistics and support plaa logistics and equipment support elements exist in active and reserve units they provide field forces with all classes of supply and maintenance support as well as medical and technical support these forces normally form support groups under logistics and equipment command posts 191 a ztz99 type 99 main battle tank conducting training the plaa also relies heavily on civil military integration to supplement services provided by military logistics units official publications note the importance of integrating civilian and military production during mobilizations and the plaa regularly uses a combination of mil itary and civilian materiel rations and fuel equipment civilian transport vehicles vessels armored infantry fighting vehicles aifvs and armored personnel carriers apcs the plaa has a large variety of wheeled and tracked aifvs and apcs highlighted below are two of the plaa s most modern aifvs zbd 04a the zbd 04a is one of china s newest tracked aifvs it is well armed with a 100 mm gun a coaxial 30 mm can non and a 7 62 mm machinegun it has a traditional layout with the engine in the front right and the driver in the front left the turret is in the middle with the troop compartment in the rear the zbd 04a has a licensed copy of the russian bmp 3 turret it has a three member crew and room for seven passengers this ifv weighs about 21 tons and has improved armor zbl 09 the zbl 09 often referred to as a wheeled light tank is the pla s newest wheeled armored vehicle it has an 8 8 con figuration a 105 mm gun a 7 62 mm coax ial machinegun a 12 7 mm machinegun on the right side of the turret and six 76 mm grenade launchers on each side of the turret the driver is in the front the turret is in the middle the power pack is in the rear and passive armor is fitted to the hull and turret artillery and rockets china continues to produce modern artillery systems aimed at advancing the mechanization of plaa artil lery while integrating information systems to increase lethality and precision the primary systems are the phl03 300 mm self propelled sp multiple rocket launcher the plz05 155 mm sp gun howitzer and two tracked and two wheeled 122 mm artillery systems these new systems are likely to replace almost all towed artillery the exception to this modernization trend is plaa coastal defense artillery which will continue using towed type 59 1 130 mm guns and type 66 152 mm howitzers air defense china has been fielding medi um range hq 16 surface to air missiles sams with select air defense units in the plaa as part of a comprehensive upgrade of its air defense capabilities china manufactures its own variant of russia s sa 15 and is fielding the system with plaa air defense units sup porting tracked armored forces china also manufactures a domestically designed variant of the french crotale tacti cal sam system this wheeled sam is being fielded with plaa air defense units sup porting primarily wheeled fighting forces china s tactical sams have been replacing outdated large caliber antiaircraft artillery in air defense units defending operational and large tactical level units china is fielding a modern domestically pro duced sp antiaircraft gun system with select plaa air defense units protecting larger maneuver units the pgz 07 will provide highly mobile coverage for headquarters areas troop concentrations and key logistic support areas china s domestically designed and produced pgz 04 integrated missile gun antiaircraft system is an upgraded version of the pgz 95 equipped with more effective short range sams the system is fielded with many plaa armored and mechanized units for close range air defense protection of combat maneuver elements training in 2015 pla leaders directed changes to ground forces training 195 these changes included a call for increased emphasis on problem solving inno vation and realistic combat training replacing previously scripted training methods leaders stressed the performance of key tasks such as conducting joint training training in nighttime combat and training under adverse weather and geographical conditions as essential to winning wars the plaa makes use of a num ber of training locations available for its ground forces and maintains at least one sizable train ing area in each of china s military theaters these training areas offer a variety of terrain from coastal and flat areas to moderately hilly to high plateau and mountainous terrains the major training bases provide units with venues featuring large areas for field maneuvers artillery fires and force on force confrontations professionalization since at least 2012 plaa units red forces rotating through com bined arms training centers have trained against a permanently established blue force also known as an opposition force 196 the construction of a blue force was undertaken to ensure that the plaa would become more sophisticated in con ducting realistic training scenarios increasingly plaa training emphasizes the need to empower lower level leaders to conduct target based oppor tunistic initiative driven combat the plaa has decreased the emphasis on saving face shifting toward a culture of understanding that commanders and subordinates should be allowed and expected to make mistakes in training recruitment and professional military education military service probably will remain a less attractive career option if chi na s economy stays healthy although chinese youth remain interested in the career field interest is not widespread 197 the plaa relies on a 2 year conscription period along with a mix of volunteers the ratio of conscripts to volunteers is unclear recruitment challenges notwithstanding the pla continues to pursue efforts to cultivate new type military person nel to retain talent and develop personnel who can meet the data demands of modern war fare 198 the army also has changed military recruitment schedules and age limits in an effort to better attract educated and talented people 199 basic training where students learn fundamental military skills and receive political indoctrination continues to serve as th
andrew maimba correspondent the challenges bedevilling zimbabwe are a product of the past 1999 2017 and the current political leadership including the opposition must work towards liberating zimbabweans so that they are not prisoners of that past the following events and not operation restore legacy and the 2018 harmonised elections results got zimbabwe to where it is today understanding the past in the zanu pf manifesto for the 1995 general elections zanu pf amplified the provisions for benefits of war veterans in august 1997 the government announced a new compensation and pension plan for about 60 000 war veterans which saw each ex combatant get a gratuity of 50 000 about us 4 500 then and monthly pension of roughly us 174 however all this money which the treasury had not budgeted for in that year led to the infamous black friday of november 14 1997 which saw the zimbabwean dollar tumbling against the united states dollar when government finally honoured its pledge the total package paid to the war veterans amounted to approximately 3 percent of the 1997 gdp and it was not included in the 1997 budget the payments resulted in a 55 percent budget deficit in december 1998 zimbabwe s standing line of credit with the world bank was suspended this marked the beginning of the economic woes for zimbabwe as the zimbabwean dollar lost 75 percent of its value against the us dollar on august 19 1998 a meeting of sadc leaders was held in harare where angola namibia and zimbabwe committed to assist laurent kabila s government in line with an oau resolution the zimbabwe defence forces would launch sadc operation sovereign legitimacy between 1998 and 2002 during that war the us government was supporting the rebels which were sadc allies enemies and as the rebels were defeated the us influenced western donors including the international monetary fund and the world bank to review aid programmes to harare denying the government a previously guaranteed aid package valued at us 600 million this put further a strain on the zimbabwean economy further the zanu pf election manifesto for the general elections of 1995 undertook to press forward with the land reform programme where the party directed government to resettle indigenous people on 3 4 million hectares that it had acquired from white commercial farmers the costly mistake ever to be made by the white farmers was the widely publicised event were just after the formation of the mdc in 1999 zbctv showed a video of morgan tsvangirai gleefully clapping hands as white farmers jostled to sign cheque donations to the newly formed party in brief the negative results of the land reform include the imposition of sanctions under the guise of human rights violations and lack of compensation to white farmers but are really a tool for teaching other african states a strong lesson that no land must be taken from beneficiaries of colonialism without compensation because of the land reform zimbabwe became isolated from the international community as the pressure on the zimbabwean dollar persisted forex reserves dropped to critical levels gideon gono the then reserve bank of zimbabwe governor began to engage in quasi fiscal activities and introduced import controls and banned foreign currency accounts fcas the banning of the fcas led to a situation where the rbz began to retain all export proceeds creating an opportunity for corruption in the control and allocation of the scarce forex reserves as the economy was struggling former president mugabe became fixated on consolidating his power factionalism began eating into the party elected members of district and provincial structures were being expelled to facilitate the takeover of party leadership by former first lady grace mugabe those who raised concerns over mugabe s leadership were persecuted the corruption created an oligarchy which has built large houses and drives expensive cars and are frequently out of the country to spend money the neglect of government business affected service delivery all of this put together has cost the country further in stolen resources opportunities and time wasted zimbabwe is largely a spiritual country with most practising christianity blended with african religion during the second chimurenga the freedom fighters would consult traditional leaders and would be guided there is a belief that there are certain rituals that need to be done to thank the ancestors and to correct certain wrongs emanating from the pre and post chimurenga period the failure by government to address the spiritual issues said to be outstanding has often been cited as the reason why the once peaceful nation is turning against itself there is no doubt an economic warfare that has been waged by certain western countries together with the us government against zimbabwe is on zimbabwe is endowed with resources that are not available in the west and in the us and the policies of zanu pf which are pro zimbabwean people have made these resources difficult to access by the west hence they prefer a western inclined regime in the form of the mdc this is why it is not difficult to find a relationship between the mdc as a party as well as its leaders and sanctions for example zdera the country is under trade economic financial undeclared sanctions as well as arrears triggered penalties balance of payments lines of credit and also foreign direct investment have been prohibited or minimised and the effects are not targeted as claimed by opposition elements but are felt across vulnerable groups and the entire economy hence their maintenance for as long as zanu pf is the governing party this argument can be supported by the fact that when morgan tsvangirai was prime minister he called for the lifting of sanctions while he was in australia in july 2012 where he stated i think there is justification for the international community to remove the sanctions because i think they ve outlived their usefulness soon after losing the presidential election in 2013 he started advocating for their imposition again indicating that the sanctions are meant to turn the people against the government in order for a pro western opposition to be in power shaping the future the fundamentals required to get zimbabwe back on its feet regardless of who is president or which is the ruling party are i opening up of democratic space ii upholding of the rule of law iii fighting corruption iv re engagement with the international community in an effort to attract investors fdi and reopening lines of credit v enhancing agricultural and industrial production for domestic consumption and export vi reducing the deficit between imports and exports vii reducing government expenditure viii enhancing productivity within the public service ix abandoning electoral results disputes and unwarranted mass action since taking control of the levers of state president mnangagwa has worked towards getting zimbabwe back on its feet the nelson chamisa led mdc alliance cannot afford to let him succeed if they are to remain a political option for zimbabwe this is the reason why they have formulated the jecha policy to sabotage the president s efforts and the more they allow the president to work the quicker zimbabweans will realise that he president mnangagwa is working towards improving the lives of the people this is why from december 2018 mdc alliance leaders such as nelson chamisa tendai biti chalton hwende patson dzamara doug coltart and happymore chidziva have taken to social media threatening to make the country ungovernable in 2019 mdc lost the local authorities national assembly senatorial and presidential elections and they have to wait for 2023 to have another shot they need to give president mnangagwa a chance to sort out a situation created over 21 years the challenges we are facing cannot be sorted out in a year no matter who is the president
as the u s government blows through its crisis era borrowing record surpassing 1 trillion a year in debt sales it s relying on creditors who could make its deficit financing even more costly america s 15 6 trillion government bond market the world s largest and most liquid isn t necessarily losing customers but the biggest growth in demand is coming from the private sector rather than the public side that matters because if these price sensitive buyers start pushing for better rates it could help drive up the average interest rate on the nation s debt which is already close to a nine year high the shift in the investor base is evident in auction results for 10 year treasuries a benchmark for global borrowing the share of foreign purchases has stagnated as international reserves have peaked but the proportion of domestic bids has risen steadily amid an explosion in exchange traded funds and other passive investment products u s funds bought on average about half of each monthly offering in 2018 compared with around a fifth in 2010 there has been an ongoing question about whether domestic buyers would be willing to absorb all the net supply or whether at some point treasury yields would have to adjust up to a level where they became a more attractive asset said brad setser a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations and a former treasury official buyer evolution the international investor base is also evolving away from official accounts such as reserve managers and in favor of private buyers who may be less compelled to show up at auctions if the price isn t right about 6 2 trillion of treasuries around 40 percent of the market is in non u s hands making these investors preferences crucial for america s finances foreign accounts still buy large chunks of auctions but locals have outpaced them for years in essence it s like all the increase in supply is being taken on by these investment funds at least with respect to the auctions said ankit sahni president of exante data a new york based research firm foreign official demand has stagnated in part because of a decline in global reserves which peaked almost five years ago the u s currency s strength has also played a role particularly since the appreciation of the dollar last year foreign official holders in emerging markets have used their reserves more actively said catherine mann global chief economist at citigroup inc and former chief economist at the organization for economic cooperation and development what s more china s waning current account surplus leaves them less to recycle into treasuries and sanctions may have driven sales judging by russia s actions last year demand headwind although international demand for u s assets is strong among asian institutional buyers and europeans seeking higher returns outside the euro area they ve tended to move to buy agencies or corporate bonds setser said that s particularly true if you hedge to be sure the 10 year s yield of about 2 78 percent more than a half point lower than when the recession ended in 2009 reflects strong interest particularly against a backdrop of solid u s growth and while the bid to cover ratio a measure of auction demand on 10 year sales has trended lower over the past decade it s not far off its 25 year average sahni at exante warns that monthly changes in treasury auction statistics don t capture the full picture of demand for example participants at auctions may simply be rolling over maturing debt or selling holdings around the same time for reasons such as portfolio rebalancing informed debate but these figures help inform the debate over how much a pullback in foreign or domestic participation could exacerbate forces that typically drive borrowing costs higher such as swelling supply and a tight labor market the trend in demand is becoming even more relevant if the u s is to avoid the worst prognoses for its finances and economy in the previous peak for government fundraising following the financial crisis the economy was still recovering from recession and federal reserve policy was pulling borrowing costs lower today s fiscal stimulus comes as those pressures are reversing with the expansion in its 10th year and the fed letting treasuries run off its balance sheet it s uncharted territory said greg staples co head of americas fixed income at asset manager dws this could be the first time that you ve had a massive supply of treasuries at the same time that both the fed is either tightening or at neutral and the economy s doing pretty well for now at least one potential catalyst for a buyers strike is missing inflation but staples says further political dysfunction could unnerve some buyers at the moment we think the market s going to accept increased supply he said but the partial government shutdown is only raising the stakes investors attitude toward u s debt may change if the political backdrop grows more toxic as debt ceiling and budget deadlines approach next quarter staples said treasury will get a strong signal from its buyer base in early february following the next quarterly refunding wall street expects this

declining price level in a developing economy which is perennially suffering from widening fiscal deficits fd is good news while maintaining the country s fd within 3 3 of gdp by fy19 might be overshot marginally the inflation management bodes well for the economy the latest core inflation reflected in consumer price index cpi indicates that price level had increased by 2 19 during december 2018 and the headline inflation represented by wholesale price index wpi had gone up by 3 8 during the period both are well within the medium term mandate of monetary policy of the reserve bank of india of keeping inflation within 4 2 band read also enjoy hot tea in kulhads indian railways to re introduce eco friendly earthen cups although for medium and long term monetary policy perspective rbi considers the headline inflation the very nature of cpi being oriented towards the prices of daily necessities of the common man and therefore directly influencing their well being it is also being taken into due consideration in deciding the monetary policy the brent crude oil prices had observed a steady downward movement and stood at 56 56 gallon a 22 drop from 72 11 gallon in april 2018 this had helped the current account deficit in other words saving investment gap to come down but neutralised by higher level of imports and lower growth in export for instance the total steel imports at 6 7 mt during april december fell by 1 62 whereas the total steel exports at 6 4 mt during the period went down by 29 14 as a result the cad that was 1 9 of gdp by fy18 stands at 2 7 of gdp by q3 fy19 secondly the depreciation movement of rupee vis s vis dollar from 65 63 in april 2018 to 70 44 in december also contributed to the widening of import bill the movement of wpi rates in various steel categories during the past nine months indicates a good signal of the market trends of steel prices the comparison of the same in major steel categories with the movement of global steel prices and domestic prices may throw some light on this wpi for wire rods has increased by 1 6 during the past nine months during this period export prices of ex turkey wire rods mesh have fallen by 16 3 and domestic average prices for 6 mm wire rods rose from 50 157 tonne all inclusive in april 2018 to 51 839 t in november by 3 4 similarly the wpi for hr coils marginally dipped by 0 1 in the past nine months the chinese export price for hr coils ex tianjin had fallen by 16 3 during the period the domestic prices of hr coils have moved up from 54 930 t including gst in april to 55 541 t in november 2018 by 1 1 in a globalised market scenario it is possible that the degree of decline in domestic prices would be aligned with the price decline in the global market however if the rate of decline in the domestic market is lower or behaves in the reverse albeit marginally the credit must go to the indigenous demand factor in case of india this has actually happened as the above price movement trend would signify in a scenario of price decline it is common that buyers postpone their purchase especially for inventory purposes this is also applicable partially for the project implementing agencies which procure in bulk during upward price scenario thus declining prices sort of escalate the downward movement of demand the current steel market is reflecting largely a similar picture the domestic market behaviour would predominantly influence indian steel market as the global market size is getting increasingly squeezed the unilateral action of the us to impose restrictive duties under section 232 on imports of steel and aluminium has resulted in the diversion of exports by south korea and japan from usa to india and other countries a new phenomenon of quota based steel trading is becoming the basic rule the average exports in the past three years form the basis that would determine the quota rule while the us is gradually getting into the quota groove with argentina brazil south korea and possibly japan and reworking united states mexico canada agreement for north american free trade agreement the latest safeguard duty imposition with a number of trading partners including india by european union finalising in early february 2019 would be further restricting the global steel trade in the contraction zone the likely provision that unfulfilled volume in a specific quota may also be utilised by one after fulfilment of its own quota would gradually take the quota based trade to a bilateral or trilateral trade mechanism a fact far distant from the multilateral trade pattern envisaged by the world trade organization the us and eu germany italy belgium turkey and france apart from south korea thailand and vietnam are the majority of export destinations among the top 10 large export destinations for steel in 2017 china factor in determining the shape of global steel trade is still predominant the country exported 69 34 mt of steel in 2018 which is 29 1 lower compared to the previous year it would face quota in the eu while us china trade war has not shown any diminishing trend that leaves south asia middle east vietnam and india as export destinations for china in 2019 as china is facing antidumping duty and countervailing duty and safeguard duties in a maximum number of countries the pricing of chinese exports can only be competitive and not below the marginal cop a reasonably stable global steel price would therefore be a prime factor in stabilising domestic steel prices in india in the coming months the author is dg

china s economy cooled in the fourth quarter under pressure from faltering domestic demand and bruising us tariffs dragging 2018 growth to the lowest in nearly three decades and pressuring beijing to roll out more stimulus to avert a sharper slowdown growing signs of weakness in china which has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years are fuelling anxiety about risks to the world economy and are weighing on profits for firms ranging from apple to big carmakers policymakers have pledged more support this year to reduce the risk of massive job losses but have ruled out a flood of stimulus like that which beijing has relied on in the past which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt the government has means to support the economy they can expand infrastructure spending and they can cut banks reserve requirement ratio so we don t need to worry about capital spending said naoto saito chief researcher at daiwa institute of research in tokyo but the problem lies in consumption as the u s and china clash on many fronts consumer sentiment appears to have been hurt until now solid wage growth has been supporting consumption but now there appears to be a sense of vague anxiety about the future fourth quarter gross domestic product gdp grew at the slowest pace since the global financial crisis easing to 6 4 per cent on year as expected from 6 5 per cent in the third quarter the national bureau of statistics said on monday that pulled full year growth down to 6 6 per cent the slowest annual pace since 1990 gdp in 2017 grew a revised 6 8 per cent with support measures expected to take some time to kick in most analysts believe conditions are likely to get worse before they get better and see a further slowing to 6 3 per cent this year some china watchers believe actual growth is already weaker than official data suggest uncertainties aplenty despite a raft of policy easing steps so far december data released along with gdp showed continued weakness across broad areas of the economy at the end of last year factory output picked up unexpectedly to 5 7 per cent from 5 4 per cent but it was one of the few bright spots along with a stronger services sector while regulators have been fast tracking construction projects most of the gain appeared due to higher mining and oil production reuters calculations showed average daily steel output hit its lowest level since march as producers cut output amid shrinking profit margins despite the slowing economy chinese officials also pledged to continue with a crackdown on air pollution that has weighed on the industrial sector other data on monday showed investment and retail sales continued to languish while the jobless rate edged higher fixed asset investment rose 5 9 per cent in 2018 the slowest in at least 22 years as a regulatory crackdown on riskier financing and debt weighed on local government spending early in the year property investment is also looking wobbly with analysts waiting to see if beijing will risk loosening restrictions on home buyers that have kept a potential housing bubble in check chinese consumers are clearly feeling the pressure though retail sales growth picked up marginally in december to 8 2 per cent the consumer strength gauge is around the weakest in 15 years auto sales in the world s biggest car market shrank for the first time since the 1990s officials recently pledged to boost consumer demand for big ticket items from cars to appliances but gains in disposable income are slowing while household debt is on the rise other data in recent weeks showed exports and imports unexpectedly shrank last month while falling factory orders point to a further drop in activity in coming months and more job shedding some factories in guangdong china s export hub have shut earlier than usual ahead of the long lunar new year holiday as new business dries up trade pressures even if china and the united states agree on a trade deal in current talks which would be a tall order analysts said it would be no panacea for china or its exporters demand is weakening globally not just in the united states net exports actually dragged on china s growth by 8 6 percent last year reuters calculations based on official data showed trade negotiators are facing an early march deadline and washington has threatened to sharply hike tariffs if there are no substantial signs of agreement white house officials have given markedly different views on progress so far china s vice premier and lead negotiator liu he is due to visit washington for the next round of talks at the end of the month more stimulus to free up more funds for lending particularly to vulnerable smaller firms the central bank has cut the amount of reserves that banks need to set aside as reserves rrr five times over the past year and guided borrowing costs lower further rrr reductions are expected in coming quarters but most analysts do not see a cut in benchmark interest rates yet as policymakers wait to see if earlier steps begin to stabilise activity more forceful easing could also pressure the yuan and aggravate high debt levels with money going into less efficient or speculative investments as it often has in the past the government may unveil more fiscal stimulus during the annual parliament meeting in march including bigger tax cuts and more spending on infrastructure projects some analysts believe it could deliver 2 trillion yuan 295 13 billion worth of cuts in taxes and fees this year and allow local governments to issue another 2 trillion yuan in special bonds largely used to fund key projects china has ample room for policy adjustments statistics bureau chief ning jizhe said on monday still some analysts do not expect the economy to bottom out convincingly until summer 1 6 7767 chinese yuan renminbi
both the boj and european central bank will hold policy meetings this week neither is expected to change its stance jpmorgan economists illustrate the limited scope to re arm they estimate the average benchmark of developed world central banks remains almost 2 percentage points below the pre crisis level and recent economic weakness and quiescent inflation have forced them to rein in forecasts for how much that gap will close they now expect the federal reserve to raise rates just two times this year not the four they thought previously they ve pushed back the european central bank s first rate increase to december from september and cut their anticipated hikes next year to two from three and they no longer see the boj lifting its 10 year yield target in 2020 some analysts maintain central banks need to move quickly to normalise policy so they re better positioned to deal with the next downturn but policymakers have generally rejected such a strategy arguing that an economically unwarranted move to a tighter stance could bring about the very economic contraction they re seeking to avoid the upshot is there will be less ammunition for next time something likely to worry investors the fed for example has a current rate target range of 2 25 per cent to 2 5 per cent about half the 500 basis points in cuts it has made to fight past downturns if the ecb was facing its current outlook but with higher rates it would be easing policy according to krishna guha the head of central bank strategy at evercore isi advertisement still ecb president mario draghi has signalled that an increase in rates is possible this year something a growing number of investors and economists say is unlikely to materialise economists at hsbc holdings reckon that the ecb has missed its opportunity to tighten the boj has also refrained from taking additional action to spur prices even though underlying inflation remains near zero per cent that might reflect some political pushback against its ultra easy policies the boj will probably prefer to preserve its scarce ammunition alicia garcia herrero chief economist for asia pacific at natixis sa in hong kong wrote in a note that would also protect its reputation from frequent policy changes policy blitz to understand how much ammunition was spent in the wake of the global financial crisis consider this analysts at bank of america calculate central banks cut rates more than 700 times and bought us12 trillion of financial assets since the september 2008 collapse of lehman brothers global government debt surged close to 75 per cent to us66 5 trillion they estimate only the fed has made any real progress in moving away from crisis settings with nine rate hikes since late 2015 and by slowly reducing its holdings of securities bought during the crisis and its aftermath advertisement low rates are a fact of life that we as policymakers have to deal with fed vice chairman richard clarida told fox business network this month we have the tools that we think are appropriate to provide support to the economy if needed the ecb and the boj are in a tougher spot their main policy rates are in negative territory european and japanese central bankers are most at risk of having to fight the next downturn with their bare knuckles as they haven t even started to recoup ammunition said joachim fels global economic adviser at pacific investment management co that could lead to meaningful instability in foreign exchange markets during the next global slump as the fed cuts rates to counter the downturn while the ecb and boj are constrained from acting said nathan sheets chief economist at pgim fixed income investors in that case would be torn between wanting to offload dollars because they yield less and coveting them as a safe haven at a time of economic trouble those diminished arsenals mean policymakers will probably have to burrow ever deeper into unconventional territory already the program of asset purchases known as quantitative easing rolled out by the ecb fed boj and others has drawn political criticism others question the efficacy of qe in reaching parts of the economy ailing from logjams that can t be resolved by monetary policy to make matters worse other stimulus options may also be more limited next time the global economy needs a boost us tax cuts which limit space for fiscal stimulus when it is needed and diminished capacity for international policy co ordination add to the concerns bloomberg economics chief economist tom orlik said the prospect of a slower pace of rate hikes by the fed and delays in normalisation from the ecb and bank of japan is a reminder that when the next downturn comes central banks will have more limited ammunition to fight it bloomberg

by portia nkani the global economy faces a number of complex challenges from technological change and globalization and the lingering effects of the 2008 9 financial crisis global growth is moderating as the recovery in trade and manufacturing activity loses steam despite ongoing negotiations trade tensions among major economies remain elevated these tensions combined with concerns about softening global growth prospects have weighed on investor sentiment and contributed to declines in global equity prices on monetary policy there is considerable discussion about how central banks can respond to a deep or prolonged downturn the latest world banks global economic prospects report shows that borrowing costs for emerging market and developing economies emdes have increased in part as major advanced economy central banks continue to withdraw policy accommodation in varying degrees a strengthening u s dollar heightened financial market volatility and rising risk premiums have intensified capital outflow and currency pressures in some large emdes with some vulnerable countries experiencing substantial financial stress energy prices have fluctuated markedly mainly due to supply factors with sharp falls toward the end of 2018 other commodity pricesôçöparticularly metalsôçöhave also weakened posing renewed headwinds for commodity exporters economic activity in advanced economies has been diverging of late growth in the united states has remained solid bolstered by fiscal stimulus in contrast activity in the euro area has been somewhat weaker than previously expected owing to slowing net exports while growth in advanced economies is estimated to have slightly decelerated to 2 2 percent last year it is still above potential and in line with previous forecasts emde growth edged down to an estimated 4 2 percent in 2018ôçö0 3 percentage point slower than previously projectedôçöas a number of countries with elevated current account deficits experienced substantial financial market pressures and appreciable slowdowns in activity more generally as suggested by recent high frequency indicators the recovery among commodity exporters has lost momentum significantly largely owing to country specific challenges within this group activity in commodity importers while still robust has slowed somewhat reflecting capacity constraints and decelerating export growth in low income countries lics growth is firming as infrastructure investment continues and easing drought conditions support a rebound in agricultural output however lic metals exporters are struggling partly reflecting softer metals prices central banks in many emdes have tightened policy to varying degrees to confront currency and inflation pressures in all global growth is projected to moderate from a downwardly revised 3 percent in 2018 to 2 9 percent in 2019 and 2 8 percent in 2020 21 as economic slack dissipates monetary policy accommodation in advanced economies is removed and global

than expected pickup in commodity exporters accompanied by a deceleration in commodity importers emde growth is projected to plateau at an average of 4 6 percent in 2020 21 as the recovery in commodity exporters levels off reads the report per capita growth will remain anemic in several emde regionsôçömost notably in those with a large number of commodity exportersôçölikely impeding further poverty alleviation the projected gradual deceleration of global economic activity over the forecast horizon could be more severe than currently expected given the predominance of substantial downside risks a sharper than expected tightening of global financing conditions or a renewed rapid appreciation of the u s dollar could exert further downward pressure on activity in emdes including in those with large current account deficits financed by portfolio and bank flows government and or private sector debt has also risen in a majority of emdes over the last few years including in many lics reducing the fiscal room to respond to shocks and heightening the exposure to shifts in market sentiment and rising borrowing costs escalating trade tensions are another major downside risk to the global outlook if all tariffs currently under consideration were implemented they would affect about 5 percent of global trade flows and could dampen growth in the economies involved leading to negative global spillovers while some countries could benefit from traded diversion in the short run rising trade protectionism would stifle investment and severely disrupt global value chains contributing to higher prices and lower productivity other downside risks such as heightened political uncertainty escalating geopolitical tensions and conflict further cloud the outlook
rating agentur expert ra gmbh confirmed sovereign government credit rating of armenia at bb yerevan january 21 arka rating agentur expert ra gmbh confirmed the sovereign government credit rating sgc of armenia at bb sufficient level of creditworthiness of the government in national currency and at bb sufficient level of creditworthiness of the government in foreign currency the rating agency told arka news agency the rating outlook is stable which means that in the mid term perspective there is a high probability of maintaining the rating score positive factors the rating agency analysts say the country s budget deficit was lower than expected as a result of under spending by the government due to the thorough review of the budget execution by the authorities in 2019 the budget already includes the new fiscal rules aimed at managing public finances without affecting economic output negatively they say also in the mid term perspective we still expect the fiscal policy to be contractionary and to swap current expenditures for capital expenditures to propel growth in 2018 the banking sector remained quite stable after the tense political situation which developed along part of last year the banking system remained solid with good capitalization and liquidity metrics as of september 2018 the capital adequacy ratio stood at 17 9 and the ratio of liquid assets to short term liabilities was 126 5 in addition the ratio of npls to total loans despite having slightly increased since 2017 was also low at 6 9 moreover profitability was favorable as roa stood at 1 5 and roe at 9 5 as of the same date credit to the economy has picked up as of november 2018 loans in armenia had grown by around 20 3 y o y and we project domestic credit to gdp to be in the range between 60 62 at the end of 2018 government debt structure has remained nearly unchanged as of november 2018 shortterm debt accounted for 2 6 of total debt 14 3 had floating interest rate and fxdenominated debt remained elevated at 80 7 nevertheless this type of debt is mostly concessional real gdp growth is expected to have slowed down in 2018 as compared to 2017 albeit remaining robust at about 5 3 the analysts point out that robust private consumption and investment higher copper prices stable remittances and exports contributed positively to growth however public spending was weaker than anticipated moreover toward the end of 2018 we have observed lower remittances inflow which have hurt private consumption figures and also a y o y decline in exports as a result of weaker external demand they say as inflation remains stalled expected at 2 7 by end 2018 mainly due to steep declines in food prices and as private consumptions has shown signs of slowing down towards the end of the year the central bank of armenia cba has left the refinancing rate at 6 continuing with its expansionary monetary policy even though the inflation metric is well off the cba target the stability of the reading has been positive between 2017 and 2018 the dynamic of the cpi index has been the smoothest in recent years in general we continue to observe a high quality of the monetary policy with high credibility and an improved transmission mechanism which has contributed to the fall of lending rates analysts say armenia has a strong investment potential as showed by a projected net fdi inflows to gdp at around 2 in 2018 restricting factors the rating agency s analysts say that after a rapid slide in international reserves in 1h 2018 these started to pick up again in 2h 2018 and reached usd 2 2 bn by year end 2018 thus short term debt remains well covered 13x gdp per capita in ppp terms is expected to have finished 2018 at usd 10 3 th the inflation rate is expected to post a figure of around 2 7 in 2018 very close to the reading from 2017 reflecting stability in the price level the quality of the fiscal policy remains quite favorable as we have seen narrowing budget balances and lower public debt confirming a positive path for the consolidation process the analysts say as already mentioned the new fiscal rules were already implemented in the new budget for 2019 moreover the government plans a new tax policy where the profit and dividend tax rates will be reduced and sales tax rates will be increased to compensate for the cuts institutional development in the country remains bearable as there are good conditions in the country for business as shown by the doing business rating with a moderate rule of law and government transparency nonetheless corruption remains a drag for economic growth the spread between the 10y u s government bond and the usd denominated armenian government bond maturing in 2025 remains acceptable at 3 3p p negative factors government debt is expected to have remained quite stable in 2018 we project this metric to have declined by around 2p p in the last year down to around 51 of gdp the analysts say public debt which includes obligations from the cba is also expected to have declined moreover government debt to budget revenues according to our projection will stand at around 235 of gdp showing a decrease of about 17p p as compared to 2017 these figures support the strategy of the government to consolidate public finances and reduce debt levels of unemployment in armenia are expected to remain fairly high in 2018 at around 18 the underdevelopment of the stock markets is still a negative factor affecting the creditworthiness of armenia market capitalization in the country declined slightly in 2018 down to 2 4 of gdp the country s position in the global competitiveness ranking of the world economic forum improved slightly in 2018 as the country was ranked 70th of 140 countries 73rd in 2017 however business remains dominated by oligopolies and the economy relies heavily on imports stress factors financial dollarization remains high but stable loans and deposits in fx were equivalent to 55 6 and 53 of total loans and deposits respectively as of november 2018 weak stress factor the conflict with azerbaijan for the nagorno karabakh remains unresolved and escalation is still a latent risk very weak stress factor 1 non oil dependent peers include georgia kyrgyzstan and tajikistan sensitivity assessment the rating agency analysts think the following developments could lead to an upgrade materialization of the consolidation efforts of public finances for a substantial period of time narrowing of the fiscal balance and drop of government and public debt levels consistent reduction in the dependence on external factors combined with a steep decrease in levels of financial dollarization as developments that could lead to a downgrade the analysts point out the following opposite behavior in regard to our estimated fiscal expectations i e further widening of the fiscal balance and a sustained increase on government debt in the mid to long term perspective the confirmation of armenia s ratings at bb with a stable outlook reflects a well managed effective and credible monetary policy successful consolidation efforts of public finances as well as robust and stable economic growth hector alvarez rating associate of rating agentur expert ra gmbh responsible expert is quoted in the agency s report moreover the structure of government debt remains quite favorable despite most of the obligations being of external nature also we consider that the political risk has been reduced as the new government won by a high margin in the past december elections despite this government debt is still elevated and the country remains highly exposed to external factors as the economy is still highly dependent on remittances inflows imports and commodities exports moreover despite financial dollarization and government debt having decreased they remain fairly high 0

downward revision since october in part reflects carry over from softer momentum in the second half of 2018 the global growth forecast for 2019 and 2020 had already been revised downward in the last weo partly because of the negative effects of tariff increases enacted in the united states and china earlier that year the further downward revision since october in part reflects carry over from softer momentum in the second half of 2018 including in germany following the introduction of new automobile fuel emission standards and in italy where concerns about sovereign and financial risks have weighed on domestic demand but also weakening financial market sentiment as well as a contraction in turkey now projected to be deeper than anticipated risks to global growth tilt to the downside an escalation of trade tensions beyond those already incorporated in the forecast remains a key source of risk to the outlook financial conditions have already tightened since the fall a range of triggers beyond escalating trade tensions could spark a further deterioration in risk sentiment with adverse growth implications especially given the high levels of public and private debt these potential triggers include a no deal withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union and a greater than envisaged slowdown in china the main shared policy priority is for countries to resolve cooperatively and quickly their trade disagreements and the resulting policy uncertainty rather than raising harmful barriers further and destabilizing an already slowing global economy across all economies measures to boost potential output growth enhance inclusiveness and strengthen fiscal and financial buffers in an environment of high debt burdens and tighter financial conditions are imperatives the imf has revised downwards its forecasts for advanced economies slightly mainly due to downward revisions for the euro area within the euro area the significant revisions are for germany where production difficulties in the auto sector and lower external demand will weigh on growth in 2019 and for italy where sovereign and financial risks and the connections between them are adding headwinds to growth the us expansion continues but the forecast remains for a deceleration with the unwinding of fiscal stimulus across advanced economies the imf foresees growth to slow from 2 3 in 2018 to 2 in 2019 and 1 7 in 2020 this softening growth momentum has provided little lift to inflation while core inflation is close to target in the united states where growth is above trend it remains significantly below target in the euro area and japan economic activity in emerging and developing economies is also projected to tick down to 4 5 in 2019 with a rebound to 4 9 in 2020 the projection for 2019 has been lowered 0 2 percentage point from october mainly because of a large projected contraction in turkey amid policy tightening and adjustment to more restrictive external financing conditions there is also a significant downgrade to growth in mexico in 2019 20 reflecting lower private investment the projected rebound in 2020 is due to an expected recovery in argentina and turkey the outlook for emerging markets and developing economies reflects the continued headwinds from weaker capital flows following higher us policy rates and exchange rate depreciations even though they have become less extreme across emerging economies some of the pickup in inflation reversed towards the end of 2018 overall the cyclical forces that propelled broad based global growth since the second half of 2017 may be weakening somewhat faster than the imf expected in october trade and investment have slowed industrial production outside the united states has decelerated and purchasing managers indices have weakened flagging softening momentum while this does not mean that the imf is staring at a major downturn it is important to take stock of the many rising risks an escalation of trade tensions and a worsening of financial conditions are key sources of risk to the outlook higher trade uncertainty will further dampen investment and disrupt global supply chains a more serious tightening of financial conditions is particularly costly given the high levels of private and public sector debt in countries china s growth slowdown could be faster than expected especially if trade tensions continue and this can trigger abrupt sell offs in financial and commodity markets as was the case in 2015 16 in europe the brexit cliffhanger continues and the costly spillovers between sovereign and financial risk in italy remain a threat in the united states a protracted us federal government shutdown poses downside risks policy priorities given this backdrop policymakers need to act now to reverse headwinds to growth and prepare for the next downturn the main policy priority is for countries to resolve cooperatively and quickly their trade disagreements and the resulting policy uncertainty rather than raising harmful barriers further and destabilizing an already slowing global economy the call of group of twenty leaders to reform the world trade organization in buenos aires must be accomplished where fiscal space is low fiscal policy needs to adjust in a growth friendly manner to ensure public debt is on a sustainable path while protecting the most vulnerable monetary policy in advanced economies should continue to normalize carefully the major central banks are keenly aware of the slowing momentum and imf expect they will calibrate their next steps in line with these developments macroprudential tools should be used where financial vulnerabilities are building up across all economies measures to boost potential output growth and enhance inclusiveness are imperatives lastly given that policy space for countries is more limited than in 2008 multilateral cooperation will be even more important in the event of a sharper decline in global growth and it is essential that multilateral institutions like the imf have adequate resources to deal with the rising risks powered by capital market live news disclaimer no business standard journalist was involved in creation of this content the international monetary fund imf has released the update of the world economic outlook weo projecting global growth at 3 5 in 2019 and 3 6 in 2020 0 2 and 0 1 percentage point below last october s projections
growth in the united states is projected to decelerate to 2 5 in 2019 and 2 in 2020 as the impulse from fiscal stimulus in 2018 wanes steady growth of 2 0 is projected for the european union although risks are tilted to the downside including a potential fallout from brexit growth in china is expected to moderate from 6 6 in 2018 to 6 3 in 2019 with policy support partly offsetting the negative impact of trade tensions several large commodity exporting countries such as brazil nigeria and the russian federation are projected to see a moderate pickup in growth in 2019 2020 albeit from a low base however economic growth is uneven and is often failing to reach where it is most needed per capita incomes will stagnate or grow only marginally in 2019 in several parts of africa western asia and latin america and the caribbean even where per capita growth is strong economic activity is often driven by core industrial and urban regions leaving peripheral and rural areas behind eradicating poverty by 2030 will require both double digit growth in africa and steep reductions in income inequality further clouding the prospects are a confluence of risks with the potential to severely disrupt economic activity and inflict significant damage on longer term development prospects these risks include waning support for multilateral approaches the escalation of trade policy disputes financial instabilities linked to elevated levels of debt and rising climate risks as the world experiences an increasing number of extreme weather events the contemporaneous appearance of several important risks endangers efforts to achieve the 2030 agenda for sustainable development the universally adopted plan containing 17 specific goals to promote prosperity and social well being while protecting the environment alongside various short term risks there is an increasing urgency to deal with much more fundamental problems what we have hitherto viewed as long term challenges such as climate change have become immediate short term risks elliott harris un chief economist and assistant secretary general for economic development said strong global cooperation the report underscores that strengthening global cooperation is central to advancing sustainable development the multilateral approach to global policymaking is facing significant challenges including a trend toward greater unilateral actions pressures have materialized in the areas of international trade international development finance and tackling climate change these threats come at a time when international cooperation and governance are more important than ever many of the challenges laid out in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development are global by nature and require collective and cooperative action waning support for multilateralism also raises questions around the capacity for collaborative policy action in the event of a widespread global shock trade tensions amid the rise in global trade tensions global trade growth moderated over the course of 2018 from growth of 5 3 in 2017 to 3 8 while tensions have materially impacted some specific sectors stimulus measures and direct subsidies have so far offset much of the direct economic impacts on china and the united states but a prolonged escalation of trade tensions could severely disrupt the global economy directly impacted sectors have already witnessed rising input prices and delayed investment decisions these impacts can be expected to spread through global value chains particularly in east asia slower growth in china and the united states could also reduce the demand for commodities affecting commodity exporters from africa and latin america tight financial conditions as global financial conditions tighten an unexpectedly rapid rise in interest rates or a significant strengthening of the us dollar could exacerbate emerging market fragilities leading to a heightened risk of debt distress this risk can be further aggravated by global trade tensions monetary policy adjustment in developed economies commodity price shocks or domestic political or economic disruptions many low income countries have already experienced a substantial rise in interest burdens countries with a substantial amount of dollar denominated debt high current account or fiscal deficits large external financing needs and limited policy buffers are particularly vulnerable to financial stress climate risks a fundamental shift in the way the world powers economic growth is imperative economic decision making must fully integrate the negative climate risks associated with emissions this can be achieved through tools such as carbon pricing measures energy efficiency regulations such as minimum performance standards and building codes and reduction of socially inefficient fossil fuel subsidy regimes governments can also promote policies to stimulate new energy saving technologies such as research and development subsidies in countries that remain highly reliant on fossil fuel production economic diversification is vital
briefing highlights markets at risk amid shutdown brexit what to make of earnings china s growth slows tsx loonie at a glance new york closed today barrick leaves door open to sale of zambian mine from today s globe and mail mad dogs and englishmen noël coward markets haven t just weathered the dysfunction in washington and london they ve risen far above it that threatens to come unhinged though amid the stalemates on both sides of the atlantic add to that concerns over quarterly corporate results and you ve got the makings of even more uncertainty for markets now enjoying a nice bounce in the early going of 2019 and this promises to be a key week on all three fronts here s a look u s shutdown john normand head of cross asset fundamental strategy at jpmorgan chase sees this as a sleeper issue for investors and which so far is hurting president trump s approval rating more than the stock market that he suggested is because the 20 or so shutdowns of the past 50 years have ended quickly with modest fallout such as u s stock declines that averaged 2 to 3 per cent and erosion of the trade weighted american dollar of 1 to 3 per cent we re now on new terrain though this year s shutdown could become more material for the u s economy and markets for two reasons its record length threatens spillover to the broader economy through government contractors for example and this conflict could soon overlap with february march political risks around the mueller report and the debt ceiling debate mr normand said dispiritingly u s domestic politics is replacing international risks like the u s china trade war as a potential volatility generator he added thus there will be a toll that few envisioned when the showdown between the white house and the democrats began we along with almost all others initially brushed off the economic impact of the u s government shutdown having seen this kabuki play many times before said bank of montreal chief economist douglas porter however now stretching into a record four weeks with no off ramp in clear sight the costs are beginning to build he added the early guesstimates that the shutdown could shave perhaps one tenth from q1 gdp maybe two at worst are running into the stark reality that the end is not nigh and crucially the economic data blind spots will widen as releases are heavily delayed so ironically we may not officially know the true economic costs until it is long over remember that economists are questioning when the expansion ends so look further out the lesson of this shutdown is that government has ceased to function well in washington said cibc world markets chief economist avery shenfeld yes someday soon federal workers will be paid again but more meaningfully the default policy outcome from a polarized d c will be a fiscal tightening that adds to the slowing of growth in 2020 brexit if anything there is even greater uncertainty warned bmo senior economist jennifer lee british prime minister theresa may last week lost the vote on her brexit divorce deal with the eu then survived a no confidence bid next she returns today with a plan b which faces a jan 29 vote this comes of course as the march 29 date for brexit draws closer the possibility that plan b is rejected is still very high despite fears of an accidental cliff edge brexit and brexit fatigue ms lee said and if it is there will be another confidence vote there could be another election and there could be another referendum she added but all of that takes time which the government does not have what is becoming more certain is that pm may will be asking brussels for an extension amid all of this last week markets toughed it out the pound actually finished the week slightly higher even rising 1 3 per cent against the euro while the ftse managed to follow the leaders higher albeit in a more modest fashion than most major indexes said bmo s mr porter ms lee s colleague the economic impact of the relentless uncertainty is subtle but u k gdp has lagged the euro zone for the past two years and business frustration all but boiled over following week s impasse how the markets have dealt with this to do date in no way suggests what could happen going forward warned cmc markets chief analyst michael hewson just because we ve hit two month highs week against the u s dollar and the euro doesn t mean we re out of the woods and investors would do well to remember that mr hewson said of the pound prime minister may s plan b isn t likely to look that different to her plan a when she unveils it week and in the absence of anything else the u k is still on course to leave the eu on march 29 nothing that has happened in the last few days has changed that corporate earnings as bmo senior economist robert kavcic put it the bar for fourth quarter results has been lowered the q4 earnings season got under way week and while it s still very early in the proceedings the early results have been mixed mr kavcic said we ve seen a generally solid performance from the banks with some headline beats from the likes of citigroup and bank of america though jpmorgan missed for the first time in about four years he added noting some earnings misses as well so get ready for week two with some biggies including ibm johnson johnson canadian pacific railway ford motor co procter gamble bristol myers squibb intel norfolk southern rogers communications starbucks union pacific and colgate palmolive to name but a few only 10 per cent of the companies on the s p 500 have reported so far of them just shy of 80 per cent have topped the profit estimates of analysts and 56 per cent have bested the revenue estimates these are right in line with historical norms but running a bit less positive than in recent quarters mr kavcic said noting that expectations were easing before the current run of results even started the consensus bottom up earnings growth estimate is currently 14 5 per cent year over year for 2018q4 according to thomson reuters tally down from 16 per cent at the start of the year and 20 per cent in early october he said of the current fourth quarter expectations note also that calendar year 2019 growth expectations have been shaved to 6 5 per cent from above 10 per cent in early october sequentially the trend is clearly toward more subdued earnings growth with these expectations a marked downshift from better than 20 per cent year over year growth in each of the three quarters through 2018q3 as jpmorgan s mr normand sees it we re going to learn a lot as results roll out and determine where our money should be behind or alongside political theatre in the u s and u k is a corporate earnings season that will better inform late 2018 s ubiquitous

trade discussions between the united states and china will be closely scrutinised similarly any progress on brexit will be a major breakthrough especially when prime minister teresa may survived a vote of no confidence on wednesday said mohd afzanizam echoing sundararajah s views he also expected the fbm klci to be confined within a tight range as market sentiment would continue to remain cautious meanwhile on the home front finance minister lim guan eng said goldman sachs apology in regards to the involvement of its former employee tim leissner in the 1malaysia development board 1mdb scandal was not sufficient and that the investment bank should make reparation and pay malaysia a compensation of us 7 5 billion he pointed out that the apology was necessary for malaysia and the investment bank must be accountable as the issue also involved a breach of financial duty where the banking industry had the obligation to make good the losses that the country had suffered leissner has been criminally charged by us and malaysian prosecutors with bribery and money laundering in connection with 1mdb and is scheduled to be sentenced in june in a separate development the government has appointed mizuho bank malaysia bhd hsbc bank malaysia bhd and daiwa capital markets ltd as joint lead arrangers for the 10 year 200 billion yen rm7 6 billion samurai bond lim said the appointments were made after six proposals were shortlisted from the 27 proposals received by the finance ministry during the tabling of 2019 budget in the dewan rakyat last year the finance minister said that the japanese government has offered to guarantee the 200 billion yen bonds which is expected to be issued before march this year commenting on the matter inter pacific research sdn bhd head of research pong teng siew said the news sparks the possibility that the government was ready to spend again through the awarding of new contracts in the future the government was very cautious and preoccupied on trimming its spending lowering the national debt and getting a better value for its spending but this news is likely to instil confidence and positivity among investors as this would mean more liquidity returning back into the equity market and more work in building government infrastructure said pong meanwhile the crash in crude oil prices in 2014 looks set to claim its first publicly

while global growth in 2018 remained close to postcrisis highs the global expansion is weakening and at a rate that is somewhat faster than expected this update of the world economic outlook weo projects global growth at 3 5 percent in 2019 and 3 6 percent in 2020 0 2 and 0 1 percentage point below last october s projections the downward revisions are modest however we believe the risks to more significant downward corrections are rising while financial markets in advanced economies appeared to be decoupled from trade tensions for much of 2018 the two have become intertwined more recently tightening financial conditions and escalating the risks to global growth the global expansion is weakening and at a rate that is somewhat faster than expected we have revised downwards our forecasts for advanced economies slightly mainly due to downward revisions for the euro area within the euro area the significant revisions are for germany where production difficulties in the auto sector and lower external demand will weigh on growth in 2019 and for italy where sovereign and financial risks and the connections between them are adding headwinds to growth the us expansion continues but the forecast remains for a deceleration with the unwinding of fiscal stimulus across advanced economies we foresee growth to slow from 2 3 percent in 2018 to 2 percent in 2019 and 1 7 percent in 2020 this softening growth momentum has provided little lift to inflation while core inflation is close to target in the united states where growth is above trend it remains significantly below target in the euro area and japan economic activity in emerging and developing economies is also projected to tick down to 4 5 percent in 2019 with a rebound to 4 9 percent in 2020 the projection for 2019 has been lowered 0 2 percentage point from october mainly because of a large projected contraction in turkey amid policy tightening and adjustment to more restrictive external financing conditions there is also a significant downgrade to growth in mexico in 2019 20 reflecting lower private investment the projected rebound in 2020 is due to an expected recovery in argentina and turkey the outlook for emerging markets and developing economies reflects the continued headwinds from weaker capital flows following higher us policy rates and exchange rate depreciations even though they have become less extreme across emerging economies some of the pickup in inflation reversed towards the end of 2018 overall the cyclical forces that propelled broad based global growth since the second half of 2017 may be weakening somewhat faster than we expected in october trade and investment have slowed industrial production outside the united states has decelerated and purchasing managers indices have weakened flagging softening momentum while this does not mean we are staring at a major downturn it is important to take stock of the many rising risks an escalation of trade tensions and a worsening of financial conditions are key sources of risk to the outlook higher trade uncertainty will further dampen investment and disrupt global supply chains a more serious tightening of financial conditions is particularly costly given the high levels of private and public sector debt in countries china s growth slowdown could be faster than expected especially if trade tensions continue and this can trigger abrupt sell offs in financial and commodity markets as was the case in 2015 16 in europe the brexit cliffhanger continues and the costly spillovers between sovereign and financial risk in italy remain a threat in the united states a protracted us federal government shutdown poses downside risks policy priorities given this backdrop policymakers need to act now to reverse headwinds to growth and prepare for the next downturn the main policy priority is for countries to resolve cooperatively and quickly their trade disagreements and the resulting policy uncertainty rather than raising harmful barriers further and destabilizing an already slowing global economy the call of group of twenty leaders to reform the world trade organization in buenos aires must be accomplished where fiscal space is low fiscal policy needs to adjust in a growth friendly manner to ensure public debt is on a sustainable path while protecting the most vulnerable monetary policy in advanced economies should continue to normalize carefully the major central banks are keenly aware of the slowing momentum and we expect they will calibrate their next steps in line with these developments macroprudential tools should be used where financial vulnerabilities are building up across all economies measures to boost potential output growth and enhance inclusiveness are imperatives lastly given that policy space for countries is more limited than in 2008 multilateral cooperation will be even more important in the event of a sharper decline in global growth and it is essential that multilateral institutions like the imf have adequate resources to deal with the rising risks

the extent to which what we re witnessing is a mild economic slowdown or as some are arguing the start of a full blown recession still is unclear luc vallée chief strategist economic research and strategy group with laurentian bank securities inc lbs in montreal states in a recent note lbs isn t forecasting a recession but sébastien lavoie the firm s chief economist says lbs is very much aware of the many risks escalation of the u s china trade war a major downturn in equities a lengthy shutdown of the u s government closing of the u s mexico border pressure from u s president donald trump on u s federal reserve board chairman jerome powell increased turmoil in the middle east further buildup of north korea s nuclear arsenal failure of the u s congress to ratify the u s mexico canada agreement and a difficult brexit process however lavoie adds the economies of the u s and thus canada can continue to grow unless several risks materialize simultaneously the other eight canadian economists surveyed by investment executive ie agree their average growth forecast for real gross domestic product gdp growth for 2019 is 2 4 in the u s and 1 8 in canada the pace is expected to slow in 2020 to 1 8 in the u s and 1 7 in canada but that slowdown isn t a recession and isn t alarming both economies are operating at full capacity with relatively low unemployment and interest rates still at stimulative levels in this environment increases in interest rates are needed to make sure the economies don t overheat nevertheless central banks are becoming more cautious the tone of the fed has changed implying less need to move rates higher says paul ferley assistant chief economist with royal bank of canada in toronto he attributes this to the fed s perception of more headwinds in the form of trade protectionism policy uncertainty now that the democrats control congress and financial market volatility thus ferley anticipates the fed s overnight rate will rise to only 3 from the current 2 5 previously he had expected the rate to reach 4 for many of the economists escalation of the u s china trade war is the biggest risk if trump goes ahead with additional tariffs on imports from china a global recession would become more likely china s economy already is showing signs of weakening due to the impact of high u s tariffs despite china responding quickly with stimulative measures but more tariffs would be very challenging not just for china but also for emerging countries that rely on trade with that nation and for resources exporters such as canada as oil and metal prices would be affected most economists currently assume that oil prices will recover to more than us 60 a barrel for west texas intermediate oil from the low of us 46 at which they ended 2018 only one economist in ie s survey craig alexander chief economist at deloitte canada in toronto foresees the trade war escalating adding the odds are greater than 50 that there will be more u s protectionism this year and potentially more in 2020 as the u s presidential election nears alexander has the lowest real gdp growth forecasts for 2020 at 1 3 for canada and at 1 1 5 for the u s but he says that isn t because of the trade war which won t directly affect the u s economy significantly because exports are less than 10 of gdp however he does anticipate china s growth will slow to not much more than 5 by 2020 vs the 6 or so the other economists predict what will pull down u s economic growth alexander says is government restraint in part that s inevitable as the stimulus from the 2018 tax cuts fades but he anticipates additional restraint given the huge u s public debt and federal deficits avery shenfeld managing director and chief economist at cibc world markets inc in toronto also anticipates fiscal drag in the u s and forecasts only 1 5 growth for that economy in 2020 noting that some program spending is scheduled to end next year with congress in the hands of the democrats he s assuming inaction which will result in modest tightening fiscal drag isn t one of the risks currently worrying financial markets but it s an important one to keep in mind another risk currently under the markets radar is high u s corporate debt lavoie points out that the debt of u s non financial corporations now is more than us 15 trillion and that the quality of this debt has deteriorated with more than half of the investment grade debt rated only bbb the risk is that high premiums may be demanded on the large refinancings needed in the next few years for s p 500 composite index listed companies about us 300 billion in 2019 and more than us 350 billion in each of the next three years there s also the possibility of a mistake by central banks ferley understands why the fed is cautious but he s a little worried that if rates aren t high enough inflation could take off wages are beginning to rise in the u s and could quickly feed through to higher prices on consumer goods and services he s forecasting 2 4 inflation in the u s in 2020 overhanging these expectations are the markets themselves if investors continue to fear recession and sell producing a plunge in valuations consumer and business confidence could erode says alexander
some years ago i faced up to the futility of reporting true things about america s disastrous wars and so i left afghanistan for another remote mountainous country far away it was the polar opposite of afghanistan a peaceful prosperous land where nearly everybody seemed to enjoy a good life on the job and in the family this story first appeared at tomdispatch it s true that they didn t work much not by american standards anyway in the u s full time salaried workers supposedly laboring 40 hours a week actually average 49 with almost 20 clocking more than 60 these people on the other hand worked only about 37 hours a week when they weren t away on long paid vacations at the end of the work day about four in the afternoon perhaps three in the summer they had time to enjoy a hike in the forest or a swim with the kids or a beer with friends which helps explain why unlike so many americans they are pleased with their jobs often i was invited to go along i found it refreshing to hike and ski in a country with no land mines and to hang out in cafés unlikely to be bombed gradually i lost my warzone jitters and settled into the slow calm pleasantly uneventful stream of life there four years on thinking i should settle down i returned to the united states it felt quite a lot like stepping back into that other violent impoverished world where anxiety runs high and people are quarrelsome i had in fact come back to the flip side of afghanistan and iraq to what america s wars have done to america where i live now in the homeland there are not enough shelters for the homeless most people are either overworked or hurting for jobs housing is overpriced hospitals crowded and understaffed schools largely segregated and not so good opioid or heroin overdose is a popular form of death and men in the street threaten women wearing hijab did the american soldiers i covered in afghanistan know they were fighting for this ducking the subject one night i tuned in to the democrats presidential debate to see if they had any plans to restore the america i used to know to my amazement i heard the name of my peaceful mountain hideaway norway bernie sanders was denouncing america s crooked version of casino capitalism that floats the already rich ever higher and flushes the working class he said that we ought to look to countries like denmark like sweden and norway and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people he believes he added in a society where all people do well not just a handful of billionaires that certainly sounds like norway for ages they ve worked at producing things for the use of everyone not the profit of a few so i was all ears waiting for sanders to spell it out for americans but hillary clinton quickly countered we are not denmark smiling she said i love denmark and then delivered a patriotic punch line we are the united states of america well there s no denying that she praised capitalism and all the small businesses that were started because we have the opportunity and the freedom in our country for people to do that and to make a good living for themselves and their families she didn t seem to know that danes swedes and norwegians do that too and with much higher rates of success the truth is that almost a quarter of american startups are not founded on brilliant new ideas but on the desperation of men or women who can t get a decent job the majority of all american enterprises are solo ventures having zero payrolls employing no one but the entrepreneur and often quickly wasting away sanders said that he was all for small business too but that meant nothing if all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent as george carlin said the reason they call it the american dream is because you have to be asleep to believe it in that debate no more was heard of denmark sweden or norway the audience was left in the dark later in a speech at georgetown university sanders tried to clarify his identity as a democratic socialist he said he s not the kind of socialist with a capital s who favors state ownership of anything like the means of production the norwegian government on the other hand owns the means of producing lots of public assets and is the major stockholder in many a vital private enterprise i was dumbfounded norway denmark and sweden practice variations of a system that works much better than ours yet even the democratic presidential candidates who say they love or want to learn from those countries don t seem to know how they actually work why we re not denmark proof that they do work is delivered every year in data rich evaluations by the u n and other international bodies the organization for economic cooperation and development s annual report on international well being for example measures 11 factors ranging from material conditions like affordable housing and employment to quality of life matters like education health life expectancy voter participation and overall citizen satisfaction year after year all the nordic countries cluster at the top while the united states lags far behind in addition norway ranked first on the u n development program s human development index for 12 of the last 15 years and it consistently tops international comparisons of such matters as democracy civil and political rights and freedom of expression and the press what is it though that makes the scandinavians so different since the democrats can t tell you and the republicans wouldn t want you to know let me offer you a quick introduction what scandinavians call the nordic model is a smart and simple system that starts with a deep commitment to equality and democracy that s two concepts combined in a single goal because as far as they are concerned you can t have one without the other right there they part company with capitalist america now the most unequal of all the developed nations and consequently a democracy no more political scientists say it has become an oligarchy a country run at the expense of its citizenry by and for the super rich perhaps you noticed that in the last century scandinavians aiming for their egalitarian goal refused to settle solely for any of the ideologies competing for power not capitalism or fascism not marxist socialism or communism geographically stuck between powerful nations waging hot and cold wars for such doctrines scandinavians set out to find a path in between that path was contested by socialist inspired workers on the one hand and capitalist owners and their elite cronies on the other but it led in the end to a mixed economy thanks largely to the solidarity and savvy of organized labor and the political parties it backed the long struggle produced a system that makes capitalism more or less cooperative and then redistributes equitably the wealth it helps to produce struggles like this took place around the world in the twentieth century but the scandinavians alone managed to combine the best ideas of both camps while chucking out the worst in 1936 the popular u s journalist marquis childs first described the result to americans in the book sweden the middle way since then all the scandinavian countries and their nordic neighbors finland and iceland have been improving upon that hybrid system today in norway negotiations between the confederation of trade unions and the confederation of norwegian enterprise determine the wages and working conditions of most capitalist enterprises public and private that create wealth while high but fair progressive income taxes fund the state s universal welfare system benefitting everyone in addition those confederations work together to minimize the disparity between high wage and lower wage jobs as a result norway ranks with sweden denmark and finland among the most income equal countries in the world and its standard of living tops the charts so here s the big difference in norway capitalism serves the people the government elected by the people sees to that all eight of the parties that won parliamentary seats in the last national election including the conservative høyre party now leading the government are committed to maintaining the welfare state in the u s however neoliberal politics put the foxes in charge of the henhouse and capitalists have used the wealth generated by their enterprises as well as financial and political manipulations to capture the state and pluck the chickens they ve done a masterful job of chewing up organized labor today only 11 of american workers belong to a union in norway that number is 52 in denmark 67 in sweden 70 in the u s oligarchs maximize their wealth and keep it using the democratically elected government to shape policies and laws favorable to the interests of their foxy class they bamboozle the people by insisting as hillary clinton did at that debate that all of us have the freedom to create a business in the free marketplace which implies that being hard up is our own fault in the nordic countries on the other hand democratically elected governments give their populations freedom from the market by using capitalism as a tool to benefit everyone that liberates their people from the tyranny of the mighty profit motive that warps so many american lives leaving them freer to follow their own dreams to become poets or philosophers bartenders or business owners as they please family matters maybe our politicians don t want to talk about the nordic model because it shows so clearly that capitalism can be put to work for the many not just the few consider the norwegian welfare state it s universal in other words aid to the sick or the elderly is not charity grudgingly donated by elites to those in need it is the right of every individual citizen that includes every woman whether or not she is somebody s wife and every child no matter its parentage treating every person as a citizen affirms the individuality of each and the equality of all it frees every person from being legally possessed by another a husband for example or a tyrannical father which brings us to the heart of scandinavian democracy the equality of women and men in the 1970s norwegian feminists marched into politics and picked up the pace of democratic change norway needed a larger labor force and women were the answer housewives moved into paid work on an equal footing with men nearly doubling the tax base that has in fact meant more to norwegian prosperity than the coincidental discovery of north atlantic oil reserves the ministry of finance recently calculated that those additional working mothers add to norway s net national wealth a value equivalent to the country s total petroleum wealth currently held in the world s largest sovereign wealth fund worth more than 873 billion by 1981 women were sitting in parliament in the prime minister s chair and in her cabinet american feminists also marched for such goals in the 1970s but the big boys busy with their own white house intrigues initiated a war on women that set the country back and still rages today in brutal attacks on women s basic civil rights health care and reproductive freedom in 1971 thanks to the hard work of organized feminists congress passed the bipartisancomprehensive child development bill to establish a multi billion dollar national day care system for the children of working parents in 1972 president richard nixon vetoed it and that was that in 1972 congress also passed a bill first proposed in 1923 to amend the constitution to grant equal rights of citizenship to women ratified by only 35 states three short of the required 38 that equal rights amendment or era was declared dead in 1982 leaving american women in legal limbo in 1996 president bill clinton signed the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act obliterating six decades of federal social welfare policy as we know it ending federal cash payments to the nation s poor and consigning millions of female heads of household and their children to poverty where many still dwell 20 years later today nearly half a century after nixon trashed national child care even privileged women torn between their underpaid work and their kids are overwhelmed things happened very differently in norway there feminists and sociologists pushed hard against the biggest obstacle still standing in the path to full democracy the nuclear family in the 1950s the world famous american sociologist talcott parsons had pronounced that arrangement with hubby at work and the little wife at home the ideal setup in which to socialize children but in the 1970s the norwegian state began to deconstruct that undemocratic ideal by taking upon itself the traditional unpaid household duties of women caring for the children the elderly the sick and the disabled became the basic responsibilities of the universal welfare state freeing women in the workforce to enjoy both their jobs and their families that s another thing american politicians still boringly mostly odiously boastful men surely don t want you to think about that patriarchy can be demolished and everyone be the better for it paradoxically setting women free made family life more genuine many in norway say it has made both men and women more themselves and more alike more understanding and happier it also helped kids slip from the shadow of helicopter parents in norway mother and father in turn take paid parental leave from work to see a newborn through its first year or more at age one however children start attending a neighborhood barnehage kindergarten for schooling spent largely outdoors by the time kids enter free primary school at age six they are remarkably self sufficient confident and good natured they know their way around town and if caught in a snowstorm in the forest how to build a fire and find the makings of a meal one kindergarten teacher explained we teach them early to use an axe so they understand it s a tool not a weapon to americans the notion of a school taking away your child to make her an axe wielder is monstrous in fact norwegian kids who are well acquainted in early childhood with many different adults and children know how to get along with grown ups and look after one another more to the point though it s hard to measure it s likely that scandinavian children spend more quality time with their work isn t everything parents than does a typical middle class american child being driven by a stressed out mother from music lessons to karate practice for all these reasons and more the international organization save the children cites norway as the best country on earth in which to raise kids while the u s finishes far down the list in 33rd place don t take my word for it this little summary just scratches the surface of scandinavia so i urge curious readers to google away but be forewarned you ll find much criticism of all the nordic model countries the structural matters i ve described of governance and family are not the sort of things visible to tourists or visiting journalists so their comments are often obtuse take the american tourist blogger who complained that he hadn t been shown the slums of oslo there are none or the british journalist who wrote that norwegian petrol is too expensive though not for norwegians who are in any case leading the world in switching to electric cars neoliberal pundits especially the brits are always beating up on the scandinavians in books magazines newspapers and blogs predicting the imminent demise of their social democracies and bullying them to forsake the best political economy on the planet self styled experts still in thrall to margaret thatcher tell norwegians they must liberalize their economy and privatize everything short of the royal palace mostly the norwegian government does the opposite or nothing at all and social democracy keeps on ticking it s not perfect of course it has always been a carefully considered work in progress governance by consensus takes time and effort you might think of it as slow democracy but it s light years ahead of us

by kevin yao and yawen chen beijing reuters china s economy cooled in the fourth quarter under pressure from faltering domestic demand and bruising u s tariffs dragging 2018 growth to the lowest in nearly three decades and pressuring beijing to roll out more stimulus to avert a sharper slowdown growing signs of weakness in china which has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years are fueling anxiety about risks to the world economy and are weighing on profits for firms ranging from apple nasdaq to big carmakers policymakers have pledged more support this year to reduce the risk of massive job losses but have ruled out a flood of stimulus like that which beijing has relied on in the past which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt the government has means to support the economy they can expand infrastructure spending and they can cut banks reserve requirement ratio so we don t need to worry about capital spending said naoto saito chief researcher at daiwa institute of research in tokyo but the problem lies in consumption as the u s and china clash on many fronts consumer sentiment appears to have been hurt until now solid wage growth has been supporting consumption but now there appears to be a sense of vague anxiety about the future fourth quarter gross domestic product gdp grew at the slowest pace since the global financial crisis easing to 6 4 percent on year as expected from 6 5 percent in the third quarter the national bureau of statistics said on monday that pulled full year growth down to 6 6 percent the slowest annual pace since 1990 gdp in 2017 grew a revised 6 8 percent with support measures expected to take some time to kick in most analysts believe conditions are likely to get worse before they get better and see a further slowing to 6 3 percent this year some china watchers believe actual growth is already weaker than official data suggest uncertainties aplenty despite a raft of policy easing steps so far december data released along with gdp showed continued weakness across broad areas of the economy at the end of last year factory output picked up unexpectedly to 5 7 percent from 5 4 percent but it was one of the few bright spots along with a stronger services sector while regulators have been fast tracking construction projects most of the gain appeared due to higher mining and oil production reuters calculations showed average daily steel output hit its lowest level since march as producers cut output amid shrinking profit margins despite the slowing economy chinese officials also pledged to continue with a crackdown on air pollution that has weighed on the industrial sector other data on monday showed investment and retail sales continued to languish while the jobless rate edged higher fixed asset investment rose 5 9 percent in 2018 the slowest in at least 22 years as a regulatory crackdown on riskier financing and debt weighed on local government spending early in the year property investment is also looking wobbly with analysts waiting to see if beijing will risk loosening restrictions on home buyers that have kept a potential housing bubble in check chinese consumers are clearly feeling the pressure though retail sales growth picked up marginally in december to 8 2 percent the consumer strength gauge is around the weakest in 15 years auto sales in the world s biggest car market shrank for the first time since the 1990s officials recently pledged to boost consumer demand for big ticket items from cars to appliances but gains in disposable income are slowing while household debt is on the rise other data in recent weeks showed exports and imports unexpectedly shrank last month while falling factory orders point to a further drop in activity in coming months and more job shedding some factories in guangdong china s export hub have shut earlier than usual ahead of the long lunar new year holiday as new business dries up trade pressures even if china and the united states agree on a trade deal in current talks which would be a tall order analysts said it would be no panacea for china or its exporters demand is weakening globally not just in the united states net exports actually dragged on china s growth by 8 6 percent last year reuters calculations based on official data showed trade negotiators are facing an early march deadline and washington has threatened to sharply hike tariffs if there are no substantial signs of agreement white house officials have given markedly different views on progress so far china s vice premier and lead negotiator liu he is due to visit washington for the next round of talks at the end of the month more stimulus to free up more funds for lending particularly to vulnerable smaller firms the central bank has cut the amount of reserves that banks need to set aside as reserves rrr five times over the past year and guided borrowing costs lower further rrr reductions are expected in coming quarters but most analysts do not see a cut in benchmark interest rates yet as policymakers wait to see if earlier steps begin to stabilize activity more forceful easing could also pressure the yuan and aggravate high debt levels with money going into less efficient or speculative investments as it often has in the past the government may unveil more fiscal stimulus during the annual parliament meeting in march including bigger tax cuts and more spending on infrastructure projects some analysts believe it could deliver 2 trillion yuan 295 13 billion worth of cuts in taxes and fees this year and allow local governments to issue another 2 trillion yuan in special bonds largely used to fund key projects china has ample room for policy adjustments statistics bureau chief ning jizhe said on monday still some analysts do not expect the economy to bottom out convincingly until summer

capital the anticipated decrease in silver and gold production is due to a later startup of cose production related to a change in the mining method the modification takes into account the current

by pranab bardhan this is the 40th anniversary of the onset of economic reform and opening up gaige kaifang in china under the leadership of deng xiaoping which eventually led to a dramatic transformation of its economy and global status it is however remarkable that china s current supreme leader xi jinping marked the anniversary in a speech in the great hall of people in beijing mainly emphasizing the party s pervasive control it is also remarkable that in recent years this leadership seems to have forsaken deng s earlier advice of tao guang yang hui keep a low profile in the flush of chinese nationalist glory xi explicitly stated in the 19th party congress that china has now entered a new era when its model offers a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence many people both in rich and poor countries seem to be already awe struck by this model what are the special characteristics of the chinese development model briefly it s a model of essentially capitalist development under authoritarian leadership and purposive governance with a vertical production structure where basic capital goods are produced in monopoly state owned enterprises and the much larger rest of the economy is under private ownership with a state guided nationalist industrial policy and finance with subsidized access to land and credit for state favored business and repression of labor rights massive investments in infrastructure funded by a very high national savings rate particularly on account of large undistributed profits of companies with rural industrialization in a decentralized framework of jurisdictional competition and openness to foreign trade and acquisition and learning of foreign technology it has produced a rapid pace of economic growth over the last three decades and lifted hundreds of millions of people above the poverty line undoubtedly a spectacular historic feat for any developing country the recent slowing of the growth rate does not tarnish the long term shining performance so far i have discussed some of these features of chinese development particularly in a comparative assessment with indian development in my book awakening giants feet of clay princeton 2013 incidentally i should mention here that when a chinese translation of this book came out in beijing the translator thought it fit or prudential to take out without my permission some of the passages in the book that criticized chinese policy while those critical of indian policy remained i believe the chinese governance system is a crucial part of the china development model and in this article i shall concentrate on its special features both positive and negative which tend to be overlooked in the simplistic discussion on authoritarianism vs democracy that tends to dominate the usual observations on the system authoritarianism is neither necessary nor sufficient for some of those special features in many ways these features undergirding the chinese polity and economy are quite distinctive and their roots go long back in history i shall focus here on the aspects of governance that affect economic development and less on their clearly repressive police state aspects and gross abuse of basic human rights political meritocracy it is often pointed out that unlike in most authoritarian countries china has a political meritocracy china s dramatic success has now convinced even some western scholars see for example a recent book by daniel bell the china model political meritocracy and the limits of democracy not to speak of the members of the chinese elite that in terms of performance chinese political meritocracy can achieve as well as or even better than a multi party democracy not merely are officials in china selected on the basis of an examination system that goes way back in imperial history their career promotion depends on how well the local economy performs this works better than in for example democratic india s top administrative system where promotion is based more on seniority than on performance even though recruitment is on the basis of civil service examinations however an immediate question arises in the political system who defines what is meritorious and what is not it is possible that what may look like meritorious performance to the chinese party elite and zhongzubu its central organization department may not be considered so by many others in the general population particularly in a large country with inevitable diversities and conflicts of objectives not to speak of the outlying regions where performance by centrally appointed provincial leaders considered meritorious by the party may not be judged so by ethnic groups like tibetans or uighurs in general how do we know what people consider as meritorious without institutions of downward accountability one of the distinctive features of democracy is that the criteria of meritorious performance arise out of open public discussion thus how much of a political leadership s performance is meritorious may include considerations of pluralism and inclusiveness in the decision process itself to the extent it is not captured by elite interests in an unequal society democratic performance emphasizes the process as much as outcome in this process citizens in a democracy are not treated as children what is good for them is not decided by a patrimonial leadership as is the case much too often in china or singapore this is valid even when the latter leadership is wise and benevolent also in a democracy the performance criteria are much more multi faceted reflecting the pluralist agenda it is uncommon to reward an official mainly on the basis of the growth rate of the local economy and thus the incentives get diluted and are less effective the same thing is happening in china now when other criteria like environmental goals enter performance evaluation performance vs loyalty the general understanding is that career concerns of top officials act as a key determinant of economic growth at the local level particularly the county and prefecture levels and job rotation of officials at that level provides useful on the job training at diverse localities of course such performance incentives also generate plenty of side income opportunities for example from sales of local government land or mining rights which while helping local revenue also illicitly lines the pockets of officials what about the large numbers of the rank and file of public employees who mostly remain in one place and for whom career incentives through promotion are not that relevant the evidence suggests that they help themselves to all kinds of supplemental compensations perks and benefits making up for low salaries in other authoritarian countries such systems of supplemental compensation sometimes degenerate into local loot and plunder the proverbial extreme case is that of zaire under mobutu where soldiers and bureaucrats were not paid but left to fend for themselves this tradition largely continues in the democratic republic of congo even today it is likely that in china this system for the low level officials was constrained from being excessive by the career concerns of their bosses the top local leaders however and this in not widely known as one climbs up the political ladder to the provincial levels and beyond the performance factor seems to diminish in importance in career prospects and the factor of political connections assumes significance this is suggested in an analysis by pierre landry xiaobo lu and haiyan duan 2017 of a comprehensive dataset of political appointments at the provincial prefectural and county levels this is also supported by an analysis of the biographical database of all provincial leaders from 1978 until 2012 and their promotion patterns by fubing su mengyue he and ran tao 2016 there are also quid pro quo transactions in those promotions using data for over a million land transactions during 2004 16 ting chen and james kung have recently shown that provincial party secretaries in selling local government land gave firms linked with politburo members nearly 60 price discounts compared to others and in return such discount givers were estimated to be 23 more likely to be promoted to positions of national leadership in general the larger the discount the higher was the chance of promotion the recent crackdowns have somewhat reduced the chances for such promotions in any case such a general structure of promotion has at least one implication compared to other countries since performance incentives operate at least at the lower levels higher level leaders even when they are selected on the basis of their loyalty to the current leadership at the top are likely to have some measure of field tested competence and experience this balance of performance and loyalty over an official s career path leads to a major advantage that china enjoys in the minimum quality of its bureaucracy compared to many other countries including say us or india not to speak of many authoritarian countries where loyalty rules over minimum competence of course this also means that competent officials who are not sufficiently well connected to the top current leadership in china may reach a glass ceiling some of them may then turn to alternative ways of earning rewards including some corrupt ways these corrupt ways have now been substantially curbed in the recent anti corruption campaigns there is even some evidence that high performers connected to previous top leaderships were particularly likely to be investigated although the campaigns went much beyond merely penalizing rival power groups in india meritocratically recruited bureaucrats can be manipulatively transferred from one job to another the threat of transfer to undesirable jobs or locations often ensures loyalty to their political masters the lure of post retirement plum jobs for ex bureaucrats assigned by political leaders also work to keep the former pliant there are many stories about vertical corrupt transactions in buying and selling of positions in the chinese bureaucracy some of which have been revealed in the recent anti corruption campaigns just as there are stories about corrupt deals between indian politicians and bureaucrats in the process of transfers and postings in uk such manipulative transfers are less common the system in usa on the other hand is characterized by high turnover of senior civil servants long before firing by twitter under the current president the political bureaucratic distinction particularly at higher levels is of course blurred in china as the party is supreme but even in western democracies the political control over senior appointments and promotions in public service has increased over time even in the uk the insulation of career civil service has declined somewhat and this insulation has always been much weaker in usa than in uk or denmark or new zealand the issue of such insulation or autonomy pertains not just to the civil service but also to the various regulatory bodies that any complex economy requires like the entities that regulate public utilities e g electricity telecommunication and apex bodies regulating monetary or environmental policy or financial markets decisions in such regulatory bodies need special expertise and some insulation from the day to day political pressures and some independence from political interference such independence is of course lacking in the chinese system even in democracies the balance between autonomous experts and the need for periodic public review of their decisions to ensure accountability has been difficult to achieve and populist movements are now questioning the role of experts this is apart from the issue of regulatory capture where the regulatory body itself is captured by the special interests of those who are to be regulated in india genuinely independent regulatory bodies are more an exception than the rule organizational capacity to foster technological innovations china of course has been very successful in the catching up process of development of learning and imitating off the shelf technology as chinese students recently arrived in the us from china always tell me in some day to day application and enhancement of existing technology mobile payment e commerce transport etc china is now more advanced than the us but in any future advances beyond the existing technological frontier china has a major advantage and a major disadvantage the advantage follows from the large size of the population and of the domestic market innovations that thrive on economies of scale network effects and big data feedback loops will find hospitable ground in china the disadvantage for china follows from the lack of an open system that could encourage free spirit critical thinking and diversity rather than conformity which are necessary ingredients of many types of creative innovations the current system of state promotion and guidance of globally successful large private technological enterprises is worth examining from this point of view will the chinese state allow the full forces of creative destruction that the austrian economist schumpeter used to associate with innovations are today s successful incumbent firms private or public too big to fail what will be the role of venture capital funds there are inherent problems of state run or controlled venture capital funds it also depends on the nature of future innovations some innovations are of the disruptive kind that challenge incumbent firms which the us private innovators in collaboration with venture capitalists are good at and a politically connected large entrenched organization usually is not other innovations are of the steady incremental kind that adds up to significant gains the japanese call it kaizen in which some large organizations in germany japan and south korea have excelled it is likely that the chinese system is more conducive to this incremental kind of innovations upward vs downward accountability apart from some degree of two way accountability between the politburo and the provincial officials it is probably correct to say that the chinese system is mainly one of upward accountability downward accountability provides more political legitimacy to democratic governments but such accountability can sometimes degenerate into pandering to short run interests and pressure groups particularly at election time short run cyclical official behavior before the party congress is not unknown in china but in general it is much easier for leaders to take long run prudent decisions under the chinese governance system but a severe flaw of the upwardly accountable chinese system is that mistakes in such top level decisions or outright abuse of power take longer to detect and to correct as the flow of information upward is tortuous or choked and the tendency to cover up is often too strong the recent abolition of term limits for the president and the decline of the collective leadership that deng had put in place will make this problem more acute in multi party democracies the open adversarial relation between the government and opposition parties and the media to the extent it is not hampered by commercial interests usually uncovers the mistakes and abuses much sooner and corrections are prompted by public protests agitations and ultimately electoral sanctions business politician nexus in governance over the last quarter century there has been a tight often collusive relationship between business and politicians in china this is evident not just from frequent interchanging of positions between executives in public sector companies and the party s central committee but some of china s richest private businessmen are members of the national people s congress china s parliament and the people s political consultative conference an important advisory body it has been estimated that the average net worth of the richest 70 members of the national people s congress in china is several times that for the richest 70 members of the us congress or the indian parliament there are accounts of large donations made before such businessmen are selected for these bodies this is apart from the top political families princelings and their relatives who have long been in lucrative business there are many accounts of resultant influence peddling policy manipulation politically connected firms getting favors in loans from public banks and access to prime real estate monopoly mining rights etc even to take an example from a different area like public health drug prices are usually much higher in china than say in india even though the single payer system in chinese health care should have given the government more bargaining advantage vis a vis the drug companies people attribute this to the more entrenched kickback system between drug companies and doctors hospitals and officials in china it is likely that the business politician collusion in governance while rampant is somewhat more subject to public scrutiny in india than china and the courts are more independent in india though clogged and corrupt particularly at the lower levels it should however be mentioned that the relation with the all powerful party is somewhat precarious for the chinese business tycoons as any perceived political disloyalty is punished more harshly than in india indian politicians may be a bit more dependent on businessmen in view of the need for large election funding much of the process being quite non transparent now abrasively so under the anonymous election bond system decentralization and structures of local accountability chinese political centralization in the imperial authority in the past and in that of the party in recent decades has been historically tempered by a unique blending of political centralization with economic and administrative decentralization another distinctive feature of the chinese governance system the chinese system has been described by the economist chenggang xu as regionally decentralized authoritarianism in contrast with most authoritarian systems that are highly centralized india in some sense is the obverse combining political decentralization regional power groupings have been quite strong in recent decades with economic centralization the vertical fiscal imbalance in the sense of concentration of fiscal power in the central government for example is quite severe in general the fiscal system is much more decentralized in china where sub provincial levels of government tend to spend about 60 of total government budgetary expenditure compared to less than 10 per cent in india this is not including the large off budget revenue raising and expenditure of local governments in china the much worse performance of sub provincial local bodies in india is partly attributable to this even though chinese local governments have much larger responsibility for infrastructure building and public services jurisdictional competition for mobile resources and business and regional competition in growth rates influencing career promotion of officials have played a very important role in chinese local development to an extent unthinkable in india but in recent years the pace of experimentation and trial and error pilot projects in local areas which characterized the early reform period has slowed down in china the current regime s more centralized and loyalty based leadership has made experimentation even more difficult this is on top of the policy paralysis of a bureaucracy made nervous by the massive anti corruption campaigns a growing literature in decentralization all over the world has pointed to the problem of capture of local governments by the elite including officials and intermediaries and the frequent diversion of benefits and resources to non target groups in india there is plenty of evidence of local landed interests undermining decentralized welfare programs for the poor apart from the provincial political administration and legislators hampering devolution of power to the elected village municipal governments china s more egalitarian land use rights distribution after de collectivization may have prevented the rise of a landed oligarchy that has often captured local governments in parts of rural india however in recent decades chinese decentralization has not been able to avoid the problem of serious local elite capture chinese local business in collusion with local officials has been at the root of problems of arbitrary land acquisition toxic pollution and violation of safety standards in food and in work for factories and mines such collusion is much more rampant in china than say in india primarily because china has fewer checks from below on abuse of power on safety standards for example chinese coalmine death rates are reported to be many times higher than that in india in general there is now evidence that politically connected firms in china have higher workplace fatalities there are also fewer checks on debt fueled over investment and excess capacity in state controlled or politically connected firms currently a source of major macro economic problems in china china s central leadership is now trying to rein in the debt problem of local governments and their dependence on the shadow banking system systemic stability one concern about the chinese governance system is about the mechanism through which a system that can go off equilibrium on account of various kinds of political or economic shocks is restored to equilibrium in the face of a crisis the chinese state often tends to over react suppress information and act heavy handedly thereby sometimes magnifying the dimensions of the crisis this also generates low tolerance for short run economic volatility and the rush to reckless fiscal policies that exacerbate the staggering problems of capital misallocation that china faces the institutional mechanisms for structural reform have arguably become weaker as the resolution of internal governance conflicts is now more dependent on personalized channels there also remains the larger institutional issue that china has historically faced how to institutionally guarantee the rule of a good emperor as opposed to a bad emperor or that of a good emperor not turning bad the recent disruption in the conventions of collective leadership and the acceleration of the cult of personality in leadership can only worsen this problem as the economy becomes more complex and social relations become more convoluted and intense the absence of transparent and accountable processes and the attempts by a control freak leadership to force lockstep conformity and discipline will generate acute tension conflicts and informational inefficiency democracies based on pluralist foundations and institutionalized checks and balances are usually more resilient although in recent days the strains in that system are also becoming much too serious

beijing reuters china is expected to report on monday that economic growth cooled to its slowest in 28 years in 2018 amid weakening domestic demand and bruising us tariffs adding pressure on beijing to roll out more support measures to avert a sharper slowdown growing signs of weakness in china which has generated nearly a third of global growth in the past decade are stoking worries about risks to the world economy and are weighing on profits for firms ranging from apple to big carmakers chinese policymakers have pledged more support for the economy this year to reduce the risk of massive job losses but they have ruled out a flood of stimulus like that which beijing has unleashed in the past which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt analysts polled by reuters expect the world s second largest economy to have grown 6 4 percent in the october december quarter from a year earlier slowing from the previous quarter s 6 5 percent pace and matching levels last seen in early 2009 during the global financial crisis that could pull 2018 gross domestic product gdp growth to 6 6 percent the lowest since 1990 and down from a revised 6 8 percent in 2017 with stimulus measures expected to take some time to kick in most analysts believe conditions in china are likely to get worse before they get better and see a further slowdown to 6 3 percent this year some analysts believe real growth levels are already much weaker than official data suggest even if china and the united states agree on a trade deal in current talks which is a tall order analysts said it would be no panacea for the sputtering chinese economy unless beijing can galvanize weak investment and consumer demand chen xingdong chief china economist at bnp paribas said investors should not expect the latest round of stimulus to produce similar results as during the 2008 09 global crisis when beijing s huge spending package quickly boosted growth what china can really do this year is to prevent deflation prevent a recession and a hard landing in the economy chen said on a quarterly basis growth likely eased to 1 5 percent inoct dec from 1 6 percent in the preceding period china will release its fourth quarter and 2018 gdp data onmonday 0200 gmt along with december factory output retailsales and fixed asset investment since china s quarterly gdp readings tend to be unusually steady most investors prefer to focus on recent trends surprising contractions in december trade data and factory activity gauges in recent weeks have suggested the economy cooled more quickly than expected at the end of 2018 leaving it on shakier footing at the start of the new year sources have told reuters that beijing was planning tolower its growth target to 6 6 5 percent this year from around6 5 percent in 2018 tepid expansion in industrial output and weaker consumer spending is squeezing companies profit margins discouraging fresh investment and raising the risk of higher job losses some factories in guangdong china s export hub have shut earlier than usual ahead of the long lunar new year holiday as the tariff war with the united states curtails orders others are suspending production lines and cutting back on workers hours if the trade war drags on some migrant workers may not have jobs to return to trade negotiators are facing an early march deadline and washington has threatened to sharply hike tariffs if there are no substantial signs of progress stimulus steps eyed so far chinese policymakers have fast tracked construction projects and cut taxes and some import duties to spur demand to free up more funds for lending particularly to more vulnerable smaller firms the central bank has cut the amount of reserves that banks need to set aside as reserves rrr five times over the past year and guided borrowing costs lower further rrr reductions are expected in coming quarters but most analysts do not see a cut in benchmark interest rates just yet as policymakers wait to see if earlier steps begin to stabilize conditions more forceful easing could pressure the yuan and aggravate high debt levels with money going into less efficient or speculative investments the government may unveil more fiscal stimulus measures during the annual parliament meeting in march including bigger tax cuts and more spending on infrastructure projects analysts say some china watchers believe the government could deliver 2 trillion yuan 295 13 billion worth of cuts in taxes and fees this year and allow local governments to issue another 2 trillion yuan in special bonds largely used to fund key projects still some analysts do not expect the economy to bottom out convincingly until summer
singaporeans don t expect overall consumer costs to budge much in the next 12 months but think that core inflation that is price hikes outside of housing and private transport could still inch up people here figured that inflation would hit 2 85 per cent in the year ahead the quarterly dbs smu singapore index of inflation expectations sindex poll found in december this was the third straight quarterly drop and a dip from the 2 88 per cent pinged by the previous survey three months prior meanwhile core inflation expectations for the year ahead rose from 2 92 per cent in september to 2 99 per cent in december according to results released on monday singapore management university smu researchers who have started tracking consumers inflation expectations for key components of the price basket found the expectation of cost increases unchanged at 3 per cent for healthcare and 2 per cent for food and utilities expectations for education were logged for the first time at 3 per cent and for recreation at 2 per cent altogether the results suggest an expectation of higher cost increases outside of private road transport and housing segments possibly as a reaction to expectation of stronger us dollar if us interest rate keeps rising and higher domestic wages the survey providers noted in a summary of the report still the weighted composite for inflation expectations was 2 9 per cent in december against 2 91 per cent in september the research team also noted that after adjustments for potential behavioural biases overall inflation expectations were stable in 2018 at 2 per cent this could mean that expectations were anchored fairly well despite various short term uncertainties of the global economy the researchers wrote pointing to factors such as the us china trade war and rate hikes at the united states federal reserve taimur baig chief economist and managing director of group research at dbs said understanding the sentiment and expectations of singaporeans with regard to inflation is critical for policymakers analysts companies academics and financial sector participants as per the latest results at 2 9 per cent the one year ahead inflation expectations of singaporeans were broadly unchanged in december compared with the september 2018 survey given that the historical median has been 3 4 per cent since the inception of the survey in september 2011 this reflects a gradual downtrend in inflation expectations the survey s principal investigator smu assistant professor aurobindo ghosh added further tightening of the monetary policy in october 2018 seems to have lowered overall inflation expectations both in the medium and long term and bodes well for the future effectiveness of the monetary policy regime the monetary authority of singapore adjusted singapore s monetary policy to allow for the modest and gradual appreciation of the singapore dollar at both its meetings in 2018 after six years without tightening the central bank s official outlook is for overall inflation to stand at between 1 per cent and 2 per cent in 2019 with core inflation forecast to come in at between 1 5 per cent and 2 5 per cent the sindex survey was an online poll of some 500 people backed by the sim kee boon institute for financial economics at smu dbs came on board for the first time as a co sponsor and research partner with bank economists joining their academic counterparts to analyse and interpret responses

beijing china s economy cooled in the fourth quarter under pressure from faltering domestic demand and bruising u s tariffs dragging 2018 growth to the lowest in nearly three decades and pressuring beijing to roll out more stimulus to avert a sharper slowdown growing signs of weakness in china which has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years are fueling anxiety about risks to the world economy and are weighing on profits for firms ranging from apple to big carmakers policymakers have pledged more support this year to reduce the risk of massive job losses but have ruled out a flood of stimulus like that which beijing has relied on in the past which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt the government has means to support the economy they can expand infrastructure spending and they can cut banks reserve requirement ratio so we don t need to worry about capital spending said naoto saito chief researcher at daiwa institute of research in tokyo but the problem lies in consumption as the u s and china clash on many fronts consumer sentiment appears to have been hurt until now solid wage growth has been supporting consumption but now there appears to be a sense of vague anxiety about the future fourth quarter gross domestic product gdp grew at the slowest pace since the global financial crisis easing to 6 4 percent on year as expected from 6 5 percent in the third quarter the national bureau of statistics said on monday that pulled full year growth down to 6 6 percent the slowest annual pace since 1990 gdp in 2017 grew a revised 6 8 percent with support measures expected to take some time to kick in most analysts believe conditions are likely to get worse before they get better and see a further slowing to 6 3 percent this year some china watchers believe actual growth is already weaker than official data suggest uncertainties aplenty despite a raft of policy easing steps so far december data released along with gdp showed continued weakness across broad areas of the economy at the end of last year factory output picked up unexpectedly to 5 7 percent from 5 4 percent but it was one of the few bright spots along with a stronger services sector while regulators have been fast tracking construction projects most of the gain appeared due to higher mining and oil production reuters calculations showed average daily steel output hit its lowest level since march as producers cut output amid shrinking profit margins despite the slowing economy chinese officials also pledged to continue with a crackdown on air pollution that has weighed on the industrial sector other data on monday showed investment and retail sales continued to languish while the jobless rate edged higher fixed asset investment rose 5 9 percent in 2018 the slowest in at least 22 years as a regulatory crackdown on riskier financing and debt weighed on local government spending early in the year property investment is also looking wobbly with analysts waiting to see if beijing will risk loosening restrictions on home buyers that have kept a potential housing bubble in check chinese consumers are clearly feeling the pressure though retail sales growth picked up marginally in december to 8 2 percent the consumer strength gauge is around the weakest in 15 years auto sales in the world s biggest car market shrank for the first time since the 1990s officials recently pledged to boost consumer demand for big ticket items from cars to appliances but gains in disposable income are slowing while household debt is on the rise other data in recent weeks showed exports and imports unexpectedly shrank last month while falling factory orders point to a further drop in activity in coming months and more job shedding some factories in guangdong china s export hub have shut earlier than usual ahead of the long lunar new year holiday as new business dries up trade pressures even if china and the united states agree on a trade deal in current talks which would be a tall order analysts said it would be no panacea for china or its exporters demand is weakening globally not just in the united states net exports actually dragged on china s growth by 8 6 percent last year reuters calculations based on official data showed trade negotiators are facing an early march deadline and washington has threatened to sharply hike tariffs if there are no substantial signs of agreement white house officials have given markedly different views on progress so far china s vice premier and lead negotiator liu he is due to visit washington for the next round of talks at the end of the month more stimulus to free up more funds for lending particularly to vulnerable smaller firms the central bank has cut the amount of reserves that banks need to set aside as reserves rrr five times over the past year and guided borrowing costs lower further rrr reductions are expected in coming quarters but most analysts do not see a cut in benchmark interest rates yet as policymakers wait to see if earlier steps begin to stabilize activity more forceful easing could also pressure the yuan and aggravate high debt levels with money going into less efficient or speculative investments as it often has in the past the government may unveil more fiscal stimulus during the annual parliament meeting in march including bigger tax cuts and more spending on infrastructure projects some analysts believe it could deliver 2 trillion yuan 295 13 billion worth of cuts in taxes and fees this year and allow local governments to issue another 2 trillion yuan in special bonds largely used to fund key projects china has ample room for policy adjustments statistics bureau chief ning jizhe said on monday still some analysts do not expect the economy to bottom out convincingly until summer
the fourth quarter growth rate of 6 4 per cent compared to the previous year matched that of the first quarter of 2009 the lowest growth rate since the chinese government began publishing quarterly growth rates at the beginning of 1992 the official growth rate of 6 6 per cent in 2018 while a decent figure given the size of china s economy and in line with the government s target for growth of about 6 5 per cent for the year was the lowest since a rise 3 9 per cent in 1990 a year when china was sanctioned by western countries over its ruthless crackdown on the pro democracy movement the previous year china s economic growth rate in 2018 slipped to its lowest level in nearly three decades raising concerns over whether beijing has done enough to arrest the deepening slowdown at a time when the external environment is turning hostile and a mountain of debt at home is restricting the scope for additional stimulus the 2009 reading occurred at the beginning of the global financial market crash that sparked recessions throughout the west a cleaner walks on a pedestrian overpass against the skyscrapers under construction at the central business district in beijing monday january 21 2019 china s 2018 economic growth fell to a three decade low of 6 6 per cent amid a tariff battle with washington photo ap the fourth quarter growth rate was down from 6 5 per cent in the third quarter according to data released monday by the national bureau of statistics and matched the median forecast of 6 4 per cent from a bloomberg survey of analysts the 2018 annual growth rate was down

slightly from 8 1 per cent in november which was the lowest growth rate in 15 years the retail sales growth rate was higher than expected with analysts predicting a like sized gain of 8 1 per cent according to a bloomberg survey industrial product grew 5 7 per cent in december compared to a year earlier up from 5 4 per cent in november which was the lowest reading since november 2008 the rise was higher than expected with analysts forecasting a gain of 5 3 per cent according to a bloomberg survey fixed asset investment rose 5 9 per cent in 2018 from a year earlier down from 7 2 per cent in

president xi jinping gathered the country s provincial governors and ministers in beijing for a special session on how to manage major risks including ideological political and economic risks xi delivered an opening speech for the study session on monday morning in the summary of xi s speech published by the state news agency xinhua he said there are challenges and difficulties in implementing supply side structural reforms xi urged local authorities and ministries to keep a balance between nurturing growth and preventing risks all regions and departments must take effective measures to stabilise employment to keep economic activity within a reasonable range xi was quoted as saying analysts expect china s economy to weaken further during the first six months of this year before stabilising in the second half as beijing stimulus efforts including more infrastructure spending a further tax cut and lowering the cost of lending for smaller businesses take hold the government s cut in individual taxes from october last year may have played a hand in lifting consumer spending slightly based in december but analysts at capital economics said such impact is not likely to be long lasting we expect the uptick in industrial output and consumer spending to prove short lived said analysts at capital economics in a note published monday still with the headwinds from cooling global growth and the lagged impact of slower credit growth set to intensify in the coming months china s economy is likely to weaken further before growth stabilises in the second half of the year on the back of expanded policy stimulus more importantly employment and wage growth are facing downward pressure this year this will have a depressing effect on consumption said cicc analysts in a research note pointing to sagging growth in smartphone and car sales in china as evidence of more cautious consumer spending chinese smartphone sales dropped 8 per cent in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the same period a year earlier according to counterpoint research canalys another research company estimated an even steeper decline of around 15 per cent in the same quarter last month iphone maker apple issued its first revenue warning in nearly 12 years citing weak chinese demand car sales a key indicator for chinese consumption also dropped last year for the first time in almost 30 years considering the deterioration of corporate profitability the downward pressure on the real estate market still uncertain external demand and the decline in the growth rate of new service industries pressure on employment in many industries this year cannot be ruled out the cicc analysts said nomura analysts said current stimulus measures will not be sufficient and the government will need to do more to prevent a rapid deterioration in the economy we believe beijing will further ramp up its stimulus measures although it currently seems reluctant to ease tightening measure in the property sector leaving almost the entire onus on infrastructure investment we believe deregulating the property markets in big cities is the key to unlocking a growth recovery said analysts from nomura jp morgan s analysts forecast a significant value added tax cut fiscal subsidies on home appliance and auto purchases as well as an expansion in government s budget deficit target to be announced in the coming months to boost spending along with monetary policy moves to support lending such as another bank reserve ratio cut early in the second quarter given the continued headwinds created by the government campaign to reduce debt and risky lending in the economy as well as the trade war with the united states the government reportedly will set a growth target range of between 6 and 6 5 per cent for this year the growth target range will be released publicly at the national people s congress in early march

authorâ miguel sanz joã o lourenã o has been president of angola since 26 september 2017 about one year later he cemented his hold on power by taking over the chairmanship of the ruling movimento popular de libertaã ã o de angola mpla although he reshuffled the government for instance by replacing the transport minister and the vice president manuel vicente most other ministerial posts had not changed from the previous administration despite promises to diversify the economy and fight corruption which he has described as a scourge on society his actions so far appear contradictory to his publicly voiced intentions and declarations past and present lourenã o inherited a dire economic situation characterised by serious shortages of foreign currency particularly of the u s dollar and the continual devaluation of the kwanza the currency depreciated 40 per cent against the greenback in 2018 in addition inflation has hovered around 30 per cent and is set to rise angolaâ s economic troubles began in 2014 when global crude oil prices dipped and severely hampered the governmentâ s ability to generate revenue angola depends on oil for 75 per cent of its government revenue and 90 per cent of its exports this over dependency on the hydrocarbon sector left the country vulnerable to economic shocks potentially placing the country into an irrecoverable position diversification has long been the answer but execution of a strategy and plan never materialised in the previous administration lourenã oâ s chief election campaign plank centered on reducing the dependency on angolaâ s hydrocarbons sector and creating new revenue streams from existing resources or developing new ones diversification was also a key condition for the international monetary fund imf to agree to a three year extended fund facility for angola worth usd3 7 billion which the creditor announced on 7 december 2018 usd990 million would be immediately disbursed ending corruption including bribery and money laundering was another condition diversification an urgent priority angola is in â desperateâ need of cash and therefore lourenã o is pursuing an ambitious investment programme to develop the countryâ s agricultural tourism and mining assets for instance the government is planning to invest usd230 million across the country over the next six years to support its proyectoâ de desarrolloâ deâ agricultura comercial a development initiative launched last december which aims to commercialise the agricultural sector over usd77 million had already been invested in such projects countrywide at the end of 2018 oil majors such as the u k â s bp franceâ s total and u s oil giant exxonmobil have also signed memoranda of understanding with the state owned oil company sonangol to develop new ultra deep offshore oil operations however the amount of the investments has not yet been made public a lot of the money for the new investments appears guaranteed by the government against the backdrop of a poor economic outlook coupled with crude oil prices below the levels the government had counted on â although brent crude prices rebounded early this year off the back of a production cut agreed by opec member states â angola will have to resort to more borrowing thanks to reprofiling of its debt through the issuing of usd5 billion worth of euro and dollar denominated bonds likely explains the reduced fiscal deficit as maturities have been extended in the medium term however debt to gdp remained at a risky 90 per cent at the end of 2018 meaning that more commercial loans will be needed to finance the ambitious investment programme and will continue to damage economic growth prospects not least because china is angolaâ s largest purchaser of oil meanwhile angola already owes beijing a lot of money official figures put this at usd23 billion last year but due to the lack of reliable data this number could be much higher furthermore as a lot of that debt with china has been guaranteed through oil swap deals increased volatility in crude oil prices is likely to again create more financial headaches for the government foreign investors are also likely to be concerned as a growing debt burden will hinder the governmentâ s ability to honour its debt repayments and ability to unlock financial resources for instance to pay for projects or salaries to its civil servants anti corruption lourenã o also pledged to stamp out corruption which he has described as a â scourge on societyâ international observers were positively surprised when he sacked the children of ex president dos santos from key positions within the state owned oil company sonangol and angolaâ s sovereign wealth fund fsdea josã filomeno a son of the former president and former head of fsdea and his business ally dual swiss angolan national jean claude bastos de morais were arrested in angola in september 2018 on charges they had conspired to defraud the state in multiple jurisdictions including in switzerland and the united kingdom both have denied wrongdoing authorities in mauritius switzerland and the u k froze their assets while investigations were ongoing however londonâ s commercial court which is part of its high court lifted the freezing order due to what it said were serious procedural failings in the original complaint notwithstanding and based on a recognition that corruption was conducted with impunity under the previous administration lourenã oâ s government in may last year adopted an amnesty bill for the voluntary repatriation of stolen state funds that had been moved offshore the true extent of angolaâ s corruption problem is unclear but authorities both in angola and the u s have indicated that close to usd30 billion in illicitly obtained money from the state is being held in offshore accounts but the amnesty bill which expired in december appears to have attracted little interest according to legal practitioners on the ground and few actually repatriated any money the government has promised to now coercively go after those who have stolen public funds and hidden it abroad angolaâ s ability to do this remains in doubt repatriation of financial assets will also depend on the willingness of banks abroad to transfer back the money tightening anti money laundering legislation across the world will make commercial banks â especially those in oecd countries â more averse to high risk jurisdictions like angola diminishing the effectiveness of the law since â de riskingâ of angolaâ s banking sector took place after the collapse of portugalâ s banco espirito santo â in part due to toxic credit at its angolan subsidiary â hardly any western banks have resumed correspondent banking relationships for transacting in u s dollars which explains a lot of angolaâ s current problems but because oil dependent angolaâ s financial sector is highly dollarised such correspondent banking is also key to repatriate the stolen funds placing doubt about the likely success of lourenã oâ s policies his advisors should be aware of that restoring trust depends on the government s ability to reform the financial sector which remains concentrated around a few politically exposed persons among angolan banks shareholders of the 27 commercial banks registered with banco nacional de angola â the central bank and sector regulator â five control over 80 per cent of total banking assets deposits and loans in addition the banking sector is highly centralised with the vast majority of angolans and small and medium sized enterprises unable to access formal credit instead the bulk of credit given by angolan banks goes to a few hundred chosen investors given that diversification is a priority of the lourenã o presidency his ability to also restructure the financial sector will be critical from reformist to a return to old habits the governmentâ s new policies have indeed caught many media headlines but lourenã oâ s own behavior during his first year in office also contradict his narrative it started with lavish spending during a state visit to europe where the angolan delegation signed several agricultural development projects with french financiers among others according to reports on the maka angola news website the angolan delegation went on a spending spree chartering at least three aircraft including a boeing 787 vip private airliner a boeing 737 and a gulfstream business jet according to the leasing company the boeing 787 cost usd74 000 an hour to charter it goes without saying that this sort of spending does not marry well with lourenã oâ s promises and his narrative of being a modest person others have pointed to the lourenã o familyâ s real estate property in the town of bethesda maryland united states a report by u s newspaper the washington post citing public records said the property was purchased in 2013 for usd1 7 million by the lourenã o family while it is not illegal for angolans to own property abroad as a primary residence such revelations will probably fuel suspicions about the presidentâ s true intentions more questions emerge over lourenã oâ s positioning vis ã vis the former vice president manuel vicente who portuguese prosecutors in 2017 charged with bribing that countryâ s attorney general in 2011 lourenã o refused to recognise the portuguese authoritiesâ competency to try vicente and lambasted the charges as â interferenceâ by the former colonial power it was agreed that vicente would be tried in angola instead this never occurred although vicente has been sidelined from the mpla leadership he remains an influential businessman in both angola and abroad â another worrying trend is potential nepotism and conflicts of interest including within the military in april 2018 the president promoted his brother â general sequeira joã o lourenã o â as deputy head of the president s intelligence bureau which oversees the military the police and the intelligence services two months prior he allegedly sold a state owned aircraft to his brotherâ s aviation company â sjl aeronã utica â without a public tender and at an undisclosed price it does not end there his plans to expand the military budget should sound some alarm bells while already having among the largest military budgets on the continent lourenã o is intent on expanding it further one reason raised has been to fight piracy as angola is looking to expand its offshore oil production operations and modernizing its naval capabilities would ensure security of such operations against such threats this is despite angola suffering hardly any such attacks in its waters over the past few years although official figures indicate that angolaâ s military budget halved between 2014 and 2017 well respected sweden based think tank sipri has noted that estimates of real military spending are hard to come by across sub saharan africa despite the decline in september 2016 middle east based privinvest group announced on its website that it would provide naval vessels to the angolan navy and construct a ship building facility together with a london based partner around that same time it was revealed that privinvest had signed contracts to supply ships to mozambique which were never delivered the deal along with two others left mozambique with a massive bill of usd2 1 billion â more than its total national debt at the time on 29 december south african police arrested manuel chang mozambiqueâ s finance minister when the deals with privinvest were signed on suspicion of fraud relating to the deal this followed an indictment by the u s district court of new york city which led to the arrest of jean boustani an executive of privinvest three former bankers of swiss bank credit suisse and a dozen more have also been indicted for their role in the scheme while privinvest was not the only company involved with inflating mozambiqueâ s debt to astronomical levels the company has faced resistance in other jurisdictions such as nigeria paris based the africa report revealed in june 2018 that the nigerian finance minister in 2014 had refused to accept a usd2 billion investment proposal from privinvest after it appeared clear that nigeria would have to provide most of the guaranteesâ for the loans that would finance the joint venture privinvest had reportedly proposed to take control over a derelict shipyard from the nigerian navy and refurbish it that angola has signed a deal with privinest under lourenã oâ s watch â granted he was defence minister at the time â may therefore also concern investors especially since the government never confirmed the investment furthermore in may 2018 credit suisse announced a usd700 million loan to angola conclusion napoleon walks if lourenã o is serious about eradicating corruption he should be careful with who he deals with and how this may look to the outside so far his defence scorecard his lavish spending support for vicente and family appointments can only undermine his credibility that the highest ranks of the mpla and the broader governing elite in angola remain intact bar a few cosmetic changes to the political bureau â the apex governing body of the mpla â is also worrying adopting policies that indeed are likely conditions imposed by international financiers such as the imf but that in reality are unlikely to produce any change in behaviours not only puts his own track record at risk but also the reputation of the entire country furthermore the lack of criminal convictions of former senior officials â not only of the former presidentâ s family but also other high ranking mpla cadres â suggests that their behaviour will not change either the authorities are deliberately delaying the processes to get some initial goodwill from foreign investors or the system is so slow that no conviction will serve to deter future corrupt behaviour the end result is that foreign investors and financiers engaging in angola are setting themselves up to considerable compliance and legal risks giving the â newâ president the benefit of the doubt may have been valid in his first year but the lack of progress should prompt them to adopt a more cautious approach just as napoleon in george orwellâ s animal farm promised a whole new way of governing once in power he quickly adopted the same habits as his former steward read more on â

committed to making the uk a high risk place for the world s most sophisticated criminals to operate october patisserie valerie investigation into accounting irregularities patisserie valerie remains under scrutiny after an internal investigation in october 2018 revealed significant and potentially fraudulent accounting irregularities the company s shares were suspended and investigations were commenced after the company uncovered a shortfall of 40 million in its finances it announced to the stock market that it was on the brink of collapse the shortfall was traced to two company bank overdraft facilities that were supposedly kept secret from the board suggesting a clear lack of corporate transparency cfo chris marsh immediately suspended following the revelations was arrested by the sfo on suspicion of committing fraud by false representation and released on bail he subsequently resigned ceo paul may was also forced to step down the financial reporting council frc has commenced an investigation into the company and the role that its cfo played and will interrogate the company s accounts for the years ending 2015 2016 and 2017 grant thornton the company s auditors are also under investigation for their activity in overseeing the company s accounts this follows other recent investigations in which large accounting firms have been scrutinised and criticised for rubber stamping the accounts of companies subsequently investigated for fraud and accounting irregularities this is an area that may yet prove fruitful for regulators in future barclays bank qatari fundraising trial collapse on 26 october 2018 the sfo failed in its final bid to reinstate criminal proceedings against barclays plc of conspiracy to defraud and barclays plc and barclays bank plc regarding charges of providing unlawful financial assistance contrary to the companies act 1985 the allegations concerned barclays 2008 borrowing from qatar during the global banking crisis which helped barclays avoid any bailout from the uk government the sfo claimed that barclays plc conspired to secure this funding via hidden side deals worth over 300 million the sfo further alleged that both entities were involved in providing a 3bn loan to the state of qatar in 2008 for buying shares in the bank on 21 may 2018 the hon mr justice jay sitting at the crown court at southwark dismissed the corporate charges on 23 july 2018 the sfo applied to the high court to reinstate those charges via an application for a voluntary bill of indictment an exceptional procedure sought where for example a prosecutor seeks to try a defendant on the basis of evidence that has previously been dismissed or where a procedural irregularity with the way that a case has been charged needs to be corrected in the high court lord justice davis refused the sfo s application removing the sfo s ability to prosecute either corporate entity on this evidence the charges against four individuals former chief executive john varley roger jenkins thomas kalaris and richard boath remain notwithstanding that these men will stand trial the failure even to have a jury hear the evidence on which the sfo director considered there was sufficient evidence to charge barclays plc and barclays bank plc will be embarrassing for the sfo which sought and secured additional funding from the treasury in order to pursue this investigation and referred to it in keynote speeches as one of its major investigations return to table of contents november fca financial crime survey on 13 november 2018 the fca published its first industrywide review of the risks facing the financial sector the report is based on data from 2 000 uk based banks and building societies over a one year period providing insight into how they are responding to financial crime risks the financial services industry is putting significant resources into preventing financial crime and reporting concerns internally to money laundering reporting officers mlro and externally to the national crime agency nca the data demonstrates that in the period covered 363 000 cases of suspicious activity were reported to the nca by mlros in the same period law enforcement agencies submitted 123 000 investigative orders under the proceeds of crime act seeking information about these financial institutions customers the review identifies cyber crime and fraud enabled by new technology as the greatest threats examples include vishing using the telephone in an attempt to deceive the user into surrendering private information malware enabled fraud software used to collect information or data phishing fraudulently obtaining sensitive information such as usernames passwords and banking details by sending disguised emails and hacking the review s list of high risk countries provides no real surprises iran panama russia iraq and laos make up the top five largely no doubt in relation to sanctions risks with countries in the middle east and africa making up the majority of the remainder at the top of the list interestingly whilst countries considered offshore e g jersey and guernsey are featured in the list of 228 they are low risk because whilst they facilitate transactions for many businesses and individuals through their generous tax regimes they have developed very effective anti money laundering laws and regulations to mitigate the associated risks house of lords select committee on the bribery act 2010 as reported in our october enforcement update the house of lords select committee on the bribery act 2010 was formed in may 2018 to consider the effectiveness of the bribery act whether it has led to stricter prosecution of corruption a higher conviction rate and a reduction in offending the committee recently heard evidence from interested parties including law enforcement agencies defence lawyers anti corruption trade associations and global companies on 13 november 2018 sir brian leveson president of the queen s bench division who has presided over the judicial approval of all four of the uk s deferred prosecution agreements dpas to date shed light on what adequate procedures under the bribery act should be sir brian supported the suggestion made by a committee member that in court adequacy could be construed in light of what was reasonable in all the circumstances if this view is taken on more widely by the judiciary greater clarity would be provided to businesses than has so far been provided by the sfo or in the legislation itself on the same day the committee heard from representatives of the sfo the director of public prosecutions and the nca sfo director lisa osofsky supported an extension of the failure to prevent bribery offence to other kinds of economic crimes sir brian noted that this extension could be in the public interest enabling uk law enforcement to take a more robust far reaching approach to tackling economic crime in a further evidence session on 11 december 2018 iskander fernandez a lawyer who represented skansen interiors limited in the first contested failure to prevent trial a prosecution which he described as bizarre given the company s level of cooperation and self reporting his evidence focussed on what companies particularly smes can do to ensure they have the right procedures in place stressing the importance of having a bespoke policy in place to cover red flags rather than a blanket policy from the internet which could fail properly to meet the requirements of adequate procedures the committee is expected to report its findings by 31 march 2019 law commission review of uk confiscation regime the law commission is reviewing the confiscation regime as it currently stands under part 2 of the proceeds of crime act 2002 with its consultation paper due in september 2019 law commissioner professor david ormerod qc noted in a public statement about the review the law commission welcomes the opportunity to review this area of the law and we are asking all those with expertise and experience of the confiscation regime to provide us with evidence examples and ideas to inform the project what we hear will inform our options for law reform to be published in a consultation paper next year in its first year the project will review the current legislative regime and will be open to input from practitioners academics and experts the review will not however touch on the recovery of criminal assets under the civil regime leading some to criticise that the review will fail to offer an efficient proposal to connect the currently separate parts of the confiscation regime for example by combining the civil and criminal parts of the system société générale 1 4 billion settlement with us authorities over sanctions violations in november 2018 société générale group socgen agreed to pay a 1 4 billion settlement to us authorities over sanctions violations related to cuba in 2015 the penalty combines with a three year dpa in which the bank will not be prosecuted if it abides by the terms of the agreement socgen has taken several steps to ensure compliance such as hiring an independent consultant to evaluate the bank s enhancement implementations in its sanctions compliance programme an additional penalty of 95 million has been agreed over separate violations of regulations related to the bank s new york branch in a statement by chief executive frederic oudea socgen admitted shortcomings that were identified in these settlements and noted that the company has cooperated with the us authorities to resolve these matters the penalties are for approximately 13 billion of transactions that violated us sanctions between 2004 and 2010 socgen conducted these transactions between clients in iran cuba and sudan prosecutors alleged that oil transactions between a dutch commodities trading firm and a cuban company with a state monopoly on the production and refining of cuban crude oil were deliberately masked under inaccurate payments to hide the cuban nexus of dollar transactions companies house surge in sars sent to the nca the nca has seen a five fold increase in suspicious activity reports sars in the last financial year a freedom of information act request lodged by uk ngo corruption watch has shown an increase from 426 reports in the financial year 2016 17 to 2 264 received by the uk national crime agency from companies house in 2017 18 a spokesperson for companies house said that companies house works closely with law enforcement bodies to identify suspicious and potentially criminal activities and where necessary information is shared with law enforcement partners roger hamilton martin of corruption watch however believes that concerns remain over the integrity of the uk company register given the lack of verification by companies house of beneficial ownership information duncan hames of transparency international uk also commented that more needs to be done to hold those accountable for facilitating these crimes uk limited partnerships have felt the pressure of criticism as they have often been used to hide shell companies and have regularly been caught in money laundering scandals the most recent of which concerned danske bank in september 2018 the bank identified 177 uk registered customers who may have laundered money through its estonian branch between 2007 2016 in the past year 922 544 transactions reported to the nca as sars were identified as warranting further investigation the bulk of sars received by the nca are submitted from financial institutions with more than two million currently in its database danske bank charged by danish prosecutors in ongoing ml investigation on 28 november 2018 the danish state prosecutor for serious economic and international crime søik announced that danske bank a s was to be preliminarily charged with offences contrary to the danish anti money laundering act on four counts all relating to the bank s estonian branch covering the period from 1 february 2007 to the end of january 2016 the company s statement following the charging decision noted that it expected the preliminary charges after it presented its preliminary findings to søik in september 2018 the suspected money laundering is understood to exceed 200 billion however it is possible that any penalty that results from the conclusion of the søik investigation may be of limited significance when compared to the damage already caused to the bank and the risk that other international law enforcement investigations and prosecutions may follow particularly if this were to involve us prosecutions the recent significant seven fold increase in danish sentencing tariffs for money laundering offences will likely not apply to the danske bank case as these increases took effect after the conduct in question occurred fh bertling conclusion of trial in corruption investigation the sfo s investigation into fh bertling ltd which started in september 2014 has concluded following the conviction at trial of three former company executives for bribery offences the case concerned the payment on fh bertling s behalf of over 350 000 in bribes and facilitation payments to ensure that its bid for the conocophillips jasmine shipping contract was successful as well as to obtain assurances that inflated prices it would charge for other services said to be worth over 16 million would be approved by the oil company a separate investigation into the company revealed that between january 2004 and december 2006 senior executives had conspired to pay bribes to an agent for the angolan state oil company to secure shipping contracts worth around 21 million the sfo confirmed that across both investigations a total of nine convictions either through guilty pleas or convictions after trial were secured including for the company itself the sfo s director commented bribery has no place in business in britain or abroad it undermines the rule of law distorts our economy and damages the reputation of the uk on 11 january 2019 the three former bertling executives together with one conocophillips executive were sentenced to terms of imprisonment of between six months and two years all of which were suspended and will not take effect for two years provided no further offences are committed standard bank conclusion of uk s first deferred prosecution agreement on 30 november 2018 the sfo announced the successful completion of the uk s first dpa approved exactly three years previous as discussed in our february 2016 enforcement update the agreement concerned charges against standard bank plc that contrary to section 7 bribery act 2010 it had failed to prevent persons associated with it from committing bribery not only was this the sfo s first use of a dpa it was the first charge for that offence financial orders met by the bank under the dpa included a fine of 16 8m 8 4 million in disgorgement of profits passed to the uk treasury 6 million in compensation plus over 1 million interest to be paid to the government of tanzania and 330 000 in costs to the sfo the bank was required to cooperate with the sfo by disclosing information and material relating to the activities of individuals involved the bank also implemented an improved corporate compliance programme including a pwc review of its anti bribery and corruption procedures pwc was required to implement any recommendations and report to the sfo return to table of contents december financial action task force evaluation of uk s anti money laundering measures the financial action task force fatf founded by the g7 exists to develop policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing on 7 december 2018 fatf published a report on the uk s anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing measures as of march 2018 noting there was a well developed and robust regime to effectively combat money laundering as a major global financial centre and the world s largest centre for cross border banking the uk risks being used as a destination to launder the proceeds of crime despite this the report found that the anti money laundering system is effective particularly in the areas of investigation and prosecution of ml tf confiscation the implementation of targeted financial sanctions related to terrorism and proliferation protecting the nonprofit sector from terrorist abuse understanding the ml tf risks facing the country preventing misuse of legal structures and co operating domestically and internationally to address them areas requiring improvement include the resourcing of the financial intelligence unit fiu based in the nca and the sar regime despite concerns raised about the lack of available resources over a decade ago in the uk s previous fatf mutual evaluation the issue persists fatf stated they are not convinced that other law enforcement agencies fill the gaps left by the fiu and that the fiu s more limited role impacts on the sharing of information with foreign fius in relation to the sar regime fatf suggested an overhaul due to under reporting of suspicious transactions by trust company providers lawyers and accountants moreover the sar regime s reporting mechanism requires modernising to ensure that sars are effectively screened and checked against multiple databases this is linked to the issue of resourcing as well as additional human resources the nca needs to ensure that the best analytical software is available to detect and prevent money laundering alstom sfo prosecutions on 19 december 2018 nicholas reynolds former global sales director for the boiler retrofits unit of alstom power ltd a subsidiary of alstom sa was convicted of conspiracy to corrupt concluding the investigation and prosecution of alstom companies reynolds and two other individuals john venskus and göran wikström both of whom pleaded guilty and alstom power which also pleaded guilty were convicted of conspiracy to corrupt in relation to bribing lithuanian politicians and officials in a lithuanian power station in order to win two contracts worth 240 million venskus and wikström received custodial sentences and alstom power was ordered to pay 18 038 000 on 10 april 2018 alstom network uk ltd was found guilty of conspiracy to corrupt in relation to making corrupt payments to win contracts in tunisia but is yet to be sentenced the company and two individuals were acquitted of similar charges in relation to contracts in india and poland and the company and three individuals were acquitted of a similar charge in relation to a contract for the budapest metro it was a difficult period for the alstom group with adverse findings and financial penalties for corruption in the uk us and switzerland despite this the company reported revenues of 8 billion in 2017 and shareholders approved a merger with siemens in early 2018 tesco acquittal of defendants in fraud trial as a result of an investigation into accounting irregularities tesco elected to enter into a dpa with the sfo in may 2017 and paid a penalty of 129m however the sfo has now failed to secure convictions against two key senior executives after the trial judge dismissed the prosecution s case for being too weak to be placed before a jury in 2014 the uk retailer announced it had overstated its profit by 250 million due to the accelerated recognition of commercial income and delayed accrual of costs leaving a deficit in its accounts the sfo s case against the defendants former uk managing director chris bush and ex uk food commercial director john scouler concerned a claim that income was pulled forward into one financial period treating future income as current both men were each alleged to have been aware of the illegality of this technique and to have encouraged its use with the intention of misleading the market both were charged with fraud by abuse of position contrary to sections 1 and 4 fraud act 2006 and false accounting contrary to section 17 theft act 1968 the re trial at the crown court at southwark an earlier trial being halted due to the serious illness of a co accused collapsed after the trial judge sir john royce ruled that the prosecution case lacked sufficient evidence to show that the defendants knew of the fraudulent accounting there was therefore no legal case for either defendant to answer the sfo sought to overturn the ruling by exercising the ability to request the court of appeal criminal division to reconsider rulings that would otherwise terminate criminal proceedings however that court refused the sfo leave to appeal and the jury were directed to acquit both defendants what is significant about this case is that the sfo lost a submission of no case to answer at the half time stage of the trial raising serious concerns about the charging decisions taken against these defendants and the ensuing flaws that were highlighted by their legal teams in the manner that the prosecution was pursued despite the sfo s failure to adduce sufficient evidence at trial to support a fundamental element of the offences charged knowledge of the alleged offence it is still considering whether to re try a third former director who faces the same charges this trial was the first example of a trial of individuals following a dpa approved by the sfo companies that agree to dpas following an investigation have to consider whether they can accept that there was criminal wrongdoing within their organisation following the high profile failure of this trial there exists uncertainty as to whether convictions against individuals will necessarily follow sfo approved dpas and as to whether the sfo could in fact prove the criminal charges on which dpas are formulated which could weaken the sfo s hand in seeking to encourage companies to enter into future dpas house of commons select committee seizes evidence despite us court seal pressure on facebook s executives remains high following the cambridge analytica scandal in a bid further to investigate facebook s data and privacy controls damian collins mp chair of the digital culture media and sport committee invoked parliamentary powers conferred on the committee to seize material that is understood to contain confidential internal communications between facebook executives the documents were demanded from the founder of a us software company six4three who was in the uk at the time and was compelled to comply with the demand whilst the ability for parliamentary committees to demand and obtain material from third parties is by no means a new power the exercise of this power by serving a demand on an executive visiting from another country is more novel standing orders permit committees such as this to require the attendance of or the production of documents from persons in the uk companies or private individuals provided the information sought is relevant to the work of the committee rules governing parliamentary privilege mean that witnesses so summoned have immunity from civil or criminal proceedings based on evidence they provide whether orally or in writing this case is novel because the materials obtained by the committee are subject to a preservation seal from the san mateo superior court in the us where six4three and facebook are involved in litigation making them publicly unavailable and subject to restricted disclosure the court has reportedly invited submissions from the litigants as to how the actions of the committee may raise important constitutional issues in the us companies who may find themselves within the sights of parliamentary committees should consider carefully what material is brought to the uk by executives because once material is within the uk a parliamentary committee may seek its production even overseas courts orders are unlikely to prevent the revelation of material of interest to parliament return to table of contents general corporate criminal liability under the trump administration government data and interviews with federal officials show that the number of corporates prosecuted for white collar criminal offences in the us has generally decreased since barak obama s presidency from the second half of the obama administration there was also a sharp decline in financial penalties enforced against banks and large corporations three large corporations walmart barclays and rbs were faced with high demands in order to resolve investigations during the final months of the obama administration federal officials demanded that walmart pay nearly 1 billion and plead guilty in the foreign bribery investigation barclays was demanded to pay nearly 7 billion to settle claims that it sold toxic mortgage investments that helped fuel the 2008 financial crisis and rbs was investigated over its role in the crisis since trump s presidency the department of justice doj reached a settlement agreement of 2 billion with barclays rbs escaped criminal charge and walmart is yet to be charged under the enforcement of the us securities and exchange commission sec and the doj experts found that since obama s administration there has been a 62 percent decrease in sec penalties imposed and illicit profits recovered and a 72 percent decline in doj corporate penalties sec enforcement officers state that the agency should not be judged according to financial penalties alone but by the impact of high profile cases it has tackled in the past year which they claim compares favourably to any period in the commission s history in addition the statistics must be considered against the overall improving stock market and the fact that since the financial crisis industries have increased their compliance procedures that said trump s more sympathetic stance towards corporate misfeasance reflects the administration s deregulatory agenda that has been pursued throughout the federal government lisa osofsky s tenure as sfo director to date lisa osofsky s tenure as sfo director o began on 28 august 2018 amidst high profile trials a high turnover of sfo staff and the impending uncertainties of brexit osofsky is now three months into her new role and remains committed to making sure that the uk is a high risk place for the world s most sophisticated criminals to operate osofsky delivered the keynote address at the 35th international conference on the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa in washington dc based on themes which aligned with the plans set out during her introductory speech in september 2018 she prioritised collaboration across the international law enforcement community the sfo s bribery and corruption cases overwhelmingly involve the conduct of foreign participants highlighting why international cooperation is essential when investigating and prosecuting these cases osofsky s commitment to prosecuting large scale money laundering on a global level is likely to involve intelligence sharing both domestically between the uk s governmental bodies and internationally osofsky noted that a doj prosecutor is currently working at the sfo and whilst he is learning our british ways he is also teaching uk prosecutors the doj s ways however the perception remains that osofsky will lead the sfo with american methods company cooperation osofsky s role so far has required consideration of the sfo s approach to and implementation of dpas she has strongly encouraged the cooperation of companies under investigation and the adoption of compliance and reform measures offering practical advice on what the sfo expects when it refers to cooperation osofsky said that companies should tell me something i don t know and make the path to admissible evidence easier through making witnesses available promptly pointing the sfo to the hot documents evidence that is most important both inculpatory and exculpatory making the evidence available in a way that comports with our laws making the evidence available in a way that is useful and enables the sfo to test and probe the facts and avoiding actions that create proof issues or create procedural barriers osofsky maintained the sfo s dicta that following an internal investigation corporates seeking to claim privilege over first witness accounts were unlikely to be considered cooperative corporates will have to consider how to balance disclosure of the outcome of their investigation alongside the fact that they may later be required to disclose this in court against one of their employees to ensure a fair trial osofsky also noted that with the intention of accelerating the current pace of investigations the sfo is investing in technology that would help to get to the hugely varied ways that criminals now converse lead more quickly to both inculpatory and exculpatory documents and help to meet the sfo s disclosure obligations in criminal trials in the uk more recently osofsky confirmed that she would welcome additional laws akin to corporate manslaughter to enable the agency to pursue the corporate big boys whom she believes the sfo s current legal armoury allows to escape prosecution for fraud and corruption resulting only in prosecution of the middle managers rather than the controlling minds it may still be premature to assess osofsky s leadership style so far and predict her future impact as a senior uk prosecutor she has dealt in recent months with results from charging decisions for which she was not responsible however she has given a clear indication of the direction in which she hopes to steer the sfo and in the forthcoming year it can be expected that she will seek to stamp her mark on the way that the agency operates the content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances
glen hodgson is a senior fellow at the c d howe institute the american economy is adrift like a huge sailing ship when tides are high and winds are favourable it can be headed in the right direction but when conditions darken the u s economy will have no mooring or anchor to rely upon it could even end up crashing on the rocks once again as it did in 2008 the u s economy is now a decade into a sustained growth cycle and it is essentially back to its potential growth path near term economic conditions are generally positive notwithstanding the trade war with china and the recent meltdown in share prices for many profitable and well performing companies u s economic growth was robust in 2018 fuelled by a tax cut that advantaged firms and higher income individuals and the consensus is for solid performance again in 2019 with output growth projected at 2 5 per cent or higher job creation has been solid and measured unemployment is below 4 per cent current performance is no doubt important but a focus on the short term deflects attention away from the underlying macroeconomic and structural weaknesses of the u s economy weakness can be seen in four macroeconomic fundamentals first the united states fiscal anchor has been lost at sea large fiscal deficits and mounting u s public debt are not a recent phenomenon to be blamed solely on the donald trump administration and the previous congress a pattern of large deficits and a steady run up in u s public debt stretches back to the early stages of the g w bush administration made much worse by the 2008 09 global financial crisis and the exceptional fiscal stimulus used to rekindle growth and help restore confidence in the u s economy but the deep 2018 tax cuts without comparable cuts to spending mean u s federal fiscal deficits are once again rapidly growing the congressional budget office projects a fiscal deficit over us 1 trillion in 2020 the growth boost from tax cuts was short lived and has largely evaporated public debt is increasing and is projected to exceed 90 per cent of gdp by 2020 triple the share of gdp when bill clinton left office almost 20 years ago debt service costs will inevitably absorb a larger share of the national budget moreover the u s fiscal framework is burdened by massive unfunded social security liabilities and the sustainability of medicare and medicaid are at risk congress has so far been unwilling to consider how to fund these program commitments to the american public second u s monetary policy is still not fully re anchored the united states and many other parts of the global economy have been medicated for a decade with truly exceptional monetary stimulus or what we termed monetary morphine in a past globe and mail commentary reducing the dependency on easy money and restoring more traditional monetary conditions was never going to be easy or straightforward the u s federal reserve saw signs two years ago of more normal u s output and employment growth ahead and its benchmark short term interest rate has been steadily increased in small increments however the recent sharp downward adjustment in equity prices coupled with a decline in long term interest rates confirm that the u s economy has not completed its withdrawal from monetary morphine trade and other policy turmoil simply provided an added shock the fed will have to proceed carefully on its journey back to more normal interest rates if it is to avoid destabilizing confidence in the recovery third as canadians know all too well the trump administration has made chaotic attempts to strengthen the u s trade bargaining position but without an overarching trade strategy and with no consideration of the collateral damage mr trump boxed himself in on the north american free trade agreement and the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp and american exporters now seem sure to lose market share in cptpp signatory countries a new trade agreement with canada and mexico has been negotiated but tariffs remain in place on canadian and mexican steel and aluminum which makes little economic sense and the new united states mexico canada agreement still has to run the gauntlet of confirmation by a divided congress trade talks with china are now the headline story and where they are headed is unknown to reduce economic uncertainty and be able to roll back the punitive tariffs being paid by american consumers on chinese goods mr trump may eventually have to declare victory in the china trade negotiations even if there is limited underlying positive change to justify this declaration and fourth climate change is the ultimate existential threat facing the united states and the world in the years ahead despite the overwhelming scientific and physical evidence and mounting costs and risks washington has moved backward by announcing its withdrawal from the paris accord some climate policy action is being taken by other levels of u s government but the absence of federal leadership and co ordination will inevitably put the united states years behind others in terms of climate change mitigation adaptation and seizing low carbon growth opportunities it is hard for canada to protect itself from an american economy adrift due to deep economic integration and myriad business social and personal networks the least we can do is to identify and understand the many risks and implement our own strong macroeconomic trade and climate change policies that may not entirely prevent the malaise from spreading but it could make canada better equipped to deal with the consequences
china s economy cooled in the fourth quarter under pressure from faltering domestic demand and bruising u s tariffs dragging 2018 growth to the lowest in nearly three decades and pressuring beijing to roll out more stimuli to avert a sharper slowdown growing signs of weakness in china which has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years are fueling anxiety about risks to the world economy and are weighing on profits for firms ranging from apple to big carmakers policymakers have pledged more support this year to reduce the risk of massive job losses but have ruled out a flood of stimulus like that which beijing has relied on in the past which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt the government has means to support the economy they can expand infrastructure spending and they can cut banks reserve requirement ratio so we don t need to worry about capital spending said naoto saito chief researcher at daiwa institute of research in tokyo but the problem lies in consumption as the u s and china clash on many fronts consumer sentiment appears to have been hurt until now solid wage growth has been supporting consumption but now there appears to be a sense of vague anxiety about the future fourth quarter gross domestic product gdp grew at the slowest pace since the global financial crisis easing to 6 4 percent on year as expected from 6 5 percent in the third quarter the national bureau of statistics said on monday that pulled full year growth down to 6 6 percent the slowest annual pace since 1990 gdp in 2017 grew a revised 6 8 percent with support measures expected to take some time to kick in most analysts believe conditions are likely to get worse before they get better and see a further slowing to 6 3 percent this year some china watchers believe actual growth is already weaker than official data suggest uncertainties aplenty despite a raft of policy easing steps so far december data released along with gdp showed continued weakness across broad areas of the economy at the end of last year factory output picked up unexpectedly to 5 7 percent from 5 4 percent but it was one of the few bright spots along with a stronger services sector while regulators have been fast tracking construction projects most of the gain appeared due to higher mining and oil production reuters calculations showed average daily steel output hit its lowest level since march as producers cut output amid shrinking profit margins despite the slowing economy chinese officials also pledged to continue with a crackdown on air pollution that has weighed on the industrial sector other data on monday showed investment and retail sales continued to languish while the jobless rate edged higher fixed asset investment rose 5 9 percent in 2018 the slowest in at least 22 years as a regulatory crackdown on riskier financing and debt weighed on local government spending early in the year property investment is also looking wobbly with analysts waiting to see if beijing will risk loosening restrictions on home buyers that have kept a potential housing bubble in check chinese consumers are clearly feeling the pressure though retail sales growth picked up marginally in december to 8 2 percent the consumer strength gauge is around the weakest in 15 years auto sales in the world s biggest car market shrank for the first time since the 1990s officials recently pledged to boost consumer demand for big ticket items from cars to appliances but gains in disposable income are slowing while household debt is on the rise other data in recent weeks showed exports and imports unexpectedly shrank last month while falling factory orders point to a further drop in activity in coming months and more job shedding some factories in guangdong china s export hub have shut earlier than usual ahead of the long lunar new year holiday as new business dries up trade pressures even if china and the united states agree on a trade deal in current talks which would be a tall order analysts said it would be no panacea for china or its exporters demand is weakening globally not just in the united states net exports actually dragged on china s growth by 8 6 percent last year reuters calculations based on official data showed trade negotiators are facing an early march deadline and washington has threatened to sharply hike tariffs if there are no substantial signs of agreement white house officials have given markedly different views on progress so far china s vice premier and lead negotiator liu he is due to visit washington for the next round of talks at the end of the month more stimuli to free up more funds for lending particularly to vulnerable smaller firms the central bank has cut the amount of reserves that banks need to set aside as reserves rrr five times over the past year and guided borrowing costs lower further rrr reductions are expected in coming quarters but most analysts do not see a cut in benchmark interest rates yet as policymakers wait to see if earlier steps begin to stabilize activity more forceful easing could also pressure the yuan and aggravate high debt levels with money going into less efficient or speculative investments as it often has in the past the government may unveil more fiscal stimulus during the annual parliament meeting in march including bigger tax cuts and more spending on infrastructure projects some analysts believe it could deliver 2 trillion yuan 295 13 billion worth of cuts in taxes and fees this year and allow local governments to issue another 2 trillion yuan in special bonds largely used to fund key projects china has ample room for policy adjustments statistics bureau chief ning jizhe said on monday still some analysts do not expect the economy to bottom out convincingly until summer
region opens fiscal taps but borrowing could spell trouble in next slowdown singapore government debt in emerging asian economies hit 50 of gross domestic product in the third quarter of last year according to estimates by the institute of international finance in a trend that suggests a regional shift away from fiscal conservatism further increases in public debt however point to potential problems if the global economy takes a sudden turn for the worse the next two years could be precarious with some economists predicting slower growth entering a financial crisis with a weak fiscal position worsens the depth and duration of the ensuing recession particularly in emerging market economies because fiscal policy tends to be pro cyclical in these cases said vitor gaspar director of the international monetary fund s fiscal affairs department while government debt in emerging asia is creeping up it remains low compared with japan s 223 1 of gdp and 100 8 in the u s the relatively low public debt gives the region more buffer against a potential global downturn enabling policymakers to use expansionary fiscal policy to support demand said frederic neumann co head of asian economic research at hsbc in china for example the central government is increasingly stepping up its fiscal easing with selected tax cuts for households and companies something it can afford given the relatively low level of public debt the small increase reflects consolidation by the public sector as well as a shift in demand to the private sector in countries such as china korea indonesia malaysia thailand and the philippines said hoe ee khor chief economist at the singapore based asean 3 macroeconomic research office the east asian region has typically been prudent when it comes to the management of public finances hoe said as any form of debt high levels beyond sustainable thresholds could create vulnerabilities and regional policymakers appear mindful of the risks asia s mix of relatively low public debt and relatively high private debt is part of a larger picture of spiralling borrowing worldwide global debt reached 244 trillion in the third quarter of last year according to the iif non financial corporate debt in emerging asia jumped five percentage points year on year to 124 of gdp compared with 101 6 in japan and 72 6 in the u s according to imf estimates 40 of the overall rise in debt worldwide over the last decade came from china arguably the biggest cause for concern is the growth of corporate debt outside the financial sector in the country which the iif estimates hit 157 of gdp in the third quarter professor xiang songzuo former chief economist at china agriculture bank said in a dec 15 speech that to solve the debt problem first the government has to pay back debts it owes businesses the state owned enterprises have to pay back debts they owe private enterprises and large private enterprises have to pay back debts they owe smaller ones concerns about china s rising debt levels are mirrored by worries elsewhere in asia though most asian government debt levels are relatively low those of hong kong india pakistan and singapore run between 67 and 112 potentially tightening policymakers economic wriggle room come any regional or global downturn and highlighting the region s striking divergent patterns said chua hak bin senior economist at maybank kim eng rising public debt in malaysia prompted prime minister mahathir mohamad to put the brakes on chinese backed port and rail projects while elsewhere concerns have been raised about a debt trap stemming from loans taken under beijing s belt and road initiative a big infrastructure development project sri lanka handed control of the chinese funded hambantota port to beijing after it was unable tor repay debts incurred in its construction while pakistan was forced in october last year to approach the imf for a bailout in part due to debts taken on under the initiative asia s mix of relatively low public versus relatively high private debt comes as overall world debt is spiralling the iif s scarcely believable 244 trillion global debt total revised upwards the international monetary fund s december estimate of an all time high of 184 trillion for 2017 on average the world s debt now exceeds 86 000 per person the top three borrowers in the world united states china and japan account for more than half of global debt exceeding their share of global output the imf reported in an october the imf suggested governments come up with a more transparent balance sheet analysis not only including typically off book public corporation debt and clearing up sometimes hazy public private lines but on the other hand factoring in public assets such state corporations infrastructure natural resources which the fund estimated to be worth 101 trillion or 219 of world gdp but earlier in 2018 the imf warned in a research paper that excess private debt tends to spill over into the public sector balance sheet citing not only controversial bank bailouts dispensed during the 2008 global economic crisis but less contentious measures taken by governments whenever the private sector is caught in a debt overhang other analyses suggest that there is no way to objectively measure when government debt becomes dangerous as debt sometimes is an indicator of spending that in turn drives the growth that later helps reduce debt and lower interest on debt repayment follow us on twitter follow arevico
honk kong asian markets on monday built on last week s rally as investors cheered a report that china had offered to eliminate its massive trade surplus with the united states while data showed chinese economic growth hit forecasts in 2018 regional equities picked up where they finished friday after bloomberg said beijing had pledged to ramp up spending on us goods over the next five years while there was some scepticism over the offer observers said it indicated that talks between the economic superpowers were heading in the right direction the news provided further support to shares which were already being buoyed by hopes the two sides would be able to resolve the tariffs spat which has hammered world markets for almost a year china s top economics negotiator is due to visit washington later this month for more talks as the end of a 90 day truce agreed between donald trump and xi jinping draws closer for now markets are going ahead with the growing perception that there is a lot of willingness by both parties to make a deal said national australia bank senior strategist rodrigo catril but as the march 1st deadline approaches the market is also likely to demand more concrete evidence that a deal looks more likely than not in early trade hong kong and shanghai were both up 0 6 percent while tokyo ended the morning 0 5 percent higher sydney rose 0 3 percent singapore added 0 5 percent and taipei put on 0 7 percent with wellington and jakarta also up may s plan b china released figures showing the economy expanded at the 6 6 percent clip expected in an afp survey but that represented its slowest pace since 1990 when it was hit by outrage over the tiananmen square crackdown a year earlier and in a sign of the battle beijing faces in getting things back on track october december growth came in at 6 4 percent the worst quarterly figure since the global financial crisis 10 years ago the data come as china struggles to address a chronic debt burden while at the same time fighting the damaging trade war with the us it also reinforces the need for officials to press on with stimulus measures such as the tax cuts announced last week and moves to make it easier for banks to lend while the government is putting policy responses in place we anticipate that these will need to be ramped up over the course of the year stephen chang portfolio manager for asia at pacific investment management said in a note next on traders radar is british prime minister theresa may s revised plan for exiting the european union with her original proposal left in tatters after being roundly rejected by mps last week britain will leave the european union on march 29 without a deal unless mps can force a delay or get their act together in time and come up with an alternative plan that brussels is also happy with despite the uncertainty the pound was holding up against the dollar in asian trade key figures around 0230 gmt tokyo nikkei 225 up 0 5 percent at 20 758 74 break hong kong hang seng up 0 6 percent at 27 254 36 shanghai composite up 0 6 percent at 2611 56 euro dollar up at 1 1378 from 1 1365 at 2200 gmt pound dollar down at 1 2863 from 1 2867 dollar yen down at 109 60 yen from 109 72 oil west texas intermediate down 27 cents at 53 53 per barrel oil brent crude down 38 cents at 62 32 per barrel new york dow up 1 4 percent at 24 706 35 close london ftse 100 up 2 0 percent at 6 968 33 close

at daiwa institute of research in tokyo but the problem lies in consumption as the u s and china clash on many fronts consumer sentiment appears to have been hurt until now solid wage growth has been supporting consumption but now there appears to be a sense of vague anxiety about the future fourth quarter gross domestic product gdp grew at the slowest pace since the global financial crisis easing to 6 4 on year as expected from 6 5 in the third quarter the national bureau of statistics said on monday that pulled full year growth down to 6 6 the slowest annual pace since 1990 gdp in 2017 grew a revised 6 8 with support measures expected to take some time to kick in most analysts believe conditions are likely to get worse before they get better and see a further slowing to 6 3 this year some china watchers believe actual growth is already weaker than official data suggest uncertainties aplenty despite a raft of policy easing steps so far december data released along with gdp showed continued weakness across broad areas of the economy at the end of last year factory output picked up unexpectedly to 5 7 from 5 4 but it was one of the few bright spots along with a stronger services sector while regulators have been fast tracking construction projects most of the gain appeared due to higher mining and oil production reuters calculations showed average daily steel output hit its lowest level since march as producers cut output amid shrinking profit margins despite the slowing economy chinese officials also pledged to continue with a crackdown on air pollution that has weighed on the industrial sector other data on monday showed investment and retail sales continued to languish while the jobless rate edged higher fixed asset investment rose 5 9 in 2018 the slowest in at least 22 years as a regulatory crackdown on riskier financing and debt weighed on local government spending early in the year property investment is also looking wobbly with analysts waiting to see if beijing will risk loosening restrictions on home buyers that have kept a potential housing bubble in check chinese consumers are clearly feeling the pressure though retail sales growth picked up marginally in december to 8 2 the consumer strength gauge is around the weakest in 15 years auto sales in the world s biggest car market shrank for the first time since the 1990s officials recently pledged to boost consumer demand for big ticket items from cars to appliances but gains in disposable income are slowing while household debt is on the rise other data in recent weeks showed exports and imports unexpectedly shrank last month while falling factory orders point to a further drop in activity in coming months and more job shedding some factories in guangdong china s export hub have shut earlier than usual ahead of the long lunar new year holiday as new business dries up trade pressures even if china and the united states agree on a trade deal in current talks which would be a tall order analysts said it would be no panacea for china or its exporters demand is weakening globally not just in the united states net exports actually dragged on china s growth by 8 6 last year reuters calculations based on official data showed trade negotiators are facing an early march deadline and washington has threatened to sharply hike tariffs if there are no substantial signs of agreement white house officials have given markedly different views on progress so far china s vice premier and lead negotiator liu he is due to visit washington for the next round of talks at the end of the month more stimulus to free up more funds for lending particularly to vulnerable smaller firms the central bank has cut the amount of reserves that banks need to set aside as reserves rrr five times over the past year and guided borrowing costs lower further rrr reductions are expected in coming quarters but most analysts do not see a cut in benchmark interest rates yet as policymakers wait to see if earlier steps begin to stabilise activity more forceful easing could also pressure the yuan and aggravate high debt levels with money going into less efficient or speculative investments as it often has in the past the government may unveil more fiscal stimulus during the annual parliament meeting in march including bigger tax cuts and more spending on infrastructure projects some analysts believe it could deliver 2 trillion yuan 295 13 billion worth of cuts in taxes and fees this year and allow local governments to issue another 2 trillion yuan in special bonds largely used to fund key projects china has ample room for policy adjustments statistics bureau chief ning jizhe said on monday still some analysts do not expect the economy to bottom out convincingly until summer
china s economy cooled in the fourth quarter under pressure from faltering domestic demand and bruising u s tariffs dragging growth in 2018 to its lowest level in nearly three decades and pressuring beijing to roll out more stimulus to avert a sharper slowdown growing signs of weakness in china which has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years are fueling anxiety about risks to the world economy and are weighing on profits for firms ranging from apple to big carmakers policymakers have pledged more support this year to reduce the risk of massive job losses but have ruled out a flood of stimulus like that which beijing has relied on in the past which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt
article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com 1 general 1 1 please list and briefly describe the principal legislation and regulatory bodies which apply to and or regulate aviation in your jurisdiction the civil aviation act the caa 2006 is the principal legislation which governs aviation in nigeria while the apex regulatory body is the nigerian civil aviation authority ncaa other regulatory bodies which regulate aviation include the federal airport authority of nigeria faan which amongst other duties as may be stipulated by the federal government is statutorily charged to manage all commercial airports in nigeria the federal ministry of aviation fma which is now part of the transportation ministry of nigeria and is responsible for the formulation of aviation policies in nigeria and the nigerian airspace management agency nama which provides air traffic services aeronautical telecommunication navigation services for take off and landing of aircraft amongst others 1 2 what are the steps which air carriers need to take in order to obtain an operating licence an application must be made in writing to the director general of the ncaa no later than six months to the proposed date of utilisation and must be signed by the applicant the form and content of the application is provided for in the guidelines and requirements for the grant of airline operating permit of the ncaa 1 3 what are the principal pieces of legislation in your jurisdiction which govern air safety and who administers air safety aviation safety is governed by the caa and the nigerian civil aviation regulations 2015 ncar the international civil aviation organisation the icao also known as the chicago convention also ensures safe operations by member states notably the ncaa was established in conformity with the icao international standards to further this objective these standards were incorporated into the ncar to ensure compliance as general safety conditions for crew operators airworthiness etc in part 20 of the ncar 1 4 is air safety regulated separately for commercial cargo and private carriers no there is no separate regulation for commercial cargo and private carriers part 8 of the ncar prescribes the requirements for operations and expressly provides that it applies to all types of aircrafts 1 5 are air charters regulated separately for commercial cargo and private carriers no this is not regulated separately air charters are regulated pursuant to the relevant and applicable provisions in the ncar 1 6 as regards international air carriers operating in your jurisdiction are there any particular limitations to be aware of in particular when compared with domestic or local operators by way of example only restrictions and taxes which apply to international but not domestic carriers air operators operating domestic routes do not require a route licence to operate commercial air travel provided that they notify the ncaa of the route s to be operated the frequency of operations and notice of flight schedules to the ncaa faan and nama however foreign airlines engaging in scheduled operations must obtain a foreign carrier operating permit fcop issued by the ncaa before engaging in operations after safety assessment audits are carried out by the ncaa in june 2018 in a bid to reduce tax burden and improve the ease of doing business for taxpayers the federal executive council approved two executive orders and five amendment bills one of which is the value added tax act modification order which exempts transport services available for use by the public from the payment of value added tax thus removing the mandatory 5 vat on transportation however the federal inland revenue service which is the regulatory body responsible for assessing and collecting federal government tax in nigeria is yet to implement this directive worthy of note is the fact that in nigeria international airlines have not been subject to the payment of vat 1 7 are airports state or privately owned there are 26 airports owned by the federal government and operated by the faan five of which are functional international airports spread around the country the only state owned airport is the akwa ibom airport located in uyo the capital city of akwa ibom state while the murtala mohammed airport two mma2 is the only airport operated under a public private partnership agreement with bi courtney aviation as the concessionaire there are also some privately owned airports one of which is the osubi airport in warri delta state owned and operated by shell petroleum development company 1 8 do the airports impose requirements on carriers flying to and from the airports in your jurisdiction all air operators must have an air transport licence atl issued by the ncaa to carry out scheduled domestic operations in nigeria for domestic carriers operating on a non scheduled basis they must obtain an airline operating permit aop issued by the authority while carriers operating non commercial flight operations must obtain a permit for non commercial flights pncf for nigerian carriers operating international routes an application is to be made to the ncaa for the issuance of an air carrier s permit acp in addition the air operator must join the international air transport association iata and the iata clearing house and must show evidence of financial capability for such operations further non scheduled operations do not require flight clearance from the ncaa prior to undertaking non scheduled international operations as long as the operators have air operator certificates aoc but shall only be required to depart and enter the country through designated custom airports for foreign airlines engaging in scheduled operations in and out of nigeria they must obtain a foreign carrier operating permit fcop issued by the ncaa in addition an air service agreement usually a bi lateral air service agreement basa is entered into after a safety assessment audit is carried out by the ncaa prior to the issuance of the fcop and commencement of operations 1 9 what legislative and or regulatory regime applies to air accidents for example are there any particular rules regulations systems and procedures in place which need to be adhered to the civil aviation investigation of air accidents and incidents regulations 2016 applies to the investigation of accidents in nigeria the act provides for the establishment of an accident investigation bureau which shall report to the president in the event of an air accident in addition the act stipulates that the state in which the accident occurs will institute an inquiry into the circumstances of the accident in accordance with the procedure which may be recommended by the international civil aviation organization the procedure to be complied with can be summarised as follows the state in which the accident occurs is to conduct an inquiry into the circumstances of the accident the icao will recommend a procedure which is to be adopted subject to the local legislations of the affected member state the state of registry that is the contracting state of the icao on whose register the aircraft is entered is to be accorded observer status at the inquiry the state conducting the investigation is to give feedback of the investigation reports to the state of registry 1 10 have there been any recent cases of note or other notable developments in your jurisdiction involving air operators and or airports in march 2018 the african continental free trade agreement afcfta treaty was endorsed by 44 african countries although nigeria is yet to adopt the same the afcfta seeks to create a single market by tackling non tariff barriers and liberalising commercial services airline operators have stated that where nigeria adopts the afcfta foreign airlines would be able to schedule local flights in nigeria without the requirement or need of employing local staff on may 18 2017 the then acting president of nigeria signed the presidential executive order no 1 eo1 on the promotion of transparency and efficiency in the business environment designed to facilitate the ease of doing business in the country the eo1 expressly banned touting by officials and unofficial persons at the airports and provided for the merging of departure and arrival interfaces into a single customer interface by government agencies such as the nigerian customs service and the nigerian immigration service more recently on july 18 2018 the nigerian aviation minister revealed the name of the proposed national carrier as nigeria air which he stated is to be private sector led and driven 2 aircraft trading finance and leasing 2 1 does registration of ownership in the aircraft register constitute proof of ownership part 4 of the ncar provides that no person may operate an aircraft that is eligible for registration in nigeria unless it has been registered by its owner or operator and has been issued a certificate of aircraft registration however the underlined operator along with the requirement that an aircraft is eligible for registration if it is owned by a foreign person who has leased the aircraft to a nigerian citizen implies that other persons aside from the actual owners of the aircraft can register such an aircraft in nigeria registration of ownership is prima facie proof of title but not conclusive proof of ownership of the aircraft as operators who have leased the aircraft from a foreign person can also register the aircraft in the aircraft register 2 2 is there a register of aircraft mortgages and charges broadly speaking what are the rules around the operation of this register presently there is no register of aircraft mortgages or charges even though the ncar requires the ncaa to establish and maintain legal interests in aircraft registry the information in this register may be made available to individuals upon an application in practice interests such as mortgages charges liens and other encumbrances are noted in the registration particulars of the aircraft and noted in the file maintained for each aircraft by the ncaa 2 3 are there any particular regulatory requirements which a lessor or a financier needs to be aware of as regards aircraft operation the lessor or financier needs to be aware that the owner of the aircraft is liable for any damage injury or loss arising from the operations and activities of the aircraft operator where same is under its control the civil aviation act also provides that damages in respect of injury shall be recoverable without proof of negligence or intention or any other cause of action subject to the right of indemnity by the lessee or operator paragraph 8 3 1 10 of the ncar also provides that a lessor shall transfer to the lessee at the time of the lease all maintenance records relating to the aircraft in a manner acceptable to the ncaa 2 4 as a matter of local law is there any concept of title annexation whereby ownership or security interests in a single engine are at risk of automatic transfer or other prejudice when installed on wing on an aircraft owned by another party if so what are the conditions to such title annexation and can owners and financiers of engines take pre emptive steps to mitigate the risks there is no local law that provides for title annexation in nigeria 2 5 what if any are the tax implications in your jurisdiction for aircraft trading as regards a value added tax vat and or goods and services tax gst and b documentary taxes such as stamp duty and to the extent applicable do exemptions exist as regards non domestic purchasers and sellers of aircraft and or particular aircraft types or operations interest earned by a lessor on a finance lease with regards to aircraft trading is not liable to a charge of vat as it is a return on investment also the federal inland revenue service firs in information no 9701 provides that the import of aircrafts aircraft spare parts and machinery as goods and services taxable at 0 the import of aircrafts and spare parts are thus zero rated goods for the purpose of value added tax previously vat was assessed on domestic ticket sales in nigeria however by an executive order on the removal of vat from all forms of shared transportation issued by the federal government of nigeria in june 2018 vat has been removed from the commercial domestic air transport sector stamp duty is payable on leases and other documentation depending on the term of the lease for a lease for a term of one to seven years the applicable stamp duty is 0 78 however the commissioner in certain circumstances can assess stamp duty at 1 5 generally most agreements in the aviation industry would be subject to stamp duties also aviation lease loan agreement would be subject to stamp duties at the applicable rate depending on the term of the lease withholding tax income on a property situated in nigeria is liable to tax regardless of the place of payment it also applies to lease payments and loan payments it is usually assessed at the rate of 10 but can be reduced to 7 5 where a double taxation agreement has been entered into in nigeria therefore any income on an aircraft situated in nigeria will be liable to a withholding tax of 10 or 7 5 as the case may be capital gains tax is imposed on the gains arising from the sale or disposal of chargeable assets at a rate of 10 in the event of a sale of any aircraft or aviation asset the gain arising from the sale will be subject to a capital gains tax imposed at the rate of 10 2 6 is your jurisdiction a signatory to the main international conventions montreal geneva and cape town yes nigeria is a signatory to the convention for unification of certain rules relating to international carriage of air montreal 1999 the convention on international recognition of rights in aircraft geneva 1948 the convention on international interests in mobile equipment and the protocol to the convention on international interests in mobile equipment on matters specific to aircraft equipment cape town 2001 2 7 how are the conventions applied in your jurisdiction nigeria has ratified and domesticated the conventions mentioned in question 2 6 above in the civil aviation act 2006 and thus they are applicable and enforceable in nigeria the government has further given approval for the establishment of the national entry point to the international registry within the nigerian civil aviation authority the cape town convention 2001 by section 73 2 and has been domesticated and incorporated under the fifth schedule to the caa 2006 2 8 does your jurisdiction make use of any taxation benefits which enhance aircraft trading and leasing either in bound or out bound leasing for example access to an extensive network of double tax treaties or similar or favourable tax treatment on the disposal of aircraft please refer to our response in question 2 5 3 litigation and dispute resolution 3 1 what rights of detention are available in relation to aircraft and unpaid debts section 27 3 of the caa gives the ncaa the power to take all steps reasonably necessary to ground any aircraft to ensure compliance rule 1 3 3 4 of the ncars provides that an aircraft which is involved in a violation for which a civil penalty has been imposed or may be imposed on its owner or operator may be subject to detention by the authority in accordance with its enforcement procedures the caa recognises the right of a state entity inter governmental organisation or any other private provider of public services to arrest or detain an object under the law of that state for payment of amounts owed to such entity organisation or provider 3 2 is there a regime of self help available to a lessor or a financier of an aircraft if it needs to reacquire possession of the aircraft or enforce any of its rights under the lease finance agreement the caa provides that any remedy available to a lessor or financier that does not require an application to the court may be exercised without court action and leave of court generally a court order is not required before a lessor or financier can exercise the right of repossession or sale of an aircraft in the event of a default subject to the specific provisions of the contract 3 3 which courts are appropriate for aviation disputes does this depend on the value of the dispute for example is there a distinction in your jurisdiction regarding the courts in which civil and criminal cases are brought the federal high court is vested with exclusive jurisdiction to try both criminal and civil aviation disputes pursuant to section 63 of the civil aviation act and 251 k of the 1999 constitution of the federal republic of nigeria as amended however if the aviation dispute is concerning employee or labour matters such action may be instituted in the national industrial court of nigeria 3 4 what service requirements apply for the service of court proceedings and do these differ for domestic airlines parties and non domestic airlines parties the federal high court rules fhcr and the sheriff and civil processes act scpa provide guidelines for service of court processes as well as the requirements for valid service for domestic airlines parties the fhcr provides in order 6 rules 2 8 that service is effected when the process is served personally on party on the principal officers of the company or leaving it at the office of the company where personal service cannot be effected order 2 rule 5 allows substituted service through delivery to any person at the last place of business of the airline or party delivery to an agent of the airline party involved where there is a strong probability that it would get to the airline party advertisement in the official gazette pasting in the court house or delivery to the legal practitioner of the airline party where service is to be effected on non domestic airlines parties the processes can be served in the same manner as that of domestic airline parties highlighted above there are however additional requirements order 6 rule 14 of the fhcr provides that leave of the court must be sought and obtained to serve a writ on a defendant outside jurisdiction leave is sought by way of an application to the federal high court supported by an affidavit stating i that the plaintiff has a good cause of action ii in what country the defendant can be found and iii the grounds upon which the application is made more so section 97 of the scpa provides that any writ of summons which is to be served outside the state in which it is issued shall have endorsed on the face of it notice that the writ is to be served outside jurisdiction 3 5 what types of remedy are available from the courts or arbitral tribunals in your jurisdiction both on i an interim basis and ii a final basis all civil remedies can be obtained from the court or arbitral tribunal in an aviation dispute this is however dependent on the cause of action and reliefs sought on an interim basis remedies available are interim injunction interlocutory injunction prohibitory injunction and or mandatory injunction on final basis remedies available include perpetual injunctions damages specific performance declaration etc 3 6 are there any rights of appeal to the courts from the decision of a court or arbitral tribunal and if so in what circumstances do these rights arise generally the right of appeal from a decision of a court is governed by the constitution of the federal republic of nigeria and the rules of court for an arbitral award it is not appealable the only recourse is to apply for the setting aside of the award in its entirety at the high court the constitution in sections 241 1 and 242 provide that the right to appeal a decision from the federal high court to the court of appeal can either be as of right or with leave of the court appeal is as of right where the decision is a final decision of the federal high court or where the ground of appeal involves questions of law alone or where the decision is on the interpretation of the constitution or where the decision is on the question of whether any fundamental right has been is being or is likely to be contravened in all other circumstances appeal must be with leave of court however according to section 241 2 of the constitution a party cannot appeal against a decision of the high court granting unconditional leave to defend an action against a consent judgment or an order as to costs only in the case of an arbitral award an application for the setting aside of an award can be lodged in the federal high court where the arbitrator misconducted himself where the award was improperly procured or that the award contains decisions on matters which are beyond the scope submitted to arbitration 4 commercial and regulatory 4 1 how does your jurisdiction approach and regulate joint ventures between airline competitors the nigerian civil aviation authority the ncaa or authority

product or service is likely to create market power and at least one of the joint venture companies derives income in or from nigeria arising from the sale and rendering of services in the civil aviation industry or there exists use of the firm s assets in a manner that yields interest royalties and dividends furthermore such arrangements would be prohibited by the authority where the

which pending legislative or regulatory changes if any or potential developments affecting the aviation industry more generally in your jurisdiction are likely to feature or be worthy of attention in the next two years or so member states of the african union currently 49 of 55 have taken a bold step in signing the afcfta the afcfta seeks to create a single continental market for goods and services in the member states with free movement of business persons and investments using a single currency while nigeria is yet to sign as it is currently evaluating the potential impacts on the economy it is expected that upon signing the afcfta the transportation sector which includes the aviation sector would experience a significant shift in the aviation business demographic originally

since last year scores of notable economic analysts seriously argued that if president donald trump has his way the liberal market economy of the post ii world war period is ending on the other hand the trump camp proudly and unapologetically embraces mercantilism recently henry kissinger made an interview with the financial times in his interview the grand master of global diplomacy made this breathtaking confession henry kissinger said trump may be one of those figures in history who appears from time to time to mark the end of an era and to force it to give up its old pretences it doesn t necessarily mean that he knows this or that he is considering any great alternative it could just be an accident could it be that via his trade mark tweets president trump is laying out a new paradigm for the world economy this is supported by the fact that president trump finds ever more supporters in the world for his illiberal views at a minimum the liberal world order as we knew it and came to rely on it in economics and business is not only punctured in the united states martin hufner the former chief economist of germany s hvb group argued that it is high time to rethink the global model he noted that if president trump has his way the liberal market economy and globalization are giving way to the brave new world of unvarnished mercantilism as an economic analyst martin hufner sketch out what this world seems to look like according to him the emerging mercantilist world order can be revealed in seven brief principles first not open but closed borders tariffs and protectionism are deemed to create jobs these walls are instituted to limit competition on the job market second interventionism rather than free markets if the economy does not develop in the way president trump wants it he does not hesitate to threaten individual companies with the lobe state intervention rule of law is different third forget striving for any consistency in economic policymaking what matters now is creating deliberate surprise and uncertainty in the markets through unexpected measures and using it to one s national advantage fourth reign in the independence of the central bank better yet subordinate monetary policy under the executive power of the president the united states federal reserve is still independent but president trump has already made it clear that he does not like any fed policy of raising interest rates fifth use of interest rates unabashedly to promote business and to create jobs the goal of price stability is virtually absent in president trump s vocabulary sixth forget balanced budgets the federal public deficit in the united states so far this year is 70 billion higher than in the same period last year seventh instead of aiming for redistribution as a form of economic and social justice make no apologies for favoring the rich in society witness the last united states tax reform of course not all of these trumpian goals are shared by all neo mercantilists robert hicks of michigan university said that it is very far from a consistent system but it will undoubtedly shape investment prospects on global capital markets key elements of the new equation are economic growth is being inflated via tax cuts on short notice robert hicks noted that in the long run however growth under the aegis of global mercantilism will be lower capital is not used so efficiently market uncertainty is greater and world trade is less dynamic productivity is not growing so fast anymore in addition to the demographic brakes on growth economic policy is added as a slowing factor at the same time inflation tends to be higher because nobody cares however governments may intervene in prices for specific goods which are particularly important for people in the long term price controls in individual sectors are conceivable according to martin hufner the interest rates of banks and on the capital market will be lower in the long term this should stimulate the economy not least the construction sector corporate profits will be higher than under previous conditions that helps the stock markets at the same time exchange rate fluctuations will tend to be greater
reuters following are five big themes likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the reuters stories related to them should i stay or should i go another week closer to the date britain leaves the european union or are we given how crushingly prime minister theresa may s proposed brexit agreement was defeated by lawmakers there is little chance her plan b

australia faces a continuing deceleration in the world economy with a new report by the imf outlining a key global risk is a greater than anticipated china slowdown that would hit its foreign trading partners and commodity producing economies like australia hardest china s economy slowed to its lowest rate of growth in a decade in the fourth quarter expanding 6 4 per cent compared to a year earlier in line with economists expectations official government data published on monday showed the imf cut its global growth forecasts for 2019 and 2020 and admitted recent weakness in economic data around the world was likely to persist over coming months the global expansion has weakened the imf said risks to global growth tilt to the downside the global economy is forecast by the imf to grow 3 5 per cent this year and 3 6 per cent in 2020 down 0 2 and 0 1 percentage points on october s projections and below the 3 9 per cent the fund tipped last april for 2019 advertisement global growth for 2018 was estimated to be a higher 3 7 per cent mr frydenberg said the strength of the domestic economy and the coalition s budget repair had given the government the flexibility and resilience to respond to challenges as they arise in a possible sign that a fiscal injection was not off the table if the international outlook materially worsened domestic economic momentum appears to have lost stream in recent months partly due to a more cautious consumer delivering mixed christmas retail sales falling house prices denting consumer sentiment and business anxiety about an election expected to be held in may mr frydenberg said the strength of the domestic economy and the coalition s budget repair had given the government the flexibility and resilience to respond to challenges as they arise mick tsikas internationally surprise weakness in major european economies such as germany italy and france and fraught brexit negotiations are compounding the negative impacts from the us china tariff war and china s broader economic moderation the imf said a second source of systemic financial stability risk is a deeper than envisaged slowdown in china with negative implications for trading partners and global commodity prices the imf said advertisement about 30 per cent of australia s exports are shipped to china including billions of dollars worth of iron ore coal and liquefied natural gas the commonwealth bank business sales indicator bsi a measure of economy wide spending based on credit and debit card transactions tracked by the bank fell 0 8 per cent in volatile seasonally adjusted terms in december only the second decline in the past eight months a report released monday said spending across the economy is growing in line with longer term averages commsec chief economist craig james said big ticket items like cars are experiencing softer sales in response to slower growth of home prices and outright declines in some cities the washington based imf urged governments to strengthen fiscal and financial buffers in an environment of high debt burdens and tighter financial conditions fiscal policy should build buffers where needed to replenish limited policy space for combating downturns the imf said advertisement eyeing an election the morrison government has pledged to return the federal budget to surplus next financial year shadow treasurer chris bowen has promised labor s tax rises will deliver bigger budget surpluses to shield the economy from mounting international economic risks mr bowen said it was another report with a downgrade of global economic prospects that may impact on the australian economy the imf s world economic outlook contains an important warning for australia and one that has thus far been ignored by scott morrison and josh frydenberg mr bowen said labor is the only major party with economic and tax policies designed to restore the fiscal buffers and pay down debt in a fair way unfortunately we have a treasurer who is more interested in the labor party than managing the economy addressing anaemic wages growth or putting forward a positive plan for the economy advertisement mr frydenberg said australia was growing faster than any g7 country except the us and annual gdp growth was at 2 8 per cent compared to 2 1 per cent when the coalition came to government over 1 2 million new jobs have been created driving unemployment down to 5 1 per cent compared to the 5 7 per cent when we came to government annual average growth in spending is down to 1 9 per cent the lowest of any government in 50 years and half of what it was under labor and making possible a return to surplus and an end to the decade of deficits in its annual review of the australian economy late last year the imf delivered a positive economic report card welcoming our budget management strong economic growth improved labour market conditions and housing affordability reforms prime minister scott morrison last week tried to make an election issue out of the storm clouds in the global economy warning the uncertainty meant voters should trust the coalition not labor to manage the economy mr bowen has said he has been warning of and preparing for a global slowdown for some time advertisement global industrial production and manufacturing orders dropped markedly in december including in europe china and much of asia outside of us china trade tensions a no deal withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union could also be a catalyst for economic and financial market disruption particularly given high public and private debt levels the imf added the imf did not disclose new forecasts for australia in the limited eight page update in october it forecast australia s solid economic growth to peak at a six year high of 3 2 per cent in 2018 before the us china trade war weighs down the local export dependent economy s growth to 2 8 per cent pace in 2019 market economists have lowered their growth forecasts for australia since then in light of softer national accounts for the september quarter that were published in december separately the imf in november ramped up concerns on risks to australia s economy from bulging household debt and high house prices
